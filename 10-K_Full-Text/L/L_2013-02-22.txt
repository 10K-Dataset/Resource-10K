CNA FINANCIAL
CORPORATION

CNA Financial Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “CNA”) was incorporated
in 1967 and is an insurance holding company. CNA’s property and casualty and remaining life & group insurance operations are primarily conducted by Continental Casualty Company (“CCC”), incorporated in 1897, and The
Continental Insurance Company (“CIC”), organized in 1853, and certain other affiliates. CIC became a subsidiary of CNA in 1995 as a result of the acquisition of The Continental Corporation (“Continental”). CNA accounted for
65.6%, 63.4% and 63.0% of our consolidated total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

CNA’s insurance products primarily include commercial property and casualty coverages, including surety. CNA’s services include risk management, information services, warranty and claims
administration. CNA’s products and services are primarily marketed through independent agents, brokers and managing general underwriters to a wide variety of customers, including small, medium and large businesses, insurance companies,
associations, professionals and other groups.

CNA’s property and casualty field structure consists of 49
underwriting locations across the United States. In addition, there are five centralized processing operations which handle policy processing, billing and collection activities, and also act as call centers to optimize service. The claims structure
consists of two regional claim centers designed to efficiently handle the high volume of low severity claims including property damage, liability, and workers’ compensation medical only claims, and 16 principal claim offices handling the more
complex claims. In addition, CNA has underwriting and claim capabilities in Canada and Europe.

CNA Specialty

CNA Specialty includes the following business groups:

Professional & Management Liability

: Professional & Management Liability provides
management and professional liability insurance and risk management services and other specialized property and casualty coverages in the United States. This group provides professional liability coverages to various professional firms, including
architects, real estate agents, small and mid-sized accounting firms, law firms and technology firms. Professional & Management Liability also provides directors and officers (“D&O”), employment practices, fiduciary and
fidelity coverages. Specific areas of focus include small and mid-size firms as well as privately held firms and not-for-profit



organizations, where tailored products for this client segment are offered. Products within Professional & Management Liability are distributed through brokers, independent agents and
managing general underwriters. Professional & Management Liability, through CNA HealthPro, also offers insurance products to serve the health care industry. Products include professional liability and associated standard property and
casualty coverages, and are distributed on a national basis through brokers, independent agents and managing general underwriters. Key customer segments include long term care facilities, allied health care providers, life sciences, dental
professionals and mid-size and large health care facilities.

International

:  International
provides similar management and professional liability insurance and other specialized property and casualty coverages, through similar distribution channels, in Canada and Europe.

Surety

:  Surety offers small, medium and large contract and commercial surety bonds. CNA Surety provides
surety and fidelity bonds in all 50 states through a network of independent agencies. On June 10, 2011, CNA completed the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest of CNA Surety.

Warranty and Alternative Risks

:

Warranty and Alternative Risks provides extended service
contracts and related products that provide protection from the financial burden associated with mechanical breakdown and other related losses, primarily for vehicles and portable electronic communication devices.

CNA Commercial

CNA Commercial’s property products include standard and excess property coverages, as well as marine coverage, and boiler and machinery. Casualty products include standard casualty insurance products
such as workers’ compensation, general and product liability, commercial auto and umbrella coverages. Most insurance programs are provided on a guaranteed cost basis; however, CNA also offers specialized loss-sensitive insurance programs to
those customers viewed as higher risk and less predictable in exposure.

These property and casualty products
are offered as part of CNA’s

Small Business, Commercial

and

International

insurance groups. CNA’s Small Business insurance group serves its smaller commercial accounts and the Commercial insurance group serves CNA’s
middle markets and its larger risks. In addition, CNA Commercial provides total risk management services relating to claim and information services to the large commercial insurance marketplace, through a wholly owned subsidiary, CNA ClaimPlus,
Inc., a third party administrator. The International insurance group primarily consists of the commercial product lines of CNA’s operations in Europe and Canada. During the fourth quarter of 2011, CNA sold its 50% ownership interest in First
Insurance Company of Hawaii (“FICOH”).

Also included in CNA Commercial is

CNA Select Risk
(“Select Risk”)

, which includes CNA’s excess and surplus lines coverages. Select Risk provides specialized insurance for selected commercial risks on both an individual customer and program basis. Customers insured by Select Risk
are generally viewed as higher risk and less predictable in exposure than those covered by standard insurance markets. Select Risk’s products are distributed throughout the United States through specialist producers, program agents and brokers.

Hardy

In July of 2012, CNA completed the acquisition of Hardy Underwriting Bermuda Limited (“Hardy”), a specialized Lloyd’s of London (“Lloyd’s”) underwriter. Through Lloyd’s
Syndicate 382, Hardy underwrites primarily short-tail exposures in the following coverages:

Marine & Aviation

provides coverage for a variety of large risks including energy, cargo and specie, marine hull and general aviation.

Non-Marine Property

comprises direct and facultative property, including construction insurance of industrial and commercial risks (heavy industry, general manufacturing and commercial property portfolios), together with residential and small
commercial risks.

Property Treaty Reinsurance

offers catastrophe reinsurance on an excess of loss basis, proportional treaty and excess of loss coverages and crop reinsurance.

Specialty Lines

offers coverage for a variety of risks
including political violence, accident and health and financial institutions.



Life & Group Non-Core

Life & Group Non-Core primarily includes the results of the life and group lines of business that are in
run-off. CNA continues to service its existing individual long term care commitments, its payout annuity business and its pension deposit business. CNA also retains a block of group reinsurance and life settlement contracts. These businesses are
being managed as a run-off operation. CNA’s group long term care business, while considered non-core, continues to accept new employees in existing groups.

Other

Other primarily includes certain CNA corporate
expenses, including interest on CNA corporate debt, and the results of certain property and casualty business in run-off, including CNA Re and asbestos and environmental pollution (“A&EP”). In 2010, CNA ceded substantially all of its
legacy A&EP liabilities under the Loss Portfolio Transfer, as further discussed in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

Direct Written Premiums by Geographic Concentration

Set
forth below is the distribution of CNA’s direct written premiums by geographic concentration.

Approximately 9.2%, 8.8% and 6.9% of CNA’s direct written premiums were derived from
outside of the United States for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

Property and Casualty Claim and Claim Adjustment
Expenses

The following loss reserve development table illustrates the change over time of reserves
established for property and casualty claim and claim adjustment expenses at the end of the preceding ten calendar years for CNA’s property and casualty insurance companies. The table excludes CNA’s life insurance subsidiaries, and as
such, the carried reserves will not agree to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. The first section shows the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated year. The second section, reading down, shows the
cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years with respect to the originally reported reserve liability. The third section, reading down, shows re-estimates of the originally recorded reserves as of the end of each successive year, which
is the result of CNA’s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries’ expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims. The last section compares the latest re-estimated reserves to the reserves
originally established, and indicates whether the original reserves were adequate or inadequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims.



The loss reserve development table is cumulative and, therefore, ending
balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the current and prior years. The development amounts in the table below include the impact of reinsurance commutations, but exclude the impact
of the allowance for doubtful accounts on reinsurance receivables.

(a)

Effective January 1, 2010, CNA ceded approximately $1.5 billion of net asbestos and environmental pollution claim and allocated claim
adjustment expense reserves relating to its continuing operations under a retroactive reinsurance agreement with an aggregate limit of $4.0 billion, as further discussed in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under
Item 8.

(b)

On July 2, 2012, CNA acquired Hardy. As a result of this acquisition, net reserves were increased by $291 million. Further information on this
acquisition is included in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.



Please read information relating to CNA’s property and casualty claim
and claim adjustment expense reserves and reserve development set forth under Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”), and in Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, included under Item 8.

Investments

Please read Item 7, MD&A – Investments and Notes 1, 3, 4 and 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, included under Item 8.

Other

Competition:

The property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive both as to rate and
service. CNA competes with a large number of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities for both distributors and customers. Insurers compete on the basis of factors including products, price, services, ratings and financial strength.
CNA must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve its insurance products and services.

There are
approximately 2,800 individual companies that sell property and casualty insurance in the United States. Based on 2011 statutory net written premiums, CNA is the seventh largest commercial insurance writer and the 13th largest property and casualty
insurance organization in the United States.

Regulation:

The insurance industry is subject
to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision. Each domestic and foreign jurisdiction has established supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers relative to licensing insurers and agents, approving policy forms, establishing
reserve requirements, prescribing the form and content of statutory financial reports, and regulating capital adequacy and the type, quality and amount of investments permitted. Such regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations, which
require that rates not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. In addition to regulation of dividends by insurance subsidiaries, intercompany transfers of assets may be subject to prior notice or approval by insurance regulators,
depending on the size of such transfers and payments in relation to the financial position of the insurance subsidiaries making the transfer or payment.

Hardy is also supervised by the Council of Lloyd’s, which is the franchisor for all Lloyd’s operations. The Council of Lloyd’s has wide discretionary powers to regulate Lloyd’s
underwriting, such as establishing the capital requirements for syndicate participation. In addition, the annual business plans of each syndicate are subject to the review and approval of the Lloyd’s Franchise Board, which is responsible for
business planning and monitoring for all syndicates.

The European Union’s executive body, the European
Commission, is implementing new capital adequacy and risk management regulations called Solvency II that would apply to CNA’s European operations. In addition, global regulators, including the United States National Association of Insurance
Commissioners, are working with the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (“IAIS”) to consider changes to insurance company supervision. Among the areas being addressed are company and group capital requirements, group
supervision and enterprise risk management. It is not currently clear to what extent or how the activities of the IAIS will impact CNA or U.S. insurance regulation.

Domestic insurers are also required by the state insurance regulators to provide coverage to insureds who would not
otherwise be considered eligible by the insurers. Each state dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks. CNA’s share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function
of its respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each state.

Further, insurance
companies are subject to state guaranty fund and other insurance-related assessments. Guaranty fund assessments are levied by the state departments of insurance to cover claims of insolvent insurers. Other insurance-related assessments are generally
levied by state agencies to fund various organizations including disaster relief funds, rating bureaus, insurance departments, and workers’ compensation second injury funds, or by industry organizations that assist in the statistical analysis
and ratemaking process.



Although the federal government does not directly regulate the business of
insurance, federal legislative and regulatory initiatives can impact the insurance industry in a variety of ways. These initiatives and legislation include tort reform proposals; proposals addressing natural catastrophe exposures; terrorism risk
mechanisms; federal financial services reforms; various tax proposals affecting insurance companies; and possible regulatory limitations, impositions and restrictions arising from the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as
well as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, both enacted in 2010.

Various legislative and
regulatory efforts to reform the tort liability system have, and will continue to, impact CNA’s industry. Although there has been some tort reform with positive impact to the insurance industry, new causes of action and theories of damages
continue to be proposed in state court actions or by federal or state legislatures that continue to expand liability for insurers and their policyholders. For example, some state legislatures have from time to time considered legislation addressing
direct actions against insurers related to bad faith claims. As a result of this unpredictability in the law, insurance underwriting is expected to continue to be difficult in commercial lines, professional liability and other specialty coverages.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act expanded the federal presence in insurance
oversight and may increase the regulatory requirements to which CNA may be subject. The Act’s requirements include streamlining the state-based regulation of reinsurance and nonadmitted insurance (property or casualty insurance placed from
insurers that are eligible to accept insurance, but are not licensed to write insurance in a particular state). The Act also established a new Federal Insurance Office within the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The Act called for numerous studies
and contemplates further regulation.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the related
amendments in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act may increase CNA’s operating costs and underwriting losses. This landmark legislation may lead to numerous changes in the health care industry that could create additional operating
costs for CNA, particularly with respect to its workers’ compensation and long term care products.

Properties:

The Chicago location houses CNA’s principal executive offices. CNA’s subsidiaries
own or lease office space in various cities throughout the United States and in other countries. The following table sets forth certain information with respect to CNA’s principal office locations:



CNA leases its office space described above except for the buildings in
Chicago, Illinois, Reading, Pennsylvania and Aurora, Illinois, which are owned.

DIAMOND OFFSHORE
DRILLING, INC.

Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (“Diamond Offshore”) is engaged, through its
subsidiaries, in the business of operating drilling rigs that are chartered on a contract basis for fixed terms by companies engaged in the exploration and production of hydrocarbons. Offshore rigs are mobile units that can be relocated based on
market demand. Diamond Offshore accounted for 21.1%, 23.6% and 23.0% of our consolidated total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

Rigs:

Diamond Offshore owns 44 offshore drilling rigs, consisting of 32 semisubmersible rigs, seven
jack-ups and five dynamically positioned drillships, four of which are under construction with deliveries scheduled for the second and fourth quarters of 2013 and the second and fourth quarters of 2014. Diamond Offshore’s semisubmersible fleet
also includes the

Ocean Onyx

and

Ocean Apex

, two moored semisubmersible rigs which are under construction and expected to be delivered in the third quarter of 2013 and the second quarter of 2014. Diamond Offshore’s diverse fleet
enables it to offer a broad range of services worldwide in both the floater market (ultra-deepwater, deepwater and mid-water) and the non-floater, or jack-up market.

A floater rig is a type of mobile offshore drilling unit that floats and does not rest on the seafloor. This asset class
includes self-propelled drillships and semisubmersible rigs. Semisubmersible rigs consist of an upper working and living deck resting on vertical columns connected to lower hull members. Such rigs operate in a “semi-submerged” position,
remaining afloat, off bottom, in a position in which the lower hull is approximately 55 feet to 90 feet below the water line and the upper deck protrudes well above the surface. Semisubmersible rigs hold position while drilling by use of a series of
small propulsion units or thrusters that provide dynamic positioning (“DP”) to keep the rig on location, or with anchors tethered to the seabed. Although DP semisubmersibles are self-propelled, such rigs may be moved long distances with
the assistance of tug boats; non-DP, or moored, semisubmersible rigs require tug boats or the use of a heavy lift vessel to move between locations.

A drillship is an adaptation of a maritime vessel which is designed and constructed to carry out drilling operations by means of a substructure with a moon pool centrally located in the hull. Drillships
are typically self-propelled and are positioned over a drillsite through the use of either an anchoring system or a DP system similar to those used on semisubmersible rigs.

Diamond Offshore’s floater fleet (semisubmersibles and drillships) can be further categorized based on the nominal
water depth for each class of rig as follows:

(a)

Rated water depth for semisubmersibles and drillships reflects the maximum water depth in which a floating rig has been designed to operate.
However, individual rigs are capable of drilling, or have drilled, in marginally greater water depths depending on conditions (such as salinity of the ocean, weather and sea conditions).

(b)

Includes four drillships under construction.

(c)

Includes two rigs to be constructed utilizing the hulls of two of Diamond Offshore’s existing mid-water floaters.

(d)

Includes three rigs which are being marketed for sale.

Jack-up rigs are mobile, self-elevating drilling platforms equipped with legs that are lowered to the ocean floor.
Diamond Offshore’s jack-ups are used for drilling in water depths from 20 feet to 350 feet. The water depth limit of a particular rig is able to operate is principally determined by the length of the rig’s legs. The rig hull includes the
drilling equipment, jacking system, crew quarters, loading and unloading facilities, storage areas for bulk and liquid materials, heliport and other related equipment. A jack-up rig is towed to the drillsite with its hull riding in the sea, as a
vessel, with its legs retracted. Once over a drillsite, the legs are lowered until they rest on the seabed and jacking continues with the legs penetrating the seabed until they are firm and stable, and resistance is sufficient to elevate the hull
above the surface of the water. After completion of drilling operations, the hull is lowered until it rests in the



water and then the legs are retracted for relocation to another drillsite. All of Diamond Offshore’s jack-up rigs are equipped with a cantilever system that enables the rig to extend its
drilling package over the aft end of the rig.

Fleet Enhancements and
Additions:

Diamond Offshore’s long term strategy is to upgrade its fleet to meet customer demand for advanced, efficient and high-tech rigs by acquiring or building new rigs when possible to do so at attractive prices, and
otherwise by enhancing the capabilities of its existing rigs at a lower cost and reduced construction period than newbuild construction would require. Diamond Offshore has contracted with Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. Ltd., for the construction of
four dynamically positioned, ultra-deepwater drillships. Diamond Offshore expects the aggregate cost for the four drillships, including commissioning, spares and project management costs, to be approximately $2.6 billion.

Construction has begun on two moored semisubmersible rigs designed to operate in water depths up to 6,000 feet. The rigs
will be constructed utilizing the hulls of two of Diamond Offshore’s mid-water floaters and the aggregate cost of the two rigs is estimated to be approximately $680 million, including commissioning, spares and project management costs.

In February of 2013, Diamond Offshore announced that one of its mid-water floaters, the

Ocean Patriot

,
will undergo enhancements to enable the rig to work in the North Sea at an estimated aggregate cost of approximately $120 million. The enhancement project is expected to begin during the third quarter of 2013 with completion expected in early 2014.

Diamond Offshore will evaluate further rig acquisition and upgrade opportunities as they arise. However,
Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance whether, or to what extent, it will continue to make rig acquisitions or upgrades to its fleet.

Markets:

The principal markets for Diamond Offshore’s contract drilling services are the following:

—

South America, principally offshore Brazil;

—

Australia and Asia, including Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam;

—

the Middle East, including Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia;

—

Europe, principally in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and Norway;

—

East and West Africa;

—

the Mediterranean Basin, including Egypt; and

—

the Gulf of Mexico, including the U.S. and Mexico.

Diamond Offshore actively markets its rigs worldwide. From time to time Diamond Offshore’s fleet operates in various
other markets throughout the world.

Diamond Offshore believes its presence in multiple markets is valuable in
many respects. For example, Diamond Offshore believes that its experience with safety and other regulatory matters in the U.K. has been beneficial in Australia and other international areas in which Diamond Offshore operates, while production
experience it has gained through its Brazilian and North Sea operations has potential application worldwide. Additionally, Diamond Offshore believes its performance for a customer in one market area enables it to better understand that
customer’s needs and better serve that customer in different market areas or other geographic locations.

Drilling Contracts:

Diamond Offshore’s contracts to provide offshore drilling services vary in
their terms and provisions. Diamond Offshore typically obtains its contracts through a competitive bid process, although it is not unusual for Diamond Offshore to be awarded drilling contracts following direct negotiations. Drilling contracts
generally provide for a basic fixed dayrate regardless of whether or not such drilling results in a productive well. Drilling contracts may also provide for reductions in rates during periods when the rig is being moved or when



drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns, adverse weather conditions or other circumstances. Under dayrate contracts, Diamond Offshore generally pays the
operating expenses of the rig, including wages and the cost of incidental supplies. Historically, dayrate contracts have accounted for the majority of Diamond Offshore’s revenues. In addition, from time to time, Diamond Offshore’s dayrate
contracts may also provide for the ability to earn an incentive bonus from its customer based upon performance.

The duration of a dayrate drilling contract is generally tied to the time required to drill a single well or a group of
wells, which Diamond Offshore refers to as a well-to-well contract, or a fixed period of time, in what Diamond Offshore refers to as a term contract. Many drilling contracts may be terminated by the customer in the event the drilling rig is
destroyed or lost or if drilling operations are suspended for an extended period of time as a result of a breakdown of equipment or, in some cases, due to other events beyond the control of either party to the contract. Certain of Diamond
Offshore’s contracts also permit the customer to terminate the contract early by giving notice, and in most circumstances, this requires the payment of an early termination fee by the customer. The contract term in many instances may also be
extended by the customer exercising options for the drilling of additional wells or for an additional length of time, generally at competitive market rates and mutually agreeable terms at the time of the extension.

Customers:

Diamond Offshore provides offshore drilling services to a customer base that includes
major and independent oil and gas companies and government-owned oil companies. During 2012, 2011 and 2010, Diamond Offshore performed services for 35, 52 and 46 different customers. During 2012, 2011 and 2010, one of Diamond Offshore’s
customers in Brazil, Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. (“Petrobras”), (a Brazilian multinational energy company that is majority-owned by the Brazilian government), accounted for 33%, 35% and 24% of Diamond Offshore’s annual total
consolidated revenues. OGX Petróleo e Gás Ltda. (“OGX”), (a privately owned Brazilian oil and natural gas company), accounted for 12%, 14% and 14% of Diamond Offshore’s annual total consolidated revenues in each of the
years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of Diamond Offshore’s annual total consolidated revenues during 2012, 2011 or 2010.

Brazil is one of the most active floater markets in the world today. Currently, the greatest concentration of Diamond
Offshore’s operating assets is offshore Brazil, where it has 12 rigs contracted. Diamond Offshore’s contract backlog attributable to its expected operations offshore Brazil is $1.2 billion, $1.0 billion, $0.5 billion and $62 million for
the years 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.

Competition:

Despite consolidation in recent
years, the offshore contract drilling industry remains highly competitive with numerous industry participants, none of which at the present time has a dominant market share. The industry may also experience additional consolidation in the future,
which could create other large competitors. Some of Diamond Offshore’s competitors may have greater financial or other resources than Diamond Offshore. Diamond Offshore competes with offshore drilling contractors that together have almost 780
mobile rigs available worldwide.

The offshore contract drilling industry is influenced by a number of
factors, including global economies and demand for oil and natural gas, current and anticipated prices of oil and natural gas, expenditures by oil and gas companies for exploration and development of oil and natural gas and the availability of
drilling rigs.

Drilling contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis. Price is typically
the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job. Customers may also consider rig availability and location, a drilling contractor’s operational and safety performance record, and condition and suitability of
equipment. Diamond Offshore believes it competes favorably with respect to these factors.

Diamond Offshore
competes on a worldwide basis, but competition may vary significantly by region at any particular time. Competition for offshore rigs generally takes place on a global basis, as these rigs are highly mobile and may be moved, at a cost that may be
substantial, from one region to another. It is characteristic of the offshore contract drilling industry to move rigs from areas of low utilization and dayrates to areas of greater activity and relatively higher dayrates. Significant new rig
construction and upgrades of existing drilling units could also intensify price competition.



Governmental Regulation:

Diamond Offshore’s
operations are subject to numerous international, foreign, U.S., state and local laws and regulations that relate directly or indirectly to its operations, including regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment, requiring
removal and clean-up under some circumstances, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, and may include laws or regulations pertaining to climate change, carbon emissions or energy use.

Operations Outside the United States:

Diamond Offshore’s operations outside the U.S. accounted for
approximately 94%, 90% and 81% of its total consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

Properties:

Diamond Offshore owns an office building in Houston, Texas, where its corporate headquarters are located, offices and other facilities in New Iberia, Louisiana,
Aberdeen, Scotland, Macae, Brazil and Ciudad del Carmen, Mexico. Additionally, Diamond Offshore currently leases various office, warehouse and storage facilities in Louisiana, Australia, Indonesia, Norway, Malaysia, Singapore, Egypt, Equatorial
Guinea, Angola, Vietnam and the U.K. to support its offshore drilling operations.

BOARDWALK
PIPELINE PARTNERS, LP

Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP (“Boardwalk Pipeline”) is engaged in
integrated natural gas and natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) transportation and storage and natural gas gathering and processing. Boardwalk Pipeline accounted for 8.1%, 8.1% and 7.7% of our consolidated total revenue for the years ended
December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

We own approximately 55% of Boardwalk Pipeline comprised of
102,719,466 common units, 22,866,667 class B units and a 2% general partner interest. A wholly owned subsidiary of ours, Boardwalk Pipelines Holding Corp. (“BPHC”) is the general partner and holds all of Boardwalk Pipeline’s incentive
distribution rights which entitle the general partner to an increasing percentage of the cash that is distributed by Boardwalk Pipeline in excess of $0.4025 per unit per quarter.

In October of 2012, Boardwalk Pipeline acquired Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream LLC (“Louisiana Midstream”) for
approximately $620 million. Louisiana Midstream provides transportation and storage services for natural gas and NGLs, fractionation services for NGLs and brine supply services for producers and consumers of petrochemicals through two hubs in
southern Louisiana.

Boardwalk Pipeline owns and operates approximately 14,170 miles of interconnected natural
gas pipelines directly serving customers in 13 states and indirectly serving customers throughout the northeastern and southeastern United States through numerous interconnections with unaffiliated pipelines. Boardwalk Pipeline also owns
approximately 240 miles of NGL pipelines in Louisiana. In 2012, its pipeline systems transported approximately 2.5 trillion cubic feet (“Tcf”) of gas and approximately 7.1 million barrels (“MMbbls”) of NGLs. Average daily
throughput on Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas pipeline systems during 2012 was approximately 6.9 billion cubic feet (“Bcf”). Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas storage facilities are comprised of 14 underground storage fields
located in four states with aggregate working gas capacity of approximately 201.0 Bcf and Boardwalk Pipeline’s NGL storage facilities consist of eight salt dome storage caverns located in one state with an aggregate storage capacity of
approximately 17.6 MMbbls. Boardwalk Pipeline also owns two salt dome caverns for use in providing brine supply services and to support the NGL cavern operations.

The pipeline and storage systems of Boardwalk Pipeline consist of the following:

The Gulf Crossing pipeline system, which originates in Texas and proceeds into Louisiana, operates approximately 360
miles of natural gas pipeline. The pipeline system has a peak-day delivery capacity of 1.7 Bcf per day and average daily throughput for the year ended December 31, 2012 was 1.3 Bcf per day.

The Gulf South pipeline system runs approximately 7,240 miles along the Gulf Coast in the states of Texas, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. Gulf South has two natural gas storage facilities with 83.0 Bcf of working gas storage capacity. The pipeline system has a peak-day delivery capacity of 6.8 Bcf per day and average daily throughput for the year
ended December 31, 2012 was 3.0 Bcf per day.



The Texas Gas pipeline system originates in Louisiana, East Texas and
Arkansas and runs for approximately 6,110 miles north and east through Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, and into Ohio, with smaller diameter lines extending into Illinois. The pipeline system has a peak-day delivery
capacity of 4.4 Bcf per day and average daily throughput for the year ended December 31, 2012 was 2.5 Bcf per day. Texas Gas owns nine natural gas storage fields with 84.0 Bcf of working gas storage capacity.

Field Services operates natural gas gathering, compression, treating and processing infrastructure in southern Texas and
in the Marcellus Shale area in Pennsylvania with approximately 355 miles of pipeline.

Boardwalk HP Storage
Company, LLC (“HP Storage”) owns and operates seven salt dome natural gas storage caverns in Mississippi, with 36.3 Bcf of total storage capacity, of which approximately 23.0 Bcf is working gas capacity. HP Storage also operates
approximately 105 miles of pipeline which connects its facilities with several major natural gas pipelines, including Gulf South. Average daily throughput for the pipeline system for the year ended December 31, 2012 was 0.1 Bcf per day. HP
Storage also owns undeveloped land which is suitable for up to six additional storage caverns, one of which is expected to be placed in service in 2013.

Louisiana Midstream’s storage services provide approximately 53.2 MMbbls of salt dome storage capacity, including approximately 11.0 Bcf of working natural gas storage capacity and approximately 17.6
MMbbls of salt dome NGL storage capacity, significant brine supply infrastructure including two salt dome caverns and more than 240 miles of pipeline assets, including an extensive ethylene distribution system.

Boardwalk Pipeline’s current expansion projects include the following:

Southeast Market Expansion: The Southeast Market Expansion project is an interconnection between Boardwalk
Pipeline’s Gulf South pipeline and HP Storage facilities, additional compression facilities and approximately 70 miles of additional pipeline, adding 0.5 Bcf per day of peak-day transmission capacity, subject to Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (“FERC”) approval. The project is expected to be placed in service in the second half of 2014 and will cost approximately $300 million. The Southeast Market Expansion project is fully contracted with a weighted-average contract
life of approximately 10 years.

South Texas Eagle Ford Expansion: The South Texas Eagle Ford Expansion
construction project consists of 55 miles of gathering pipeline and a cryogenic processing plant. The system will have the capability of gathering in excess of 0.3 Bcf per day of liquids-rich gas in the Eagle Ford Shale production area in Texas and
processing up to 150 MMcf per day of liquids-rich gas. Boardwalk Pipeline will also provide re-delivery of processed residue gas to a number of interstate and intrastate pipelines. Boardwalk Pipeline has executed long term fee-based gathering and
processing agreements for approximately 50% of the plant’s processing capacity. The plant and new pipeline are estimated to cost approximately $180 million and are expected to be placed in service in April of 2013.

Salt Dome Storage: HP Storage is developing a new salt dome storage cavern having working gas capacity of
approximately 5.3 Bcf, which is expected to be placed in service in the second quarter of 2013 with an estimated cost of approximately $23 million.

Choctaw Brine Supply Expansion Projects: Louisiana Midstream is engaged in two brine supply service expansion projects. The first brine supply project consists of the development of a one million
barrel brine pond, which was placed in service in January of 2013 at a total cost of approximately $13 million. Louisiana Midstream has executed seven-year, fixed-fee contracts in support of this project. The second project, which is supported by a
20-year commitment with minimum volume requirements, consists of constructing 26 miles of 12-inch pipeline from Louisiana Midstream’s facilities to a petrochemical customer’s plant. This project is expected to cost approximately $50
million and is expected to be placed in service in the third quarter of 2013.

Customers:

Boardwalk Pipeline serves a broad mix of customers, including producers of natural gas,
local distribution companies, marketers, electric power generators, industrial users and interstate and intrastate pipelines, located throughout the Gulf Coast, Midwest and Northeast regions of the U.S.



Competition:

Boardwalk Pipeline competes with
numerous other pipelines that provide transportation, storage and other services at many locations along its pipeline systems. Boardwalk Pipeline also competes with pipelines that are attached to new natural gas supply sources that are being
developed closer to some of its traditional natural gas market areas. In addition, regulators’ continuing efforts to increase competition in the natural gas industry have increased the natural gas transportation options of Boardwalk
Pipeline’s traditional customers. As a result of regulators’ policies, capacity segmentation and capacity release have created an active secondary market which increasingly competes with Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas pipeline
services. Further, natural gas competes with other forms of energy available to Boardwalk Pipeline’s customers, including electricity, coal, fuel oils and alternative fuel sources.

The principal elements of competition among pipelines are available capacity, rates, terms of service, access to gas
supplies, flexibility and reliability of service. In many cases, the elements of competition, in particular flexibility, terms of service and reliability, are key differentiating factors between competitors. This is especially the case with capacity
being sold on a longer term basis. Boardwalk Pipeline is focused on finding opportunities to enhance its competitive profile in these areas by increasing the flexibility of its pipeline systems to meet the demands of customers, such as power
generators and industrial users, and is continually reviewing its services and terms of service to offer customers enhanced service options.

Seasonality:

Boardwalk Pipeline’s revenues can be affected by weather, natural gas price levels and natural gas price volatility. Weather impacts natural gas demand for
heating needs and power generation, which in turn influences the short term value of transportation and storage across Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipeline systems. Colder than normal winters can result in an increase in the demand for natural gas for
heating needs and warmer than normal summers can impact cooling needs, both of which typically result in increased pipeline transportation revenues and throughput. While traditionally peak demand for natural gas occurs during the winter months
driven by heating needs, the increased use of natural gas for cooling needs during the summer months has partially reduced the seasonality of revenues. In 2012, approximately 53% of Boardwalk Pipeline’s revenue was recognized in the first and
fourth quarters of the year.

Governmental Regulation:

FERC regulates Boardwalk
Pipeline’s natural gas operating subsidiaries under the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”) of 1938 and the Natural Gas Policy Act (“NGPA”) of 1978. FERC regulates, among other things, the rates and charges for the transportation and
storage of natural gas in interstate commerce and the extension, enlargement or abandonment of facilities under its jurisdiction. Where required, Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas interstate subsidiaries hold certificates of public convenience
and necessity issued by FERC covering certain of their facilities, activities and services. The maximum rates that may be charged by Boardwalk Pipeline’s subsidiaries operating under FERC’s jurisdiction, for all aspects of the natural gas
transportation services it provides, are established through FERC’s cost-of-service rate-making process. The maximum rates that may be charged by Boardwalk Pipeline for storage services on Texas Gas, with the exception of services associated
with a portion of the working gas capacity on that system, are established through FERC’s cost-of-service rate-making process. Key determinants in FERC’s cost-of-service rate-making process are the costs of providing service, the volumes
of gas being transported, the rate design, the allocation of costs between services, the capital structure and the rate of return a pipeline is permitted to earn. FERC has authorized Boardwalk Pipeline to charge market-based rates for its firm and
interruptible storage services for the majority of its storage facilities. None of Boardwalk Pipeline’s FERC-regulated entities has an obligation to file a new rate case.

Boardwalk Pipeline is also regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) under the Natural Gas
Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended by Title I of the Pipeline Safety Act of 1979 (“NGPSA”) and the Hazardous Liquids Pipeline Safety Act of 1979 (“HLPSA”), which regulates safety requirements in the design, construction,
operation and maintenance of interstate natural gas and NGL pipeline facilities. Boardwalk Pipeline has received authority from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”), an agency of DOT, to operate certain
natural gas pipeline assets under special permits that will allow it to operate those assets at higher than normal operating pressures of up to 0.80 of the pipe’s Specified Minimum Yield Strength (“SMYS”). Operating at higher than
normal operating pressures will allow each of these pipelines to transport all of the volumes Boardwalk Pipeline has contracted for with its customers. PHMSA retains discretion whether to grant or maintain authority for Boardwalk Pipeline to operate
these natural gas pipeline assets at higher pressures. PHMSA has also developed regulations that require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain areas along their pipelines and
take additional measures to protect pipeline



segments located in highly populated areas. The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (“2011 Act”) was enacted in 2012 and increased maximum civil
penalties for certain violations to $200,000 per violation per day, and from a total cap of $1 million to $2 million. In addition, the 2011 Act reauthorized the federal pipeline safety programs of PHMSA through September 30, 2015, and directs
the Secretary of Transportation to undertake a number of reviews, studies and reports, some of which may result in additional natural gas and hazardous liquids pipeline safety rulemaking. A number of the provisions of the 2011 Act have the potential
to cause owners and operators of pipeline facilities to incur significant capital expenditures and/or operating costs.

Boardwalk Pipeline’s operations are also subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment. Such regulations impose, among other things,
restrictions, liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation, handling, use, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste and in connection with spills, releases and emissions of various substances
into the environment. Environmental regulations also require that Boardwalk Pipeline’s facilities, sites and other properties be operated, maintained, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities.

Properties:

Boardwalk Pipeline is headquartered in approximately 108,000 square feet of leased office
space located in Houston, Texas. Boardwalk Pipeline also leases approximately 108,000 square feet of office space in Owensboro, Kentucky. Boardwalk Pipeline’s operating subsidiaries own their respective pipeline systems in fee. However,
substantial portions of these systems are constructed and maintained on property owned by others pursuant to rights-of-way, easements, permits, licenses or consents.

HIGHMOUNT EXPLORATION & PRODUCTION LLC

HighMount Exploration & Production, LLC (“HighMount”) is engaged in the exploration, production and marketing of natural gas and oil (including condensate and NGLs). HighMount accounted
for 2.0%, 2.5% and 2.9% of our consolidated total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

HighMount’s proved reserves and production are primarily located in the Sonora field, a tight sands gas formation within the Permian Basin in West Texas. HighMount holds mineral rights on over
500,000 net acres in the Permian Basin, with over 6,000 producing wells. In addition, HighMount has working interests in undeveloped oil and gas properties located on approximately 73,000 net acres in Oklahoma and approximately 9,000 net acres in
the Texas Panhandle which contain primarily oil reserves. During 2012, HighMount began the commercial development of its Oklahoma properties, utilizing horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technologies.

HighMount’s interests in developed and undeveloped acreage, wellbores and well facilities generally take the form of
working interests in leases that have varying terms. HighMount’s interests in these properties are, in many cases, held jointly with third parties and may be subject to royalty, overriding royalty, carried, net profits and other similar
interests and contractual arrangements with other parties as is customary in the oil and gas industry. HighMount also owns and operates approximately 3,000 miles of gathering lines and over 65,000 horsepower of compression which are used to
transport natural gas and NGLs principally from HighMount’s producing wells to processing plants and pipelines owned by third parties.



We use the following terms throughout this discussion of HighMount’s
business, with “equivalent” volumes computed with oil and NGL quantities converted to Mcf, on an energy equivalent ratio of one barrel to six Mcf:

As of December 31, 2012, HighMount owned 825.1 Bcfe of net proved reserves, of which
84.1% were classified as proved developed reserves. HighMount’s estimated total proved reserves consist of 557.6 Bcf of natural gas, 35.1 MMBbls of NGLs, and 9.5 MMBbls of oil and condensate. HighMount produced approximately 154 MMcfe per day
of net natural gas, NGLs and oil during 2012. HighMount holds leasehold or drilling rights in 0.7 million net acres, of which 0.5 million is developed acreage and the balance is held for future exploration and development drilling
opportunities. HighMount participated in the drilling of 91 wells during 2012, of which 83 (or 91.2%) are productive wells.

Reserves:

HighMount’s reserves represent its share of reserves based on its net revenue interest in each property. Estimated reserves as of December 31, 2012 are
based upon studies for each of HighMount’s properties prepared by HighMount staff engineers and are the responsibility of management. Calculations were prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally accepted by the
petroleum industry and in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) guidelines.



HighMount employs various internal controls to validate the reserve
estimation process. The main internal controls include (i) detailed reviews of reserve-related information by reserve engineering and executive management, (ii) reserve audits performed by an independent third party reserve auditor,
(iii) segregation of duties, and (iv) system reconciliation or automated interface between various systems used in the reserve estimation process.

HighMount employs a team of reservoir engineers that specialize in HighMount’s areas of operation. The reservoir engineering team reports to HighMount’s Chief Operating Officer. The compensation
of HighMount’s reservoir engineers is not dependent on the quantity of reserves booked. HighMount also employs a lead evaluator who reports to the Chief Financial Officer. HighMount’s lead evaluator has over 33 years of petroleum
engineering experience, most of which have been in the reservoir engineering and reserve fields. He is a member in good standing of the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers and the Society of Petroleum Engineers, as well as a Licensed
Professional Engineer in the State of Texas.

HighMount’s reserves estimates for 2012 have been
independently audited by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (“NSAI”), a worldwide leader of petroleum property analysis for industry and financial organizations and governmental agencies. NSAI was founded in 1961 and performs
consulting services under Texas Board of Professional Engineers Registration No. F-2699. The technical person primarily responsible for NSAI’s audit and audit letter has 32 years of industry experience and has been practicing consulting
petroleum engineering at NSAI since 1989.

The following table sets forth HighMount’s proved reserves at
December 31, 2012, based on average 2012 prices of $2.76 per MMBtu for natural gas, $41.11 per Bbl for NGLs and $94.71 per Bbl for oil. Approximately 95% of HighMount’s proved reserves were located in the Permian Basin in Texas and
approximately 5% of proved reserves were located in Oklahoma.

HighMount reviews its proved reserves on an annual basis. During 2012, total proved
reserves declined 309 Bcfe, reflecting (i) a 328 Bcfe reduction as a result of economic factors such as lower gas prices and higher operating expenses, and as a result of higher production decline rates of its producing wells, partly due to the
suspension of uneconomic maintenance and recompletion work, (ii) a 56 Bcfe reduction as a result of production during the year, offset by (iii) additions of 75 Bcfe through drilling and booking of proved undeveloped locations.

At December 31, 2012, HighMount had proved undeveloped reserves of 131 Bcfe on locations scheduled to be drilled in
the next five years. During 2012, HighMount recorded negative net reserve revisions of 198 Bcfe primarily due to a reclassification of proved undeveloped reserves to the non-proved category because these reserves were no longer economical due to the
decrease in natural gas prices. Also, 48 Bcfe of non-proved reserves were promoted to the proved undeveloped category as a result of the 2012 drilling activity. During 2012, HighMount spent $14 million to convert 2 Bcfe from proved undeveloped
reserves to proved developed reserves through drilling. As of December 31, 2012, there were no proved undeveloped locations that had remained undeveloped for five years or more.

Estimated net quantities of proved natural gas and oil reserves at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 and changes in
the reserves during 2012, 2011 and 2010 are shown in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

HighMount’s Sonora properties typically have relatively long reserve lives and high well completion success rates. Based on December 31, 2012 proved reserves and HighMount’s average
production from these properties during 2012, the average reserve-to-production index of HighMount’s proved reserves is 15 years.



In order to replenish reserves as they are depleted by production, and to
increase reserves, HighMount develops its existing acreage by drilling new wells and, where available, employing new technologies and drilling strategies designed to enhance production from existing wells. In addition, HighMount seeks to acquire
additional acreage in its core areas of operation, as well as other locations where its management has identified an opportunity.

During 2012, 2011 and 2010, HighMount engaged in the drilling activity presented in the following table:

In addition, at December 31, 2012, HighMount had 23 (20.2 net) wells in progress.

Acreage:

As of December 31, 2012, HighMount owned interests in 1,107,551 gross
(700,281 net) acres in the United States which is comprised of 609,659 gross (467,602 net) developed acres, and 497,892 gross (232,679 net) undeveloped acres.

As of December 31, 2012, leases covering 86,577, 27,859 and 9,843 of HighMount’s net acreage will expire by December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, if production is not established or HighMount
takes no other action to extend the terms.

Production and Sales:

Please see the Production
and Sales statistics table for additional information included in the MD&A under Item 7.

HighMount
utilizes its own marketing and sales personnel to market the natural gas and oil that it produces to large energy companies and intrastate pipelines and gathering companies. Production is typically sold and delivered directly to a pipeline at liquid
pooling points or at the tailgates of various processing plants, where it then enters a pipeline system. Permian Basin natural gas sales prices are primarily at a Houston Ship Channel Index.

To manage the risk of fluctuations in prevailing commodity prices, HighMount enters into commodity and basis swaps and
other derivative instruments.

Wells:

As of December 31, 2012, HighMount had working
interests in 6,133 gross producing wells (5,874 net producing wells) located primarily in the Permian Basin. In addition, HighMount had royalty interests in approximately 250 wells located in the Permian Basin. Wells located in the Permian Basin
have a typical well depth in the range of 6,000 to 9,000 feet.

Competition:

HighMount
competes with other oil and gas companies in all aspects of its business, including acquisition of producing properties and leases and obtaining goods, services and labor, including drilling rigs and well completion services. HighMount also competes
in the marketing of produced natural gas and oil. Some of HighMount’s competitors have substantially larger financial and other resources than HighMount. Factors that affect HighMount’s ability to acquire producing properties include
available funds, available information about the property and standards established by HighMount for minimum projected return on investment. Natural gas and oil also compete with alternative fuel sources, including heating oil and coal.



Governmental Regulation:

All of HighMount’s
operations are conducted onshore in the United States. The U.S. oil and gas industry, and HighMount’s operations, are subject to regulation at the federal, state and local level. Such regulation includes requirements with respect to, among
other things: permits to drill and to conduct other operations; provision of financial assurances (such as bonds) covering drilling and well operations; the location of wells; the method of drilling and completing wells; the surface use and
restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled; the plugging and abandoning of wells; the marketing, transportation and reporting of production; the valuation and payment of royalties; the size of drilling and spacing units (regarding the
density of wells which may be drilled in a particular area); the unitization or pooling of natural gas and oil properties; maximum rates of production from natural gas and oil wells; venting or flaring of natural gas; and the ratability of
production and the operation of gathering systems and related assets.

HighMount uses hydraulic fracturing to
stimulate the production of oil and natural gas. In recent years, concerns have been raised that the fracturing process may, among other things, contaminate underground sources of drinking water. The conference committee report for The Department of
the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2010 requested the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) to conduct a study of hydraulic fracturing, particularly the relationship between
hydraulic fracturing and drinking water. In December of 2012 the EPA issued a progress report of the projects the EPA is conducting as part of the study. A final draft report is expected to be released for public comment and peer review in 2014.
Several bills have been introduced in Congress seeking federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing, which has historically been regulated at the state level, though none of the proposed legislation has been passed into law. HighMount believes that
similar bills will continue to be introduced in Congress and a number of federal agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing; however, HighMount cannot predict
whether any such bill will be passed into law or, if passed, the substance of any such new law.

The Federal
Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the NGA to prohibit natural gas market manipulation by any entity, directed the FERC to facilitate market transparency in the sale or transportation of physical natural gas and significantly increased the penalties
for violations of the NGA of 1938, the NGPA of 1978, or FERC regulations or orders thereunder. In addition, HighMount owns and operates gas gathering lines and related facilities which are regulated by the DOT and state agencies with respect to
safety and operating conditions.

HighMount’s operations are also subject to federal, state and local
laws and regulations concerning the discharge of contaminants into the environment, the generation, storage, transportation and disposal of contaminants, and the protection of public health, natural resources, wildlife and the environment. In most
instances, the regulatory requirements relate to the handling and disposal of drilling and production waste products, water and air pollution control procedures, and the remediation of petroleum-product contamination. In addition, HighMount’s
operations may require it to obtain permits for, among other things, air emissions, discharges into surface waters, and the construction and operation of underground injection wells or surface pits to dispose of produced saltwater and other
non-hazardous oilfield wastes. HighMount could be required, without regard to fault or the legality of the original disposal, to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes, to suspend or cease operations in contaminated areas or to perform
remedial well plugging operations or cleanups to prevent future contamination.

In September of 2009, the EPA
adopted regulations under the Clean Air Act requiring the monitoring and reporting of annual greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions by certain large U.S. GHG emitters. Affected companies are required to monitor their GHG emissions and report to
the EPA. Oil and gas exploration and production companies that emit more than 25,000 metric tons of GHG per year from any facility (as defined in the regulations), including HighMount, are required to monitor and report emissions for facilities that
meet the emissions threshold. HighMount filed its first GHG report in September of 2012 for the 2011 reporting year.

Properties:

In addition to its interests in oil and gas producing properties, HighMount leases an aggregate of approximately 56,300 square feet of office space in Houston, Texas, which
includes its corporate headquarters, and approximately 83,800 square feet of office space in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. HighMount also leases other surface rights and office, warehouse and storage facilities necessary to operate its business. In
addition to leased properties, HighMount also owns a 44,000 square foot office building in Sonora, Texas, and a 1,500 square foot office building in Morrison, Oklahoma.



LOEWS HOTELS HOLDING CORPORATION

The subsidiaries of Loews Hotels Holding Corporation (“Loews Hotels”), our wholly owned subsidiary, presently
operate a chain of 19 primarily upper, upscale hotels. Each hotel in the chain is managed by Loews Hotels. Ten of these hotels are owned by Loews Hotels, five are owned by joint ventures in which Loews Hotels has a significant equity interest and
four are managed for unaffiliated owners. Loews Hotels’ earnings are derived from the operation of its wholly owned hotels, its share of earnings in joint venture hotels and hotel management fees earned from both joint venture and managed
hotels. Loews Hotels accounted for 2.7%, 2.4% and 2.1% of our consolidated total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. The hotels are described below.

Competition:

Competition from other hotels and lodging facilities is vigorous
in all areas in which Loews Hotels operates. The demand for hotel rooms in many areas is seasonal and dependent on general and local economic conditions. Loews Hotels properties also compete with facilities offering similar services in locations
other than those in which its hotels are located. Competition among luxury hotels is based primarily on location and service. Competition among resort and commercial hotels is based on price as well as location and service. Because of the
competitive nature of the industry, hotels must continually make expenditures for updating, refurnishing and repairs and maintenance, in order to prevent competitive obsolescence.



Recent Developments:

—

In June of 2012, Loews Hotels acquired a hotel in Hollywood, California, which is now operating as the Loews Hollywood Hotel. In November of 2012,

Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, CNA Financial Corporation

If CNA determines that its recorded insurance reserves are insufficient to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim
and claim adjustment expenses, CNA may need to increase its insurance reserves.

CNA maintains
insurance reserves to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, including the estimated cost of the claims adjudication process, for reported and unreported claims and for future policy benefits. Reserves
represent CNA’s best estimate at a given point in time. Insurance reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex estimates derived by CNA, generally utilizing a variety of reserve estimation techniques from numerous
assumptions and expectations about future events, many of which are highly uncertain, such as estimates of claims severity, frequency of claims, mortality, morbidity, discount rates, inflation, claims handling, case reserving policies and
procedures, underwriting and pricing policies, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured event and the time of its ultimate settlement. Mortality is the relative incidence of death.
Morbidity is the frequency and severity of illness, sickness and diseases contracted. Many of these uncertainties are not precisely quantifiable and require significant judgment on CNA’s part. As trends in underlying claims develop,
particularly in so-called “long tail” or long duration coverages, CNA is sometimes required to add to its reserves. This is called unfavorable net prior year



development and results in a charge to earnings in the amount of the added reserves, recorded in the period the change in estimate is made. These charges can be substantial.

CNA is also subject to the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as industry
practices and legal, judicial, social, economic and other environmental conditions change. These issues have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on CNA’s business by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent
or by increasing the number or size of claims, resulting in further increases in CNA’s reserves. The effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict. Examples of emerging or potential
claims and coverage issues include:

—

the effects of worldwide economic conditions, which have resulted in an increase in the number and size of certain claims including both directors
and officers (“D&O”) and errors and omissions (“E&O”) insurance claims related to corporate failures, as well as other coverages;

—

class action litigation relating to claims handling and other practices; and

—

mass tort claims, including bodily injury claims related to welding rods, benzene, lead, noise induced hearing loss, injuries from various medical
products including pharmaceuticals, and various other chemical and radiation exposure claims.

In light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making the assumptions necessary to
establish reserve levels, CNA reviews and changes its reserve estimates in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled. If estimated reserves are insufficient for any reason, the required increase
in reserves would be recorded as a charge against earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient. These charges could be substantial.

CNA’s key assumptions used to determine reserves for long term care products and payout annuity contracts could vary significantly from actual experience.

CNA’s reserves for long term care products and payout annuity contracts are based on certain key assumptions
including morbidity, mortality, policy persistency (the percentage of policies remaining in force) and discount rates (which are impacted by expected investment yields). A prolonged period during which interest rates remain at levels lower than
those anticipated in CNA’s reserving may result in shortfalls in investment income on assets supporting policy obligations, which may require changes to reserves. These assumptions, while based on historical data and industry experience and
monitored consistently, are critical bases for reserve estimates and are inherently uncertain. If estimated reserves are insufficient for any reason, the required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against earnings in the period in
which reserves are determined to be insufficient. These charges could be substantial.

Catastrophe losses are
unpredictable and could result in material losses.

Catastrophe losses are an inevitable part of
CNA’s business. Various events can cause catastrophe losses. These events can be natural or man-made, and may include hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, severe winter weather, fires, and acts of terrorism. The frequency and severity of
these catastrophe events are inherently unpredictable. In addition, longer-term natural catastrophe trends may be changing and new types of catastrophe losses may be developing due to climate change, a phenomenon that has been associated with
extreme weather events linked to rising temperatures, and includes effects on global weather patterns, greenhouse gases, sea, land and air temperatures, sea levels, rain, hail and snow.

The extent of CNA’s losses from catastrophes is a function of the total amount of its insured exposures in the
affected areas, the frequency and severity of the events themselves, the level of reinsurance assumed and ceded and reinsurance reinstatement premiums, if any. As in the case of catastrophe losses generally, it can take a long time for the ultimate
cost to CNA to be finally determined, as a multitude of factors contribute to such costs, including evaluation of general liability and pollution exposures, additional living expenses, infrastructure disruption, business interruption and reinsurance
collectibility. Reinsurance coverage for terrorism events is provided only in limited



circumstances, especially in regard to “unconventional” terrorism acts, such as nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological attacks. As a result, catastrophe losses are particularly
difficult to estimate.

As CNA’s claim experience develops on a specific catastrophe, CNA may be required
to adjust its reserves, or take unfavorable net prior year development, to reflect revised estimates of the total cost of claims.

CNA has exposure related to A&EP claims, which could result in material losses.

CNA’s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have exposures related to A&EP claims. CNA’s experience has been that establishing claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for casualty
coverages relating to A&EP claims is subject to uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims. Additionally, traditional actuarial methods and techniques employed to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional
property and casualty exposures are less precise in estimating claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for A&EP. As a result, estimating the ultimate cost of both reported and unreported A&EP claims is subject to a higher degree of
variability.

On August 31, 2010, CNA completed a retroactive reinsurance transaction under which
substantially all of its legacy A&EP liabilities were ceded to National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., subject to an aggregate limit of $4.0 billion (“Loss Portfolio Transfer”). If the
other parties to the Loss Portfolio Transfer do not fully perform their obligations, CNA’s liabilities for A&EP claims covered by the Loss Portfolio Transfer exceed the aggregate limit of $4.0 billion, or CNA determines it has exposures to
A&EP claims not covered by the Loss Portfolio Transfer, CNA may need to increase its recorded net reserves which would result in a charge against CNA’s earnings. These charges could be substantial.

CNA’s premium writings and profitability are affected by the availability and cost of reinsurance.

CNA purchases reinsurance to help manage its exposure to risk. Under CNA’s ceded reinsurance arrangements, another
insurer assumes a specified portion of CNA’s exposure in exchange for a specified portion of policy premiums. Market conditions determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection CNA purchases, which affects the level of its
business and profitability, as well as the level and types of risk CNA retains. If CNA is unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance at a cost it deems acceptable, CNA may be unwilling to bear the increased risk and would reduce the level of its
underwriting commitments.

CNA may not be able to collect amounts owed to it by reinsurers which could result in higher
net incurred losses.

CNA has significant amounts recoverable from reinsurers which are reported as
receivables on its balance sheets and are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves. The ceding of insurance does not, however, discharge CNA’s primary liability for
claims. As a result, CNA is subject to credit risk relating to its ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers. In the past, certain of CNA’s reinsurance carriers have experienced credit downgrades by rating agencies within the term of
CNA’s contractual relationship. Such action increases the likelihood that CNA will not be able to recover amounts due. In addition, reinsurers could dispute amounts which CNA believes are due to it. If CNA is not able to collect the amounts due
from reinsurers for any of the foregoing reasons, its net incurred losses will be higher.

CNA may not be able to
collect amounts owed to it by policyholders who hold deductible policies which could result in higher net incurred losses.

A portion of CNA’s business is written under deductible policies. Under these policies, CNA is obligated to pay the related insurance claims and are reimbursed by the policyholder to the extent of
the deductible, which may be significant. As a result CNA is exposed to credit risk to the policyholder. If CNA is not able to collect the amounts due from policyholders, its incurred losses will be higher.



CNA has incurred and may continue to incur significant realized and unrealized
investment losses and volatility in net investment income arising from volatility in the capital and credit markets.

CNA’s investment portfolio is exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit and currency risks, many of which are unpredictable. Investment returns are an important part of CNA’s
overall profitability. General economic conditions, changes in financial markets such as fluctuations in interest rates, credit conditions and currency, commodity and stock prices, and many other factors beyond CNA’s control can adversely
affect the value of its investments and the realization of investment income. Further, CNA invests a portion of its assets in equity securities and limited partnerships which are subject to greater market volatility than its fixed income
investments. In addition, limited partnership investments generally present, higher illiquidity than fixed income investments. As a result of all of these factors, CNA may not realize an adequate return on its investments, may incur losses on sales
of its investments, and may be required to write-down the value of its investments.

CNA’s valuation of investments
and impairment of securities requires significant judgment which is inherently uncertain.

CNA
exercises significant judgment in analyzing and validating fair values, which are primarily provided by third parties, for securities in its investment portfolio including those that are not regularly traded in active markets. CNA also exercises
significant judgment in determining whether the impairment of particular investments is temporary or other-than-temporary. The valuation of residential and commercial mortgage and other asset backed securities can be particularly sensitive to fairly
small changes in collateral performance. Due to the inherent uncertainties involved with these judgments, CNA may incur unrealized losses and conclude that other-than-temporary write-downs of its investments are required.

CNA is subject to capital adequacy requirements and, if it is unable to maintain or raise sufficient capital to meet these
requirements, regulatory agencies may restrict or prohibit CNA from operating its business.

Insurance
companies such as CNA are subject to capital adequacy standards set by regulators to help identify companies that merit further regulatory attention. These standards apply specified risk factors to various asset, premium and reserve components of
statutory capital and surplus reported in CNA’s statutory basis of accounting financial statements. Current rules, including those promulgated by insurance regulators and specialized markets such as Lloyd’s, require companies to maintain
statutory capital and surplus at a specified minimum level determined using the applicable regulatory capital adequacy formula. If CNA does not meet these minimum requirements, CNA may be restricted or prohibited from operating its business. If CNA
is required to record a material charge against earnings in connection with a change in estimates or the occurrence of an event or if it incurs significant losses related to its investment portfolio, CNA may violate these minimum capital adequacy
requirements unless it is able to raise sufficient additional capital.

While we have provided CNA with
substantial amounts of capital in prior years, we may be restricted in our ability or may not be willing to provide additional capital support to CNA in the future. If CNA is in need of additional capital, CNA may be required to secure this funding
from sources other than us. CNA may be limited in its ability to raise significant amounts of capital on favorable terms or at all.

CNA’s insurance subsidiaries, upon whom CNA depends for dividends in order to fund its working capital needs, are limited by insurance regulators in their ability to pay dividends.

CNA is a holding company and is dependent upon dividends, loans and other sources of cash from its
subsidiaries in order to meet its obligations. Ordinary dividend payments or dividends that do not require prior approval by the insurance subsidiaries’ domiciliary insurance regulator are generally limited to amounts determined by formula
which varies by jurisdiction. The formula for the majority of domestic states is the greater of 10% of the prior year statutory surplus or the prior year statutory net income, less the aggregate of all dividends paid during the twelve months prior
to the date of payment. Some jurisdictions including certain domestic states, however, have an additional stipulation that dividends cannot exceed the prior year’s earned surplus. If CNA is restricted, by regulatory rule or otherwise, from
paying or receiving inter-company dividends, CNA may not be able to fund its working capital needs and debt service requirements from available cash. As a result, CNA would need to look to other sources of capital which may be more expensive or may
not be available at all.



Rating agencies may downgrade their ratings of CNA and thereby adversely affect its
ability to write insurance at competitive rates or at all.

Ratings are an important factor in
establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. CNA’s insurance company subsidiaries, as well as CNA’s public debt, are rated by rating agencies, namely, A.M. Best Company (“A.M. Best”), Moody’s Investors
Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”). Ratings reflect the rating agency’s opinions of an insurance company’s or insurance holding company’s financial strength, capital
adequacy, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and debt holders.

Due to the intense competitive environment in which CNA operates, the uncertainty in determining reserves and the potential for CNA to take material unfavorable net prior year development in the future,
and possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies, the rating agencies may take action to lower CNA’s ratings in the future. If CNA’s property and casualty insurance financial strength ratings are
downgraded below current levels, CNA’s business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The severity of the impact on CNA’s business is dependent on the level of downgrade and, for certain products, which rating
agency takes the rating action. Among the adverse effects in the event of such downgrades would be the inability to obtain a material volume of business from certain major insurance brokers, the inability to sell a material volume of CNA’s
insurance products to certain markets, and the required collateralization of certain future payment obligations or reserves.

In addition, it is possible that a lowering of our corporate debt ratings by certain of the rating agencies could result in an adverse impact on CNA’s ratings, independent of any change in CNA’s
circumstances. CNA has entered into several settlement agreements and assumed reinsurance contracts that require collateralization of future payment obligations and assumed reserves if its ratings or other specific criteria fall below certain
thresholds. The ratings triggers are generally more than one level below CNA’s current ratings.

Risks Related to Us and Our
Subsidiary, Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.

Diamond Offshore’s business depends on the level of activity in
the oil and gas industry, which is significantly affected by volatile oil and gas prices.

Diamond
Offshore’s business depends on the level of activity in offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production in markets worldwide. Worldwide demand for oil and gas, oil and gas prices, market expectations of potential changes in these
prices and a variety of political and economic factors significantly affect this level of activity. However, higher or lower commodity demand and prices do not necessarily translate into increased or decreased drilling activity since Diamond
Offshore’s customers’ project development time, reserve replacement needs, as well as expectations of future commodity demand and prices all combine to affect demand for Diamond Offshore’s rigs. Oil and gas prices have been, and are
expected to continue to be, extremely volatile and are affected by numerous factors beyond Diamond Offshore’s control, including:

—

worldwide demand for oil and gas;

—

the level of economic activity in energy-consuming markets;

—

the worldwide economic environment or economic trends, such as recessions;

—

the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, commonly called OPEC, to set and maintain production levels and pricing;

—

the level of production in non-OPEC countries;

—

the worldwide political and military environment, including uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or additional outbreak of armed
hostilities in the Middle East, other oil-producing regions or other geographic areas or further acts of terrorism in the United States or elsewhere;



—

civil unrest;

—

the cost of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas;

—

the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves;

—

the rate of decline of existing and new oil and gas reserves;

—

available pipeline and other oil and gas transportation and refining capacity;

—

the ability of oil and gas companies to raise capital;

—

weather conditions;

—

natural disasters or incidents resulting from operating hazards inherent in offshore drilling, such as oil spills;

—

the policies of various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and gas reserves;

—

development and exploitation of alternative fuels or energy sources;

—

competition for customers’ drilling budgets from land-based energy markets around the world;

—

domestic and foreign tax policy; and

—

advances in exploration and development technology.

Diamond Offshore’s business involves numerous operating hazards which could expose it to significant losses and significant damage claims. Diamond Offshore is not fully insured against all of
these risks and its contractual indemnity provisions may not fully protect Diamond Offshore.

Diamond
Offshore’s operations are subject to the significant hazards inherent in drilling for oil and gas offshore, such as blowouts, reservoir damage, loss of production, loss of well control, unstable or faulty sea floor conditions, fires and natural
disasters such as hurricanes. The occurrence of any of these types of events could result in the suspension of drilling operations, damage to or destruction of the equipment involved and injury or death to rig personnel, damage to producing or
potentially productive oil and gas formations, and oil spillage, oil leaks, well blowouts and extensive uncontrolled fires, any of which could cause significant environmental damage. In addition, offshore drilling operations are subject to perils
peculiar to marine operations, including capsizing, grounding, collision and loss or damage from severe weather. Operations also may be suspended because of machinery breakdowns, abnormal drilling conditions, failure of subcontractors to perform or
supply goods or services or personnel shortages.

Consistent with industry practice, Diamond Offshore’s
contracts with its customers generally contain contractual rights to indemnity from its customer for, among other things, pollution originating from the well, while Diamond Offshore retains responsibility for pollution originating from the rig.
However, Diamond Offshore’s contractual rights to indemnification may be unenforceable or limited due to negligent or willful acts of commission or omission by itself, its subcontractors and/or suppliers and Diamond Offshore’s customers
may dispute, or be unable to meet, their contractual indemnification obligations.

Diamond Offshore maintains
liability insurance, which includes coverage for environmental damage; however, because of contractual provisions and policy limits, Diamond Offshore’s insurance coverage may not adequately cover its losses and claim costs. In addition,
pollution and environmental risks are generally not fully insurable when they are determined to be the result of criminal acts. Also, Diamond Offshore does not typically purchase loss-of-hire insurance to cover lost revenues when a rig is unable to
work. Moreover, insurance costs across the industry have increased following the Macondo incident and, in the future, certain insurance coverage is likely to become more costly and may become less available or not available at all.



Diamond Offshore believes that the policy limit under its marine liability
insurance is within the range that is customary for companies of its size in the offshore drilling industry and is appropriate for its business. However, if an accident or other event occurs that exceeds Diamond Offshore’s coverage limits or is
not an insurable event under its insurance policies, or is not fully covered by contractual indemnity, it could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. There can be no assurance that Diamond
Offshore will continue to carry the insurance it currently maintains, that its insurance will cover all types of losses or that those parties with contractual obligations to indemnify Diamond Offshore will necessarily be financially able to
indemnify Diamond Offshore against all of these risks. In addition, no assurance can be made that Diamond Offshore will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates it considers to be reasonable or that Diamond Offshore will be able
to obtain insurance against some risks.

Diamond Offshore’s industry is highly competitive and cyclical, with
intense price competition.

The offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive with
numerous industry participants, none of which at the present time has a dominant market share. Some of Diamond Offshore’s competitors may have greater financial or other resources than it does. The drilling industry has experienced
consolidation in the past and may experience additional consolidation, which could create additional large competitors. Drilling contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis. Price is typically the primary factor in determining
which qualified contractor is awarded a job; however, rig availability and location, a drilling contractor’s safety record and the quality and technical capability of service and equipment may also be considered.

Diamond Offshore’s industry has historically been cyclical. There have been periods of lower demand, excess rig
supply and low dayrates, followed by periods of high demand, short rig supply and high dayrates. Diamond Offshore cannot predict the timing or duration of such business cycles. Periods of excess rig supply intensify the competition in the industry
and often result in rigs being idle for long periods of time. Prolonged periods of low utilization and dayrates could also result in the recognition of impairment charges on certain of Diamond Offshore’s drilling rigs if future cash flow
estimates, based upon information available to management at the time, indicate that the carrying value of these rigs may not be recoverable.

Significant new rig construction and upgrades of existing drilling rigs could also intensify price competition. Based on analyst reports, Diamond Offshore believes that there are approximately 67 floaters
on order and scheduled for delivery between 2013 and 2016, with approximately 75% of these rigs scheduled for delivery in 2013 and 2014. The resulting increases in rig supply could be sufficient to depress rig utilization and intensify price
competition from both existing competitors, as well as new entrants into the offshore drilling market. Not all of the rigs currently under construction have been contracted for future work, which may further intensify price competition as scheduled
delivery dates occur. The majority of the floaters on order are dynamically positioned drilling rigs, which further increases competition with Diamond Offshore’s fleet in certain circumstances, depending on customer requirements. In Brazil,
Petrobras, which accounted for approximately 33% of Diamond Offshore’s consolidated revenues in 2012 and, as of February 1, 2013, accounted for approximately $2.6 billion of contract drilling backlog through 2016 and to which nine of
Diamond Offshore’s floaters are currently contracted, has announced plans to construct locally 29 new ultra-deepwater drilling units to be delivered beginning in 2015. These new drilling rigs, if built, would increase rig supply and could
intensify price competition in Brazil as well as other markets as they enter the market, would compete with, and could displace, Diamond Offshore’s deepwater and ultra-deepwater floaters coming off contract and could materially adversely affect
Diamond Offshore’s utilization rates, particularly in Brazil.

Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance that its
current backlog of contract drilling revenue will be ultimately realized.

As of February 1,
2013, Diamond Offshore’s contract drilling backlog was approximately $8.6 billion for contracted future work extending, in some cases, until 2019. Generally, contract backlog only includes future revenues under firm commitments; however, from
time to time, Diamond Offshore may report anticipated commitments for which definitive agreements have not yet been, but are expected to be, executed. Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance that it will be able to perform under these contracts
due to events beyond its control or that Diamond Offshore will be able to ultimately execute a definitive agreement in cases where one does not currently exist. In addition, Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance that its customers will be able
to or



willing to fulfill their contractual commitments. Diamond Offshore’s inability to perform under its contractual obligations or to execute definitive agreements or its customers’
inability or unwillingness to fulfill their contractual commitments may have a material adverse effect on Diamond Offshore’s business.

Diamond Offshore relies heavily on a relatively small number of customers and the loss of a significant customer and/or a dispute that leads to the loss of a customer could have a material adverse
impact on its financial results.

Diamond Offshore provides offshore drilling services to a customer
base that includes major and independent oil and gas companies and government-owned oil companies. In 2012, Diamond Offshore’s five largest customers in the aggregate accounted for 62% of its consolidated revenues. Diamond Offshore expects
Petrobras and OGX, which accounted for approximately 33% and 12% of Diamond Offshore’s consolidated revenues in 2012, to continue to be significant customers in 2013. Diamond Offshore’s contract drilling backlog, as of February 1,
2013, includes $1.0 billion, or 36% and $187 million or 7% of its contracted backlog for 2013, which is attributable to contracts with Petrobras and OGX for operations offshore Brazil. Petrobras has announced plans to construct locally, 29 new
ultra-deepwater drilling units to be delivered beginning in 2015. These new drilling units, if built, would compete with, and could displace, Diamond Offshore’s deepwater and ultra-deepwater floaters coming off contract and could materially
adversely affect utilization rates, particularly in Brazil. While it is normal for Diamond Offshore’s customer base to change over time as work programs are completed, the loss of, or a significant reduction in the number of rigs contracted
with, any major customer may have a material adverse effect on Diamond Offshore’s business.

The terms of Diamond
Offshore’s drilling contracts may limit its ability to attain profitability in a declining market or to benefit from increasing dayrates in an improving market.

The duration of offshore drilling contracts is generally determined by customer requirements and, to a lesser extent, the
respective management strategies of the offshore drilling contractors. In periods of decreasing demand for offshore rigs, drilling contractors generally prefer longer term contracts, but often at flat or slightly lower dayrates, to preserve dayrates
at existing levels and ensure utilization, while customers prefer shorter contracts that allow them to more quickly obtain the benefit of lower dayrates. Conversely, in periods of rising demand for offshore rigs, contractors typically prefer shorter
contracts that allow them to more quickly profit from increasing dayrates. In contrast, during these periods customers with reasonably definite drilling programs typically prefer longer term contracts to maintain dayrate prices at a consistent
level. An inability to obtain longer term contracts in a declining market or to fully benefit from increasing dayrates in an improving market through shorter term contracts may limit Diamond Offshore’s profitability.

Contracts for Diamond Offshore’s drilling rigs are generally fixed dayrate contracts, and increases in Diamond Offshore’s
operating costs could adversely affect the profitability on those contracts.

Diamond Offshore’s
contracts for its drilling rigs provide for the payment of a fixed dayrate per rig operating day, although some contracts do provide for a limited escalation in dayrate due to increased operating costs incurred by Diamond Offshore. Many of Diamond
Offshore’s operating costs, such as labor costs, are unpredictable and fluctuate based on events beyond Diamond Offshore’s control. The gross margin that Diamond Offshore realizes on these fixed dayrate contracts will fluctuate based on
variations in Diamond Offshore’s operating costs over the terms of the contracts. In addition, for contracts with dayrate escalation clauses, Diamond Offshore may be unable to fully recover increased or unforeseen costs from its customers.

Diamond Offshore’s drilling contracts may be terminated due to events beyond its control.

Diamond Offshore’s customers may terminate some of their term drilling contracts if the drilling rig is destroyed or
lost or if Diamond Offshore has to suspend drilling operations for a specified period of time as a result of a breakdown of major equipment or, in some cases, due to other events beyond the control of either party. In addition, some of Diamond
Offshore’s drilling contracts permit the customer to terminate the contract after specified notice periods by tendering contractually specified termination amounts. These termination payments may not fully compensate Diamond Offshore for the
loss of a contract. In addition, the early termination of a contract may result in a rig being idle for an extended period of time. During periods of depressed market conditions, Diamond Offshore may be subject to an increased risk of its customers
seeking to repudiate their contracts. Diamond Offshore’s



customers’ ability to perform their obligations under drilling contracts may also be adversely affected by restricted credit markets and economic downturns. If Diamond Offshore’s
customers cancel some of their contracts, and Diamond Offshore is unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms, or if contracts are disputed or suspended for an extended period of time or if a number of
contracts are renegotiated, it could materially and adversely affect Diamond Offshore’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Significant portions of Diamond Offshore’s operations are conducted outside the United States and involve additional risks not associated with domestic operations.

Diamond Offshore operates in various regions throughout the world which may expose it to political and other
uncertainties, including risks of:

—

war and civil disturbances;

—

piracy or assaults on property or personnel;

—

kidnapping of personnel;

—

expropriation or nationalization of property or equipment;

—

renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts;

—

changing political conditions;

—

imposition of trade barriers or import-export quotas;

—

foreign and domestic monetary policies;

—

the inability to repatriate income or capital;

—

difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods;

—

fluctuations in currency exchange rates;

—

regulatory or financial requirements to comply with foreign bureaucratic actions;

—

travel limitations or operational problems caused by public health threats;

—

difficulties in supplying, repairing or replacing equipment or transporting personnel in remote locations;

—

difficulties in obtaining visas or work permits for employees on a timely basis; and

—

changing taxation policies.

Diamond Offshore is subject to the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control and other U.S. laws and regulations governing its international operations in addition to worldwide
anti-bribery laws. In addition, international contract drilling operations are subject to various laws and regulations in countries in which Diamond Offshore operates, including laws and regulations relating to:

—

the equipping and operation of drilling rigs;

—

import - export quotas or other trade barriers;

—

repatriation of foreign earnings or capital;

—

oil and gas exploration and development;

—

taxation of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel; and



—

use and compensation of local employees and suppliers by foreign contractors.

Some foreign governments favor or effectively require the awarding of drilling contracts to local contractors, require
use of a local agent or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. These practices may adversely affect Diamond Offshore’s ability to compete in those regions. It is difficult to
predict what governmental regulations may be enacted in the future that could adversely affect the international drilling industry. The actions of foreign governments may materially and adversely affect Diamond Offshore’s ability to compete.

In addition, the shipment of goods, including the movement of a drilling rig across international borders,
subjects Diamond Offshore to extensive trade laws and regulations. Diamond Offshore’s import activities are governed by unique customs laws and regulations that differ in each of the countries in which Diamond Offshore operates and often impose
record keeping and reporting obligations. The laws and regulations concerning import/export activity and record keeping and reporting requirements are complex and change frequently. These laws and regulations may be enacted, amended enforced and/or
interpreted in a manner that could materially and adversely impact Diamond Offshore’s operations. Shipments can be delayed and denied export or entry for a variety of reasons, some of which may be outside of Diamond Offshore’s control.
Shipping delays or denials could cause unscheduled downtime for rigs. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal and civil penalties, economic sanctions, seizure of shipments and/or the contractual withholding of
monies owed to Diamond Offshore, among other things.

Diamond Offshore may enter into drilling contracts that exposes it
to greater risks than it normally assumes.

From time to time, Diamond Offshore may enter into
drilling contracts with national oil companies, government-controlled entities or others that expose it to greater risks than it normally assumes, such as exposure to greater environmental or other liability and more onerous termination provisions
giving the customer a right to terminate without cause or upon little or no notice. Upon termination, these contracts may not result in a payment to Diamond Offshore, or if a termination payment is required, it may not fully compensate Diamond
Offshore for the loss of a contract. In addition, the early termination of a contract may result in a rig being idle for an extended period of time. For example, Diamond Offshore currently operates, and expects to continue to operate, its drilling
rigs offshore Mexico for PEMEX – Exploración y Producción (“PEMEX”), the national oil company of Mexico. The terms of these contracts expose Diamond Offshore to greater environmental liability than it normally assumes,
and provide that, among other things, each contract can be terminated by PEMEX on short notice, contractually or by statute, subject to certain conditions. While Diamond Offshore believes that the financial terms of these contracts and its operating
safeguards in place mitigate these risks, it can provide no assurance that the increased risk exposure will not have a material negative impact on future operations or financial results.

Fluctuations in exchange rates and nonconvertibility of currencies could result in losses.

Due to Diamond Offshore’s international operations, Diamond Offshore may experience currency exchange losses where
revenues are received and expenses are paid in nonconvertible currencies or where it does not effectively hedge an exposure to a foreign currency. Diamond Offshore may also incur losses as a result of an inability to collect revenues because of a
shortage of convertible currency available to the country of operation, controls over currency exchange or controls over the repatriation of income or capital. Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance that financial hedging arrangements will
effectively hedge any foreign currency fluctuation losses that may arise.

Diamond Offshore may be required to accrue
additional tax liability on certain of its foreign earnings.

Certain of Diamond Offshore’s
international rigs are owned and operated, directly or indirectly, by Diamond Offshore International Limited (“DOIL”), a wholly owned Cayman Islands subsidiary of Diamond Offshore. It is Diamond Offshore’s intention to indefinitely
reinvest future earnings of DOIL and its foreign subsidiaries to finance foreign activities. Diamond Offshore does not expect to provide for U.S. taxes on any future earnings generated by DOIL, except to the extent that these earnings are
immediately subjected to U.S. federal income tax. Should a future



distribution be made from any unremitted earnings of this subsidiary, Diamond Offshore may be required to record additional U.S. income taxes.

Rig conversions, upgrades or new builds may be subject to delays and cost overruns.

From time to time, Diamond Offshore adds new capacity through conversions or upgrades to existing rigs or through new
construction, such as its four, ultra-deepwater drillships under construction and its construction of the

Ocean Apex

and

Ocean Onyx

. Projects of this type are subject to risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large
construction project resulting from numerous factors, including the following:

—

shortages of equipment, materials or skilled labor;

—

work stoppages;

—

unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment;

—

unanticipated cost increases;

—

weather interferences or storm damage;

—

difficulties in obtaining necessary permits or in meeting permit conditions;

—

design and engineering problems;

—

availability of suppliers to recertify equipment for enhanced regulations;

—

customer acceptance delays;

—

shipyard failures or unavailability; and

—

failure or delay of third party service providers, civil unrest and labor disputes.

Failure to complete a rig upgrade or new construction on time, or failure to complete a rig conversion or new
construction in accordance with its design specifications may, in some circumstances, result in the delay, renegotiation or cancellation of a drilling contract, resulting in a loss of contract drilling backlog and revenue to Diamond Offshore. If a
drilling contract is terminated under these circumstances, Diamond Offshore may not be able to secure a replacement contract with equally favorable terms.

Diamond Offshore has elected to self-insure for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the GOM.

Because the amount of insurance coverage available to Diamond Offshore has been limited, and the cost for such coverage
is substantial, Diamond Offshore has elected to self-insure for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the GOM. This results in a higher risk of losses, which could be material, that are not covered by third party
insurance contracts.

influences the rates and terms of its transportation contracts is the current and anticipated basis spreads - generally meaning the difference in the price of natural gas at receipt and delivery points on its natural gas pipeline systems which
influence how much



customers are willing to pay to transport gas between those points. Basis differentials can be affected by, among other things, the availability and supply of natural gas, competition from other
pipelines, including pipelines under development, available transportation and storage capacity, storage inventories, regulatory developments, weather and general market demand in markets served by its pipeline systems. As new sources of natural gas
have been identified and developed, changes in pricing dynamics between supply basins, pooling points and market areas have occurred. As a result of the increase in overall pipeline capacity and the new sources of supply, basis spreads on its
pipeline systems have narrowed over the past several years, reducing the transportation rates Boardwalk Pipeline can negotiate with its customers on contracts due for renewal for its firm transportation services. The narrowing of basis differentials
has also adversely affected the rates it is able to charge for its interruptible and short term firm transportation services. As a result, the rates Boardwalk Pipeline is able to obtain on renewals of expiring contracts are generally lower than
those under the expiring contracts, which adversely impacts its revenues and distributable cash.

The development of
large new gas supply basins in the U.S. and the overall increase in the supply of natural gas created by such development can significantly affect Boardwalk Pipeline’s business.

Growing supplies of natural gas are being produced in new production areas that are not connected to Boardwalk
Pipeline’s system and are closer to large end-user market areas than the supply basins connected to its system that traditionally served these markets. For example, gas produced in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, New York, West Virginia
and Ohio is being shipped to nearby northeast markets such as New York and Philadelphia which have traditionally been served by gas produced in Gulf Coast and mid-continent production areas which are connected to its pipelines. This has caused and
may continue to cause gas produced in supply areas connected to its system to be diverted to other market areas which may adversely affect capacity utilization and transportation rates on its systems. In addition, as discussed above, growing
supplies of natural gas from developing supply basins, especially shale plays, connected to Boardwalk Pipeline’s system have caused and may continue to cause basis spreads to narrow. All of these dynamics continue to impair Boardwalk
Pipeline’s ability to renew or replace existing contracts or to sell interruptible and short term firm transportation services at attractive rates, which adversely impacts Boardwalk Pipeline’s revenues and distributable cash flows.

Changes in the price of natural gas and NGLs impacts supply of and demand for those commodities, which impacts
Boardwalk Pipeline’s business.

Natural gas prices in the U.S. are currently lower than
historical averages driven by the abundant and growing gas supply discussed above. The prices of natural gas and NGLs fluctuates in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors, including:

—

worldwide economic conditions;

—

weather conditions, seasonal trends and hurricane disruptions;

—

the relationship between the available supplies and the demand for natural gas and NGLs;

—

new supply sources;

—

the availability of adequate transportation capacity;

—

storage inventory levels;

—

the price and availability of oil and other forms of energy;

—

the effect of energy conservation measures;

—

the nature and extent of, and changes in, governmental regulation, new regulations adopted by the EPA for example greenhouse gas legislation and
taxation; and

—

the anticipated future prices of natural gas, oil and other commodities.



It is difficult to predict future changes in natural gas and NGL prices.
However, the economic environment that has existed over the last several years generally indicates a bias toward continued downward pressure on natural gas prices. Sustained low natural gas prices could negatively impact producers including those
directly connected to Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipelines that have contracted for capacity with them.

Conversely, future increases in the price of natural gas could make alternative energy sources more competitive and
reduce demand for natural gas. A reduced level of demand for natural gas could reduce the utilization of capacity on Boardwalk Pipeline’s systems, reduce the demand for its services and could result in the non-renewal of contracted capacity as
contracts expire and affect its midstream businesses.

Boardwalk Pipeline may not have sufficient available cash, to
continue making distributions to unitholders at the current distribution rate or at all.

The amount
of cash Boardwalk Pipeline can distribute to its unitholders, including us, principally depends upon the amount of cash it generates from its operations and financing activities and the amount of cash it requires, or determines to use, for other
purposes, all of which fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on a number of factors. Many of these factors are beyond the control of Boardwalk Pipeline. Some of the factors that influence the amount of cash Boardwalk Pipeline has available for
distribution in any quarter include:

—

the level of capital expenditures it makes or anticipates making, including for expansion and growth projects;

—

the cost and form of payment for pending or anticipated acquisitions and growth or expansion projects and the commercial success of any such
initiatives;

—

the amount of cash necessary to meet its current or anticipated debt service requirements and other liabilities;

—

fluctuations in working capital needs;

—

its ability to borrow funds and/or access capital markets to fund operations or capital expenditures, including acquisitions; restrictions contained
in its debt agreements; and

—

fluctuations in cash generated by its operations, including as a result of the seasonality of its business, customer payment issues and general
business conditions such as, among others, contract renewals, basis spreads, market rates, and fluctuations in PAL revenues.

Boardwalk Pipeline may determine to reduce or eliminate distributions at any time it determines that its cash reserves are insufficient or are otherwise required to fund current or anticipated future
operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, growth or expansion projects or other business needs. Any such reduction would reduce the amount of cash available to us.

Investments that Boardwalk Pipeline makes, whether through acquisitions or growth projects, that appear to be accretive may nevertheless reduce its distributable cash flows.

Boardwalk Pipeline plans to continue to grow and diversify its business by among other things, investing in assets
through acquisitions and organic growth projects. Its ability to grow, diversify and increase distributable cash flows will depend, in part, on its ability to close and execute on accretive acquisitions and projects. Any such transaction involves
potential risks that may include, among other things:

—

the diversion of management’s and employees’ attention from other business concerns;

—

inaccurate assumptions about volume, revenues and costs, including potential synergies;

—

a decrease in liquidity as a result of Boardwalk Pipeline using available cash or borrowing capacity to finance the acquisition or project;



—

a significant increase in interest expense or financial leverage if Boardwalk Pipeline incurs additional debt to finance the acquisition or project;

—

inaccurate assumptions about the overall costs of equity or debt;

—

an inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate the acquired business and assets or the developed assets;

—

unforeseen difficulties operating in new product areas or new geographic areas; and

—

changes in regulatory requirements.

Additionally, acquisitions contain the following risks:

—

an inability to integrate successfully the businesses it acquires;

—

the assumption of unknown liabilities for which Boardwalk Pipeline is not indemnified, for which its indemnity is inadequate or for which its
insurance policies may exclude from coverage;

—

limitations on rights to indemnity from the seller; and

—

customer or key employee losses of an acquired business.

Boardwalk Pipeline is exposed to credit risk relating to nonperformance by its customers.

Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from the nonperformance by a customer of its contractual obligations. Boardwalk Pipeline’s exposure generally relates to receivables for services
provided, future performance under firm agreements and volumes of gas or other products owed by customers for imbalances or product loaned by it to them under certain of its services. For Boardwalk Pipeline’s FERC-regulated business, Boardwalk
Pipeline’s tariffs only allow it to require limited credit support in the event that its transportation customers are unable to pay for its services. If any of its significant customers have credit or financial problems which result in a delay
or failure to pay for services provided by them or contracted for with them, or to repay the product they owe them, it could have a material adverse effect on Boardwalk Pipeline’s business. In addition, as contracts expire, the credit or
financial failure of any of its customers could also result in the non-renewal of contracted capacity, which could have a material adverse effect on its business.

Boardwalk Pipeline depends on certain key customers for a significant portion of its revenues. The loss of any of these key customers could result in a decline in its revenues.

Boardwalk Pipeline relies on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of revenues. Its largest customer in
terms of revenue, Devon Gas Services, LP, represented over 12% of its 2012 revenues. Boardwalk Pipeline’s top ten customers comprised approximately 47% of its revenues in 2012. Boardwalk Pipeline may be unable to negotiate extensions or
replacements of contracts with key customers on favorable terms which could materially reduce its contracted transportation volumes and the rates it can charge for its services.



Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas transportation and storage operations are
subject to FERC’s rate-making policies which could limit its ability to recover the full cost of operating its pipelines, including earning a reasonable return.

Boardwalk Pipeline is subject to extensive regulations relating to the rates it can charge for its natural gas
transportation and storage operations. For Boardwalk Pipeline’s cost-based services, FERC establishes both the maximum and minimum rates it can charge. The basic elements that FERC considers are the costs of providing service, the volumes of
gas being transported, the rate design, the allocation of costs between services, the capital structure and the rate of return a pipeline is permitted to earn. Boardwalk Pipeline may not be able to recover all of its costs, including certain costs
associated with pipeline integrity, through existing or future rates.

Customers or FERC can challenge the
existing rates on any of Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipelines. Such a challenge against them could adversely affect its ability to charge rates that would cover future increases in its costs or even to continue to collect rates to maintain its
current revenue levels that are designed to permit a reasonable opportunity to recover current costs and depreciation and earn a reasonable return.

If any of Boardwalk Pipeline’ pipelines under FERC jurisdiction were to file a rate case, or if they have to defend their rates in a proceeding commenced by a customer or FERC, Boardwalk Pipeline
would be required, among other things, to establish that the inclusion of an income tax allowance in its cost of service is just and reasonable. Under current FERC policy, since it is a limited partnership and does not pay U.S. federal income taxes,
this would require it to show that its unitholders (or their ultimate owners) are subject to federal income taxation. To support such a showing, Boardwalk Pipeline’s general partner may elect to require owners of its units to re-certify their
status as being subject to U.S. federal income taxation on the income generated by Boardwalk Pipeline or may attempt to provide other evidence. Boardwalk Pipeline can provide no assurance that the evidence it might provide to FERC will be sufficient
to establish that its unitholders (or their ultimate owners) are subject to U.S. federal income tax liability on the income generated by Boardwalk Pipeline’s jurisdictional pipelines. If Boardwalk Pipeline is unable to make such a showing, FERC
could disallow a substantial portion of the income tax allowance included in the determination of the maximum rates that may be charged by its pipelines, which could result in a reduction of such maximum rates from current levels.

Pipeline safety laws and regulations requiring the performance of integrity management programs or the use of certain safety
technologies could subject Boardwalk Pipeline to increased capital and operating costs and require it to use more comprehensive and stringent safety controls.

Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipelines are subject to regulation by the DOT under the NGPSA with respect to natural gas and
the HLPSA with respect to NGLs, both as amended. The NGPSA and HLPSA govern the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of natural gas and NGLs pipeline facilities. These amendments have resulted in the
adoption of rules by the DOT, through PHMSA, that require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections, correction of identified anomalies and other measures to ensure pipeline
safety in high consequence areas, such as high population areas, areas unusually sensitive to environmental damage, and commercially navigable waterways. These regulations have resulted in an overall increase in maintenance costs. Due to recent
highly publicized incidents on certain pipelines in the U.S., it is possible that PHMSA may develop more stringent regulations. Boardwalk Pipeline could incur significant additional costs if new or more stringently interpreted pipeline safety
requirements are implemented.

The 2011 Act was enacted and signed into law in early 2012. Under the 2011 Act,
maximum civil penalties for certain violations have been increased to $200,000 per violation per day, and from a total cap of $1 million to $2 million. In addition, the 2011 Act reauthorized the federal pipeline safety programs of PHMSA through
September 30, 2015, and directs the Secretary of Transportation to undertake a number of reviews, studies and reports, some of which may result in additional natural gas and hazardous liquids pipeline safety rulemaking. A number of the
provisions of the 2011 Act have the potential to cause owners and operators of pipeline facilities to incur significant capital expenditures and/or operating costs.



Boardwalk Pipeline needs to maintain authority from PHMSA to operate portions of its
pipeline systems at higher than normal operating pressures.

Boardwalk Pipeline has entered into firm
transportation contracts with shippers which utilize the design capacity of certain of its pipeline assets, assuming that Boardwalk Pipeline operates those pipeline assets at higher than normal operating pressures (up to 0.80 of the pipeline’s
SMYS). Boardwalk Pipeline has authority from PHMSA to operate those pipeline assets at such higher pressures, however PHMSA retains discretion to withdraw or modify this authority. If PHMSA were to withdraw or materially modify such authority,
Boardwalk Pipeline may not be able to transport all of its contracted quantities of natural gas on its pipeline assets and could incur significant additional costs to re-obtain such authority or to develop alternate ways to meet its contractual
obligations.

Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, HighMount Exploration & Production LLC

HighMount may not be able to replace reserves and sustain production at current levels. Replacing reserves is risky and uncertain
and requires significant capital expenditures.

HighMount’s success depends largely upon its
ability to find, develop or acquire additional reserves that are economically recoverable. Unless HighMount replaces the reserves produced through successful development, exploration or acquisition, its proved reserves will decline over time.
HighMount may not be able to successfully find and produce reserves economically in the future or to acquire proved reserves at acceptable costs. HighMount makes a substantial amount of capital expenditures for the acquisition, exploration and
development of reserves. HighMount’s net cash flows have been negatively impacted by reduced natural gas and NGL prices as well as increased drilling costs developing HighMount’s oil reserves. If HighMount’s cash flow from operations
is not sufficient to fund its capital expenditure budget, there can be no assurance that financing will be available or available at favorable terms to meet those requirements.

Estimates of natural gas and oil reserves are uncertain and inherently imprecise.

Estimating the volume of proved natural gas and oil reserves is a complex process and is not an exact science because of
numerous uncertainties inherent in the process. The process relies on interpretations of available geological, geophysical, engineering and production data. The extent, quality and reliability of this technical data can vary. The process also
requires certain economic assumptions, such as oil and gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. Therefore, these estimates are inherently imprecise.

Actual future production, commodity prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities
of recoverable reserves most likely will vary from HighMount’s estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the quantities and present value of HighMount’s reserves. In addition, HighMount may adjust estimates of proved
reserves upward or downward to reflect production history, results of exploration and development drilling, prevailing commodity prices and prevailing development expenses.

The timing of both the production and the expenses from the development and production of natural gas and oil properties
will affect both the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves and their present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor, used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes, is not necessarily the most
accurate representation of their value.

If commodity prices remain depressed, HighMount may be required to take
additional write-downs of the carrying values of its properties.

HighMount may be required, under
full cost accounting rules, to write-down the carrying value of its natural gas and oil properties. A number of factors could result in a write-down, including continued low commodity prices, a substantial downward adjustment to estimated proved
reserves, a substantial increase in estimated development costs, or deterioration in exploration results. It is difficult to predict future changes in gas prices. However, the abundance of natural gas supply discoveries over the last few years would
generally indicate a bias toward downward pressure on prices. HighMount utilizes the full cost method of accounting for its exploration and development activities. Under full cost accounting, HighMount is required to perform a ceiling test each
quarter. The ceiling test is an impairment test and generally establishes a maximum, or “ceiling,” of the book value of



HighMount’s natural gas properties that is equal to the expected after tax present value (discounted at the required rate of 10%) of the future net cash flows from proved reserves, including
the effect of cash flow hedges, calculated using the average first day of the month price for the preceding 12-month period.

If the net book value of HighMount’s exploration and production (“E&P”) properties (reduced by any related net deferred income tax liability) exceeds its ceiling limitation, HighMount
will impair or “write-down” the book value of its E&P properties. HighMount recorded a ceiling test impairment charge in each quarter of 2012, totaling $433 million (after taxes) for the year ended December 31, 2012 as a result of
declines in natural gas and NGL prices. A write-down may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher natural gas and oil prices may subsequently increase the ceiling. Depending on the magnitude of any future impairment, a ceiling test
write-down could significantly reduce HighMount’s income, or produce a loss.

Natural gas, oil and other commodity prices are
volatile.

The commodity price HighMount receives for its production heavily influences its revenue,
profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth. If the current low price environment for natural gas continues, HighMount’s results of operations will be lower as well. HighMount is subject to risks due to frequent and possibly
substantial fluctuations in commodity prices. NGL prices generally fluctuate on a basis that correlates to fluctuations in crude oil prices. In the past, the prices of natural gas and crude oil have been extremely volatile, and HighMount expects
this volatility to continue. The markets and prices for natural gas and oil depend upon factors beyond HighMount’s control. These factors include, among others, economic and market conditions, domestic production and import levels, storage
levels, basis differentials, weather, government regulations and taxation. Lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that HighMount can produce economically.

HighMount engages in commodity price hedging activities.

The extent of HighMount’s commodity price risk is related to the effectiveness and scope of HighMount’s hedging activities. To the extent HighMount hedges its commodity price risk, HighMount
will forego the benefits it would otherwise experience if commodity prices or interest rates were to change in its favor. Furthermore, because HighMount has entered into derivative transactions related to only a portion of its natural gas and oil
production, HighMount will continue to have direct commodity price risk on the unhedged portion. HighMount’s actual future production may be significantly higher or lower than HighMount estimates at the time it enters into derivative
transactions for that period.

As a result, HighMount’s hedging activities may not be as effective as
HighMount intends in reducing the volatility of its cash flows, and in certain circumstances may actually increase the volatility of cash flows. In addition, even though HighMount’s management monitors its hedging activities, these activities
can result in substantial losses. Such losses could occur under various circumstances, including if a counterparty does not perform its obligations under the applicable hedging arrangement or if the hedging arrangement is imperfect or ineffective.

Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiaries Generally

In addition to the specific risks and uncertainties faced by our subsidiaries, as discussed above, we and all of our
subsidiaries face risks and uncertainties related to, among other things, terrorism, hurricanes and other natural disasters, competition, government regulation, dependence on key executives and employees, litigation, dependence on information
technology and compliance with environmental laws.

Acts of terrorism could harm us and our subsidiaries.

Future terrorist attacks and the continued threat of terrorism in this country or abroad, as well as possible retaliatory
military and other action by the United States and its allies, could have a significant impact on the assets and businesses of certain of our subsidiaries. CNA issues coverages that are exposed to risk of loss from a terrorism act. Terrorist acts or
the threat of terrorism, including increased political, economic and financial market instability and volatility in the price of oil and gas, could affect the market for Diamond Offshore’s drilling services, Boardwalk Pipeline’s
transportation, gathering and storage services and HighMount’s exploration and production



activities. In addition, future terrorist attacks could lead to reductions in business travel and tourism which could harm Loews Hotels. While our subsidiaries take steps that they believe are
appropriate to secure their assets, there is no assurance that they can completely secure them against a terrorist attack or obtain adequate insurance coverage for terrorist acts at reasonable rates.

Our subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal, state and local governmental regulations.

The businesses operated by our subsidiaries are impacted by current and potential federal, state and local governmental
regulations which impose or might impose a variety of restrictions and compliance obligations on those companies. Governmental regulations can also change materially in ways that could adversely affect those companies. Risks faced by our
subsidiaries related to governmental regulation include the following:

CNA.

The insurance
industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision. Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of CNA’s policyholders rather than its investors. Each jurisdiction in which CNA does business has
established supervisory agencies that regulate its business. In addition, the Lloyd’s marketplace sets rules under which its members, including CNA’s Hardy syndicate operate. These rules and regulations include the following:

—

standards of solvency, including risk-based capital measurements;

—

restrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments;

—

restrictions on CNA’s ability to withdraw from unprofitable lines of insurance or unprofitable market areas;

—

the required use of certain methods of accounting and reporting;

—

the establishment of reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes;

—

potential assessments for funds necessary to settle covered claims against impaired, insolvent or failed private or quasi-governmental insurers;

—

licensing of insurers and agents;

—

approval of policy forms;

—

limitations on the ability of CNA’s insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us; and

—

limitations on the ability to non-renew, cancel or change terms and conditions in policies.

Regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations which require that rates not be excessive, inadequate or
unfairly discriminatory. CNA may also be required by the jurisdictions in which it does business to provide coverage to persons who would not otherwise be considered eligible. Each jurisdiction dictates the types of insurance and the level of
coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks. CNA’s share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and is generally a function of its respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each jurisdiction.

Diamond Offshore.

The offshore drilling industry is dependent on demand for services from the oil and
gas exploration industry and, accordingly, is affected by changing tax and other laws relating to the energy business generally. Diamond Offshore may be required to make significant capital expenditures for additional equipment to comply with
governmental laws and regulations. It is also possible that these laws and regulations may in the future add significantly to Diamond Offshore’s operating costs or result in a reduction in revenues associated with downtime required to install
such equipment, or may otherwise significantly limit drilling activity.



In the aftermath of the Macondo well blowout in April of 2010 and the
subsequent investigation into the causes of the event, new rules have been implemented for oil and gas operations in the GOM and in many of the international locations in which Diamond Offshore operates, including new standards for well design,
casing and cementing and well control procedures, as well as rules requiring operators to systematically identify risks and establish safeguards against those risks through a comprehensive safety and environmental management system
(“SEMS”). New regulations may continue to be announced, including rules regarding drilling systems and equipment, such as blowout preventer and well control systems and lifesaving systems as well as rules regarding employee training,
engaging personnel in safety management and requiring third party audits of SEMS programs. Such new regulations could require modifications or enhancements to existing systems and equipment, or require new equipment, and could increase Diamond
Offshore’s operating costs and cause downtime for its rigs if it is required to take any of them out of service between scheduled surveys or inspections, or if it is required to extend scheduled surveys or inspections, to meet any such new
requirements. Diamond Offshore is not able to predict the likelihood, nature or extent of additional rulemaking, nor is it able to predict the future impact of these events on operations. Additional governmental regulations concerning licensing,
taxation, equipment specifications, training requirements or other matters could increase the costs of Diamond Offshore’s operations, and enhanced permitting requirements as well as escalating costs borne by its customers could reduce
exploration activity in the GOM and therefore demand for its services.

Governments in some countries are
increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of concessions, the exploration for oil and gas and other aspects of the oil and gas industry. The modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or
regulations curtailing exploratory or developmental drilling for oil and gas for economic, environmental or other reasons could materially and adversely affect Diamond Offshore’s operations by limiting drilling opportunities.

Boardwalk Pipeline

.  Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas transportation and storage operations are
subject to extensive regulation by FERC and the DOT among other federal and state authorities. In addition to FERC rules and regulations related to the rates Boardwalk Pipeline can charge for its services, federal regulations extend to pipeline
safety, operating terms and conditions of service, the types of services Boardwalk Pipeline may offer, construction or abandonment of facilities, accounting and record keeping, and relationships and transactions with affiliated companies. These
regulations can adversely impact Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to compete for business, construct new facilities, including by increasing the lead times to develop projects, offer new services, or recover the full cost of operating its
pipelines.

HighMount.

All of HighMount’s operations are conducted onshore in the
United States. The U.S. oil and gas industry, and HighMount’s operations, are subject to regulation at the federal, state and local level. Such regulation includes requirements with respect to, among other things: permits to drill and to
conduct other operations; provision of financial assurances (such as bonds) covering drilling and well operations; the location of wells; the method of drilling and completing wells; the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are
drilled; the plugging and abandoning of wells; the marketing, transportation and reporting of production; the valuation and payment of royalties; the size of drilling and spacing units (regarding the density of wells which may be drilled in a
particular area); the unitization or pooling of natural gas and oil properties; maximum rates of production from natural gas and oil wells; venting or flaring of natural gas; and the ratability of production and the operation of gathering systems
and related assets. Changes in these regulations, which HighMount cannot predict, could be harmful to HighMount’s business and results of operations.

Hydraulic fracturing is a technique commonly used by oil and gas exploration companies, including
HighMount, to stimulate the production of oil and natural gas by injecting fluids and sand into underground wells at high pressures, causing fractures or fissures in the geological formation which allow oil and gas to flow more freely. In recent
years, concerns have been raised that the fracturing process and disposal of drilling fluids may contaminate underground sources of drinking water. The conference committee report for The Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies
Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2010 requested the EPA to conduct a study of hydraulic fracturing, particularly the relationship between hydraulic fracturing and drinking water. In December of 2012 the EPA issued a progress report of the projects
the EPA is conducting as part of the study. A final draft report is expected to be released for public comment and peer review in 2014. Several bills were introduced in the 111

th

and 112

th

Congresses seeking federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing, which has historically been regulated at the state
level, though none of the proposed legislation was passed into law. Similar bills may be introduced in the



current Congress and a number of federal agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. If hydraulic fracturing
is banned or significantly restricted by federal regulation or otherwise, it could impair HighMount’s ability to economically drill new wells, which would reduce its production, revenues and profitability.

HighMount owns and operates gas gathering lines and related facilities which are regulated by the DOT and state agencies
with respect to safety and operating conditions. PHMSA has established minimum federal safety standards for certain gas gathering lines. PHMSA has indicated that changes to the current regulatory framework are needed to address gas exploration and
production activities. If implemented, the new changes could impact HighMount’s ability to transport some of its natural gas or cause HighMount to incur additional costs.

Our subsidiaries face significant risks related to compliance with environmental laws.

Our subsidiaries have extensive obligations and financial exposure related to compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws, many of which have become increasingly stringent in recent years
and may in some cases impose strict liability, which could be substantial, rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of that person. For example, Diamond Offshore could be liable for damages
and costs incurred in connection with oil spills related to its operations, including for conduct of or conditions caused by others. HighMount is subject to extensive environmental regulation in the conduct of its business, particularly related to
the handling and disposal of drilling and production waste products, water and air pollution control procedures, and the remediation of petroleum-product contamination. Boardwalk Pipeline is also subject to laws and regulations, including requiring
the acquisition of permits or other approvals to conduct regulated activities, restricting the manner in which it disposes of waste, requiring remedial action to remove or mitigate contamination and requiring capital expenditures to comply with
pollution control requirements.

We are subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change.

As awareness of climate change issues increases, governments around the world are beginning to address the matter. This
may result in new environmental regulations that may unfavorably impact us, our subsidiaries and their suppliers and customers. We and our subsidiaries may be exposed to risks related to new laws or regulations pertaining to climate change, carbon
emissions or energy use that could decrease the use of oil or natural gas, thus reducing demand for hydrocarbon-based fuel and related services provided by our energy subsidiaries. Governments also may pass laws or regulations encouraging or
mandating the use of alternative energy sources, such as wind power and solar energy, which may reduce demand for oil and natural gas. In addition, changing global weather patterns have been associated with extreme weather events and could change
longer-term natural catastrophe trends, including increasing the frequency and severity of hurricanes and other natural disasters which could increase future catastrophe losses at CNA and damage to property, disruption of business and higher
operating costs at Diamond Offshore, Boardwalk Pipeline, HighMount and Loews Hotels.

There is currently no
federal regulation that limits GHG emissions in the U.S. However, several bills were introduced in Congress in recent years that would regulate U.S. GHG emissions under a cap and trade system. Although these bills were not passed into law, some
regulation of that type may be enacted in the U.S. in the near future. In addition, in 2009 the EPA adopted regulations under the Clean Air Act requiring the monitoring and reporting of annual GHG emissions by operators of facilities that emit more
than 25,000 metric tons of GHG per year, which includes Boardwalk Pipeline and HighMount. Numerous states and several regional multi-state climate initiatives have announced or adopted plans to regulate GHG emissions, though the state programs vary
widely. The establishment of a GHG reporting system and registry may be a first step toward broader regulation of GHG emissions. Compliance with future laws and regulations could impose significant costs on affected companies or adversely affect the
demand for and the cost to produce and transport hydrocarbon-based fuel, which would adversely affect the businesses of our energy subsidiaries.



Any significant interruption in the operation of critical computer systems could materially disrupt
operations.

We and our subsidiaries have become more reliant on technology to help increase
efficiency in our businesses. We are dependent upon operational and financial computer systems to process the data necessary to conduct almost all aspects of our businesses. Any failure of our or our subsidiaries’ computer systems, or
those of our or their customers, vendors or others with whom we and they do business, could materially disrupt business operations. Computer and other business facilities and systems could become unavailable or impaired from a variety of causes,
including among others, storms and other natural disasters, terrorist attacks, utility outages or complications encountered as existing systems are replaced or upgraded. In addition, it has been reported that unknown entities or groups have mounted
so-called “cyber attacks” on businesses and other organizations solely to disable or disrupt computer systems, disrupt operations and, in some cases, steal data. Any cyber attacks that affect our or our subsidiaries’ facilities could
have a material adverse effect on our and their business or reputation.

Loss of key vendor relationships or failure of
a vendor to protect personal information could result in a materially adverse effect on our operations.

We and our subsidiaries rely on services and products provided by many vendors in the United States and abroad. These
include, for example, vendors of computer hardware, software and services, as well as other critical materials and services. If one or more key vendors becomes unable to continue to provide products or services, or fails to protect our proprietary
information, including in some cases personal information of employees, customers or hotel guests, we and our subsidiaries may experience a material adverse effect on our or their business or reputation.

We could incur impairment charges related to the carrying value of the long-lived assets and goodwill of our subsidiaries.

Our subsidiaries regularly evaluate their long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Most notably, we could incur impairment charges related to the carrying value of offshore drilling equipment at Diamond Offshore, natural gas and
oil properties at HighMount, pipeline equipment at Boardwalk Pipeline and hotel properties owned by Loews Hotels.

We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment exists. The goodwill impairment test requires us to identify reporting
units and estimate each unit’s fair value as of the testing date. We calculate the fair value of our reporting units (each of our principal operating subsidiaries) based on estimates of future discounted cash flows, which reflect
management’s judgments and assumptions regarding the appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate, future industry conditions and operations and other factors. Asset impairment evaluations are, by nature, highly subjective. The use of different
estimates and assumptions could result in materially different carrying values of our assets which could impact the need to record an impairment charge and the amount of any charge taken.

We are a holding company and derive substantially all of our income and cash flow from our subsidiaries.

We rely upon our invested cash balances and distributions from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet
our obligations and to declare and pay any dividends to holders of our common stock. Our subsidiaries are separate and independent legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to make funds available to us, whether in the form of
loans, dividends or otherwise. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us is also subject to, among other things, the availability of sufficient earnings and funds in such subsidiaries, applicable state laws, including in the case of the
insurance subsidiaries of CNA, laws and rules governing the payment of dividends by regulated insurance companies, and their compliance with covenants in their respective loan agreements. Claims of creditors of our subsidiaries will generally have
priority as to the assets of such subsidiaries over our claims and our creditors and shareholders.



We could have liability in the future for tobacco-related lawsuits.

As a result of our ownership of Lorillard, Inc. (“Lorillard”) prior to the separation of Lorillard from us in
2008 (the “Separation”), from time to time we have been named as a defendant in tobacco-related lawsuits and could be named as a defendant in additional tobacco-related suits, notwithstanding the completion of the Separation. In the
Separation Agreement entered into between us and Lorillard and its subsidiaries in connection with the Separation, Lorillard and each of its subsidiaries has agreed to indemnify us for liabilities related to Lorillard’s tobacco business,
including liabilities that we may incur for current and future tobacco-related litigation against us. An adverse decision in a tobacco-related lawsuit against us could, if the indemnification is deemed for any reason to be unenforceable or any
amounts owed to us thereunder are not collectible, in whole or in part, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and equity. We do not expect that the Separation will alter the legal exposure of either entity
with respect to tobacco-related claims. We do not believe that we have any liability for tobacco-related claims, and we have never been held liable for any such claims.

Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Management’s discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations is comprised of the following sections:



OVERVIEW

We are a holding company. Our subsidiaries are engaged in the following lines of business:

—

commercial property and casualty insurance (CNA Financial Corporation (“CNA”), a 90% owned subsidiary);

—

operation of offshore oil and gas drilling rigs (Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (“Diamond Offshore”), a 50.4% owned subsidiary);

—

transportation and storage of natural gas and natural gas liquids and gathering and processing of natural gas (Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP
(“Boardwalk Pipeline”), a 55% owned subsidiary);

—

exploration, production and marketing of natural gas and oil (including condensate and natural gas liquids), (HighMount Exploration &
Production LLC (“HighMount”), a wholly owned subsidiary); and

—

operation of hotels (Loews Hotels Holding Corporation (“Loews Hotels”), a wholly owned subsidiary).

Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this Report to “Loews Corporation,” “the
Company,” “Parent Company,” “we,” “our,” “us” or like terms refer to the business of Loews Corporation excluding its subsidiaries.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Item 8, Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.

Consolidated Financial Results

Consolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $568 million, or $1.43 per share, compared to $1.1
billion, or $2.62 per share, in 2011. Net income in 2012 includes catastrophe losses of $243 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) at CNA primarily related to Storm Sandy and after tax ceiling test impairment charges of $433 million at
HighMount related to the carrying value of its natural gas and oil properties reflecting declines in natural gas and NGL prices. Lower results at Diamond Offshore also contributed to the reduction in net income, partially offset by higher earnings
at Boardwalk Pipeline and higher parent company investment income as a result of improved performance of equity investments.

CNA’s earnings declined due to higher catastrophe losses related to Storm Sandy and a lower level of favorable net prior year development in 2012 than in 2011, partially offset by increased
investment income. Increased investment income reflects improved performance of limited partnership investments.

Diamond Offshore earnings decreased as a result of lower rig utilization and a decrease in average dayrate partially offset by lower interest expense.

Boardwalk Pipeline’s earnings increased primarily due to the contributions from recent acquisitions, lower general
and administrative expenses as well as lower impairment charges in 2012.

Book value per share increased to
$49.67 at December 31, 2012 from $47.33 at December 31, 2011.

Parent Company Structure

We are a holding company and derive substantially all of our cash flow from our subsidiaries. We rely upon our invested
cash balances and distributions from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations and to declare and pay any dividends to our shareholders. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to, among other
things, the availability of sufficient earnings and funds in such subsidiaries, applicable state laws, including in the case of the insurance subsidiaries of CNA, laws and rules governing the payment of dividends by regulated insurance companies
(see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8) and compliance with covenants in their respective loan agreements. Claims of creditors of



our subsidiaries will generally have priority as to the assets of such subsidiaries over our claims and those of our creditors and shareholders.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied on a consistent basis. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used
to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. In general, our estimates are based on historical experience, evaluation of current trends, information from third party professionals and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable
under the known facts and circumstances.

We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical
to an understanding of our Consolidated Financial Statements as their application places the most significant demands on our judgment. Due to the inherent uncertainties involved with these types of judgments, actual results could differ
significantly from estimates, which may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or equity.

Insurance Reserves

Insurance reserves are established for both short and long-duration insurance contracts. Short-duration
contracts are primarily related to property and casualty insurance policies where the reserving process is based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss, including amounts for known and unknown claims. Long-duration contracts include long term
care products and payout annuity contracts and are estimated using actuarial estimates about mortality, morbidity and persistency as well as assumptions about expected investment returns. The reserve for unearned premiums on property and casualty
contracts represents the portion of premiums written related to the unexpired terms of coverage. The reserving process is discussed in further detail in the Reserves – Estimates and Uncertainties section below.

Reinsurance and Other Receivables

An exposure exists with respect to the collectibility of ceded property and casualty and life reinsurance to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations or disputes the liabilities CNA
has ceded under reinsurance agreements. An allowance for doubtful accounts on reinsurance receivables is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from reinsurers, reinsurer solvency, CNA’s past experience and current
economic conditions. Further information on CNA’s reinsurance receivables is included in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

Additionally, an exposure exists with respect to the collectibility of amounts due from customers on other receivables.
An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due currently or in the future, management’s experience and current economic conditions.

If actual experience differs from the estimates made by management in determining the allowances for doubtful accounts on
reinsurance and other receivables, net receivables as reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets may not be collected. Therefore, our results of operations and/or equity could be materially adversely impacted.

Litigation

We and our subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings that have arisen during the ordinary course of business. We evaluate the facts and circumstances of each situation, and when management
determines it necessary, a liability is estimated and recorded. Please read Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.



Valuation of Investments and Impairment of Securities

We classify fixed maturity securities and equity securities as either available-for-sale or trading which are both
carried at fair value. Fair value represents the price that would be received in a sale of an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date, the determination of which requires us to make a significant number of
assumptions and judgments. Securities with the greatest level of subjectivity around valuation are those that rely on inputs that are significant to the estimated fair value and that are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally
from or corroborated by observable market data. These unobservable inputs are based on assumptions consistent with what we believe other market participants would use to price such securities. Further information on fair value measurements is
included in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

CNA’s
investment portfolio is subject to market declines below amortized cost that may be other-than-temporary and therefore result in the recognition of impairment losses in earnings. Factors considered in the determination of whether or not a decline is
other-than-temporary include a current intention or need to sell the security or an indication that a credit loss exists. Significant judgment exists regarding the evaluation of the financial condition and expected near-term and long term prospects
of the issuer, the relevant industry conditions and trends, and whether CNA expects to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. CNA has an Impairment Committee which reviews the investment portfolio
on at least a quarterly basis, with ongoing analysis as new information becomes available. Further information on CNA’s process for evaluating impairments is included in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under
Item 8.

Long Term Care Products and Payout Annuity Contracts

Future policy benefit reserves for CNA’s long term care products and payout annuity contracts are based on certain
assumptions including morbidity, mortality, policy persistency and discount rates, which are impacted by expected investment yields. The adequacy of the reserves are contingent on actual experience related to these key assumptions, which were
generally established at time of issue. If actual experience differs from these assumptions, the reserves may not be adequate, requiring CNA to add to reserves. Therefore, our results of operations and/or equity could be adversely impacted. The
reserving process is discussed in further detail in the Reserves – Estimates and Uncertainties section below.

Pension and
Postretirement Benefit Obligations

We make a significant number of assumptions in order to estimate the
liabilities and costs related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations under our benefit plans. The assumptions that have the most impact on pension costs are the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets.
These assumptions are evaluated relative to current market factors such as inflation, interest rates and fiscal and monetary policies. Changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense.

In determining the discount rate assumption, we utilized current market information and liability information, including
a discounted cash flow analysis of our pension and postretirement obligations. In particular, the basis for our discount rate selection was the yield on indices of highly rated fixed income debt securities with durations comparable to that of our
plan liabilities. The yield curve was applied to expected future retirement plan payments to adjust the discount rate to reflect the cash flow characteristics of the plans. The yield curves and indices evaluated in the selection of the discount rate
are comprised of high quality corporate bonds that are rated AA by an accepted rating agency.

Further
information on our pension and postretirement benefit obligations is included in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

Valuation of HighMount’s Proved Reserves

HighMount
follows the full cost method of accounting for natural gas and oil exploration and production activities. Under the full cost method, all direct costs of property acquisition, exploration and development activities are capitalized and subsequently
depleted using the units-of-production method. The depletable base of costs includes estimated future costs to be incurred in developing proved natural gas and oil reserves, as well as



capitalized asset retirement costs, net of projected salvage values. Capitalized costs in the depletable base are subject to a ceiling test. The test limits capitalized amounts to a ceiling, the
present value of estimated future net revenues to be derived from the production of proved natural gas and oil reserves, using calculated average prices adjusted for any cash flow hedges in place. If net capitalized costs exceed the ceiling test at
the end of any quarterly period, then a write-down of the assets must be recognized in that period. A write-down may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher natural gas and oil prices may subsequently increase the ceiling. For the year
ended December 31, 2012, HighMount recognized non-cash impairment charges of $680 million ($433 million after tax) related to the carrying value of natural gas and oil properties, as discussed further in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included under Item 8. In addition, gains or losses on the sale or other disposition of natural gas and oil properties are not recognized unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between
capitalized costs and proved reserves.

HighMount’s estimate of proved reserves requires a high degree of
judgment and is dependent on factors such as historical data, engineering estimates of proved reserve quantities, estimates of the amount and timing of future expenditures to develop the proved reserves, and estimates of future production from the
proved reserves. HighMount’s estimated proved reserves are based upon studies for each of its properties prepared by HighMount staff engineers. Calculations were prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally accepted by
the petroleum industry and in accordance with SEC guidelines. Determination of proved reserves is based on, among other things, (i) a pricing mechanism for oil and gas reserves which uses an average 12-month price; (ii) a limitation on the
classification of reserves as proved undeveloped to locations scheduled to be drilled within five years; and (iii) a 10% discount factor used in calculating discounted future net cash flows.

The process to estimate reserves is imprecise, and estimates are subject to revision. If there is a significant variance
in any of HighMount’s estimates or assumptions in the future and revisions to the value of HighMount’s proved reserves are necessary, related depletion expense and the calculation of the ceiling test would be affected and recognition of
natural gas and oil property impairments could occur. Given the volatility of natural gas and oil prices, it is possible that HighMount’s estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved natural gas and oil reserves that is used to
calculate the ceiling could materially change in the near term.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company uses a probability-weighted cash flow analysis to test property and equipment for impairment based on relevant market data. If an asset is determined to be impaired, a loss is recognized to reduce the
carrying amount to the fair value of the asset. Management’s cash flow assumptions are an inherent part of our asset impairment evaluation and the use of different assumptions could produce results that differ from the reported amounts.

Goodwill

Goodwill is required to be evaluated on an annual basis and whenever, in management’s judgment, there is a significant change in circumstances that would be considered a triggering event. Management
must apply judgment in assessing qualitatively whether events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Factors such as a reporting unit’s planned future
operating results, long term growth outlook and industry and market conditions are considered. Judgment is also applied in determining the estimated fair value of reporting units’ assets and liabilities for purposes of performing quantitative
goodwill impairment tests. Management uses all available information to make these fair value determinations, including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets and
observed market multiples.

Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return bases of assets and liabilities. Any resulting future tax benefits are recognized to the
extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not, and a valuation allowance is established for any portion of a deferred tax asset that management believes may not be realized. The assessment of the need for a valuation allowance
requires



management to make estimates and assumptions about future earnings, reversal of existing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies. If actual experience differs from these
estimates and assumptions, the recorded deferred tax asset may not be fully realized resulting in an increase to income tax expense in our results of operations. In addition, the ability to record deferred tax assets in the future could be limited
resulting in a higher effective tax rate in that future period.

The Company has not established deferred tax
liabilities for certain of its foreign earnings as it intends to indefinitely reinvest those earnings to finance foreign activities. However, if these earnings become subject to U.S. federal tax, any required provision could have a material impact
on our financial results.

CNA Financial

Reserves – Estimates and Uncertainties

Property and Casualty Claim and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves

CNA maintains loss reserves to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, including the estimated cost of the claims adjudication process, for claims that have
been reported but not yet settled (case reserves) and claims that have been incurred but not reported (“IBNR”). Claim and claim adjustment expense reserves are reflected as liabilities and are included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets
under the heading “Insurance Reserves.” Adjustments to prior year reserve estimates, if necessary, are reflected in results of operations in the period that the need for such adjustments is determined. The carried case and IBNR reserves as
of each balance sheet date are provided in the discussion that follows and in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

The level of reserves CNA maintains represents its best estimate, as of a particular point in time, of what the ultimate
settlement and administration of claims will cost based on CNA’s assessment of facts and circumstances known at that time. Reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex estimates that CNA derives, generally
utilizing a variety of actuarial reserve estimation techniques, from numerous assumptions and expectations about future events, both internal and external, many of which are highly uncertain.

CNA is subject to the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as industry
practices and legal, judicial, social, economic and other environmental conditions change. These issues have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on CNA’s business by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent
or by increasing the number or size of claims. Examples of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues include:

—

the effects of worldwide economic conditions, which have resulted in an increase in the number and size of certain claims including both directors
and officers (“D&O”) and errors and omissions (“E&O”) insurance claims related to corporate failures, as well as other coverages;

—

class action litigation relating to claims handling and other practices; and

—

mass tort claims, including bodily injury claims related to welding rods, benzene, lead, noise induced hearing loss, injuries from various medical
products including pharmaceuticals and various other chemical and radiation exposure claims.

The impact of these and other unforeseen emerging or potential claims and coverage issues is difficult to predict and
could materially adversely affect the adequacy of CNA’s claim and claim adjustment expense reserves and could lead to future reserve additions.



CNA’s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries also have actual and
potential exposures related to asbestos and environmental pollution (“A&EP”) claims. CNA’s experience has been that establishing reserves for casualty coverages relating to A&EP claims and the related claim adjustment expenses
are subject to uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims. Additionally, traditional actuarial methods and techniques employed to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional property and casualty exposures are
less precise in estimating claim and claim adjustment reserves for A&EP. As a result, estimating the ultimate cost of both reported and unreported A&EP claims is subject to a higher degree of variability.

To mitigate the risks posed by CNA’s exposure to A&EP claims and claim adjustment expenses, as further discussed
in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, on August 31, 2010, CNA completed a transaction with NICO, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., under which substantially all of CNA’s legacy
A&EP liabilities were ceded to NICO effective January 1, 2010 (“Loss Portfolio Transfer”).

The Loss Portfolio Transfer is considered a retroactive reinsurance contract. In the event that the cumulative claim and
allocated claim adjustment expenses ceded under the Loss Portfolio Transfer exceed the consideration paid, the resulting gain from such excess would be deferred. A cumulative amortization adjustment would be recognized in earnings in the period such
excess arises so that the resulting deferred gain would reflect the balance that would have existed if the revised estimate was available at the inception date of the Loss Portfolio Transfer. This accounting generally results in a reserve charge
because of the timing difference between the recognition of the gross adverse reserve development and the related ceded reinsurance benefit. However, there is no economic impact as long as the additional losses are within the limit under the
contract. Any future adverse prior year development in excess of approximately $230 million would put the Loss Portfolio Transfer into an overall gain position under retroactive reinsurance accounting.

Establishing Reserve Estimates

In developing claim and claim adjustment expense (“loss” or “losses”) reserve estimates, CNA’s actuaries perform detailed reserve analyses that are staggered throughout the year.
The data is organized at a “product” level. A product can be a line of business covering a subset of insureds such as commercial automobile liability for small or middle market customers, it can encompass several lines of business provided
to a specific set of customers such as dentists, or it can be a particular type of claim such as construction defect. Every product is analyzed at least once during the year, with the exception of certain run-off products which are analyzed on a
periodic basis. The analyses generally review losses gross of ceded reinsurance and apply the ceded reinsurance terms to the gross estimates to establish estimates net of reinsurance. In addition to the detailed analyses, CNA reviews actual loss
emergence for all products each quarter.

The detailed analyses use a variety of generally accepted actuarial
methods and techniques to produce a number of estimates of ultimate loss. CNA’s actuaries determine a point estimate of ultimate loss by reviewing the various estimates and assigning weight to each estimate given the characteristics of the
product being reviewed. The reserve estimate is the difference between the estimated ultimate loss and the losses paid to date. The difference between the estimated ultimate loss and the case incurred loss (paid loss plus case reserve) is IBNR. IBNR
calculated as such includes a provision for development on known cases (supplemental development) as well as a provision for claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported (pure IBNR).

Most of CNA’s business can be characterized as long-tail. For long-tail business, it will generally be several years
between the time the business is written and the time when all claims are settled. CNA’s long-tail exposures include commercial automobile liability, workers’ compensation, general liability, medical, professional liability, other
professional liability coverages, assumed reinsurance run-off and products liability. Short-tail exposures include property, commercial automobile physical damage, marine and warranty. CNA Specialty and CNA Commercial contain both long-tail and
short-tail exposures. Hardy contains primarily short-tail exposures. Other contains long-tail exposures.



Various methods are used to project ultimate loss for both long-tail and
short-tail exposures including, but not limited to, the following:

—

paid development;

—

incurred development;

—

loss ratio;

—

Bornhuetter-Ferguson using paid loss;

—

Bornhuetter-Ferguson using incurred loss;

—

frequency times severity; and

—

stochastic modeling.

The paid development method estimates ultimate losses by reviewing paid loss patterns and applying them to accident or policy years with further expected changes in paid loss. Selection of the paid loss
pattern may require consideration of several factors including the impact of inflation on claims costs, the rate at which claims professionals make claim payments and close claims, the impact of judicial decisions, the impact of underwriting
changes, the impact of large claim payments and other factors. Claim cost inflation itself may require evaluation of changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property, changes in the cost of medical care, changes in the cost of wage
replacement, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors. Because this method assumes that losses are paid at a consistent rate, changes in any of these factors can impact the results. Since the method does not rely on case reserves,
it is not directly influenced by changes in the adequacy of case reserves.

For many products, paid loss data
for recent periods may be too immature or erratic for accurate predictions. This situation often exists for long-tail exposures. In addition, changes in the factors described above may result in inconsistent payment patterns. Finally, estimating the
paid loss pattern subsequent to the most mature point available in the data analyzed often involves considerable uncertainty for long-tail products such as workers’ compensation.

The incurred development method is similar to the paid development method, but it uses case incurred losses instead of
paid losses. Since the method uses more data (case reserves in addition to paid losses) than the paid development method, the incurred development patterns may be less variable than paid patterns. However, selection of the incurred loss pattern
typically requires analysis of all of the same factors described above. In addition, the inclusion of case reserves can lead to distortions if changes in case reserving practices have taken place, and the use of case incurred losses may not
eliminate the issues associated with estimating the incurred loss pattern subsequent to the most mature point available.

The loss ratio method multiplies earned premiums by an expected loss ratio to produce ultimate loss estimates for each accident or policy year. This method may be useful for immature accident or policy
periods or if loss development patterns are inconsistent, losses emerge very slowly, or there is relatively little loss history from which to estimate future losses. The selection of the expected loss ratio typically requires analysis of loss ratios
from earlier accident or policy years or pricing studies and analysis of inflationary trends, frequency trends, rate changes, underwriting changes, and other applicable factors.

The Bornhuetter-Ferguson method using paid loss is a combination of the paid development method and the loss ratio
method. This method normally determines expected loss ratios similar to the approach used to estimate the expected loss ratio for the loss ratio method and typically requires analysis of the same factors described above. This method assumes that
future losses will develop at the expected loss ratio level. The percent of paid loss to ultimate loss implied from the paid development method is used to determine what percentage of ultimate loss is yet to be paid. The use of the pattern from the
paid development method typically requires consideration of the same factors listed in the description of the paid development method. The estimate of losses yet to be paid is added to current paid losses to estimate the ultimate loss for each year.
For long-tail lines, this method will react very slowly if actual



ultimate loss ratios are different from expectations due to changes not accounted for by the expected loss ratio calculation.

The Bornhuetter-Ferguson method using incurred loss is similar to the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method using paid loss except
that it uses case incurred losses. The use of case incurred losses instead of paid losses can result in development patterns that are less variable than paid patterns. However, the inclusion of case reserves can lead to distortions if changes in
case reserving have taken place, and the method typically requires analysis of the same factors that need to be reviewed for the loss ratio and incurred development methods.

The frequency times severity method multiplies a projected number of ultimate claims by an estimated ultimate average
loss for each accident or policy year to produce ultimate loss estimates. Since projections of the ultimate number of claims are often less variable than projections of ultimate loss, this method can provide more reliable results for products where
loss development patterns are inconsistent or too variable to be relied on exclusively. In addition, this method can more directly account for changes in coverage that impact the number and size of claims. However, this method can be difficult to
apply to situations where very large claims or a substantial number of unusual claims result in volatile average claim sizes. Projecting the ultimate number of claims may require analysis of several factors including the rate at which policyholders
report claims to CNA, the impact of judicial decisions, the impact of underwriting changes and other factors. Estimating the ultimate average loss may require analysis of the impact of large losses and claim cost trends based on changes in the cost
of repairing or replacing property, changes in the cost of medical care, changes in the cost of wage replacement, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors.

Stochastic modeling produces a range of possible outcomes based on varying assumptions related to the particular product
being modeled. For some products, CNA uses models which rely on historical development patterns at an aggregate level, while other products are modeled using individual claim variability assumptions supplied by the claims department. In either case,
multiple simulations are run and the results are analyzed to produce a range of potential outcomes. The results will typically include a mean and percentiles of the possible reserve distribution which aid in the selection of a point estimate.

For many exposures, especially those that can be considered long-tail, a particular accident or policy year
may not have a sufficient volume of paid losses to produce a statistically reliable estimate of ultimate losses. In such a case, CNA’s actuaries typically assign more weight to the incurred development method than to the paid development
method. As claims continue to settle and the volume of paid loss increases, the actuaries may assign additional weight to the paid development method. For most of CNA’s products, even the incurred losses for accident or policy years that are
early in the claim settlement process will not be of sufficient volume to produce a reliable estimate of ultimate losses. In these cases, CNA will not assign any weight to the paid and incurred development methods. CNA will use the loss ratio,
Bornhuetter-Ferguson and frequency times severity methods. For short-tail exposures, the paid and incurred development methods can often be relied on sooner primarily because CNA’s history includes a sufficient number of years to cover the
entire period over which paid and incurred losses are expected to change. However, CNA may also use the loss ratio, Bornhuetter-Ferguson and frequency times severity methods for short-tail exposures.

For other more complex products where the above methods may not produce reliable indications, CNA uses additional methods
tailored to the characteristics of the specific situation.

Periodic Reserve Reviews

The reserve analyses performed by CNA’s actuaries result in point estimates. Each quarter, the results of the
detailed reserve reviews are summarized and discussed with CNA’s senior management to determine the best estimate of reserves. This group considers many factors in making this decision. The factors include, but are not limited to, the
historical pattern and volatility of the actuarial indications, the sensitivity of the actuarial indications to changes in paid and incurred loss patterns, the consistency of claims handling processes, the consistency of case reserving practices,
changes in CNA’s pricing and underwriting, pricing and underwriting trends in the insurance market, and legal, judicial, social and economic trends.



CNA’s recorded reserves reflect its best estimate as of a particular
point in time based upon known facts, consideration of the factors cited above and its judgment. The carried reserve may differ from the actuarial point estimate as the result of CNA’s consideration of the factors noted above as well as the
potential volatility of the projections associated with the specific product being analyzed and other factors impacting claims costs that may not be quantifiable through traditional actuarial analysis. This process results in management’s best
estimate which is then recorded as the loss reserve.

Currently, CNA’s recorded reserves are modestly
higher than the actuarial point estimate. For CNA Commercial, CNA Specialty and Hardy, the difference between CNA’s reserves and the actuarial point estimate is primarily driven by uncertainty with respect to immature accident years, claim cost
inflation, changes in claims handling, tort reform roll-backs which may adversely impact claim costs and the effects from the economy. For CNA’s legacy A&EP liabilities, the difference between CNA’s reserves and the actuarial point
estimate is primarily driven by the potential tail volatility of run-off exposures.

The key assumptions
fundamental to the reserving process are often different for various products and accident or policy years. Some of these assumptions are explicit assumptions that are required of a particular method, but most of the assumptions are implicit and
cannot be precisely quantified. An example of an explicit assumption is the pattern employed in the paid development method. However, the assumed pattern is itself based on several implicit assumptions such as the impact of inflation on medical
costs and the rate at which claim professionals close claims. As a result, the effect on reserve estimates of a particular change in assumptions typically cannot be specifically quantified, and changes in these assumptions cannot be tracked over
time.

CNA’s recorded reserves are management’s best estimate. In order to provide an indication of
the variability associated with CNA’s net reserves, the following discussion provides a sensitivity analysis that shows the approximate estimated impact of variations in significant factors affecting CNA’s reserve estimates for particular
types of business. These significant factors are the ones that CNA believes could most likely materially impact the reserves. This discussion covers the major types of business for which CNA believes a material deviation to its reserves is
reasonably possible. There can be no assurance that actual experience will be consistent with the current assumptions or with the variation indicated by the discussion. In addition, there can be no assurance that other factors and assumptions will
not have a material impact on CNA’s reserves.

Within CNA Specialty, CNA believes a material deviation to
its net reserves is reasonably possible for professional liability and related business. This business includes professional liability coverages provided to various professional firms, including architects, real estate agents, small and mid-sized
accounting firms, law firms and technology firms. This business also includes D&O, employment practices, fiduciary, fidelity and surety coverages, as well as insurance products serving the health care delivery system. The most significant factor
affecting reserve estimates for this business is claim severity. Claim severity is driven by the cost of medical care, the cost of wage replacement, legal fees, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors. Underwriting and claim
handling decisions such as the classes of business written and individual claim settlement decisions can also impact claim severity. If the estimated claim severity increases by 9%, CNA estimates that the net reserves would increase by approximately
$500 million. If the estimated claim severity decreases by 3%, CNA estimates that net reserves would decrease by approximately $150 million. CNA’s net reserves for this business were approximately $5.3 billion at December 31, 2012.

Within CNA Commercial, the two types of business for which CNA believes a material deviation to its net
reserves is reasonably possible are workers’ compensation and general liability.

For CNA Commercial
workers’ compensation, since many years will pass from the time the business is written until all claim payments have been made, claim cost inflation on claim payments is the most significant factor affecting workers’ compensation reserve
estimates. Workers’ compensation claim cost inflation is driven by the cost of medical care, the cost of wage replacement, expected claimant lifetimes, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors. If estimated workers’
compensation claim cost inflation increases by 100 basis points for the entire period over which claim payments will be made, CNA estimates that its net reserves would increase by approximately $450 million. If estimated workers’ compensation
claim cost inflation decreases by 100 basis points for the entire period over which claim payments will be made, CNA estimates that its net reserves would decrease



by approximately $400 million. Net reserves for CNA Commercial workers’ compensation were approximately $4.9 billion at December 31, 2012.

For CNA Commercial general liability, the most significant factor affecting reserve estimates is claim severity. Claim
severity is driven by changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property, the cost of medical care, the cost of wage replacement, judicial decisions, legislation and other factors. If the estimated claim severity for general liability increases
by 6%, CNA estimates that its net reserves would increase by approximately $250 million. If the estimated claim severity for general liability decreases by 3%, CNA estimates that its net reserves would decrease by approximately $100 million. Net
reserves for CNA Commercial general liability were approximately $3.8 billion at December 31, 2012.

Given the factors described above, it is not possible to quantify precisely the ultimate exposure represented by claims
and related litigation. As a result, CNA regularly reviews the adequacy of its reserves and reassesses its reserve estimates as historical loss experience develops, additional claims are reported and settled and additional information becomes
available in subsequent periods.

In light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the
estimates and making the assumptions necessary to establish reserve levels, CNA reviews its reserve estimates on a regular basis and makes adjustments in the period that the need for such adjustments is determined. These reviews have resulted in
CNA’s identification of information and trends that have caused CNA to change its reserves in prior periods and could lead to the identification of a need for additional material increases or decreases in claim and claim adjustment expense
reserves, which could materially affect our results of operations and equity and CNA’s business and insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings positively or negatively. See the Ratings section of this MD&A for further information
regarding CNA’s financial strength and corporate debt ratings.

The following table summarizes gross and
net carried reserves for CNA’s property and casualty operations:

The following table summarizes the gross and net carried reserves for certain property
and casualty business in run-off, including CNA Re and A&EP:



Life & Group Non-Core Policyholder Reserves

CNA calculates and maintains reserves for policyholder claims and benefits for Life & Group Non-Core based on
actuarial assumptions. The determination of these reserves is fundamental to its financial results and requires management to make assumptions about expected investment and policyholder experience over the life of the contract. Since many of these
contracts may be in force for several decades, these assumptions are subject to significant estimation risk.

The actuarial assumptions represent management’s best estimate at the date the contract was issued plus a margin for
adverse deviation. Actuarial assumptions include estimates of morbidity, mortality, policy persistency, discount rates and expenses over the life of the contracts. Under GAAP, these assumptions are locked in throughout the life of the contract
unless a premium deficiency develops. The impact of differences between the actuarial assumptions and actual experience is reflected in results of operations each period.

Annually, management assesses the adequacy of its GAAP reserves by product group by performing premium deficiency
testing. In this test, reserves computed using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the test without provisions for adverse deviation are compared to the recorded reserves. If reserves determined based on management’s current best
estimate assumptions are greater than the existing net GAAP reserves (i.e. reserves net of any Deferred acquisition costs asset), the existing net GAAP reserves are adjusted to the greater amount.

Payout Annuity Reserves

CNA’s payout annuity reserves consist primarily of single premium group and structured settlement annuities. The annuity payments are generally fixed and are either for a specified period or
contingent on the survival of the payee. These reserves are discounted except for reserves for loss adjustment expenses on structured settlements not funded by annuities in its property and casualty insurance companies. In 2012 and 2011, CNA
recognized a premium deficiency on its payout annuity reserves. Therefore, the actuarial assumptions established at time of issue have been unlocked and updated to management’s then current best estimate. The actuarial assumptions that
management believes are subject to the most variability are discount rates and mortality.

The table below
summarizes the estimated pretax impact on CNA’s results of operations from various hypothetical revisions to its assumptions. CNA has assumed that revisions to such assumptions would occur in each policy type, age and duration within each
policy group. Although such hypothetical revisions are not currently required or anticipated, CNA believes they could occur based on past variances in experience and its expectations of the ranges of future experience that could reasonably occur.

Any actual adjustment would be dependent on the specific policies affected and,
therefore, may differ from the estimates summarized above.



Long Term Care Reserves

Long term care policies provide benefits for nursing home, assisted living and home health care subject to various daily
and lifetime caps. Policyholders must continue to make periodic premium payments to keep the policy in force. Generally CNA has the ability to increase policy premiums, subject to state regulatory approval.

CNA’s long term care reserves consist of an active life reserve, a liability for due and unpaid claims, claims in
the course of settlement and incurred but not reported claims. The active life reserve represents the present value of expected future benefit payments and expenses less expected future premium.

The actuarial assumptions that management believes are subject to the most variability are discount rates, morbidity, and
persistency, which can be affected by policy lapses and death. The table below summarizes the estimated pretax impact on CNA’s results of operations from various hypothetical revisions to its assumptions. CNA has assumed that revisions to such
assumptions would occur in each policy type, age and duration within each policy group. Although such hypothetical revisions are not currently required or anticipated, CNA believes they could occur based on past variances in experience and its
expectations of the ranges of future experience that could reasonably occur.

It should be noted that
CNA’s current GAAP long term care reserves contain a level of margin in excess of management’s current best estimates. Any required increase in the net GAAP reserves resulting from the hypothetical revisions in the table below would first
reduce the margin before they would affect results of operations. The estimated impact to results of operations in the table below are after consideration of the existing margin.

Any actual adjustment would be dependent on the specific policies affected and,
therefore, may differ from the estimates summarized above.

The following table summarizes the net carried
Life & Group Non-Core policyholder reserves:



(a)

Reserve amounts are net of $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion of ceded reserves and exclude $1.8 billion and $627 million of future policy benefits
relating to Shadow Adjustments as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, as further discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. Reserves at December 31, 2012 and 2011 also exclude $162 million
and $95 million of claim and claim adjustment expenses relating to Shadow Adjustments.

Results of Operations

The following table summarizes the results of operations for CNA for the years ended December 31,
2012, 2011 and 2010 as presented in Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

2012 Compared with 2011

Net income increased $13 million in 2012 as compared with 2011. Net investment income increased $228 million, driven by
significantly favorable limited partnership results. In addition, investment gains (losses) increased $79 million ($45 million after tax and noncontrolling interests). See the Investments section of this MD&A for further discussion of net
realized investment results and net investment income. Insurance premiums also increased $279 million, including the acquisition of Hardy. Insurance claims and policyholders’ benefits increased $407 million, primarily due to higher catastrophe
impacts, including $171 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) from Storm Sandy, and decreased favorable net prior year development. Further information on net prior year development for 2012 and 2011 is included in Note 8 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.



2011 Compared with 2010

As further discussed in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, on August,
31, 2010, CNA completed the Loss Portfolio Transfer. We recognized a loss of $328 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) in the third quarter of 2010, of which $309 million related to our continuing operations and $19 million related to
our discontinued operations.

Net income decreased $80 million in 2011 as compared with 2010. Excluding the
loss associated with the Loss Portfolio Transfer, net income decreased $408 million in 2011 as compared with 2010. Net investment income decreased $262 million, reflecting significant unfavorable limited partnership results. In addition, investment
gains (losses) decreased $105 million ($56 million after tax and noncontrolling interests). See the Investments section of this MD&A for further discussion of net realized investment results and net investment income. Partially offsetting these
decreases was an $88 million increase in insurance premiums. Insurance claims and policyholders’ benefits increased $504 million, primarily due to a lower level of favorable net prior year development, higher catastrophe losses and decreased
results in CNA’s payout annuity business. CNA’s payout annuity business was negatively impacted by a $104 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) increase in insurance reserves, due to unlocking actuarial reserve assumptions for
anticipated adverse changes in mortality and discount rates, which reflect the current low interest rate environment and CNA’s view of expected investment yields, as discussed in Life & Group Non-Core Policyholder Reserves above.
Further information on net prior year development for 2011 and 2010 is included in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

CNA Property and Casualty Insurance Operations

CNA’s
property and casualty insurance operations consist of professional, financial, specialty property and casualty products and services and commercial insurance and risk management products.

In evaluating the results of the property and casualty businesses, CNA utilizes the loss ratio, the expense ratio, the
dividend ratio and the combined ratio. These ratios are calculated using GAAP financial results. The loss ratio is the percentage of net incurred claim and claim adjustment expenses to net earned premiums. The expense ratio is the percentage of
insurance underwriting and acquisition expenses, including the amortization of deferred acquisition costs, to net earned premiums. The dividend ratio is the ratio of policyholders’ dividends incurred to net earned premiums. The combined ratio
is the sum of the loss, expense and dividend ratios.

The following table summarizes the results of CNA’s
property and casualty operations for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.



2012 Compared with 2011

Net written premiums increased $192 million in 2012 as compared with 2011. Net written premiums for 2012 included $117
million related to Hardy and for 2011 included $128 million related to First Insurance Company of Hawaii (“FICOH”). Excluding Hardy and FICOH, the increase in net written premiums was primarily driven by positive rate achievement,
partially offset by lower new business levels in certain lines in CNA Specialty. Net earned premiums increased $288 million in 2012 as compared with 2011, including $120 million related to Hardy during 2012 and $125 million related to FICOH during
2011. Excluding Hardy and FICOH, the increase in net earned premiums was consistent with increases in net written premiums and the impact of favorable premium development in CNA Commercial in 2012 as compared to unfavorable premium development in
2011.

The CNA Specialty average rate increased 5% in 2012 as compared to flat average rate in 2011 for the
policies that renewed in each period. Retention of 86% and 87% was achieved in each period. The CNA Commercial average rate increased 7% in 2012 as compared with an increase of 2% in 2011 for the policies that renewed in each period. Retention of
78% was achieved in each period.

Net operating income decreased $116 million in 2012 as compared to 2011. The
decrease in net operating income was primarily due to lower favorable net prior year development, higher catastrophe losses for CNA Commercial and decreased current accident year underwriting results in CNA Specialty. These unfavorable impacts were
partially offset by higher net investment income and the inclusion of the Surety business on a wholly owned basis in 2012 for CNA Specialty. Catastrophe losses were $243 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) in 2012 as compared to $130
million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) in 2011.



The combined ratio increased 6.5 points in 2012 as compared to 2011. The
loss ratio increased 5.3 points in 2012 as compared to 2011, primarily due to higher catastrophe losses in CNA Commercial, lower favorable net prior year development and a higher current accident year loss ratio. The expense ratio increased by 1.1
points, primarily due to the favorable impact of recoveries in 2011 on insurance receivables written off in prior years in CNA Commercial and increased acquisition and underwriting expenses in CNA Specialty.

Favorable net prior year development decreased by $189 million, from $428 million in 2011 to $239 million in 2012.
Further information on net prior year development for 2012 and 2011 is included in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

2011 Compared with 2010

Net written premiums
increased $323 million in 2011 as compared with 2010, primarily driven by new business, positive rate achievement in CNA Commercial, improved economic conditions reflected in insured exposures, as well as lower reinsurance costs. Net earned premiums
increased $101 million in 2011 as compared with 2010, consistent with increases in net written premiums over recent quarters and favorable premium development in CNA Specialty, partially offset by unfavorable premium development in CNA Commercial.

The average rate for CNA Specialty was flat for 2011 as compared to a decrease of 2% in 2010 for the policies
that renewed in each period. Retention of 87% and 86% was achieved in each period. The average rate for CNA Commercial increased 2% in 2011 as compared with an increase of 1% in 2010 for the policies that renewed in each period. Retention of 78% and
80% was achieved in each period.

Net operating income decreased $227 million in 2011 as compared to 2010
primarily due to lower net investment income, higher catastrophe losses and lower favorable net prior year development. Catastrophe losses were $130 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) in 2011 as compared to $71 million (after tax and
noncontrolling interests) in 2010.

The combined ratio increased 3.8 points in 2011 as compared to 2010. The
loss ratio increased 4.5 points in 2011 as compared to 2010, primarily due to lower favorable net prior year development and higher catastrophe losses. The expense ratio improved by 0.4 points, primarily due to the favorable impact of recoveries in
2011 on insurance receivables written off in prior years in CNA Commercial.

Favorable net prior year
development decreased by $172 million, from $600 million in 2010 to $428 million in 2011. Further information on net prior year development for 2011 and 2010 is included in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under
Item 8.

Life & Group Non-Core and Other Operations

Life & Group Non-Core primarily includes the results of the life and group lines of business that are in
run-off. Other primarily includes certain CNA corporate expenses, including interest on corporate debt and the results of certain property and casualty business in run-off, including CNA Re and A&EP. In 2010, CNA ceded substantially all of its
legacy A&EP liabilities under the Loss Portfolio Transfer, as further discussed in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.



The following table summarizes the results of CNA’s Life &
Group Non-Core and Other operations for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

2012 Compared with 2011

Net earned premiums, which relate primarily to the individual and group long term care businesses, decreased $9 million
in 2012 as compared with 2011, primarily due to lapsing of policies in CNA’s individual long term care business, which is in run-off, partially offset by increased premiums resulting from rate increase actions related to this business.

Net loss decreased $101 million in 2012 as compared with 2011. The results include expenses of $22 million
(after tax and noncontrolling interests) in 2012 and $104 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) in 2011 related to CNA’s payout annuity business, due to unlocking actuarial reserve assumptions. The initial reserving assumptions for
these contracts were determined at issuance, including a margin for adverse deviation, and were locked in throughout the life of the contract unless a premium deficiency developed. The increase to the related reserves in 2012 related to anticipated
adverse changes in discount rates, which reflect the current low interest rate environment and CNA’s view of expected future investment yields. The increase in 2011 related to anticipated adverse changes in mortality and discount rates.
Additionally, long term care claim reserves were increased $18 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) in 2012 and $30 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) in 2011.

The decrease in net loss was also driven by improved results in Life & Group Non-Core life settlement contracts
business and the impact of unfavorable performance in 2011 on its remaining pension deposit business.

2011 Compared with 2010

Net earned premiums, which relate primarily to the individual and group long term care businesses,
decreased $13 million in 2011 as compared with 2010.

Net loss decreased $125 million in 2011 as compared with
2010, primarily driven by the loss of $328 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) as a result of the Loss Portfolio Transfer consummated in the third quarter of 2010. As a result of that transaction, the investment income allocated to
Other decreased substantially because of the lower net reserve base and associated risk capital.



These net loss decreases were partially offset by net loss increases in
CNA’s payout annuity, pension deposit and long term care businesses. In 2011, CNA’s payout annuity business was negatively impacted by a $104 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) increase in insurance reserves, as discussed
above. In 2010, CNA’s payout annuity reserves were increased by $35 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests), resulting from unlocking assumptions. Additionally, long term care claim reserves were increased by $30 million (after tax and
noncontrolling interests) in 2011.

A number of CNA’s separate account pension deposit contracts
guarantee principal and an annual minimum rate of interest. If aggregate contract value in the separate account exceeds the fair value of the related assets, an additional Policyholders’ funds liability is established. In 2011, CNA increased
this pretax liability by $18 million. In 2010, CNA decreased this pretax liability by $24 million.

Diamond
Offshore

Diamond Offshore’s operating income is primarily a function of contract drilling revenue
earned less contract drilling expenses incurred or recognized. The two most significant variables affecting Diamond Offshore’s revenues are dayrates for rigs and rig utilization rates, each of which is a function of rig supply and demand in the
marketplace. These factors are not within Diamond Offshore’s control and are difficult to predict. Revenue from dayrate drilling contracts are generally recognized as services are performed, consequently, when a rig is idle, no dayrate is
earned and revenue will decrease as a result. Revenues can also be affected as a result of the acquisition or disposal of rigs, rig mobilizations, required surveys and shipyard projects. In connection with certain drilling contracts, Diamond
Offshore may receive fees for the mobilization of equipment. In addition, some of Diamond Offshore’s drilling contracts require downtime before the start of the contract to prepare the rig to meet customer requirements for which it may be
compensated.

Diamond Offshore’s operating income is also a function of varying levels of operating
expenses. Operating expenses generally are not affected by changes in dayrates, and short term reductions in utilization do not necessarily result in lower operating expenses. For instance, if a rig is to be idle for a short period of time, few
decreases in operating expenses may actually occur since the rig is typically maintained in a prepared or “warm stacked” state with a full crew. In addition, when a rig is idle, Diamond Offshore is responsible for certain operating
expenses such as rig fuel and supply boat costs, which are typically costs of the operator when a rig is under contract. However, if the rig is to be idle for an extended period of time, Diamond Offshore may reduce the size of a rig’s crew and
take steps to “cold stack” the rig, which lowers expenses and partially offsets the impact on operating income.

Operating expenses represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation and maintenance of Diamond Offshore’s drilling equipment. The principal components of Diamond Offshore’s
operating costs are, among other things, direct and indirect costs of labor and benefits, repairs and maintenance, freight, regulatory inspections, boat and helicopter rentals and insurance. Labor and repair and maintenance costs represent the most
significant components of Diamond Offshore’s operating expenses. In general, labor costs increase primarily due to higher salary levels, rig staffing requirements and costs associated with labor regulations in the geographic regions in which
Diamond Offshore’s rigs operate. In addition, the costs associated with training new and seasoned employees can be significant. Diamond Offshore expects its labor and training costs to increase in 2013 as a result of increased hiring and
training activities as it continues the process of crewing its four new drillships. Costs to repair and maintain equipment fluctuate depending upon the type of activity the drilling rig is performing, as well as the age and condition of the
equipment and the regions in which Diamond Offshore’s rigs are working.

Operating income is negatively
impacted when Diamond Offshore performs certain regulatory inspections, which it refers to as a 5-year survey, or special survey, that are due every five years for each of Diamond Offshore’s rigs. Operating revenue decreases because these
special surveys are generally performed during scheduled downtime in a shipyard. Operating expenses increase as a result of these special surveys due to the cost to mobilize the rigs to a shipyard, inspection costs incurred and repair and
maintenance costs which are recognized as incurred. Repair and maintenance activities may result from the special survey or may have been previously planned to take place during this mandatory downtime. The number of rigs undergoing a 5-year survey
will vary from year to year, as well as from quarter to quarter.



In addition, operating income may also be negatively impacted by
intermediate surveys, which are performed at interim periods between 5-year surveys. Intermediate surveys are generally less extensive in duration and scope than a 5-year survey. Although an intermediate survey may require some downtime for the
drilling rig, it normally does not require dry-docking or shipyard time, except for rigs located in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea.

As a result of anticipated downtime in the current year for rig mobilizations, regulatory surveys and shipyard projects,
Diamond Offshore expects contract drilling revenue in 2013 to decline from the levels attained in 2012. During 2013, 11 of Diamond Offshore’s rigs will require 5-year surveys and one of its U.K. rigs will require dry-docking for inspections.
These 12 rigs will be out of service for approximately 830 days in the aggregate. Diamond Offshore also expects to spend an additional approximately 590 days during 2013 for intermediate surveys, the mobilization of rigs, contract acceptance testing
and extended maintenance projects, including contract preparation work for the

Ocean Endeavor

and North Sea enhancements for the

Ocean Patriot

, each of which is expected to require approximately 180 days of downtime. Diamond Offshore
can provide no assurance as to the exact timing and/or duration of downtime associated with regulatory inspections, planned rig mobilizations and other shipyard projects.

Diamond Offshore is self-insured for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of
Mexico. If a named windstorm in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico causes significant damage to Diamond Offshore’s rigs or equipment, it could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Under its
insurance policy that expires on May 1, 2013, Diamond Offshore carries physical damage insurance for certain losses other than those caused by named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for which its deductible for physical damage is $25
million per occurrence. Diamond Offshore does not typically retain loss-of-hire insurance policies to cover its rigs.

In addition, under its current insurance policy, Diamond Offshore carries marine liability insurance covering certain legal liabilities, including coverage for certain personal injury claims, with no
exclusions for pollution and/or environmental risk. Diamond Offshore believes that the policy limit for its marine liability insurance is within the range that is customary for companies of its size in the offshore drilling industry and is
appropriate for Diamond Offshore’s business. Diamond Offshore’s deductibles for marine liability coverage, including for personal injury claims, are $10 million for the first occurrence and vary in amounts ranging between $5 million and,
if aggregate claims exceed certain thresholds, up to $100 million for each subsequent occurrence, depending on the nature, severity and frequency of claims which might arise during the policy year.

Recent Developments

Internationally, the ultra-deepwater and deepwater floater markets are generally strong and continue to show signs of further strengthening, particularly for ultra-deepwater rigs where there are
reportedly few, if any, uncontracted rigs available to work in 2013, inclusive of the expected 2013 newbuild deliveries, with the market expected to remain strong throughout 2013. Diamond Offshore believes that the diminished availability of rigs in
this market could continue to put upward pressure on dayrates during 2013. However, due to its contracted backlog in 2013 (100% and 92% for its ultra-deepwater and deepwater fleets), Diamond Offshore has limited availability in this market and may
not be able to benefit from higher price fixtures during that period. Newbuild orders for ultra-deepwater and deepwater floaters continued to be placed in 2012, including Diamond Offshore’s order for a fourth drillship and a semisubmersible
rig, both of which are currently under construction. Based on recent analyst data, there are 67 floater rigs, primarily ultra-deepwater and deepwater units, on order or under construction, excluding an estimated 29 rigs to be built on behalf of
Petróleo Brasileiro S.A., (“Petrobras”), which is currently Diamond Offshore’s most significant customer. Excluding Petrobras’ ordered rigs, nearly 73% of the floaters scheduled for delivery in 2014 and beyond are not yet
contracted for future work, including two of Diamond Offshore’s drillships and one of its semisubmersible rigs under construction. In addition, Petrobras has recently announced that it plans to cap the number of its contracted deepwater rigs
beginning in 2016. According to industry analysts, they believe Petrobras intends to fill the majority of its deepwater requirement with its own rigs, which are not yet under construction but which are scheduled for delivery in 2015 and beyond,
although industry analysts believe that this timing may be delayed due to current Brazilian shipyard limitations. If imposed by Petrobras, this limit on the



number of contracted rigs could lead to additional availability and increased competition in the deepwater market in the future.

Market demand for mid-water floaters is generally stable and is also strengthening in certain geographic markets. In both
the U.K. and Norway sectors of the North Sea, the mid-water market is very strong with industry analysts predicting the next availability of rigs in late 2013. A 2012 discovery offshore Norway has resulted in increased interest in the harsh North
Sea region, where there is a limited number of rigs capable of working and the barriers to entry are high, primarily due to significant rig modifications necessary to operate in the region. In February of 2013, Diamond Offshore announced its plan to
upgrade one of its mid-water floaters for North Sea operations, with a minimum three-year contract for the upgraded rig in the U.K. sector of the North Sea beginning in 2014. In the Mediterranean region, demand remains solid, including the Black Sea
region where recent gas discoveries have led to increased interest in the region. The Southeast Asia and Australia markets also remain steady with indications of possible strengthening.

Four of Diamond Offshore’s marketed jack-up rigs are currently operating in the Mexican waters of the Gulf of
Mexico, where drilling activity remains stable and additional tendering activity is ongoing. Diamond Offshore’s other international jack-up commenced a two year bareboat charter offshore Ecuador in 2012. During 2012, Diamond Offshore sold six
jack-up rigs, resulting in a pretax gain of approximately $76 million.

Drilling activity on the Outer
Continental Shelf of the GOM has continued to strengthen and has surpassed pre-Macondo levels. Additionally, some industry analysts predict that drilling activity, particularly in the ultra-deepwater market, will continue to strengthen in 2013 and
beyond. However, Diamond Offshore’s ability to meet this demand is limited in the near term. Diamond Offshore currently has two semisubmersible rigs on contract in the GOM, one of which is expected to have limited availability in the second
half of 2013. It also has one mid-water floater and one jack-up rig there available for contract. Looking forward, Diamond Offshore’s two ultra-deepwater drillships as well as one semisubmersible rig under construction which are scheduled for
delivery in 2014, none of which have been contracted and could be positioned in this market. The

Ocean Onyx

which is currently under construction, is expected to commence a one-year contract plus potential option periods in the GOM during the
third quarter of 2013.

Contract Drilling Backlog

The following table reflects Diamond Offshore’s contract drilling backlog as of February 1,
2013, October 17, 2012 (the date reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2012) and February 1, 2012 (the date reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2011). Contract drilling backlog is calculated by multiplying the contracted operating dayrate by the firm contract period and adding one-half of any potential rig performance bonuses. Diamond Offshore’s calculation also
assumes full utilization of its drilling equipment for the contract period (excluding scheduled shipyard and survey days); however, the amount of actual revenue earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned will be different than
the amounts and periods shown in the tables below due to various factors. Utilization rates, which generally approach 92% – 98% during contracted periods, can be adversely impacted by downtime due to various operating factors including, but not
limited to, weather conditions and unscheduled repairs and maintenance. Contract drilling backlog excludes revenues for mobilization, demobilization, contract preparation and customer reimbursables. No revenue is generally earned during periods of
downtime for regulatory surveys. Changes in Diamond Offshore’s contract drilling backlog between periods are a function of the performance of work on term contracts, as well as the extension or modification of existing term contracts and the
execution of additional contracts.

Results of Operations

The following table summarizes the results of operations for Diamond Offshore for the years ended December 31, 2012,
2011 and 2010 as presented in Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8:

2012 Compared with 2011

Contract drilling revenue decreased $318 million and net income decreased $114 million in 2012 as compared with 2011.
Contract drilling revenue for 2012 was negatively impacted by a decrease in both revenue earning days and average daily revenue earned by Diamond Offshore’s deepwater and mid-water floaters, partially offset by favorable revenue variances for
its ultra-deepwater floaters. Contract drilling expense decreased $12 million primarily due to a decrease in expense for mid-water floaters and jack-ups due to the movement of certain rigs to other operating regions with lower cost structures, lower
repair and inspection costs, as well as the absence of operating costs in 2012 for the recently sold jack-up rigs. The decrease in contract drilling expense was partially offset by an increase in costs associated with ultra-deepwater and deepwater
floaters, primarily due to higher personnel related, inspection and shorebase support costs in 2012.

Revenue
generated by ultra-deepwater floaters increased $61 million in 2012 as compared with 2011, primarily due to increased average daily revenue of $30 million and increased utilization of $30 million due to higher revenue earning days. The increase in
average daily revenue is primarily due to higher dayrates earned by the

Ocean Monarch

operating internationally during 2012 compared with the rig operating in the GOM in 2011. The increase in revenue earning days is primarily due to downtime
associated with the

Ocean Monarch

in 2011, partially offset by a decrease in revenue earning days in 2012 for other ultra-deepwater rigs as a result of scheduled surveys and shipyard projects as well as unscheduled downtime for repairs in
2012.

Revenue generated by deepwater floaters decreased $135 million in 2012 as compared with 2011, primarily
due to a $76 million decrease in average daily revenue, a $47 million decrease in utilization as a result of fewer revenue earning days and a $12 million decrease in amortized mobilization fees. The decline in average daily revenue during 2012 is
primarily due to the completion of the

Ocean Valiant’s

contract in Angola in December of 2011 which was at a significantly higher dayrate than the rig earned during 2012. The decrease in utilization during 2012 is primarily due to higher
incremental downtime for shipyard projects and inspections as compared with 2011.

Revenue generated by
mid-water floaters decreased $207 million in 2012 as compared with 2011, primarily due to a $166 million decrease in utilization, a $28 million decrease in average daily revenue and a $13 million decrease in amortized mobilization fees. Revenue
earning days decreased by 615, primarily attributable to planned downtime



for mobilization and shipyard projects, unplanned downtime for repairs, the warm stacking of rigs between contracts and additional days a rig was cold-stacked.

Revenue generated by jack-up rigs decreased $37 million in 2012 as compared with 2011, primarily due to the sale of six
jack-up rigs in 2012, three of which operated during 2011.

Net income decreased in 2012 as compared with 2011
reflecting a decline in revenue and a $19 million impairment loss (after tax and noncontrolling interests) on three mid-water floaters which are expected to be disposed of in 2013. Net income for 2012 included a $32 million gain (after tax and
noncontrolling interests) on the sale of six jack-up rigs. In addition, interest expense decreased $27 million in 2012 as compared with 2011 primarily due to incremental interest costs capitalized during 2012 related to the continuing rig
construction projects.

Diamond Offshore’s annual effective tax rate for 2012 increased as compared with
2011. The higher effective tax rate in 2012 is primarily the result of differences in the mix of Diamond Offshore’s domestic and international pre-tax earnings and losses, the mix of international tax jurisdictions in which Diamond Offshore
operates and the impact of a tax law provision that expired at the end of 2011. This provision allowed Diamond Offshore to defer recognition of certain foreign earnings for U.S. tax purposes during 2011, which deferral was unavailable in 2012.
Diamond Offshore’s 2011 tax expense also included the reversal of $15 million of U.S. income tax expense, originally recognized in 2010, related to Diamond Offshore’s intention at that time to repatriate certain foreign earnings which
changed in 2011 subsequent to its decision to build new drillships overseas.

The American Taxpayer Relief Act
of 2012, or the Act, was signed into law on January 2, 2013. The Act extends through 2013 several expired or expiring temporary business provisions which are retroactively extended to the beginning of 2012. One of the extenders will again allow
Diamond Offshore to defer recognition of certain foreign earnings for U.S. tax purposes. As required by GAAP, the effects of new legislation are recognized when signed into law. Consequently, Diamond Offshore expects to reduce its first quarter 2013
tax expense by approximately $28 million as a result of recognizing the 2012 effect of the extenders.

As
Diamond Offshore’s rigs frequently operate in different tax jurisdictions as they move from contract to contract, its effective tax rate can fluctuate substantially and its historical effective tax rates may not be sustainable and could
increase materially.

2011 Compared with 2010

Contract drilling revenue increased $24 million and net income increased $5 million in 2011 as compared with 2010.
Revenue generated by Diamond Offshore’s floater rigs increased an aggregate $95 million in 2011 as compared with 2010, while revenue generated by its jack-up fleet declined $71 million. Except for Diamond Offshore’s deepwater floaters,
average daily revenue earned by its other rigs decreased during 2011 compared to the levels attained in 2010. Utilization for ultra-deepwater and deepwater floaters increased significantly in 2011 as compared with 2010; however, utilization for
mid-water floater and jack-up fleets decreased in 2011. One additional mid-water floater and one jack-up rig were cold stacked during 2011. The

Ocean Courage

and

Ocean Valor

, which began operating under contract late in the first
quarter and in the fourth quarter of 2010, contributed incremental revenue of $162 million during 2011. Total contract drilling expense increased $158 million during 2011 as compared with 2010, reflecting incremental contract drilling expense for
the

Ocean Courage

and

Ocean Valor

, higher amortized mobilization costs and higher other operating costs associated with rigs operating internationally rather than domestically.

Revenue from ultra-deepwater floaters increased $123 million in 2011 as compared with 2010, primarily due to increased
utilization of $184 million, partially offset by a decrease in average daily revenue of $36 million and the receipt of a $31 million contract termination fee in 2010. Revenue earning days increased primarily due to the two new ultra-deepwater
floaters which were under contract in Brazil for all of 2011 generating $162 million in incremental revenue. However, aggregate revenue earned by Diamond Offshore’s six other ultra-deepwater rigs decreased $39 million due to a lower average
daily revenue earned, partially offset by an increase in revenue earning days due to downtime in 2010 associated with the relocation of three rigs from the GOM to international locations.



Revenue from deepwater floaters increased $169 million in 2011 as compared
with 2010. This increase was primarily due to a $152 million increase in utilization and a $25 million increase in average daily revenue, partially offset by an $8 million decrease in amortized mobilization fees. Revenue earning days increased in
2011, primarily due to fewer non-operating days for repairs, inspections and contract preparation activities as compared to 2010.

Revenue from mid-water floaters decreased $197 million in 2011 as compared with 2010, primarily due to decreased utilization of $153 million, decreased average daily revenue of $59 million and decreased
amortized mobilization fees of $9 million, partially offset by a $24 million demobilization fee received in relation to the

Ocean Yorktown’s

completion of its contract offshore Brazil. Revenue earning days decreased by 546, primarily
attributable to additional cold stacked days in 2011 compared to 2010, partially offset by less warm stacked days between contracts.

Revenue from jack-up rigs decreased $71 million in 2011 as compared with 2010, primarily due to decreased utilization of $71 million and decreased average daily revenue of $13 million, partially offset by
a $13 million increase in amortized mobilization fees. Revenue earning days decreased by 810, reflecting the impact of cold stacking rigs during the period, the sale of the

Ocean Shield

in July 2010 and an increase in warm stacked days in
between contracts, partially offset by a decrease in the number of non-revenue earning days for repairs and mobilization of rigs.

Net income increased in 2011 as compared with 2010, primarily due to the changes in contract drilling revenue and expense discussed above. In addition, interest expense decreased $18 million, primarily
due to interest capitalized in 2011 on Diamond Offshore’s three drillships under construction at that time. In 2010, Diamond Offshore recognized a pretax gain of $33 million related to the sale of the

Ocean Shield

.

Diamond Offshore’s annual effective tax rate decreased in 2011 as compared with 2010. The lower effective tax rate
in the current year is primarily the result of differences in the mix of Diamond Offshore’s domestic and international pretax earnings and losses, as well as the mix of international tax jurisdictions in which Diamond Offshore operates. Also
contributing to the lower effective tax rate in 2011 was the impact of a tax law provision that expired at the end of 2009 but was subsequently signed back into law in December 2010. This provision allowed Diamond Offshore to defer recognition of
certain foreign earnings for U.S. income tax purposes. The extension of this tax law provision, and Diamond Offshore’s decisions to build three new drillships overseas caused Diamond Offshore to reassess its intent to repatriate certain foreign
earnings to the U.S. It is now Diamond Offshore’s intent to reinvest those earnings internationally. Consequently, Diamond Offshore is no longer providing taxes on those foreign earnings and has reversed previously accrued taxes related to
those earnings.

Boardwalk Pipeline

Boardwalk Pipeline derives revenues primarily from the transportation and storage of natural gas and natural gas liquids
(“NGLs”) and gathering and processing of natural gas for third parties. Transportation services consist of firm natural gas transportation, whereby the customer pays a capacity reservation charge to reserve pipeline capacity at certain
receipt and delivery points along pipeline systems, plus a commodity and fuel charge on the volume of natural gas actually transported, and interruptible natural gas transportation, whereby the customer pays to transport gas only when capacity is
available and used. Boardwalk Pipeline offers firm natural gas storage services in which the customer reserves and pays for a specific amount of storage capacity, including injection and withdrawal rights, and interruptible storage and parking and
lending (“PAL”) services where the customer receives and pays for capacity only when it is available and used. Some PAL agreements are paid for at inception of the service and revenues for these agreements are recognized as service is
provided over the term of the agreement. Boardwalk Pipeline’s NGL contracts are generally fee-based and are dependent on actual volumes transported or stored, although in some cases minimum volume requirements apply. NGL storage rates are
market based rates and contracts are typically fixed-price arrangements with escalation clauses. Boardwalk Pipeline is not in the business of buying and selling natural gas and NGLs other than for system management purposes, but changes in the level
of natural gas and NGL prices may impact the volumes of gas transported and stored on its pipeline systems. Boardwalk Pipeline’s operating costs and expenses typically do not vary significantly based upon the amount of products transported,
with the exception of fuel consumed at its compressor stations.



The amount of natural gas being produced from unconventional natural gas
production areas has greatly increased in recent years. This dynamic drove the pipeline industry, including Boardwalk Pipeline, to construct substantial new pipeline infrastructure to support this development. However, the oversupply of gas from
these and other production areas has resulted in gas prices that are substantially lower than in recent years, which has caused producers to scale back production to levels below those that were expected when the new infrastructure was built. In
addition, certain of these new supply basins, such as the Marcellus and Utica Shale plays, are closer to the traditional high value markets served by interstate pipelines like Boardwalk Pipeline, a development that has further affected how natural
gas moves across the interstate pipeline grid. These factors have led to increased competition in certain pipeline markets, as well as substantially narrower price differentials than previous years between producing/supply areas and market areas
(basis spreads), which has put significant downward pressure on pricing for both firm and interruptible transportation capacity that Boardwalk Pipeline is currently marketing. Boardwalk Pipeline does not expect basis spreads on its system to improve
in the current year.

As of December 31, 2012, a substantial portion of Boardwalk Pipeline’s
transportation capacity was contracted for under firm transportation agreements having a weighted-average remaining life of approximately 6.0 years. However, each year a portion of Boardwalk Pipeline’s firm transportation agreements expire and
must be renewed or replaced. Boardwalk Pipeline renewed or replaced contracts for most of the firm transportation capacity that expired in 2012, though on average at lower rates. The amount of contracted transportation capacity which will expire in
2013 is greater than in recent years. In light of the market conditions discussed above, Boardwalk Pipeline expects that transportation contracts renewed or entered into in 2013 will be at lower rates than expiring contracts. Remaining available
capacity will be marketed and sold on a short term firm or interruptible basis, which will also be at lower rates based on current market conditions. Boardwalk Pipeline expects that these circumstances will negatively affect transportation revenues
and distributable cash flows in 2013.

The market for storage and PAL services is also impacted by the factors
discussed above, as well as by natural gas price differentials between time periods, such as winter to summer (time period price spreads). Time period price spreads declined from 2010 to 2011 and improved in the first half of 2012; however,
Boardwalk Pipeline believes that current forward pricing curves indicate that the spreads for 2013 may not be as favorable. Forward pricing curves change frequently as a result of a variety of market factors, including weather, levels of storage gas
and available capacity, among others and as such may not be a reliable predictor of actual future events. Accordingly, Boardwalk Pipeline cannot predict its future revenues from interruptible storage and PAL services due to the uncertainty and
volatility in market conditions discussed above.

Results of Operations

The following table summarizes the results of operations for Boardwalk Pipeline for the years ended December 31,
2012, 2011 and 2010 as presented in Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8:



2012 Compared with 2011

Total revenues increased $40 million in 2012 as compared with 2011, primarily due to $63 million of revenues earned by
Boardwalk HP Storage Company, LLC (“HP Storage”), acquired in December of 2011, and Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream LLC (“Louisiana Midstream”), acquired in October of 2012, and higher PAL and storage revenues of $14 million
resulting from improved market conditions. The increase in revenues was partially offset by a decrease in retained fuel of $34 million primarily due to lower natural gas prices.

Operating expenses decreased $43 million in 2012 as compared with 2011. The primary drivers of the decrease were charges
incurred in 2011 including a $29 million impairment charge associated with Boardwalk Pipeline’s materials and supplies, an expense of $5 million representing an insurance deductible associated with replacing compressor assets and $4 million of
gas losses associated with the Bistineau storage facility. In addition, in the 2012 period there were lower fuel costs of $21 million due to lower natural gas prices, lower general and administrative expenses of $16 million as a result of cost
management activities and lower operation and maintenance expenses of $11 million primarily from lower maintenance project costs and outside services. These decreases were partially offset by $38 million of expenses incurred by HP Storage and
Louisiana Midstream and $9 million of asset impairment charges. The 2011 period included a gain of $9 million from the sale of storage gas. Interest expense decreased $7 million for 2012, primarily from a charge recorded in 2011 on the early
extinguishment of debt, partially offset by increased debt levels and higher average interest rates.

2011 Compared with 2010

Total revenues increased $15 million in 2011 as compared with 2010. Gas transportation revenues,
excluding fuel, increased $61 million primarily from increased capacities resulting from the completion of several compression projects in 2010, operating the Fayetteville Lateral at its design capacity and the acquisition of HP Storage. PAL and
storage revenues decreased $19 million due to decreased parking opportunities from unfavorable natural gas price spreads between time periods and fuel retained decreased $16 million primarily due to lower natural gas prices.

Operating expenses increased $65 million in 2011 as compared with 2010. The increase includes a $29 million impairment
charge associated with Boardwalk Pipeline’s materials and supplies, most of which was subsequently sold. There were also higher operation and maintenance expenses of $18 million primarily due to maintenance projects for pipeline integrity
management and reliability spending and lower amounts of labor capitalized from fewer growth projects and higher depreciation and property taxes of $12 million associated with an increase in the asset base. These increases were partially offset by
lower fuel consumed of $9 million primarily due to lower natural gas prices. Interest expense increased by $22 million in 2011, primarily from a $13 million charge on the early extinguishment of debt and $8 million resulting from higher average
interest rates on Boardwalk Pipeline’s long term debt and lower capitalized interest.

HighMount

We use the following terms throughout this discussion of HighMount’s results of operations, with
“equivalent” volumes computed with oil and NGL quantities converted to Mcf, on an energy equivalent ratio of one barrel to six Mcf:

HighMount’s revenues and profitability depend substantially on natural gas and oil
prices and HighMount’s ability to increase its natural gas and oil production. For the period July 2008 through December 2012, NYMEX natural gas contract settlement prices have ranged from a high of $13.11 in July 2008 to a low of $2.04 in May
2012. This price decline is reflective of an increase in the supply of natural gas resulting from new sources of supply



recoverable from shale formations, primarily the result of technological advancements in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. As a result of the decline in natural gas prices, HighMount
changed its drilling program in 2011 to develop properties that produce primarily oil and natural gas liquids to benefit from the higher prices for these commodities. During 2012, NGL prices declined significantly and as a result HighMount reduced
its overall drilling program and focused its capital investments primarily on oil producing properties. The reduced natural gas and NGL prices, as well as the increased drilling costs developing HighMount’s oil reserves negatively impacted
HighMount’s net cash flow. Revenues from the sale of NGL and oil, including the impact of hedges, amounted to 46% of HighMount’s total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to 34% of its total revenue for the year
ended December 31, 2011. The price HighMount realizes for its production is also affected by HighMount’s hedging activities, as well as locational differences in market prices. As a result of ceiling test impairment charges recorded in
2012 which were primarily due to significant declines in natural gas and NGL prices, HighMount performed quarterly goodwill impairment tests and no impairment charges were required.

HighMount’s operating expenses consist primarily of production expenses, production and ad valorem taxes, as well as
depreciation, depletion and amortization (“DD&A”) expenses. Production expenses represent costs incurred to operate and maintain wells, related equipment and facilities and transportation costs. Production and ad valorem taxes increase
or decrease primarily when prices of natural gas and oil increase or decrease, but they are also affected by changes in production and state incentive programs, as well as appreciated property values. HighMount calculates depletion using the
units-of-production method, which depletes the capitalized costs and future development costs associated with evaluated properties based on the ratio of production volumes for the current period to total remaining reserve volumes for the evaluated
properties. HighMount’s depletion expense is affected by its capital spending program and projected future development costs, as well as reserve changes resulting from drilling programs, well performance and revisions due to changing commodity
prices.

Production and Sales Statistics

Presented below are production and sales statistics related to HighMount’s operations for 2012, 2011 and 2010:



In the second quarter of 2010, HighMount completed the sale of exploration
and production assets located in the Antrim Shale in Michigan and the Black Warrior Basin in Alabama. The Michigan and Alabama properties represented approximately 17% in aggregate of HighMount’s total proved reserves as of December 31,
2009, prior to the sales.

Results of Operations

The following table summarizes the results of operations for HighMount for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011
and 2010 as presented in Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.

2012 Compared with 2011

HighMount’s operating revenues decreased $93 million in 2012 as compared with 2011 due to decreased natural gas and
NGL prices and sales volumes. Average prices realized per Mcfe were $5.42 in 2012 compared to $6.30 in 2011. HighMount sold 53.7 Bcfe in 2012 compared to 60.6 Bcfe in 2011. The decrease in sales volume was primarily due to the continued reduction in
capital spending on natural gas drilling since 2008.

HighMount had hedges in place as of December 31,
2012 that covered approximately 59.5% and 26.6% of its total estimated 2013 and 2014 natural gas equivalent production at a weighted average price of $6.27 and $5.39 per Mcfe.

For the year ended December 31, 2012, HighMount recorded non-cash ceiling test impairment charges of $680 million
($433 million after tax) related to the carrying value of its natural gas and oil properties. The write-downs were the result of declines in natural gas and NGL prices. The December 31, 2012 ceiling test calculation was based on average 2012
prices of $2.76 per MMBtu for natural gas, $41.11 per Bbl for NGLs and $94.71 per Bbl for oil. See Valuation of HighMount’s Proved Reserves included in Critical Accounting Estimates above for further information.

Operating expenses were $239 million and $245 million in 2012 and 2011. Production expenses and production and ad valorem
taxes were $98 million in 2012 as compared with $109 million in 2011. DD&A expenses were $101 million in 2012 as compared with $94 million in 2011. The increase in DD&A expenses was primarily due to negative reserve revisions in 2011 and
projected future development activity focused on developing oil reserves.

In connection with refinancing its
$1.1 billion variable rate term loans, a pretax loss of $34 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011, reflecting derivative losses from termination of interest rate hedge activities. Interest expense decreased $32 million in 2012 as
compared with 2011 due to a lower outstanding debt balance in 2012.



2011 Compared with 2010

HighMount’s operating revenues decreased $65 million in 2011 as compared with 2010. Operating revenues decreased by
$46 million due to the sale of HighMount’s assets in Michigan and Alabama in 2010. Permian Basin operating revenues decreased by $19 million on sales volumes of 60.6 Bcfe in 2011 compared to 66.5 Bcfe in 2010. Average prices realized per Mcfe
for Permian Basin sales were $6.30 in 2011 compared to $6.02 in 2010, which reflects hedging activities. The decrease in Permian Basin sales volume is primarily due to the reduction in HighMount’s drilling activity in response to lower natural
gas prices.

HighMount had hedges in place as of December 31, 2011 that covered approximately 51.7% and
16.3% of its total estimated 2012 and 2013 natural gas equivalent production at a weighted average price of $5.79 and $5.44 per Mcfe.

In connection with refinancing its $1.1 billion variable rate term loans a pretax loss of $34 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011, reflecting derivative losses from termination of interest
rate hedge activities. As a result of the Michigan and Alabama asset sales in 2010, HighMount recognized a pretax loss of $30 million in Investment losses related to its interest rate and commodity hedging activities. HighMount used the proceeds
from the basin sales to reduce the outstanding debt under its term loans by $500 million, which resulted in a $15 million decrease in interest expense in 2011.

Operating expenses decreased $13 million in 2011 as compared with 2010. The decline reflects a $21 million decrease related to the sale of HighMount’s assets in Michigan and Alabama, partially offset
by an $8 million increase in operating expenses in the Permian Basin. The increase in operating expenses is due to higher DD&A expenses, partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses.

DD&A expenses were $94 million and $92 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. This reflects a
$10 million increase in the Permian Basin, due to negative reserve revisions and projected future development, offset by an $8 million decrease due to the sale of HighMount’s assets in Michigan and Alabama.

Loews Hotels

The following table summarizes the results of operations for Loews Hotels for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 as presented in Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included under Item 8:



Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization
(“EBITDA”) is an indicator of operating performance used by Loews Hotels to measure its ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures and expand its business. EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that is not meant to replace net
income as defined by GAAP. The following table reconciles EBITDA to Net income attributable to Loews Corporation for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

2012 Compared with 2011

Revenues increased by $60 million in 2012 as compared to 2011. Net income decreased by $6 million as compared to 2011.

The increase in revenues is due to $21 million from the addition of the Loews Hollywood Hotel to the
portfolio of owned properties for five months of 2012 and higher revenue per available room (“RevPAR”). RevPAR is an industry measure of the combined effect of occupancy rates and average room rates on room revenues. Other hotel operating
revenues primarily include guest charges for food and beverages. RevPAR, occupancy rates and average room rates as discussed below are for owned hotels only. RevPAR increased $5.71 to $168.89 in 2012 as compared to 2011 reflecting improving
occupancy and average room rates. Occupancy rates increased to 75.3% in 2012 from 73.6% in 2011. Average room rates increased by $2.69, or 1.2%, in 2012 as compared to 2011. In addition, revenues include $4 million from the gain on the sale of the
Loews Denver Hotel in the fourth quarter of 2012.

Revenues and operating expenses for 2012 also include $27
million of cost reimbursements from joint venture and managed properties, relating mainly to payroll incurred on behalf of the owners of hotel properties managed by us.

Equity income from joint venture properties in 2012 is consistent with 2011. Increases in average room rates at joint
venture properties was offset by lower occupancy rates in 2012 as compared to 2011.

Operating expenses
increased $60 million in 2012 as compared to 2011, due to expenses of $22 million, including acquisition and transition related costs, from the Loews Hollywood Hotel and $13 million of costs related to the closure of the Loews Regency Hotel for
renovation, partially offset by $7 million related to the partial recovery of a loan guarantee payment. In addition, operating expenses in 2012 include $27 million for cost reimbursements from joint venture and managed properties as discussed above.

2011 Compared with 2010

Revenues increased by $29 million in 2011 as compared to 2010. Net income increased by $12 million as compared to 2010.

RevPAR increased $15.29 to $163.18 in 2011 as compared to 2010. The increase in RevPAR reflects improving occupancy and
average room rates. Occupancy rates increased to 73.6% in 2011 from 70.1% in 2010. Average room rates increased by $10.46, or 5.0%, in 2011 as compared to 2010.

The improvement in operating results for 2011 as compared to 2010 is due primarily to increases in RevPAR described
above, and increases in equity income from joint venture properties reflecting higher occupancy and average room rates.



Corporate and Other

Corporate and Other operations consist primarily of investment income at the Parent Company, corporate interest expenses
and other corporate administrative costs. Investment income includes earnings on cash and short term investments held at the Parent Company level to meet current and future liquidity needs, as well as results of limited partnership investments and
the trading portfolio managed to take advantage of potential market opportunities.

The following table
summarizes the results of operations for Corporate and Other for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 as presented in Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8:

2012 Compared with 2011

Revenues increased by $63 million for 2012 as compared to 2011, primarily due to improved performance of equity and fixed
income investments in the trading portfolio, partially offset by lower performance of limited partnership investments for 2012.

Net results improved $30 million for 2012 as compared to 2011. These changes were due primarily to the change in revenues discussed above, partially offset by an increase in corporate overhead expenses
and reduced corporate overhead allocated to our subsidiaries.

2011 Compared with 2010

Revenues decreased by $185 million in 2011 as compared to 2010. There was a net loss of $85 million in 2011 as compared
to net income of $33 million in 2010. Due to less favorable equity investment returns and overall capital market volatility, the results of the trading portfolio were flat for 2011 as compared to significant gains in 2010. Earnings on cash and short
term investments were also negatively impacted in 2011 by lower effective income yields.



LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CNA Financial

Cash Flows

CNA’s primary operating cash flow sources are premiums and investment income from its insurance subsidiaries. CNA’s primary operating cash flow uses are payments for claims, policy benefits and
operating expenses, including interest expense on corporate debt. Additionally, cash may be paid or received for income taxes.

For 2012, net cash provided by operating activities was $1.3 billion as compared with $1.7 billion for 2011. Cash flows resulting from reinsurance contract commutations are reported as operating
activities. During 2012, operating cash flows were decreased by $30 million related to net cash outflows from commutations as compared with net cash inflows of $547 million during 2011. Additionally, CNA received a $29 million tax refund in 2012 as
compared to tax payments of $61 million in 2011.

Net cash used by operating activities was $89 million in
2010. As further discussed in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 and previously referenced in this MD&A, in 2010 CNA completed the Loss Portfolio Transfer transaction. As a result of this
transaction, operating cash flows were reduced for the initial net cash settlement with NICO. Excluding the impact of this transaction, net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.8 billion for 2010.

Cash flows from investing activities include the purchase and disposition of available-for-sale financial instruments.
Additionally, cash flows from investing activities may include the purchase and sale of businesses, land, buildings, equipment and other assets not generally held for resale.

Net cash used by investing activities was $934 million for 2012, as compared with net cash used of $1.1 billion for 2011
and net cash provided of $767 million for 2010. The cash flow from investing activities is impacted by various factors such as the anticipated payment of claims, financing activity, asset/liability management and individual security buy and sell
decisions made in the normal course of portfolio management. Additionally, during 2012, CNA acquired Hardy. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2010 primarily related to the sale of short term investments which was used to fund the $1.9
billion initial net cash settlement with NICO as discussed above.

Cash flows from financing activities may
include proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities, outflows for stockholder dividends or repayment of debt and outlays to reacquire equity instruments. Net cash used by financing activities was $239 million, $644 million and $742
million for 2012, 2011 and 2010.

Liquidity

CNA believes that its present cash flows from operations, investing activities and financing activities are sufficient to
fund its current and expected working capital and debt obligation needs and CNA does not expect this to change in the near term. There are currently no amounts outstanding under CNA’s $250 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility.

CNA has an effective Registration Statement on Form S-3 registering the future sale of an unlimited amount of
its debt and equity securities.

Dividends

Dividends of $0.60 per share of CNA’s common stock were declared and paid in 2012. On February 8, 2013,
CNA’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share, payable March 7, 2013 to stockholders of record on February 21, 2013. The declaration and payment of future dividends is at the discretion of CNA’s Board
of Directors and will depend on many factors, including CNA’s earnings, financial condition, business needs, and regulatory constraints.



Ratings

Ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. CNA’s insurance
company subsidiaries are rated by major rating agencies, and these ratings reflect the rating agency’s opinion of the insurance company’s financial strength, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to
policyholders. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security, and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s
rating. One or more of these agencies could take action in the future to change the ratings of CNA’s insurance subsidiaries.

The table below reflects the various group ratings issued by A.M. Best Company (“A.M. Best”), Moody’s and S&P for the property and casualty and life companies. The table also includes
the ratings for CNA senior debt.

S&P maintains a positive outlook and A.M. Best maintains a stable outlook on CNA. In
June of 2012, Moody’s upgraded CNA’s debt rating to Baa2 with a stable outlook, affirmed CNA’s insurance financial strength rating and revised its outlook on CNA’s financial strength rating to positive from stable.

If CNA’s property and casualty insurance financial strength ratings were downgraded below current levels, its
business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The severity of the impact on CNA’s business is dependent on the level of downgrade and, for certain products, which rating agency takes the rating action. Among the
adverse effects in the event of such downgrades would be the inability to obtain a material volume of business from certain major insurance brokers, the inability to sell a material volume of CNA’s insurance products to certain markets and the
required collateralization of certain future payment obligations or reserves. Downgrades of corporate debt ratings could result in adverse effects upon CNA’s liquidity position, including negatively impacting CNA’s ability to access
capital markets, and increasing its financing costs.

Further, additional collateralization may be required
for certain settlement agreements and assumed reinsurance contracts, as well as derivative contracts, if CNA’s ratings or other specific criteria fall below certain thresholds.

Diamond Offshore

Cash and
investments totaled $1.5 billion at December 31, 2012, compared to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2011. In 2012, Diamond Offshore paid cash dividends totaling $490 million, consisting of aggregate regular cash dividends of $69 million and
aggregate special cash dividends of $421 million. On February 4, 2013, Diamond Offshore declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share and a special dividend of $0.75 per share.

Cash provided by operating activities in 2012 was $1.3 billion, compared to $1.4 billion in 2011, a decrease of $109
million compared to the 2011 period, primarily due to lower earnings. Cash used in investing activities in 2012 decreased $245 million compared to 2011. This decrease was due to the sale of six jack-up rigs for cash proceeds of $132 million in 2012
and higher capital expenditures in 2011 related to the first installments for the construction of three new ultra-deepwater drillships.

Diamond Offshore is currently obligated under two vessel modification agreements and four turnkey contracts for the construction of two semisubmersible rigs and four new ultra-deepwater drillships.
Diamond Offshore estimates that the aggregate cost for the construction of the two semisubmersible rigs and the four new drillships, including commissioning, spares and project management, to be approximately $680 million and $2.6 billion, of which
$93 million and $648 million has already been paid.



In September of 2012, Diamond Offshore entered into a $750 million
syndicated, senior unsecured five-year revolving credit agreement for general corporate purposes, that provides for revolving loans, up to $250 million in performance or other standby letters of credit and up to $75 million in swingline loans. As of
December 31, 2012, there were no loans or letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement.

For
2013, Diamond Offshore has budgeted approximately $1.8 billion for capital expenditures of which approximately $1.3 billion will be spent towards the construction of its new drillships and semisubmersible rigs, and approximately $120 million will be
spent on the North Sea enhancement project for the

Ocean Patriot

. Diamond Offshore expects to finance its 2013 capital expenditures through the use of existing cash balances and cash flows from operations.

In addition, Diamond Offshore may, from time to time, issue debt or equity securities, or a combination thereof, to
finance capital expenditures, the acquisition of assets and businesses or for general corporate purposes. Diamond Offshore’s ability to access the capital markets by issuing debt or equity securities will be dependent on its results of
operations, its current financial condition, current market conditions and other factors beyond its control.

A substantial portion of Diamond Offshore’s cash flows has been and is expected to continue to be invested in the
enhancement of its drilling fleet. Diamond Offshore determines the amount of cash required to meet its capital commitments by evaluating its rig construction obligations, the need to upgrade rigs to meet specific customer requirements and its
ongoing rig equipment enhancement and replacement programs. As a result of Diamond Offshore’s intention to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of its wholly owned subsidiary, Diamond Offshore International Limited (“DOIL”), to finance
its foreign activities, Diamond Offshore does not expect such earnings to be available for distribution to its stockholders or to finance its domestic activities. However, Diamond Offshore believes that the operating cash flows generated by and cash
reserves of DOIL, and the operating cash flows available to and cash reserves of Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. will be sufficient to meet both its working capital requirements and its capital commitments over the next twelve months. Diamond
Offshore will, however, continue to make periodic assessments based on industry conditions and will adjust capital spending programs if required.

Boardwalk Pipeline

At
December 31, 2012 and 2011, cash and investments amounted to $4 million and $23 million. Funds from operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 amounted to $576 million, compared to $454 million in 2011. In 2012 and 2011, Boardwalk
Pipeline’s capital expenditures were $227 million and $142 million. During 2012, Boardwalk Pipeline purchased from us the remaining 80% interest in HP Storage for $285 million and acquired Louisiana Midstream for $620 million. These
acquisitions were funded using cash from operations, borrowings under Boardwalk Pipeline’s revolving credit facility and debt and equity offerings as further discussed below. For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, Boardwalk
Pipeline paid cash distributions of $479 million and $420 million to its partners.

Boardwalk Pipeline’s
ability to access the capital markets for debt and equity financing under reasonable terms depends on its financial condition, credit ratings and market conditions. Boardwalk Pipeline anticipates that its existing capital resources, including the
revolving credit facility and future cash flows generated from operations will be adequate to fund its operations, including its maintenance capital expenditures. Boardwalk Pipeline may seek to access the capital markets to fund some or all of its
growth capital expenditures, acquisitions or for general corporate purposes, including to refinance all or a portion of its indebtedness, a significant amount of which matures in the next five years.

In April of 2012, Boardwalk Pipeline entered into a Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement (“Amended
Credit Agreement”) with aggregate lending commitments of $1.0 billion. The Amended Credit Agreement has a maturity date of April 27, 2017. As of December 31, 2012, Boardwalk Pipeline had $302 million of loans outstanding under this
revolving credit facility with a weighted-average interest rate of 1.3% and had no letters of credit issued. As of December 31, 2012, Boardwalk Pipeline was in compliance with all covenant requirements under the credit facility.

In 2012, Boardwalk Pipeline issued $300 million of 4.0% senior notes due June 2022 and $300 million of 3.4% senior notes
due February 2023. The proceeds were used to redeem at maturity $225 million of 5.8% senior notes



due August 2012, repay in full its $200 million variable rate term loan due December 2016 and repay the $100 million of borrowings outstanding under the Subordinated Loan Agreement with us. The
remaining proceeds were used to repay borrowings under Boardwalk Pipeline’s revolving credit facility.

In October of 2012, as part of financing the acquisition of Louisiana Midstream, Boardwalk Pipeline entered into a $225
million variable rate term loan due October 1, 2017.

In February, August and October of 2012, Boardwalk
Pipeline sold 9.2 million, 11.6 million and 11.2 million common units in public offerings and received net proceeds of $250 million, $318 million and $298 million, including $5 million, $7 million and $6 million contributions from us
to maintain our 2% general partner interest. The net proceeds were used to repay borrowings under Boardwalk Pipeline’s revolving credit facility, to purchase the remaining equity ownership of HP Storage and to acquire Louisiana Midstream.

Boardwalk Pipeline incurs substantial costs for ongoing maintenance of its pipeline systems and related
facilities, including those incurred for pipeline integrity management activities, equipment overhauls, general upkeep and repairs. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration has developed regulations that require transportation
pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain areas along pipelines and take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in highly populated areas. These regulations have resulted in
an overall increase in Boardwalk Pipeline’s ongoing maintenance costs. Due to recent widely-known incidents that have occurred on certain pipelines in the U.S., it is possible that PHMSA may develop more stringent regulations. Boardwalk
Pipeline could incur significant additional costs if new or more stringently interpreted pipeline safety requirements are implemented.

Boardwalk Pipeline expects total capital expenditures to be approximately $350 million in 2013, including approximately $100 million for maintenance capital, $42 million of which will be related to
pipeline integrity management. In 2012, total capital expenditures were $227 million, of which $80 million was recorded as maintenance capital.

Boardwalk Pipeline expects to spend approximately $250 million in 2013 on its current expansion projects, including $33 million related to the Southeast Market Expansion, $73 million related to the South
Texas Eagle Ford Expansion, $16 million related to the Natural Gas Salt Dome Storage Project and $39 million related to the Choctaw Brine Supply Expansion Project.

HighMount

At December 31,
2012 and 2011, cash and investments amounted to $10 million and $85 million. Net cash flows provided by operating activities were $151 million and $140 million in 2012 and 2011. Key drivers of net operating cash flows are commodity prices,
production volumes and operating costs.

Cash used in investing activities in 2012 was $336 million, compared
to $292 million in 2011. The primary driver of cash used in investing activities is capital spent developing HighMount’s natural gas and oil reserves. In addition, in 2011, HighMount paid approximately $106 million for the acquisition of
working interests in oil and gas properties which was funded by a capital contribution from us. HighMount expects to spend approximately $270 million on capital expenditures in 2013 developing its natural gas and oil reserves, with a focus on oil
drilling opportunities. Funds for capital expenditures and working capital requirements are expected to be provided primarily from operating activities, the available capacity under the revolving credit facility and capital contributions from us.

At December 31, 2012, HighMount had $600 million of term loans outstanding and $110 million was
outstanding under HighMount’s $250 million revolving credit facility. HighMount’s credit agreement governing its term loans and revolving credit facility contains financial covenants typical for these types of agreements, including a
maximum debt to capitalization ratio and a minimum ratio of the net present value of its projected future cash flows from its proved natural gas and oil reserves to total debt. The calculation of net present value, performed at least annually, is
based on commodity prices determined by the lenders. A decline in commodity prices can reduce HighMount’s borrowing capacity requiring repayment of a portion of its line of credit funded by a capital contribution from us. As a result of
declining commodity prices, in 2012, we made a $100 million capital



contribution to HighMount of which $90 million was used to repay a portion of the amount outstanding under the line of credit in order to meet debt covenant requirements. In January of 2013,
HighMount borrowed an additional $10 million under its revolving credit facility, bringing total borrowings to $720 million. The credit agreement also contains customary restrictions or limitations on HighMount’s ability to engage in certain
transactions, including transactions with affiliates. At December 31, 2012, HighMount was in compliance with all of its covenants under the credit agreement.

Loews Hotels

Funds from
operations continue to exceed operating requirements. Cash and investments totaled $43 million at December 31, 2012, as compared to $81 million at December 31, 2011.

In January of 2013 the Loews Regency Hotel closed for an extensive renovation, with an anticipated completion in the
fourth quarter of this year. Capital expenditures for the renovation are estimated to be approximately $85 million.

Loews Hotels has added three properties to its portfolio consisting of the Loews Hollywood Hotel in 2012 and the Loews Boston Back Bay Hotel and the Loews Madison Hotel in 2013. These acquisitions were
funded with existing cash balances, third party joint venture equity, debt and approximately $88 million of net capital contributions by us.

Funds for future capital expenditures, including acquisitions of new properties, joint venture capital contributions, maintenance spending, renovation projects and working capital requirements will be
provided from operations, refinancing, newly incurred debt, existing cash balances and advances or capital contributions from us.

Corporate and Other

Parent Company cash and investments, net of receivables and payables, at
December 31, 2012 totaled $3.9 billion, as compared to $3.3 billion at December 31, 2011. During 2012, we received $683 million in interest and dividends from our subsidiaries, $285 million from the sale of our 80% ownership interest in HP
Storage to Boardwalk Pipeline and $100 million from the repayment of subordinated debt by Boardwalk Pipeline. These inflows were partially offset by the payment of $222 million to fund treasury stock purchases, net capital contributions of
approximately $100 million to our subsidiaries and $99 million of cash dividends to our shareholders.

As of
December 31, 2012, there were 391,805,166 shares of Loews common stock outstanding. Depending on market and other conditions, we may purchase shares of our and our subsidiaries’ outstanding common stock in the open market or otherwise.
During the year ended December 31, 2012, we purchased 5.6 million shares of Loews common stock at an aggregate cost of $222 million.

We have an effective Registration Statement on Form S-3 registering the future sale of an unlimited amount of our debt and equity securities.

We continue to pursue conservative financial strategies while seeking opportunities for responsible growth. These include
the expansion of existing businesses, full or partial acquisitions and dispositions, and opportunities for efficiencies and economies of scale.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

At December 31, 2012 and 2011, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.



Contractual Obligations

(a)

Includes estimated future interest payments.

(b)

Claim and claim adjustment expense reserves are not discounted and represent CNA’s estimate of the amount and timing of the ultimate settlement
and administration of gross claims based on its assessment of facts and circumstances known as of December 31, 2012. See the Reserves - Estimates and Uncertainties section of this MD&A for further information.

(c)

Future policy benefits and policyholders’ funds reserves are not discounted and represent CNA’s estimate of the ultimate amount and timing

entered into construction contracts to upgrade two existing rigs. The upgrades are expected to be completed in 2013 and 2014 at an aggregate cost of approximately $680 million, of which $93 million has been paid.

(e)

Does not include expected contribution of approximately $100 million to the Company’s pension and postretirement plans in 2013.

Further information on our commitments, contingencies and guarantees is provided in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.



INVESTMENTS

Investment activities of non-insurance subsidiaries primarily include investments in fixed income securities, including
short term investments. The Parent Company portfolio also includes equity securities, including short sales and derivative instruments, and investments in limited partnerships. These types of investments generally present greater volatility, less
liquidity and greater risk than fixed income investments and are included within Results of Operations – Corporate and Other.

We enter into short sales and invest in certain derivative instruments that are used for asset and liability management activities, income enhancements to our portfolio management strategy and to benefit
from anticipated future movements in the underlying markets. If such movements do not occur as anticipated, then significant losses may occur. Monitoring procedures include senior management review of daily detailed reports of existing positions and
valuation fluctuations to ensure that open positions are consistent with our portfolio strategy.

Credit
exposure associated with non-performance by the counterparties to derivative instruments is generally limited to the uncollateralized change in fair value of the derivative instruments recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We mitigate the
risk of non-performance by monitoring the creditworthiness of counterparties and diversifying derivatives to multiple counterparties. We occasionally require collateral from our derivative investment counterparties depending on the amount of the
exposure and the credit rating of the counterparty.

Insurance

CNA maintains a large portfolio of fixed maturity and equity securities, including large amounts of corporate and
government issued debt securities, residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, and other asset-backed securities and investments in limited partnerships which pursue a variety of long and short investment strategies across a broad array
of asset classes. CNA’s investment portfolio supports its obligation to pay future insurance claims and provides investment returns which are an important part of CNA’s overall profitability.

Net Investment Income

The significant components of CNA’s net investment income are presented in the following table:

Net investment income increased $228 million for 2012 as compared with 2011. The increase
was primarily driven by a significant increase in limited partnership investment income, increased trading portfolio income and an increase in fixed maturity securities income. Limited partnership results were positively impacted by more favorable
equity market returns, and overall capital market and credit spread volatility. The increase in fixed maturity securities income was driven by a higher invested asset base and a favorable net impact of changes in estimates of prepayments for
asset-backed securities. These favorable impacts were partially offset by the effect of purchasing new investments at lower market interest rates.

Net investment income decreased $262 million in 2011 as compared with 2010. The decrease was primarily driven by a significant decrease in limited partnership results as well as lower fixed maturity
security income. Limited partnership results were adversely impacted by less favorable equity market returns, and overall capital



market and credit spread volatility. The decrease in fixed maturity security income was primarily driven by the effect of purchasing new investments at lower market interest rates.

The fixed maturity investment portfolio provided a pretax effective income yield of 5.3%, 5.5% and 5.6% for the years
ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010. Tax-exempt municipal bonds generated $274 million, $240 million and $263 million of net investment income for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

Net Realized Investment Gains (Losses)

The components of CNA’s net realized investment results are presented in the following table:

Net realized investment gains increased $45 million for 2012 as compared with 2011,
driven by lower other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) losses recognized in earnings. Net realized investment gains decreased $56 million for 2011 as compared with 2010. Net realized investment results include OTTI losses of $100
million, $140 million and $151 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010. Further information on CNA’s realized gains and losses, including CNA’s OTTI losses and impairment decision process, is set forth in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included under Item 8.

Portfolio Quality

CNA’s fixed maturity portfolio consists primarily of high quality bonds, 91.6% and 92.1% of which were rated as
investment grade (rated BBB- or higher) at December 31, 2012 and 2011. The classification between investment grade and non-investment grade is based on a ratings methodology that takes into account ratings from two major providers,
Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) and Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. (“Moody’s”), in that order of preference. If a security is not rated by these providers, CNA formulates an internal rating. At
December 31, 2012 and 2011, approximately 98% of the fixed maturity portfolio was rated by S&P or Moody’s, or was issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, Government agencies or Government-sponsored enterprises.



The following table summarizes the ratings of CNA’s fixed maturity
portfolio at fair value:

Non-investment grade fixed maturity securities, as presented in the table below, include
high-yield securities rated below BBB- by bond rating agencies and other unrated securities that, according to CNA’s analysis, are below investment grade. Non-investment grade securities generally involve a greater degree of risk than
investment grade securities. The amortized cost of CNA’s non-investment grade fixed maturity bond portfolio was $3.4 billion and $3.2 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011. The following table summarizes the ratings of this portfolio at
fair value.

The following table summarizes available-for-sale fixed maturity securities in a gross
unrealized loss position by ratings distribution.



The following table provides the maturity profile for these
available-for-sale fixed maturity securities. Securities not due to mature on a single date are allocated based on weighted average life.

Duration

A primary objective in the management of the investment portfolio is to optimize return relative to corresponding liabilities and respective liquidity needs. CNA’s views on the current interest rate
environment, tax regulations, asset class valuations, specific security issuer and broader industry segment conditions, and the domestic and global economic conditions, are some of the factors that enter into an investment decision. CNA also
continually monitors exposure to issuers of securities held and broader industry sector exposures and may from time to time adjust such exposures based on its views of a specific issuer or industry sector.

A further consideration in the management of the investment portfolio is the characteristics of the corresponding
liabilities and the ability to align the duration of the portfolio to those liabilities and to meet future liquidity needs, minimize interest rate risk and maintain a level of income sufficient to support the underlying insurance liabilities. For
portfolios where future liability cash flows are determinable and typically long term in nature, CNA segregates investments for asset/liability management purposes. The segregated investments support the liabilities in Life & Group Non-Core
including annuities, structured settlements and long term care products.

The effective durations of fixed
maturity securities, short term investments and interest rate derivatives are presented in the table below. Short term investments are net of accounts payable and receivable amounts for securities purchased and sold, but not yet settled.

The investment portfolio is periodically analyzed for changes in duration and related
price change risk. Additionally, CNA periodically reviews the sensitivity of the portfolio to the level of foreign exchange rates and other factors that contribute to market price changes. A summary of these risks and specific analysis on changes is
included in Item 7A – Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk included herein.



Short Term Investments

The carrying value of the components of CNA’s short term investment portfolio is presented in the following table:

European Exposure

CNA’s fixed maturity portfolio includes European exposure. The following table summarizes European exposure included within fixed maturity holdings:

European exposure is based on application of a country of risk methodology. Country of
risk is derived from the issuing entity’s management location, country of primary listing, revenue and reporting currency. As of December 31, 2012, securities with a fair value and amortized cost of $2.0 billion and $1.8 billion relate to
Eurozone countries, which consist of member states of the European Union that use the Euro as their national currency. Of this amount, securities with a fair value and amortized cost of $324 million and $298 million pertain to Greece, Italy,
Ireland, Portugal and Spain.

the date of this Report and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update these statements to reflect any change in our expectations or beliefs or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any forward-looking
statement is based.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

We are a large diversified holding company. As such, we and our subsidiaries have significant amounts of
financial instruments that involve market risk. Our measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair value of our financial instruments. Changes in the trading portfolio are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of
Income. Market risk exposure is presented for each class of financial instrument held by us at December 31, assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described below. We believe that the various rates of adverse market
movements represent a measure of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions. The estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any
expected actual loss, even under adverse conditions, because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ. In addition, since our investment portfolio is subject to change based on our portfolio management strategy as well as in response to
changes in the market, these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results which may occur.

Exposure to market risk is managed and monitored by senior management. Senior management approves our overall investment
strategy and has responsibility to ensure that the investment positions are consistent with that strategy with an acceptable level of risk. We may manage risk by buying or selling instruments or entering into offsetting positions.

Interest Rate Risk – We have exposure to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of
interest rates. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk by utilizing instruments such as interest rate swaps, commitments to purchase securities, options, futures and forwards. We monitor our sensitivity to interest rate changes by
revaluing financial assets and liabilities using a variety of different interest rates. The Company uses duration and convexity at the security level to estimate the change in fair value that would result from a change in each security’s yield.
Duration measures the price sensitivity of an asset to changes in the yield rate. Convexity measures how the duration of the asset changes with interest rates. The duration and convexity analysis takes into account the unique characteristics (e.g.,
call and put options and prepayment expectations) of each security, in determining the hypothetical change in fair value. The analysis is performed at the security level and is aggregated up to the asset category level.

The evaluation is performed by applying an instantaneous change in the yield rates by varying magnitudes on a static
balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in rates would have on the recorded market value of our investments and the resulting effect on shareholders’ equity. The analysis presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial
instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices which we believe are reasonably possible over a one year period.

The sensitivity analysis estimates the change in the fair value of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities that were held on December 31, 2012 and 2011 due to an instantaneous change in the
yield of the security at the end of the period of 100 basis points, with all other variables held constant.

The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest
rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Accordingly, the analysis may not be indicative of, is not intended to provide, and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes of market interest
rates on our earnings or shareholders’ equity. Further, the computations do not contemplate any actions we could undertake in response to changes in interest rates.

Our debt is denominated in U.S. Dollars and has been primarily issued at fixed rates, therefore, interest expense would
not be impacted by interest rate shifts. The impact of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on fixed rate debt would result in a decrease in market value of $498 million and $455 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011. The impact of a
100 basis point decrease would result in an increase in market value of $543 million and $505 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011. HighMount has entered into interest rate swaps for a notional amount of



$300 million to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in LIBOR on a portion of its $600 million variable rate credit facility. These swaps effectively fix the interest rate at an effective rate of
3.4%. At December 31, 2012, the impact of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on variable rate debt would increase interest expense by approximately $9 million on an annual basis.

Equity Price Risk – We have exposure to equity price risk as a result of our investment in equity securities and
equity derivatives. Equity price risk results from changes in the level or volatility of equity prices which affect the value of equity securities or instruments that derive their value from such securities or indexes. Equity price risk was measured
assuming an instantaneous 25% decrease in the underlying reference price or index from its level at December 31, 2012 and 2011, with all other variables held constant. A model was developed to analyze the observed changes in the value of
limited partnerships held by the Company over a multiple year period along with the corresponding changes in various equity indices. The result of the model allowed us to estimate the change in value of limited partnerships when equity markets
decline by 25%.

Foreign Exchange Rate Risk – Foreign exchange rate risk arises from the possibility that
changes in foreign currency exchange rates will impact the value of financial instruments. We have foreign exchange rate exposure when we buy or sell foreign currencies or financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency, which is reduced
through the use of forward contracts. Our foreign transactions are primarily denominated in Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, British pounds, Brazilian reais and the European Monetary Unit. The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 20%
decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar from their levels at December 31, 2012 and 2011, with all other variables held constant.

Commodity Price Risk – We have exposure to price risk as a result of our investments in commodities. Commodity price
risk results from changes in the level or volatility of commodity prices that impact instruments which derive their value from such commodities. Commodity price risk was measured assuming an instantaneous increase of 20% from their levels at
December 31, 2012 and 2011. The impact of a change in commodity prices on the Company’s non-trading commodity-based financial derivative instruments at a point in time is not necessarily representative of the results that will be realized
when such contracts are ultimately settled. Net losses from commodity derivative instruments used for hedging purposes, to the extent realized, will generally be offset by recognition of the underlying hedged transaction, such as revenue from sales.

Credit Risk – We are exposed to credit risk relating to the risk of loss resulting from the
nonperformance by a customer of its contractual obligations. Although nearly all of the Company’s customers pay for its services on a timely basis, the Company actively monitors the credit exposure to its customers. Certain of the
Company’s subsidiaries may perform credit reviews of customers and may require customers to provide cash collateral, post a letter of credit, prepay for services or provide other credit enhancements.



The following tables present our market risk by category (equity prices,
interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices) on the basis of those entered into for trading purposes and other than trading purposes.

Trading portfolio:

Note:

The calculation of estimated market risk exposure is based on assumed adverse changes in the underlying reference price or index of (1) a decrease in equity
prices of 25% and (2) a decrease in yield rates of 100 basis points. Adverse changes on options which differ from those presented above would not necessarily result in a proportionate change to the estimated market risk
exposure.

Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data are comprised of the following sections:



MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for us. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation
of published financial statements.

There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any control system,
however well designed, including the possibility of human error and the possible circumvention or overriding of controls. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls
must be considered relative to their costs. Management must make judgments with respect to the relative cost and expected benefits of any specific control measure. The design of a control system also is based in part upon assumptions and judgments
made by management about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that a control will be effective under all potential future conditions. As a result, even an effective system of internal control over financial reporting can
provide no more than reasonable assurance with respect to the fair presentation of financial statements and the processes under which they were prepared.

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

. Based on this assessment, our management believes that, as of December 31, 2012, our internal control over financial reporting was
effective.

Our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued an
audit report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The report of Deloitte & Touche LLP follows this Report.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Loews Corporation

New York, NY

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Loews Corporation and subsidiaries (the
“Company”) as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control
over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012 of the Company and our report dated February 22, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedules and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the change of accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts in 2012.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Loews Corporation

New York, NY

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Loews Corporation and subsidiaries (the
“Company”) as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012. Our audits also
included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Loews Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such
financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company changed its accounting for costs
associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts in 2012.

We have also audited, in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 22, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of presentation

– Loews Corporation is a holding company. Its subsidiaries are
engaged in the following lines of business: commercial property and casualty insurance (CNA Financial Corporation (“CNA”), a 90% owned subsidiary); the operation of offshore oil and gas drilling rigs (Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.
(“Diamond Offshore”), a 50.4% owned subsidiary); transportation and storage of natural gas and natural gas liquids and gathering and processing of natural gas (Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP (“Boardwalk Pipeline”), a 55% owned
subsidiary); exploration, production and marketing of natural gas and oil (including condensate and natural gas liquids), (HighMount Exploration & Production LLC (“HighMount”), a wholly owned subsidiary); and the operation of
hotels (Loews Hotels Holding Corporation (“Loews Hotels”), a wholly owned subsidiary). Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “Company,” “Loews” and “Registrant” as used herein mean Loews Corporation
excluding its subsidiaries and the term “Net income (loss) attributable to Loews Corporation” as used herein means Net income (loss) attributable to Loews Corporation Shareholders.

Principles of consolidation

– The Consolidated Financial Statements include all subsidiaries and intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The equity method of accounting is used for investments in associated companies in which the Company generally has an interest of 20% to 50%.

Accounting estimates

– The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Accounting changes

– In October of 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) issued updated accounting guidance which limits the capitalization of costs incurred to acquire or renew insurance contracts to those that are incremental direct costs of successful contract acquisitions. The previous
guidance allowed the capitalization of acquisition costs that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance contracts, whether the costs related to successful or unsuccessful efforts.

As of January 1, 2012, the Company adopted the updated accounting guidance prospectively as of January 1, 2004,
the earliest date practicable. Due to the lack of available historical data related to certain accident and health contracts issued prior to January 1, 2004, a full retrospective application of the change in accounting guidance was
impracticable. Acquisition costs capitalized prior to January 1, 2004 will continue to be accounted for under the previous accounting guidance and will be amortized over the premium-paying period of the related policies using assumptions
consistent with those used for computing future policy benefit reserves for such contracts.

The Company has
adjusted its previously reported financial information included herein to reflect the change in accounting guidance for deferred acquisition costs. The impacts of adopting the new accounting standard on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet
as of December 31, 2011 were a $106 million decrease in Deferred acquisition costs of insurance subsidiaries and a $37 million decrease in Deferred income tax liabilities. The impacts to Accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”)
and Additional paid-in capital (“APIC”) were the result of the indirect effects of the Company’s adoption of this guidance on Shadow Adjustments, as further discussed below, and CNA’s acquisition of the noncontrolling interest of
CNA Surety in 2011.

The impacts on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended
December 31, 2011 and 2010 were $234 million and $219 million decreases in Amortization of deferred acquisition costs, $242 million and $219 million increases in Other operating expenses, resulting in a $2 million decrease and a $1 million
increase in Net income and a $0.01 decrease and no impact in Basic and Diluted net income per share. There were no changes to net cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities for the comparative periods presented as a result of the
adoption of the new accounting standard.

Investments

– The Company classifies its fixed maturity
securities and equity securities as either available-for-sale or trading, and as such, they are carried at fair value. Short term investments are carried at fair value. Changes



in fair value of trading securities are reported within Net investment income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Changes in fair value related to available-for-sale securities are reported
as a component of Other comprehensive income. The cost of fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, which are included in Net investment income on the
Consolidated Statements of Income. Losses may be recognized within the Consolidated Statements of Income when a decline in value is determined by the Company to be other-than-temporary.

To the extent that unrealized gains on fixed income securities supporting long term care products and payout annuity
contracts would result in a premium deficiency if those gains were realized, a related decrease in Deferred acquisition costs and/or increase in Insurance reserves is recorded, net of tax and noncontrolling interests, as a reduction of net
unrealized gains through Other comprehensive income (“Shadow Adjustments”). For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, Shadow Adjustments, net of participating policyholders’ interest, of $710 million and $515 million were
recorded (after tax and noncontrolling interests). At December 31, 2012 and 2011, net unrealized gains on investments included in AOCI were correspondingly reduced by $1.4 billion and $650 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests).

For asset-backed securities included in fixed maturity securities, the Company recognizes income using an
effective yield based on anticipated prepayments and the estimated economic life of the securities. When estimates of prepayments change, the effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments to date and anticipated future payments. The
amortized cost of high credit quality securities is adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been applied since the acquisition of the securities. Such adjustments are reflected in Net investment income on the
Consolidated Statements of Income. Interest income on lower rated securities is determined using the prospective yield method.

The Company’s carrying value of investments in limited partnerships is its share of the net asset value of each partnership, as determined by the General Partner. Certain partnerships for which
results are not available on a timely basis are reported on a lag, primarily three months or less. These investments are accounted for under the equity method and changes in net asset values are recorded within Net investment income on the
Consolidated Statements of Income.

Investments in derivative securities are carried at fair value with
changes in fair value reported as a component of Investment gains (losses), Income (loss) from trading portfolio, or Other comprehensive income (loss), depending on their hedge designation. A derivative is typically defined as an instrument whose
value is “derived” from an underlying instrument, index or rate, has a notional amount, requires little or no initial investment and can be net settled. Derivatives include, but are not limited to, the following types of
investments: interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, put and call options, warrants, futures, forwards, commitments to purchase securities, credit default swaps and combinations of the foregoing. Derivatives embedded within
non-derivative instruments (such as call options embedded in convertible bonds) must be split from the host instrument when the embedded derivative is not clearly and closely related to the host instrument.

Hedging

– The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as
well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Company also formally assesses (both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis) whether the derivatives that are used in hedging
transactions have been highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. When it is determined that a derivative for which
hedge accounting has been designated is not (or ceases to be) highly effective, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. See Note 5 for additional information on the Company’s use of derivatives.

Securities lending activities

– The Company lends securities for the purpose of enhancing income or to
finance positions to unrelated parties who have been designated as primary dealers by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Borrowers of these securities must deposit and maintain collateral with the Company of no less than 100% of the fair value of
the securities loaned. U.S. Government securities and cash are accepted as collateral. The Company maintains effective control over loaned securities and, therefore, continues to report such securities as investments on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets.



Securities lending is typically done on a matched-book basis where the
collateral is invested to substantially match the term of the loan. This matching of terms tends to limit risk. In accordance with the Company’s lending agreements, securities on loan are returned immediately to the Company upon notice.
Collateral is not reflected as an asset of the Company. There was no collateral held at December 31, 2012 and 2011.

Revenue recognition

– Premiums on property and casualty insurance contracts are recognized in proportion to the underlying risk insured which principally are earned ratably over the duration
of the policies. Premiums on long term care contracts are earned ratably over the policy year in which they are due. The reserve for unearned premiums represents the portion of premiums written relating to the unexpired terms of coverage.

Insurance receivables include balances due currently or in the future, including amounts due from insureds
related to losses under high deductible policies, and are presented at unpaid balances, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Amounts are considered past due based on policy payment terms. That allowance is determined based on periodic
evaluations of aged receivables, management’s experience and current economic conditions. Insurance receivables and any related allowance are written off after collection efforts are exhausted or a negotiated settlement is reached.

Property and casualty contracts that are retrospectively rated contain provisions that result in an adjustment to the
initial policy premium depending on the contract provisions and loss experience of the insured during the experience period. For such contracts, CNA estimates the amount of ultimate premiums that it may earn upon completion of the experience period
and recognizes either an asset or a liability for the difference between the initial policy premium and the estimated ultimate premium. CNA adjusts such estimated ultimate premium amounts during the course of the experience period based on actual
results to date. The resulting adjustment is recorded as either a reduction of or an increase to the earned premiums for the period.

Contract drilling revenue from dayrate drilling contracts is recognized as services are performed. In connection with such drilling contracts, Diamond Offshore may receive fees (either lump-sum or
dayrate) for the mobilization of equipment. These fees are earned as services are performed over the initial term of the related drilling contracts. Absent a contract, mobilization costs are recognized currently. From time to time, Diamond Offshore
may receive fees from its customers for capital improvements to their rigs. Diamond Offshore defers such fees received and recognizes these fees into revenue on a straight-line basis over the period of the related drilling contract. Diamond Offshore
capitalizes the costs of such capital improvements and depreciates them over the estimated useful life of the improvement.

Revenues from transportation and storage services are recognized in the period the service is provided based on contractual terms and the related transported and stored volumes. The majority of Boardwalk
Pipeline’s operating subsidiaries are subject to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) regulations and, accordingly, certain revenues collected may be subject to possible refunds to its customers. An estimated refund liability
is recorded considering regulatory proceedings, advice of counsel and estimated total exposure.

HighMount’s natural gas and oil production revenue is recognized based on actual volumes of natural gas and oil sold
to purchasers. Sales require delivery of the product to the purchaser, passage of title and probability of collection of purchaser amounts owed. Natural gas and oil production revenue is reported net of royalties. HighMount uses the sales method of
accounting for gas imbalances. An imbalance is created when the volumes of gas sold by HighMount pertaining to a property do not equate to the volumes produced to which HighMount is entitled based on its interest in the property. An asset or
liability is recognized to the extent that HighMount has an imbalance in excess of the remaining reserves on the underlying properties.

Claim and claim adjustment expense reserves

– Claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, except reserves for structured settlements not associated with asbestos and environmental pollution
(“A&EP”), workers’ compensation lifetime claims, and accident and health claims are not discounted and are based on (i) case basis estimates for losses reported on direct business, adjusted in the aggregate for ultimate loss
expectations; (ii) estimates of incurred but not reported losses; (iii) estimates of losses on assumed reinsurance; (iv) estimates of future expenses to be incurred in the settlement of claims; (v) estimates of salvage and
subrogation recoveries and (vi) estimates of amounts due from insureds related to losses under high deductible policies. Management considers current conditions and trends as well as past CNA and industry experience in establishing these
estimates. The



effects of inflation, which can be significant, are implicitly considered in the reserving process and are part of the recorded reserve balance. Ceded claim and claim adjustment expense reserves
are reported as a component of Receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Claim and claim adjustment
expense reserves are presented net of anticipated amounts due from insureds related to losses under deductible policies of $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2012 and 2011. A significant portion of these amounts are supported by
collateral. CNA also has an allowance for uncollectible deductible amounts, which is presented as a component of the allowance for doubtful accounts included in Receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Structured settlements have been negotiated for certain property and casualty insurance claims. Structured settlements
are agreements to provide fixed periodic payments to claimants. Certain structured settlements are funded by annuities purchased from Continental Assurance Company (“CAC”), a wholly owned and consolidated subsidiary of CNA, for which the
related annuity obligations are reported in Future policy benefits reserves. Obligations for structured settlements not funded by annuities are included in claim and claim adjustment expense reserves and carried at present values determined using
interest rates ranging from 7.1% to 9.7% at December 31, 2012 and 5.5% to 8.0% at December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the discounted reserves for unfunded structured settlements were $602 million and $632 million, net of
discount of $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion.

Workers’ compensation lifetime claim reserves are calculated
using mortality assumptions determined through statutory regulation and economic factors. Accident and health claim reserves are calculated using mortality and morbidity assumptions based on CNA and industry experience. Workers’ compensation
lifetime claim reserves and accident and health claim reserves are discounted at interest rates ranging from 3.0% to 6.5% at both December 31, 2012 and 2011. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, such discounted reserves totaled $2.2 billion and
$2.1 billion, net of discount of $837 million and $520 million.

Future policy benefits reserves

–
Reserves for long term care products and payout annuity contracts are computed using the net level premium method, which incorporates actuarial assumptions as to morbidity, mortality, persistency, discount rates, which are impacted by expected
investment yields and expenses. Expense assumptions include the estimated effects of expenses to be incurred beyond the premium paying period. Actuarial assumptions generally vary by plan, age at issue and policy duration. The initial assumptions
are determined at issuance, include a margin for adverse deviation, and are locked in throughout the life of the contract unless a premium deficiency develops. If a premium deficiency emerges, the assumptions are unlocked and deferred acquisition
costs, if any, and the future policy benefit reserves are adjusted. Interest rates for long term care products range from 5.0% to 7.4% at December 31, 2012 and from 5.0% to 7.5% at December 31, 2011. Interest rates for payout annuity
contracts range from 5.0% to 8.7% at December 31, 2012 and from 5.4% to 7.5% at December 31, 2011. In 2012, CNA unlocked assumptions related to its payout annuity contracts due to anticipated adverse changes in discount rates, which
reflect the current low interest rate environment and its view of expected investment yields, resulting in loss recognition which increased insurance liabilities by $33 million. In 2011, CNA unlocked assumptions related to its payout annuity
contracts due to anticipated adverse changes in mortality and discount rates resulting in loss recognition which increased insurance reserves by $166 million.

Policyholders’ funds reserves

– Policyholders’ funds reserves primarily include reserves for investment contracts without life contingencies. For these contracts, policyholder
liabilities are generally equal to the accumulated policy account values, which consist of an accumulation of deposit payments plus credited interest, less withdrawals and amounts assessed through the end of the period.

Guaranty fund and other insurance-related assessments

– Liabilities for guaranty fund and other
insurance-related assessments are accrued when an assessment is probable, when it can be reasonably estimated, and when the event obligating the entity to pay an imposed or probable assessment has occurred. Liabilities for guaranty funds and other
insurance-related assessments are not discounted and are included as part of Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the liability balances were $143 million and $152 million. As of
December 31, 2012 and 2011, included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $2 million of related assets for premium tax offsets. This asset is limited to the amount that is able to be offset against premium tax on future
premium collections from business written or committed to be written.



Reinsurance

– Reinsurance accounting allows for contractual cash
flows to be reflected as premiums and losses. To qualify for reinsurance accounting, reinsurance agreements must include risk transfer. To meet risk transfer requirements, a reinsurance contract must include both insurance risk, consisting of
underwriting and timing risk, and a reasonable possibility of a significant loss for the assuming entity.

Reinsurance receivables related to paid losses are presented at unpaid balances. Reinsurance receivables related to
unpaid losses are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves. Reinsurance receivables are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets. The cost of reinsurance is primarily accounted for over the life of the underlying reinsured policies using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the underlying policies or over the reinsurance contract period. The ceding of
insurance does not discharge the primary liability of CNA.

CNA has established an allowance for doubtful
accounts on reinsurance receivables which relates to both amounts already billed on ceded paid losses as well as ceded reserves that will be billed when losses are paid in the future. The allowance for doubtful accounts on reinsurance receivables is
estimated on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from reinsurers, reinsurer solvency, management’s experience and current economic conditions. Reinsurer financial strength ratings are updated and reviewed on an annual basis or
sooner if CNA becomes aware of significant changes related to a reinsurer. Because billed receivables are generally 5% or less of total reinsurance receivables, the age of the reinsurance receivables related to paid losses is not a significant input
into the allowance analysis. Changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts on reinsurance receivables are presented as a component of Insurance claims and policyholders’ benefits on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Amounts are considered past due based on the reinsurance contract terms. Reinsurance receivables related to paid losses
and any related allowance are written off after collection efforts have been exhausted or a negotiated settlement is reached with the reinsurer. Reinsurance receivables related to paid losses from insolvent insurers are written off when the
settlement due from the estate can be reasonably estimated. At the time reinsurance receivables related to paid losses are written off, any required adjustment to reinsurance receivables related to unpaid losses is recorded as a component of
Insurance claims and policyholders’ benefits on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Reinsurance
contracts that do not effectively transfer the economic risk of loss on the underlying policies are recorded using the deposit method of accounting, which requires that premium paid or received by the ceding company or assuming company be accounted
for as a deposit asset or liability. CNA had $3 million and $18 million recorded as deposit assets at December 31, 2012 and 2011, and $125 million and $123 million recorded as deposit liabilities at December 31, 2012 and 2011. Income on
reinsurance contracts accounted for under the deposit method is recognized using an effective yield based on the anticipated timing of payments and the remaining life of the contract. When the anticipated timing of payments changes, the effective
yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments to date and the estimated timing of future payments. The deposit asset or liability is adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been applied since the inception of
the contract.

Participating insurance

– Policyholder dividends are accrued using an estimate of
the amount to be paid based on underlying contractual obligations under policies and applicable state laws. Limitations exist on the amount of income from participating life insurance contracts that may be distributed to shareholders, and therefore
the share of income on these policies that cannot be distributed to shareholders is excluded from Shareholders’ Equity by a charge to Income and Other comprehensive income and the establishment of a corresponding liability.

Deferred acquisition costs

– Acquisition costs include commissions, premium taxes and certain underwriting
and policy issuance costs which are incremental direct costs of successful contract acquisitions. Deferred acquisition costs related to long term care contracts issued prior to January 1, 2004 include costs which vary with and are primarily
related to the acquisition of business, as further discussed above.

Acquisition costs related to property and
casualty business are deferred and amortized ratably over the period the related premiums are earned.

Deferred acquisition costs related to long term care contracts are amortized over the premium-paying period of the
related policies using assumptions consistent with those used for computing future policy benefit reserves for such contracts. Assumptions are made at the date of policy issuance or acquisition and are consistently applied during the



lives of the contracts. Deviations from estimated experience are included in results of operations when they occur. For these contracts, the amortization period is typically the estimated life of
the policy. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, deferred acquisition costs were presented net of Shadow Adjustments of $369 million and $398 million.

CNA evaluates deferred acquisition costs for recoverability. Anticipated investment income is considered in the determination of the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs. Adjustments, if
necessary, are recorded in current results of operations.

Deferred acquisition costs are presented net of
ceding commissions and other ceded acquisition costs. Unamortized deferred acquisition costs relating to contracts that have been substantially changed by a modification in benefits, features, rights or coverages that were not anticipated in the
original contract are not deferred and are included as a charge to operations in the period during which the contract modification occurred.

Investments in life settlement contracts and related revenue recognition

– Prior to 2002, CNA purchased investments in life settlement contracts. A life settlement contract is a contract
between the owner of a life insurance policy (the policy owner) and a third party investor (investor). Under a life settlement contract, CNA obtained the ownership and beneficiary rights of an underlying life insurance policy.

CNA accounts for its investments in life settlement contracts using the fair value method. Under the fair value method,
each life settlement contract is carried at its fair value at the end of each reporting period. The change in fair value, life insurance proceeds received and periodic maintenance costs, such as premiums, necessary to keep the underlying policy in
force, are recorded in Other revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The fair value of CNA’s investments in life settlement contracts were $100 million and $117 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, and are included in Other
assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The cash receipts and payments related to life settlement contracts are included in Cash flows from operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

The following table details the values for life settlement contracts. The determination of fair value is discussed in
Note 4.

CNA uses an actuarial model to estimate the aggregate face amount of life insurance that
is expected to mature in each future year and the corresponding fair value. This model projects the likelihood of the insured’s death for each inforce policy based upon CNA’s estimated mortality rates, which may vary due to the relatively
small size of the portfolio of life settlement contracts. The number of life settlement contracts presented in the table above is based upon the average face amount of inforce policies estimated to mature in each future year.

The increase in fair value recognized for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 on contracts still being
held was $11 million, $5 million and $10 million. The gains recognized during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 on contracts that settled were $42 million, $28 million and $19 million.

Separate Account Business

– Separate account assets and liabilities represent contract holder funds related
to investment and annuity products for which the policyholder assumes substantially all the risk and reward. The assets



are segregated into accounts with specific underlying investment objectives and are legally segregated from CNA. All assets of the separate account business are carried at fair value with an
equal amount recorded for separate account liabilities. Fee income accruing to CNA related to separate accounts is primarily included within Other revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

A number of separate account pension deposit contracts guarantee principal and an annual minimum rate of interest. If
aggregate contract value in the separate account exceeds the fair value of the related assets, an additional Policyholders’ funds liability is established. During 2012 and 2010, CNA decreased this pretax Policyholders’ funds liability by
$20 million and $24 million. CNA increased this pretax Policyholders’ funds liability by $18 million in 2011. Certain of these contracts are subject to a fair value adjustment if terminated by the policyholder.

Goodwill

– Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets of acquired
entities. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or when certain triggering events require additional tests. In 2012, Boardwalk Pipeline changed the date of its annual goodwill impairment test from December 31 to November 30. The
change is preferable as it better aligns Boardwalk Pipeline’s goodwill impairment testing procedures with its planning process and alleviates resource constraints in connection with its year-end closing and financial reporting process. Due to
significant judgments and estimates that are utilized in an impairment analysis, Boardwalk Pipeline determined it was impracticable to objectively determine operating and valuation estimates prior to November 30, 2012. As a result, the change
in accounting principle was prospectively applied from November 30, 2012 and does not delay, accelerate, or avoid an impairment charge.

As a result of impairments of its Natural gas and oil properties (see Note 7), which were caused by declines in natural gas and natural gas liquids (“NGL”) prices, HighMount tested its goodwill
for impairment at December 31, 2012. No impairment charge was required.

Property, plant and
equipment

– Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization (“DD&A”). Depreciation is computed principally by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives
of the various classes of properties. Leaseholds and leasehold improvements are depreciated or amortized over the terms of the related leases (including optional renewal periods where appropriate) or the estimated lives of improvements, if less than
the lease term.

The principal service lives used in computing provisions for depreciation are as follows:

HighMount follows the full cost method of accounting for natural gas and oil exploration
and production activities. Under the full cost method, all direct costs of property acquisition, exploration and development activities are capitalized. These capitalized costs are subject to a quarterly ceiling test. Under the ceiling test, amounts
capitalized are limited to the present value of estimated future net revenues to be derived from the anticipated production of proved natural gas and oil reserves, assuming an average price during the twelve month period adjusted for cash flow
hedges in place, and limiting the classification of proved undeveloped reserves to locations scheduled to be drilled within five years. If net capitalized costs exceed the ceiling test at the end of any quarterly period, then a permanent write-down
of the assets must be recognized in that period. A write-down may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher natural gas and oil prices may subsequently increase the ceiling. Approximately 5.8% (unaudited) of HighMount’s total proved
reserves as of December 31, 2012 are hedged by qualifying cash flow hedges, for which hedge adjusted prices were used to calculate estimated future net revenue. Future cash flows associated with settling asset retirement obligations that have
been accrued in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are excluded from HighMount’s calculations of discounted cash flows under the full cost ceiling test.

Depletion of natural gas and oil producing properties is computed using the units-of-production method. Under the full cost method, the base of costs subject to depletion also includes estimated future
costs to be incurred in developing proved natural gas and oil reserves, as well as capitalized asset retirement costs, net of projected salvage values. The costs of investments in unproved properties including associated exploration-related costs
are initially



excluded from the depletable base. As the unproved properties are evaluated, a ratable portion of the capitalized costs is periodically reclassified to the depletable base, determined on a
property by property basis, over the terms of underlying leases. Once a property has been completely evaluated, any remaining capitalized costs are then transferred to the depletable base. In addition, proceeds from the sale or other disposition of
natural gas and oil properties are accounted for as reductions of capitalized cost, unless the sale would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves, in which case, a gain or loss is recognized.

Impairment of long-lived assets

– The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment when changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets and intangibles with finite lives, under certain circumstances, are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value. Assets to be disposed
of and assets not expected to provide any future service potential to the Company are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.

Income taxes

– The Company and its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated tax return. Deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax
return bases of assets and liabilities, based on enacted tax rates and other provisions of the tax law. The effect of a change in tax laws or rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period in which such change is
enacted. Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not, and a valuation allowance is established for any portion of a deferred tax asset that management believes may not be realized.

The Company recognizes uncertain tax positions that it has taken or expects to take on a tax return. The tax
benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. See Note 10 for additional
information on the provision for income taxes.

Pension and postretirement benefits

– The Company
recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of its defined benefit plans in Other assets or Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in funded status related to prior service costs and credits and actuarial gains and losses
are recognized in the year in which the changes occur through Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The Company measures its benefit plan assets and obligations at December 31. Annual service cost, interest cost, expected return on
plan assets, amortization of prior service costs and credits and amortization of actuarial gains and losses are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Stock based compensation

– The Company records compensation expense upon issuance of share-based payment
awards for all awards it grants, modifies, repurchases or cancels primarily on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, generally four years. The share-based payment awards are valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The
application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive in the valuation of these awards. These assumptions include the term that the awards are expected to be outstanding, an estimate of the volatility of
the underlying stock price, applicable risk-free interest rates and the dividend yield of the Company’s stock.

The Company recognized compensation expense that decreased net income by $13 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 the Company recognized
compensation expense that decreased net income by $12 million each year. Several of the Company’s subsidiaries also maintain their own stock option plans. The amounts reported above include the Company’s share of expense related to its
subsidiaries’ plans.

Net income Per Share

– Companies with complex capital structures are
required to present basic and diluted net income per share. Basic net income per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stock by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
Diluted net income per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock.

For each of the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, approximately 0.8 million potential shares
attributable to exercises under the Loews Corporation Stock Option Plan were included in the calculation of diluted net income per share. For those same periods, approximately 2.6 million, 2.0 million and 2.4 million Stock



Appreciation Rights (“SARs”) were not included in the calculation of diluted net income per share due to the exercise price being greater than the average stock price.

Foreign currency

– Foreign currency translation gains and losses are reflected in Shareholders’ equity
as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The Company’s foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheet accounts are translated at the exchange rates in effect at each year end and income statement accounts are translated at the
average exchange rates. Foreign currency transaction gains of $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 and foreign currency transaction losses of $5 million and $18 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were
included in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Regulatory accounting

– The majority of
Boardwalk Pipeline’s operating subsidiaries are regulated by FERC. GAAP for regulated entities requires Texas Gas Transmission, LLC (“Texas Gas”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Boardwalk Pipeline, to report certain assets and
liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the manner in which independent third party regulators establish rates. Accordingly, certain costs and benefits are capitalized as regulatory assets and liabilities in order to provide for recovery
from or refund to customers in future periods. Regulatory accounting is not applicable to Boardwalk Pipeline’s other FERC regulated entities.

Supplementary cash flow information

– Cash payments made for interest on long term debt, net of capitalized interest, amounted to $450 million, $526 million and $494 million for the years
ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. Cash payments for federal, foreign, state and local income taxes amounted to $120 million, $322 million and $378 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. Investing activities
exclude $35 million and $14 million of accrued capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2010 investing activities include $51 million of previously accrued capital expenditures.

Note 2.  Acquisition/Divestitures

CNA Financial

On July 2, 2012, CNA acquired Hardy Underwriting Bermuda Limited (“Hardy”), a specialized Lloyd’s of London (“Lloyd’s”) underwriter. Through Lloyd’s syndicate 382,
Hardy underwrites primarily short-tail exposures in marine and aviation, non-marine property, specialty lines and property treaty reinsurance. Hardy has business operations in the United Kingdom, Bermuda, Bahrain, Guernsey and Singapore. For the
year ended December 31, 2011, Hardy reported gross written premiums of $430 million. The purchase price for Hardy was $231 million and resulted in CNA recording $55 million of identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets, $81 million of
identifiable finite-lived intangible assets and $35 million of goodwill.

In November of 2011, CNA completed
the sale of its 50% ownership interest in First Insurance Company of Hawaii (“FICOH”) and received $165 million in net proceeds. This sale did not have a significant impact on the Company’s results of operations.

On June 10, 2011, CNA completed the acquisition of all of the publicly traded shares of common stock of CNA Surety
Corporation (“CNA Surety”) for $475 million. Prior to the acquisition, CNA owned approximately 61% of the outstanding common stock of CNA Surety.

Boardwalk Pipeline

On October 1, 2012, a joint
venture between Boardwalk Pipeline and Boardwalk Pipelines Holding Corp. (“BPHC”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream LLC (“Louisiana Midstream”), a company that provides salt dome
storage, pipeline transportation, fractionation and brine supply services, from PL Logistics LLC for approximately $620 million. The acquisition was funded with proceeds from a $225 million five-year variable rate term loan and equity contributions
by BPHC of $269 million for a 65% equity interest and of $148 million by Boardwalk Pipeline for a 35% equity interest. The joint venture recorded $25 million of identifiable finite-lived intangible assets and $56 million of goodwill. On
October 15, 2012, Boardwalk Pipeline acquired BPHC’s 65% equity interest in the joint venture for $269 million, which did not result in any significant adjustments to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



In December of 2011, Boardwalk HP Storage Company, LLC (“HP
Storage”) acquired seven salt dome natural gas storage caverns and associated assets in Mississippi for approximately $550 million. HP Storage funded the acquisition with proceeds from a $200 million five-year variable rate term loan and equity
contributions from BPHC and Boardwalk Pipeline. BPHC contributed $280 million for an 80% interest in HP Storage and Boardwalk Pipeline contributed $70 million for a 20% interest. HP Storage recorded $52 million of goodwill and $14 million of
identifiable finite-lived intangible assets. In February of 2012, Boardwalk Pipeline acquired BPHC’s 80% interest in HP Storage for $285 million, which did not result in any significant adjustments to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

HighMount

In the fourth quarter of 2011, HighMount acquired working interests in oil and gas properties located in Oklahoma. The purchase price was approximately $106 million in cash and was included primarily in
the cost of unproved properties within Property, plant and equipment in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In
the second quarter of 2010, HighMount completed the sale of substantially all exploration and production assets located in the Antrim Shale in Michigan and the Black Warrior Basin in Alabama for approximately $530 million. These sales did not have a
material impact on the Consolidated Statements of Income. In accordance with the full cost method of accounting, proceeds from these sales were accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs.

Note 3.  Investments

Net investment income is as follows:

(a)

Includes net unrealized gains (losses) related to changes in fair value on trading securities still held of $6, $(58) and $88 for the years ended
December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

As of December 31, 2012, the Company held nine
non-income producing fixed maturity securities aggregating $1 million of fair value. As of December 31, 2011, the Company held nine non-income producing fixed maturity securities aggregating $3 million of fair value. As of December 31,
2012 and 2011, no investments in a single issuer exceeded 10% of shareholders’ equity other than investments in securities issued by the U.S. Treasury and obligations of government-sponsored enterprises.

Investment gains (losses) are as follows:



(a)

Includes gross realized gains of $251, $299 and $525 and gross realized losses of $191, $322 and $435 on available-for-sale securities for the years
ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

Net change in unrealized gains (losses) on
available-for-sale investments is as follows:

The components of other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) losses recognized in
earnings by asset type are as follows:

A security is impaired if the fair value of the security is less than its cost adjusted
for accretion, amortization and previously recorded OTTI losses, otherwise defined as an unrealized loss. When a security is impaired, the impairment is evaluated to determine whether it is temporary or other-than-temporary.

Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether an OTTI loss has occurred for a security. CNA follows a
consistent and systematic process for determining and recording an OTTI loss. CNA has established a committee responsible for the OTTI process. This committee, referred to as the Impairment Committee, is made up of three officers appointed by
CNA’s Chief Financial Officer. The Impairment Committee is responsible for evaluating all securities in an unrealized loss position on at least a quarterly basis.

The Impairment Committee’s assessment of whether an OTTI loss has occurred incorporates both quantitative and
qualitative information. Fixed maturity securities that CNA intends to sell, or it more likely than not will be required to sell before recovery of amortized cost, are considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired and the entire difference
between the amortized cost basis and fair value of the security is recognized as an OTTI loss in earnings. The remaining fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position are evaluated to determine if a credit loss exists. The factors
considered by the Impairment Committee include: (i) the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, (ii) whether the debtor is current on interest and principal payments, (iii) credit ratings of the



securities and (iv) general market conditions and industry or sector specific outlook. CNA also considers results and analysis of cash flow modeling for asset-backed securities, and when
appropriate, other fixed maturity securities.

The focus of the analysis for asset-backed securities is on
assessing the sufficiency and quality of underlying collateral and timing of cash flows based on scenario tests. If the present value of the modeled expected cash flows equals or exceeds the amortized cost of a security, no credit loss is judged to
exist and the asset-backed security is deemed to be temporarily impaired. If the present value of the expected cash flows is less than amortized cost, the security is judged to be other-than-temporarily impaired for credit reasons and that
shortfall, referred to as the credit component, is recognized as an OTTI loss in earnings. The difference between the adjusted amortized cost basis and fair value, referred to as the non-credit component, is recognized as OTTI in Other comprehensive
income. In subsequent reporting periods, a change in intent to sell or further credit impairment on a security whose fair value has not deteriorated will cause the non-credit component originally recorded as OTTI in Other comprehensive income to be
recognized as an OTTI loss in earnings.

CNA performs the discounted cash flow analysis using stressed
scenarios to determine future expectations regarding recoverability. For asset-backed securities, significant assumptions enter into these cash flow projections including delinquency rates, probable risk of default, loss severity upon a default,
over collateralization and interest coverage triggers and credit support from lower level tranches.

CNA
applies the same impairment model as described above for the majority of non-redeemable preferred stock securities on the basis that these securities possess characteristics similar to debt securities and that the issuers maintain their ability to
pay dividends. For all other equity securities, in determining whether the security is other-than-temporarily impaired, the Impairment Committee considers a number of factors including, but not limited to: (i) the length of time and the extent
to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost, (ii) the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, (iii) the intent and ability of CNA to retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an
anticipated recovery in value and (iv) general market conditions and industry or sector specific outlook.

The amortized cost and fair values of securities are as follows:



The available-for-sale securities in a gross unrealized loss position are as follows:



Based on current facts and circumstances, the Company believes the unrealized losses
presented in the table above are primarily attributable to broader economic conditions, changes in interest rates and credit spreads, market illiquidity and other market factors, but are not indicative of the ultimate collectibility of the current
amortized cost of the securities. The Company has no current intent to sell these securities, nor is it more likely than not that it will be required to sell prior to recovery of amortized cost; accordingly, the Company has determined that there are
no additional OTTI losses to be recorded at December 31, 2012.

The following table summarizes the
activity for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 related to the pretax credit loss component reflected in Retained earnings on fixed maturity securities still held at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 for which a portion of an
OTTI loss was recognized in Other comprehensive income.



Contractual Maturity

The following table summarizes available-for-sale fixed maturity securities by contractual maturity at December 31,
2012 and 2011. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because certain securities may be called or prepaid with or without call or prepayment penalties. Securities not due at a single date are allocated based on weighted average
life.

The carrying value of limited partnerships as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 was approximately $3.1 billion and $2.7 billion which includes undistributed earnings of $828 million and $607 million.
Limited partnerships comprising 74.0% of the total carrying value are reported on a current basis through December 31, 2012 with no reporting lag, 13.2% are reported on a one month lag and the remainder are reported on more than a one month
lag. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had 86 and 83 active limited partnership investments. The number of limited partnerships held and the strategies employed provide diversification to the limited partnership portfolio and the
overall invested asset portfolio.

Of the limited partnerships held, 84.1% at December 31, 2012 and 2011,
employ hedge fund strategies that generate returns through investing in securities that are marketable while engaging in various management techniques primarily in public fixed income and equity markets. These hedge fund strategies include both long
and short positions in fixed income, equity and derivative instruments. The hedge fund strategies may seek to generate gains from mispriced or undervalued securities, price differentials between securities, distressed investments, sector rotation or
various arbitrage disciplines. Within hedge fund strategies, approximately 52.3% were equity related, 27.1% pursued a multi-strategy approach, 16.8% were focused on distressed investments and 3.8% were fixed income related at December 31, 2012.

Limited partnerships representing 13.0% and 11.7% at December 31, 2012 and 2011 were invested in private
debt and equity. The remaining were invested in various other partnerships including real estate. The ten largest limited partnership positions held totaled $1.6 billion and $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2012 and 2011. Based on the most
recent information available regarding the Company’s percentage ownership of the individual limited partnerships, the carrying value reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets represents approximately 4.1% of the aggregate partnership equity
at December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related income reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Income represents approximately 3.3%, 3.9% and 3.5% of the changes in partnership equity for all limited partnership investments for the years
ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

While the Company generally does not invest in highly leveraged
partnerships, there are risks which may result in losses due to short-selling, derivatives or other speculative investment practices. The use of leverage increases volatility generated by the underlying investment strategies.

The Company’s limited partnership investments contain withdrawal provisions that generally limit liquidity for a
period of thirty days up to one year and in some cases do not permit withdrawals until the termination of the partnership. Typically, withdrawals require advance written notice of up to 90 days.



Investment Commitments

As of December 31, 2012, the Company had committed approximately $202 million to future capital calls from various
third party limited partnership investments in exchange for an ownership interest in the related partnerships.

As of December 31, 2012, the Company had mortgage loan commitments of $22 million representing signed loan
applications received and accepted.

The Company invests in various privately placed debt securities,
including bank loans, as part of its overall investment strategy and has committed to additional future purchases, sales and funding. As of December 31, 2012, the Company had commitments to purchase $185 million and sell $164 million of such
investments.

Investments on Deposit

Securities with carrying values of approximately $3.6 billion and $3.5 billion were deposited by CNA’s insurance subsidiaries under requirements of regulatory authorities and others as of
December 31, 2012 and 2011.

Cash and securities with carrying values of approximately $4 million and $5
million were deposited with financial institutions as collateral for letters of credit as of December 31, 2012 and 2011. In addition, cash and securities were deposited in trusts with financial institutions to secure reinsurance and other
obligations with various third parties. The carrying values of these deposits were approximately $277 million and $288 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011.

Note 4. Fair Value

Fair value is the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following fair value hierarchy is used in selecting inputs, with the highest priority given to Level 1, as these are the most transparent or reliable:

—

Level 1 – Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.

—

Level 2 – Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not
active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets.

—

Level 3 – Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are not observable.

Prices may fall within Level 1, 2 or 3 depending upon the methodologies and inputs used to
estimate fair value for each specific security. In general, the Company seeks to price securities using third party pricing services. Securities not priced by pricing services are submitted to independent brokers for valuation and, if those are not
available, internally developed pricing models are used to value assets using methodologies and inputs the Company believes market participants would use to value the assets.

The Company performs control procedures over information obtained from pricing services and brokers to ensure prices
received represent a reasonable estimate of fair value and to confirm representations regarding whether inputs are observable or unobservable. Procedures include (i) the review of pricing service or broker pricing methodologies,
(ii) back-testing, where past fair value estimates are compared to actual transactions executed in the market on similar dates, (iii) exception reporting, where changes in price, period-over-period, are reviewed and challenged with the
pricing service or broker based on exception criteria, (iv) detailed analyses, where the Company independently validates information regarding inputs and assumptions for individual securities and (v) pricing validation, where prices
received are compared to prices independently estimated by the Company.

The fair values of CNA’s life
settlement contracts are included in Other assets. Equity options purchased are included in Equity securities, and all other derivative assets are included in Receivables. Derivative liabilities are included in Payable to brokers. Assets and
liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized in the tables below:







The tables below present reconciliations for all assets and liabilities
measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011:



Net realized and unrealized gains and losses are reported in Net income as follows:



Securities shown in the Level 3 tables may be transferred in or out of Level
3 based on the availability of observable market information used to determine the fair value of the security. The availability of observable market information varies based on market conditions and trading volume and may cause securities to move in
and out of Level 3 from reporting period to reporting period. There were $106 million of transfers from Level 2 to Level 1 and $72 million of transfers from Level 1 to Level 2 during the year ended December 31, 2012. There were no significant
transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the year ended December 31, 2011. The Company’s policy is to recognize transfers between levels at the beginning of quarterly reporting periods.

Valuation Methodologies and Inputs

The following section describes the valuation methodologies and relevant inputs used to measure different financial instruments at fair value, including an indication of the level in the fair value
hierarchy in which the instruments are generally classified.

Fixed Maturity Securities

Fixed maturity securities are valued using methodologies that model information generated by market transactions
involving identical or comparable assets, as well as discounted cash flow methodologies. Common inputs include: prices from recently executed transactions of similar securities, broker/dealer quotes, benchmark yields, spreads off benchmark
yields, interest rates and U.S. Treasury or swap curves. Specifically for asset-backed securities, key inputs include prepayment and default projections based on past performance of the underlying collateral and current market data.

Level 1 securities include highly liquid U.S. and foreign government bonds, and redeemable preferred stock, valued using
quoted market prices. Level 2 securities include most other fixed maturity securities as the significant inputs are observable in the marketplace. Securities are generally assigned to Level 3 in cases where broker/dealer quotes are significant
inputs to the valuation and there is a lack of transparency as to whether these quotes are based on information that is observable in the marketplace. Level 3 securities also include tax-exempt auction rate certificates and private placement debt
securities. Fair value of auction rate securities is determined utilizing a pricing model with three primary inputs. The interest rate and spread inputs are observable from like instruments while the expected call date assumption is unobservable due
to the uncertain nature of principal prepayments prior to maturity and the credit spread adjustment that is security specific. Fair value of certain private placement debt securities is determined using internal models with inputs that are not
market observable.

Equity Securities

Level 1 equity securities include publicly traded securities valued using quoted market prices. Level 2 securities are primarily non-redeemable preferred stocks and common stocks valued using pricing for
similar securities, recently executed transactions, broker/dealer quotes and other pricing models utilizing market observable inputs. Level 3 securities are priced using internal models with inputs that are not market observable.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Exchange traded derivatives are valued using quoted market prices and are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Level 2 derivatives primarily include currency forwards valued using
observable market forward rates. Over-the-counter derivatives, principally interest rate swaps, total return swaps, commodity swaps, credit default swaps, equity warrants and options, are valued using inputs including broker/dealer quotes and are
classified within Level 2 or Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy, depending on the amount of transparency as to whether these quotes are based on information that is observable in the marketplace.

Short Term Investments

The valuation of securities that are actively traded or have quoted prices are classified as Level 1. These securities include money market funds and treasury bills. Level 2 primarily includes commercial
paper, for which all inputs are market observable. Fixed maturity securities purchased within one year of maturity are classified consistent with



fixed maturity securities discussed above. Short term investments as presented in the tables above differ from the amounts presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets because certain short term
investments, such as time deposits, are not measured at fair value.

Life Settlement Contracts

The fair values of life settlement contracts are determined as the present value of the anticipated death benefits less
anticipated premium payments based on contract terms that are distinct for each insured, as well as CNA’s own assumptions for mortality, premium expense, and the rate of return that a buyer would require on the contracts, as no comparable
market pricing data is available.

Separate Account Business

Separate account business includes fixed maturity securities, equities and short term investments. The valuation
methodologies and inputs for these asset types have been described above.

Significant Unobservable Inputs

The table below presents quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs utilized by the Company in
the fair value measurements of Level 3 assets. Valuations for assets and liabilities not presented in the table below are primarily based on broker/dealer quotes for which there is a lack of transparency as to inputs used to develop the valuations.
The quantitative detail of unobservable inputs from these broker quotes is neither provided nor reasonably available to the Company.

For fixed maturity securities, an increase to the expected call date assumption and
credit spread adjustment or decrease in the private offering price would result in a lower fair value measurement. For equity securities, an increase in the private offering price would result in a higher fair value measurement. For life settlement
contracts, an increase in the discount rate risk premium or decrease in the mortality assumption would result in a lower fair value measurement.



Financial Assets and Liabilities Not Measured at Fair Value

The carrying amount, estimated fair value and the level of the fair value hierarchy of the Company’s financial
instrument assets and liabilities which are not measured at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are listed in the tables below. The carrying amounts reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash and short term investments not
carried at fair value and certain other assets and liabilities approximate fair value due to the short term nature of these items.

The following methods and assumptions were used in estimating the fair value of these
financial assets and liabilities.

The fair values of mortgage loans were based on the present value of the
expected future cash flows discounted at the current interest rate for similar financial instruments, adjusted for specific loan risk.

Premium deposits and annuity contracts were valued based on cash surrender values or estimated fair values of policyholder liabilities, net of amounts ceded related to sold business.

Fair value of debt was based on observable market prices when available. When observable market prices were not
available, the fair value for debt was based on observable market prices of comparable instruments adjusted for differences between the observed instruments and the instruments being valued or is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based
on current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.



Note 5. Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivatives in the normal course of business, primarily in an attempt to reduce its
exposure to market risk (principally interest rate risk, credit risk, equity price risk, commodity price risk and foreign currency risk) stemming from various assets and liabilities. The Company’s principal objective under such strategies is to
achieve the desired reduction in economic risk, even if the position does not receive hedge accounting treatment.

The Company enters into interest rate swaps, futures and commitments to purchase securities to manage interest rate risk. Credit derivatives such as credit default swaps are entered into to modify the
credit risk inherent in certain investments. Forward contracts, futures, swaps and options are used primarily to manage foreign currency and commodity price risk.

In addition to the derivatives used for risk management purposes described above, the Company may also use derivatives
for purposes of income enhancement. Income enhancement transactions are entered into with the intention of providing additional income or yield to a particular portfolio segment or asset class. Income enhancement transactions include but are not
limited to interest rate swaps, call options, put options, credit default swaps, index futures and foreign currency forwards. See Note 4 for information regarding the fair value of derivative instruments.

A summary of the aggregate contractual or notional amounts and gross estimated fair values related to derivative
financial instruments follows. The contractual or notional amounts for derivatives are used to calculate the exchange of contractual payments under the agreements and may not be representative of the potential for gain or loss on these instruments.

For derivative financial instruments without hedge designation, changes in the fair value
of derivatives not held in a trading portfolio are reported in Investment gains (losses) and changes in the fair value of derivatives held for trading purposes are reported in Net investment income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Losses of
$5 million, $34 million and $31 million were recorded in Investment gains (losses) for the years ended December 31,



2012, 2011 and 2010. Losses of $19 million, $14 million and $75 million were included in Net investment income for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

The Company’s derivative financial instruments with cash flow hedge designation hedge variable price risk associated
with the purchase and sale of natural gas and other energy-related products, exposure to foreign currency losses on future foreign currency expenditures, as well as risks attributable to changes in interest rates on long term debt. Gains of $43
million, $33 million and $87 million were recognized in OCI related to these cash flow hedges for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. Gains of $54 million and losses of $28 million and $11 million were reclassified from AOCI into
income for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. As of December 31, 2012, the estimated amount of net unrealized gains associated with these cash flow hedges that will be reclassified from AOCI into earnings during the next
twelve months was $34 million. For each of the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the net amounts recognized due to ineffectiveness were less than $1 million.

Note 6. Receivables

Note 7.  Property, Plant and Equipment



DD&A expense and capital expenditures are as follows:

Capitalized interest related to the construction and upgrade of qualifying assets
amounted to approximately $55 million, $31 million and $23 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

Pipeline
Equipment

In October of 2012, Boardwalk Pipeline acquired Louisiana Midstream, a company that provides
salt dome storage, pipeline transportation, fractionation and brine supply services for approximately $620 million, of which $550 million was allocated to Pipeline equipment.

In December of 2011, HP Storage acquired seven salt dome natural gas storage caverns and associated assets in Mississippi
for approximately $550 million of which $487 million was allocated to Pipeline equipment. See Note 2 for additional information related to these purchases.

Offshore Drilling Equipment

Purchase of Assets

In 2012 and 2011, Diamond Offshore recorded $251 million and $490 million in Construction in process for four new
ultra-deepwater drillships. Delivery is expected in the second and fourth quarters of 2013 and in the second and fourth quarters of 2014. In addition, Diamond Offshore recorded $235 million in Construction in process for two new deepwater floaters
in 2012. The rigs will be constructed utilizing the hulls of two of Diamond Offshore’s mid-water floaters. Delivery is expected for the third quarter of 2013 and in the second quarter of 2014.

Sale of Assets

In 2012, Diamond Offshore sold six jack-up rigs for total proceeds of $132 million, resulting in a pretax gain of approximately $76 million, recorded in Other revenues.

Asset Impairment

In 2012, Diamond Offshore decided to actively market for sale three mid-water rigs and one jack-up rig. The aggregate net book value of these rigs was transferred to Assets held for sale which is included
in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In connection with the reclassification, Diamond Offshore recorded an impairment charge of $62 million related to the three mid-water rigs. The fair value for each rig was measured using an
expected present value technique that utilizes significant unobservable inputs, representing a Level 3 fair value measurement, which includes assumptions for estimated proceeds that may be received on disposition of the rig and estimated costs to
sell. At December 31, 2012, these assets held for sale amounted to $12 million.



Natural Gas and Oil Proved and Unproved Properties

Impairment of Natural Gas and Oil Properties

In 2012, HighMount recorded non-cash ceiling test impairment charges of $680 million ($433 million after tax) related to the carrying value of its natural gas and oil properties. The impairments were
recorded within Other operating expenses and as credits to Accumulated DD&A. The write-downs were the result of declines in natural gas and NGL prices. Had the effects of HighMount’s cash flow hedges not been considered in calculating the
ceiling limitation, the impairments would have been $737 million ($469 million after tax).

Purchase of Assets

In the fourth quarter of 2011, HighMount paid $106 million to acquire working interests in oil and gas properties located
in Oklahoma. See Note 2 for additional information related to this purchase.

Costs Not Being Amortized

HighMount excludes from amortization the cost of unproved properties, the cost of exploratory wells in progress and major
development projects in progress. Natural gas and oil property and equipment costs not being amortized as of December 31, 2012, are as follows, by the year in which such costs were incurred:

As a result of the decline in natural gas and NGL prices, HighMount changed its drilling
program in 2012 to develop properties that produce primarily oil. As a result, during 2012, $130 million of costs associated with unevaluated natural gas prospects were reclassified as evaluated and included in the full cost pool subject to
depletion.

Note 8.  Claim and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves

CNA’s property and casualty insurance claim and claim adjustment expense reserves represent the
estimated amounts necessary to resolve all outstanding claims, including claims that are incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) as of the reporting date. CNA’s reserve projections are based primarily on detailed analysis of the facts
in each case, CNA’s experience with similar cases and various historical development patterns. Consideration is given to such historical patterns as field reserving trends and claims settlement practices, loss payments, pending levels of unpaid
claims and product mix, as well as court decisions, economic conditions including inflation and public attitudes. All of these factors can affect the estimation of claim and claim adjustment expense reserves.

Establishing claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, including claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for
catastrophic events that have occurred, is an estimation process. Many factors can ultimately affect the final settlement of a claim and, therefore, the necessary reserve. Changes in the law, results of litigation, medical costs, the cost of repair
materials and labor rates can all affect ultimate claim costs. In addition, time can be a critical part of reserving determinations since the longer the span between the incidence of a loss and the payment or settlement of the claim, the more
variable the ultimate settlement amount can be. Accordingly, short-tail claims, such as property damage claims, tend to be more reasonably estimable than long-tail claims, such as workers’ compensation, general liability and professional
liability claims. Adjustments to prior year reserve estimates, if necessary, are reflected in the results of operations in the period that the need for such adjustments is determined. There can be no assurance that CNA’s ultimate cost for
insurance losses will not exceed current estimates.

Catastrophes are an inherent risk of the property and
casualty insurance business and have contributed to material period-to-period fluctuations in CNA’s results of operations and/or equity. CNA reported catastrophe losses, net of



reinsurance, of $391 million, $222 million and $121 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. Catastrophe losses in 2012 related primarily to Storm Sandy and other U.S.
storms.

The table below provides a reconciliation between beginning and ending claim and claim adjustment
expense reserves, including claim and claim adjustment expense reserves of the life company:

(a)

Total net incurred above does not agree to Insurance claims and policyholders’ benefits as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income
due to amounts related to uncollectible reinsurance and loss deductible receivables, and benefit expenses related to future policy benefits and policyholders’ funds, which are not reflected in the table above.

The changes in provision for insured events of prior years (net prior year claim and claim adjustment expense reserve
development) were as follows:



The following tables summarize the gross and net carried reserves:

A&EP Reserves

On August 31, 2010, Continental Casualty Company (“CCC”) together with several of CNA’s insurance subsidiaries completed a transaction with National Indemnity Company
(“NICO”), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., under which substantially all of CNA’s legacy A&EP liabilities were ceded to NICO (“Loss Portfolio Transfer”).

Under the terms of the NICO transaction, effective January 1, 2010 CNA ceded approximately $1.6 billion of net
A&EP claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserves to NICO under a retroactive reinsurance agreement with an aggregate limit of $4.0 billion. Included in the $1.6 billion of net A&EP claim and allocated claim adjustment expense
reserves was approximately $90 million of net claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserves relating to CNA’s discontinued operations. The $1.6 billion of claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserves ceded to NICO was net of
$1.2 billion of ceded claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserves under existing third party reinsurance contracts. The NICO aggregate reinsurance limit also covers credit risk on the existing third party reinsurance related to these
liabilities.

CNA paid NICO a reinsurance premium of $2.0 billion and transferred to NICO billed third party
reinsurance receivables related to A&EP claims with a net book value of $215 million (net of an allowance of $100 million for doubtful accounts on billed third party reinsurance receivables, as discussed further below). As of August 31,
2010, NICO deposited approximately $2.2 billion in a collateral trust account as security for its obligations to CNA. NICO may reduce the collateral by the amount of net A&EP claim and allocated claim adjustment expense payments. In addition,
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. guaranteed the payment obligations of NICO up to the full aggregate reinsurance



limit as well as certain of NICO’s performance obligations under the trust agreement. NICO is responsible for claims handling and billing and collection from third party reinsurers related
to CNA’s A&EP claims.

The following table displays the impact of the Loss Portfolio Transfer on the
2010 Consolidated Statement of Income:

In connection with the transfer of billed third party reinsurance receivables related to
A&EP claims and the coverage of credit risk afforded under the terms of the Loss Portfolio Transfer, CNA reduced its allowance for doubtful accounts on billed third party reinsurance receivables and ceded claim and allocated claim adjustment
expense reserves by $200 million. This reduction is reflected in Other operating expenses presented above.

The Loss Portfolio Transfer is considered a retroactive reinsurance contract. In the event that the cumulative claim and
allocated claim adjustment expenses ceded under the Loss Portfolio Transfer exceed the consideration paid, the resulting gain from such excess would be deferred. A cumulative amortization adjustment would be recognized in earnings in the period such
excess arises so that the resulting deferred gain would reflect the balance that would have existed if the revised estimate was available at the inception date of the Loss Portfolio Transfer. This accounting generally results in a reserve charge
because of the timing difference between the recognition of the gross adverse reserve development and the related ceded reinsurance benefit. However, there is no economic impact as long as the additional losses are within the limit under the
contract.

The remaining amount available under the $4.0 billion aggregate limit of the Loss Portfolio
Transfer was $2.0 billion on an incurred basis at December 31, 2012. This incurred amount includes $399 million of adverse prior year development since the contract effective date of January 1, 2010. Any future adverse prior year
development in excess of approximately $230 million would put the Loss Portfolio Transfer into an overall gain position under retroactive reinsurance accounting. The net ultimate paid losses ceded under the Loss Portfolio Transfer were $661 million
through December 31, 2012. The fair value of the collateral trust account at December 31, 2012 was $2.5 billion.

Net Prior Year
Development

Changes in estimates of claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserves and premium
accruals, net of reinsurance, for prior years are defined as net prior year development. These changes can be favorable or unfavorable. The following tables and discussion include the net prior year development recorded for CNA Specialty, CNA
Commercial and Other segments for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. The net prior year development presented below includes premium development due to its direct relationship to claim and claim adjustment expense reserve
development. The net prior year development presented below also includes the impact of commutations and write-offs, but excludes the impact of increases or decreases in the allowance for doubtful accounts on reinsurance receivables. See Note 16 for
further discussion of the allowance for doubtful accounts on reinsurance receivables.



Favorable net prior year development of $11 million, $29 million and $2
million was recorded in the Life & Group Non-Core segment for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

For the year ended December 31, 2012, favorable premium development was recorded for
CNA Commercial primarily due to premium adjustments on auditable policies arising from increased exposures.

For the year ended December 31, 2011, favorable premium development was recorded for CNA Specialty primarily due to
changes in estimates of exposures in medical professional liability tail coverages. Unfavorable premium development for CNA Commercial was recorded due to a further reduction of ultimate premium estimates relating to retrospectively rated policies,
partially offset by premium adjustments on auditable policies due to increased exposures.

For the year ended
December 31, 2010, unfavorable premium development for CNA Commercial was recorded due to a change in ultimate premium estimates relating to retrospectively rated policies and return premium on auditable policies due to reduced exposures.



CNA Specialty

The following table and discussion provide further detail of the net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment
expense reserve development (“development”) recorded for the CNA Specialty segment:


Favorable development for medical professional liability was primarily due to better than expected loss emergence in accident years 2008 and prior.

Overall, favorable development for other professional liability was primarily due to better than expected loss emergence
in accident years 2003 through 2007. Unfavorable development was recorded in CNA’s lawyer coverages in accident years 2010 and 2011 primarily due to increased frequency and severity.

Favorable development for surety coverages was primarily due to better than expected loss emergence in accident years
2010 and prior.

Other includes standard property and casualty coverages provided to CNA Specialty customers.
Overall, favorable development for other coverages was primarily due to favorable loss emergence in property and workers’ compensation coverages in accident years 2005 and subsequent. Unfavorable development was recorded in accident year 2009
primarily due to an unfavorable outcome on an individual general liability claim.


Favorable development for medical professional liability was primarily due to favorable case incurred emergence in
nurses, physicians, excess institutions and primary institutions in accident years 2008 and prior.

Favorable
development for other professional liability was driven by better than expected loss emergence in the life agents, accountants, and architects & engineers business in accident years 2008 and prior. In addition, favorable development in
CNA’s European book of business was primarily due to favorable outcomes on several large losses in financial directors and officers (“D&O”) and errors and omissions (“E&O”) coverages in accident years 2003 and prior.

Favorable development for surety coverages was primarily due to a decrease in the estimated loss on a large
national contractor in accident year 2005 and better than expected loss emergence in accident years 2009 and prior.

Favorable development in warranty was driven by favorable policy year experience on an aggregate stop loss policy covering CNA’s non-insurance warranty subsidiary.

Unfavorable development for other coverages was primarily due to increased frequency of large claims in auto and
workers’ compensation coverages in accident years 2009 and 2010.




Overall, favorable development for medical professional liability was primarily due to lower than expected frequency of large losses, primarily in accident years 2007 and prior. This development amount
also included unfavorable development in accident years 2008 and 2009 due to increased frequency of large losses related to medical products.

Overall, favorable development for other professional liability was recorded primarily in accident years 2007 and prior in D&O and E&O coverages due to several factors, including reduced frequency
of large claims and the result of reviews of large claims. This development amount also included unfavorable development in employment practices liability, E&O and D&O coverages recorded in accident years 2008 and 2009, driven by the
economic recession and higher unemployment.

Favorable development for surety coverages was primarily due to a
decrease in the estimated loss on a large national contractor in accident year 2005 and lower than expected claim emergence in accident years 2008 and prior.

CNA Commercial

The following table and discussion
provides further detail of development recorded for the CNA Commercial segment:


Unfavorable development for commercial auto coverages was primarily due to higher than expected loss emergence in accident years 2007 and subsequent and higher than expected frequency in accident year
2011.

Overall, favorable development for general liability coverages was primarily due to better than
expected loss emergence in accident years 2006 and subsequent related to umbrella business and 2003 and prior related to large account business. Unfavorable development was recorded in accident years 2009 through 2011 related to several large
losses.

Overall, unfavorable development for workers’ compensation was primarily due to increased
medical severity in accident years 2010 and 2011 and the recognition of losses related to favorable premium development in accident year 2011. Favorable development was recorded in accident years 2001 and prior reflecting favorable experience.

Overall, favorable development for property and marine coverages was due to a favorable outcome on an
individual claim in accident year 2005 and favorable loss emergence in non-catastrophe losses in accident years 2009 and 2010. Unfavorable development was recorded in accident year 2011 related to several large losses.


Favorable development for commercial auto coverages was due to lower than expected severity on bodily injury claims and
favorable claim emergence on umbrella policies in accident years 2006 and prior.



Favorable development in the general liability coverages was primarily due
to favorable claim emergence in accident years 2007 and prior related to both primary and umbrella liability coverages.

Unfavorable development for workers’ compensation was related to increased medical severity in accident year 2010.

Overall, favorable development for property and other coverages was due to decreased frequency of large losses in
commercial multi-peril coverages primarily in accident year 2010, favorable loss emergence related to catastrophe claims in accident year 2008 and favorable loss emergence related to non-catastrophe claims in accident years 2010 and prior. This
development amount also included unfavorable development related to unallocated claim adjustment expenses.


Favorable development for commercial auto coverages was primarily due to lower than expected frequency and severity
trends in accident years 2009 and prior.

Overall, favorable development for general liability and umbrella
coverages was primarily due to better than expected loss emergence in accident years 2006 and prior. This development amount also included unfavorable development, primarily driven by increased claim frequency in accident years 2004 and prior for
excess workers’ compensation and in accident years 2008 and 2009 for a portion of CNA’s primary casualty surplus lines book. Unfavorable development was also recorded for accident years prior to 2001 related to mass tort claims, primarily
as a result of increased defense costs on specific mass tort accounts, including amounts related to unallocated claim adjustment expenses.

Unfavorable development in workers’ compensation was related to increased severity of indemnity losses relative to expectations on claims related to Defense Base Act contractors, primarily in
accident years 2008 and prior.

Favorable development was recorded for property and marine coverages.
Favorable development on catastrophe claims was due to lower than expected incurred loss emergence, primarily in accident years 2008 and 2009. Favorable non-catastrophe development was due to lower than expected severity in accident years 2009 and
prior. Favorable development in marine business was primarily due to decreased claim frequency and favorable cargo salvage recoveries in recent accident years as well as lower than expected severity for excess liability in accident years 2005 and
prior. Favorable property and marine development in CNA’s European operation was due to lower than expected frequency of large claims primarily in accident year 2009.

Note 9.  Leases

Leases cover office facilities, machinery and computer equipment. The Company’s hotels in some
instances are constructed on leased land. Rent expense amounted to $96 million, $91 million and $92 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. The table below presents the future minimum lease payments to be made under
non-cancelable operating leases along with lease and sublease minimum receipts to be received on owned and leased properties.



Note 10.  Income Taxes

The Company and its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. The Company
has entered into a separate tax allocation agreement with CNA, a majority-owned subsidiary in which its ownership exceeds 80%. The agreement provides that the Company will: (i) pay to CNA the amount, if any, by which the Company’s
consolidated federal income tax is reduced by virtue of inclusion of CNA in the Company’s return or (ii) be paid by CNA an amount, if any, equal to the federal income tax that would have been payable by CNA if it had filed a separate
consolidated return. The agreement may be canceled by either of the parties upon thirty days written notice.

For 2010 through 2012, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has accepted the Company into the Compliance
Assurance Process (“CAP”), which is a voluntary program for large corporations. Under CAP, the IRS conducts a real-time audit and works contemporaneously with the Company to resolve any issues prior to the filing of the tax return. The
Company believes this approach should reduce tax-related uncertainties, if any. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the Company believes that any adjustments resulting from audits will not have a material impact on its results of
operations, financial position and cash flows. The Company and/or its subsidiaries also file income tax returns in various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. These returns, with few exceptions, are no longer subject to examination by the
various taxing authorities before 2008.

Diamond Offshore, which is not included in the Company’s
consolidated federal income tax return, files income tax returns in the U.S. federal, various state and foreign jurisdictions. Diamond Offshore’s 2009 and 2011 U.S. federal income tax returns remain subject to examination. The 2010 federal
income tax return is currently under examination. Tax years that remain subject to examination by the various other jurisdictions include years 2003 to 2011.

The current and deferred components of income tax expense (benefit), excluding taxes on discontinued operations, are as follows:



The components of U.S. and foreign income before income tax and a
reconciliation between the federal income tax expense at statutory rates and the actual income tax expense is as follows:

(a)

Includes state and local taxes, adjustments to prior year estimates and other non-deductible expenses.

Provision has been made for the expected U.S. federal income tax liabilities applicable to undistributed earnings of
subsidiaries, except for certain subsidiaries for which the Company intends to invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely to finance foreign activities, or recover such undistributed earnings tax-free. The determination of the amount of the
unrecognized deferred tax liability on approximately $2.0 billion of undistributed earnings related to foreign subsidiaries is not practicable.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

At December 31, 2012 and 2011, there were $48 million and $41 million of tax
benefits related to Diamond Offshore that if recognized would affect the effective tax rate.

The Company
recognizes interest accrued related to: (i) unrecognized tax benefits in Interest expense and (ii) tax refund claims in Other revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company recognizes penalties in Income tax expense on the
Consolidated Statements of Income. Penalties and interest amounts recorded by the Company were insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.



The following table summarizes deferred tax assets and liabilities:

As of December 31, 2012, the Company has federal loss carryforwards with a tax
effect of approximately $40 million which expire in 2014 and 2032 and federal tax credit carryforwards of $100 million, of which $95 million expire between 2019 and 2022. Diamond Offshore has foreign operating loss carryforwards with a tax effect of
approximately $24 million, of which $8 million have an indefinite life with the remaining benefits expiring between 2013 and 2021.

Although realization of deferred tax assets is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the recognized deferred tax assets will be realized through recoupment of ordinary and
capital taxes paid in prior carryback years and through future earnings, reversal of existing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies.

The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law on January 2, 2013. The act extends, through 2013, several expired or expiring temporary business provisions, commonly referred to as
“extenders”, which are retroactively extended to the beginning of 2012. As required by GAAP, the effects of new legislation are recognized when signed into law. The Company expects to reduce the first quarter of 2013 tax expense by
approximately $28 million as a result of recognizing the 2012 effect of the extenders.



Note 11.  Debt



At December 31, 2012, the aggregate of long term debt maturing in each of the next
five years is approximately as follows: $19 million in 2013, $820 million in 2014, $948 million in 2015, $1,712 million in 2016, $1,104 million in 2017 and $4,653 million thereafter. Long term debt is generally redeemable in whole or in part at
the greater of the principal amount or the net present value of scheduled payments discounted at the specified treasury rate plus a margin.

CNA Financial

In April of 2012, CNA entered into a $250 million revolving credit agreement. The credit agreement which matures on April 19, 2016 bears interest at London Interbank Offered Rate plus applicable
margin and is intended to be used for general business purposes. At CNA’s election the commitments under the unsecured credit facility may be increased from time to time up to an additional aggregate amount of $100 million, and two one-year
extensions are available prior to first and second anniversary of the closing. As of December 31, 2012, there were no borrowings under the credit facility and CNA was in compliance with all covenants.

Diamond Offshore

In September of 2012, Diamond Offshore entered into a $750 million revolving credit agreement for general business purposes. The credit agreement, which matures on September 28, 2017, bears interest
at Diamond Offshore’s option on either an alternate base rate or Eurodollar rate, as defined in the credit agreement, plus an applicable margin. As of December 31, 2012, there were no borrowings under the credit facility and Diamond
Offshore was in compliance with all covenants.

Boardwalk Pipeline

In April of 2012, Boardwalk Pipeline entered into a Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement (“Amended
Credit Agreement”) with aggregate lending commitments of $1.0 billion. The Amended Credit Agreement has a maturity date of April 27, 2017. As of December 31, 2012, Boardwalk Pipeline had $302 million of loans outstanding under the
revolving credit facility with a weighted-average interest rate on the borrowings of 1.3% and had no letters of credit issued. As of December 31, 2012, Boardwalk Pipeline was in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility and had
available borrowing capacity of $698 million.

In June of 2012, Boardwalk Pipeline issued $300 million
principal amount of 4.0% senior notes due June 15, 2022.

In August of 2012, Boardwalk Pipeline repaid at
maturity the entire $225 million principal amount of its 5.8% senior notes. In September of 2012, Boardwalk Pipeline repaid in full its $200 million variable rate term loan due December 1, 2016.

In October of 2012, Boardwalk Pipeline entered into a $225 million variable rate term loan due October 1, 2017 to
fund the acquisition of Louisiana Midstream.



In November of 2012, Boardwalk Pipeline issued $300 million principal amount
of 3.4% senior notes due February 1, 2023. The proceeds were utilized to repay $100 million of borrowings under its subordinated loan agreement with BPHC and to reduce outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility.

Note 12.  Shareholders’ Equity

The components of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are as follows:



Subsidiary Equity Transactions

In February, August and October of 2012, Boardwalk Pipeline sold 9.2 million, 11.6 million and
11.2 million common units in public offerings and received net proceeds of $250 million, $318 million and $298 million, including $5 million, $7 million and $6 million contributions from us to maintain our 2% general partner interest. The
Company’s percentage ownership interest in Boardwalk Pipeline declined as a result of these transactions, from 64% to 55%. The issuance price of the common units exceeded the Company’s carrying value, resulting in an increase to APIC of
$115 million and an increase to AOCI of $5 million.

Treasury Share Repurchases

The Company repurchased 5.6 million, 18.2 million and 11.0 million shares of Loews common stock at
aggregate costs of $222 million, $718 million and $405 million during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. Upon retirement, treasury stock is eliminated through a reduction to common stock, APIC and retained earnings.

Note 13.  Statutory Accounting Practices

CNA’s insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in various jurisdictions. These subsidiaries prepare
statutory financial statements in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the respective jurisdictions’ insurance regulators. Domestic prescribed statutory accounting practices are set forth in a variety of publications
of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) as well as state laws, regulations and general administrative rules. These statutory accounting principles vary in certain respects from GAAP. In converting from statutory
accounting principles to GAAP, the more significant adjustments include deferral of policy acquisition costs and the inclusion of net unrealized holding gains or losses in shareholders’ equity relating to certain fixed maturity securities.

CNA’s ability to pay dividends and other credit obligations is significantly dependent on receipt of
dividends from CCC as it directly or indirectly owns all significant subsidiaries. The payment of dividends by CNA’s insurance subsidiaries without prior approval of the insurance department of each subsidiary’s domiciliary jurisdiction is
generally limited by formula. Dividends in excess of these amounts are subject to prior approval by the respective insurance regulator.

Dividends from CCC are subject to the insurance holding company laws of the State of Illinois, the domiciliary state of CCC. Under these laws, ordinary dividends, or dividends that do not require prior
approval by the Department, may be paid only from earned surplus, which is calculated by removing unrealized gains from unassigned surplus. As of December 31, 2012, CCC is in a positive earned surplus position, enabling CCC to pay approximately
$550 million of dividend payments during 2013 that would not be subject to the Department’s prior approval. The actual level of dividends paid in any year is determined after an assessment of available dividend capacity, holding company
liquidity and cash needs as well as the impact the dividends will have on the statutory surplus of the applicable insurance company.

CNA’s domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk-based capital requirements. Risk-based capital is a method developed by the NAIC to determine the minimum amount of statutory capital
appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile. The formula for determining the amount of risk-based capital specifies various factors, weighted based on the perceived
degree of risk, which are applied to certain financial balances and financial activity. The adequacy of a company’s actual capital is evaluated by a comparison to the risk-based capital results, as determined by the formula. Companies below
minimum risk-based capital requirements are classified within certain levels, each of which requires specified corrective action. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, all of CNA’s domestic insurance subsidiaries exceeded the minimum
risk-based capital requirements.

Subsidiaries with insurance operations outside the United States are also
subject to insurance regulation in the countries in which they operate. CNA has legal entity and branch operations in other countries, primarily the United Kingdom, Canada and Bermuda. CNA’s foreign legal entities and branch met or exceeded
their respective regulatory and other capital requirements.



Combined statutory capital and surplus and net income (loss), determined in
accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by insurance and/or other regulatory authorities for the Combined Continental Casualty Companies and the life company, were as follows:

(a)

Represents the combined statutory surplus of CCC and its subsidiaries, including the life company.

(b)

Information derived from the statutory-basis financial statements to be filed with insurance regulators.

The Hardy insurance entities are not owned by CCC, therefore their regulatory capital is not included in the Statutory
Capital and Surplus of the Combined Continental Casualty Companies presented in the table above. At December 31, 2012, Hardy’s capital requirement was approximately $330 million, which included $66 million of capital provided by CCC and
included in Combined Continental Casualty Companies’ Statutory Capital and Surplus above.

Note 14. Supplemental Natural Gas and Oil Information (Unaudited)

Users of this information should be aware that the process of estimating quantities of proved natural
gas, NGLs and crude oil reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may also change
substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. As a
result, revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible, the subjective decisions and variances in
available data for various reservoirs make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in the financial statement disclosures.

Proved reserves represent quantities of natural gas, NGLs and oil which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in the future from
known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Proved developed reserves are proved reserves which can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment, infrastructure and
operating methods.

Estimates of reserves as of December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 are based upon studies
for each of HighMount’s properties prepared by HighMount staff engineers. Calculations were prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally accepted by the petroleum industry and in accordance with SEC guidelines.
HighMount’s reserve estimates for 2012 were audited by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., (“NSAI”). NSAI is an independent third party petroleum engineering consulting firm, and the audit was performed in accordance with
the “Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information” promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. All proved reserves are located in the United States of America.



Reserves

Estimated net quantities of proved natural gas and oil (including condensate and NGLs) reserves at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 and changes in the reserves during 2012, 2011 and 2010 are shown in
the schedule below:

(a)

HighMount added 238 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves from non-proved categories in 2010. These additions pertain to locations HighMount expects
to drill during the next five years. Additionally, HighMount added 42 Bcfe primarily through drilling and the remaining 51 Bcfe in additions were associated with the Alabama and Michigan properties prior to sale.

(b)

During 2010, HighMount reclassified 208 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves to a non-proved category due to certain wells reaching their five year
maturity as a result of reduced drilling activity in 2009 and 2010. Additionally, HighMount reduced its proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves by 346 Bcfe as a result of higher production declines on its producing wells than previously
anticipated.

(c)

During 2011, HighMount reduced its proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves by 152 Bcfe as a result of recent higher decline rates of
producing wells and economic factors such as lower gas prices and higher operating expenses.

(d)

During 2012, HighMount converted 27 Bcfe from probable reserves to proved developed and converted another 48 Bcfe from probable reserves to proved
undeveloped as a result of new drilling activity.

(e)

During 2012, HighMount reclassified 199 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves to a non-proved category as a result of economic factors such as lower
gas prices and higher operating expenses. Lower gas prices also resulted in the 80 Bcfe reduction in proved developed reserves due to wells reaching their economic limit sooner than previously anticipated. Additionally, HighMount reduced its proved
developed reserves by 49 Bcfe as a result of higher production declines on its producing wells, partly due to the suspension of uneconomic maintenance and recompletion work.



Capitalized Costs

The aggregate amounts of costs capitalized for natural gas and oil producing activities, and related aggregate amounts of
accumulated depletion follow:

The following costs were incurred in natural gas and oil producing activities:

(a)

Development costs incurred for proved undeveloped reserves were $14, $25 and $23 in 2012, 2011 and 2010.

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Natural Gas and Oil Reserves

The following table represents a calculation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to
proved natural gas and oil reserve quantities that HighMount owns:

(a)

2012, 2011 and 2010 amounts exclude the effect of derivative instruments designated as hedges of future sales of production at year end.

(b)

The following prices were used in the determination of standardized measure:



In the foregoing determination of future cash inflows, sales prices for
natural gas and oil represent average prices determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month, changed for contractual arrangements with customers. Future costs of developing and producing the proved
natural gas and oil reserves reported at the end of each year shown were based on costs determined at each such year end, assuming the continuation of existing economic conditions. Future income taxes were computed by applying the appropriate year
end or future statutory tax rate to future pretax net cash flows, less the tax basis of the properties involved, and giving effect to tax deductions, permanent differences and tax credits.

It is not intended that the FASB’s standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows represent the fair
market value of HighMount’s proved reserves. HighMount cautions that the disclosures shown are based on estimates of proved reserve quantities and future production schedules which are inherently imprecise and subject to revision and the 10%
discount rate. In addition, costs and prices as of the measurement date are used in the determinations, and no value was assigned to probable or possible reserves.

Changes in Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Natural Gas and Oil Reserves

The following table is a summary of changes between the total standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows at
the beginning and end of each year:

Note 15. Benefit Plans

Pension Plans – The Company has several non-contributory defined benefit plans for eligible
employees. Benefits for certain plans are determined annually based on a specified percentage of annual earnings (based on the participant’s age or years of service) and a specified interest rate (which is established annually for all
participants) applied to accrued balances. The benefits for another plan which covers salaried employees are based on formulas which include, among others, years of service and average pay. The Company’s funding policy is to make contributions
in accordance with applicable governmental regulatory requirements.

Other Postretirement Benefit Plans –
The Company has several postretirement benefit plans covering eligible employees and retirees. Participants generally become eligible after reaching age 55 with required years of service. Actual requirements for coverage vary by plan. Benefits for
retirees who were covered by bargaining units vary by each unit and contract. Benefits for certain retirees are in the form of a Company health care account.

Benefits for retirees reaching age 65 are generally integrated with Medicare. Other retirees, based on plan provisions, must use Medicare as their primary coverage, with the Company reimbursing a portion
of the unpaid amount; or are reimbursed for the Medicare Part B premium or have no Company coverage. The benefits provided by the Company are basically health and, for certain retirees, life insurance type benefits.



The Company funds certain of these benefit plans, and accrues postretirement
benefits during the active service of those employees who would become eligible for such benefits when they retire. The Company uses December 31 as the measurement date for its plans.

Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations:

Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost:

The expected long term rate of return for plan assets is determined based on
widely-accepted capital market principles, long term return analysis for global fixed income and equity markets as well as the active total return oriented portfolio management style. Long term trends are evaluated relative to market factors such as
inflation, interest rates and fiscal and monetary policies, in order to assess the capital market assumptions as applied to the plan. Consideration of diversification needs and rebalancing is maintained.

Assumed health care cost trend rates:

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported
for the health care plans. An increase or decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate of 1% in each year would not have a significant impact on the Company’s service and interest cost as of December 31, 2012. An increase of 1% in
each year would increase the Company’s accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2012 by $4 million and a decrease of 1% in each year would decrease the Company’s accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as
of December 31, 2012 by $6 million.



Net periodic benefit cost components:

The following provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations and plan assets:



The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $3.6 billion
and $3.3 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011.

The Company employs a total return approach whereby a
mix of equity and fixed maturity securities are used to maximize the long term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk and to manage cash flows according to plan requirements. The intent of this strategy is to minimize plan expenses by
outperforming plan liabilities over the long run. Risk tolerance is established after careful consideration of the plan liabilities, plan funded status and corporate financial conditions. The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of
fixed maturity, equity and short term securities. Alternative investments, including limited partnerships, are used to enhance risk adjusted long term returns while improving portfolio diversification. At December 31, 2012, the Company had
committed $44 million to future capital calls from various third party limited partnership investments in exchange for an ownership interest in the related partnerships. Investment risk is monitored through annual liability measurements, periodic
asset/liability studies and quarterly investment portfolio reviews.

The table below presents the estimated
amounts to be recognized from Accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic cost (benefit) during 2013.



The table below presents the estimated future minimum benefit payments at
December 31, 2012.

In 2013, it is expected that contributions of approximately $93 million will be made to
pension plans and $7 million to postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans.

Pension plan
assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below.



The limited partnership investments are recorded at fair value, which
represents the plans’ share of the net asset value of each partnership. The share of the net asset value of each partnership is determined by the General Partner and is based upon the fair value of the underlying investments, which are valued
using varying market approaches. Level 2 includes limited partnership investments which can be redeemed at net asset value in 90 days or less. Level 3 includes limited partnership investments with withdrawal provisions greater than 90 days, or for
which withdrawals are not permitted until the termination of the partnership. Within hedge fund strategies, approximately 54% are equity related, 35% pursue a multi-strategy approach and 11% are focused on distressed investments at December 31,
2012.

The fair value of the guaranteed investment contracts is an estimate of the amount that would be
received in an orderly sale to a market participant at the measurement date. The amount the plan would receive from the contract holder if the contracts were terminated is the primary input and is unobservable. The guaranteed investment contracts
are therefore classified as Level 3 investments.

For a discussion of the valuation methodologies used to
measure fixed maturity securities, equities and short term investments, see Note 4.

The tables below present
reconciliations for all pension plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011:



Other postretirement benefits plan assets measured at fair value on a
recurring basis are summarized below.

There were no Level 3 assets at December 31, 2012 and 2011.

Savings Plans – The Company and its subsidiaries have several contributory savings plans which allow employees to
make regular contributions based upon a percentage of their salaries. Matching contributions are made up to specified percentages of employees’ contributions. The contributions by the Company and its subsidiaries to these plans amounted to $117
million, $100 million and $104 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

Stock
Option Plans – In 2012, shareholders approved the amended and restated Loews Corporation 2000 Stock Option Plan (the “Loews Plan”). The aggregate number of shares of Loews common stock for which options or SARs may be granted under
the Loews Plan increased from 12,000,000 shares to 18,000,000 shares, and the maximum number of shares of Loews common stock with respect to which options or SARs may be granted to any individual in any calendar year is 1,200,000 shares. The
exercise price per share may not be less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Generally, options and SARs vest ratably over a four-year period and expire in ten years.



A summary of the stock option and SAR transactions for the Loews Plan
follows:

The following table summarizes information about the Company’s stock options and
SARs outstanding in connection with the Loews Plan at December 31, 2012:

In 2012, the Company awarded SARs totaling 970,800 shares. In accordance with the Loews
Plan, the Company has the ability to settle SARs in shares or cash and has the intention to settle in shares. The SARs balance at December 31, 2012 was 5,740,208 shares. There were 7,129,900 shares and 1,813,211 shares available for grant as of
December 31, 2012 and 2011.

The weighted average remaining contractual terms of awards outstanding and
exercisable as of December 31, 2012, were 5.7 years and 4.7 years. The aggregate intrinsic values of awards outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2012 were $33 million and $27 million. The total intrinsic value of awards exercised
was $18 million, $6 million and $9 million for the years ended 2012, 2011 and 2010. The total fair value of shares vested was $11 million, $11 million and $12 million for the years ended 2012, 2011 and 2010.

The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $8 million, $10 million and $11 million related to the Loews
Plan for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. The related income tax benefits recognized were $3 million, $4 million and $4 million. At December 31, 2012, the compensation cost related to nonvested awards not yet recognized
was $10 million, and the weighted average period over which it is expected to be recognized is 2.3 years.



The fair value of granted options and SARs for the Loews Plan were estimated
at the grant date using the Black-Scholes pricing model with the following assumptions and results:

Note 16. Reinsurance

CNA cedes insurance to reinsurers to limit its maximum loss, provide greater diversification of risk,
minimize exposures on larger risks and to exit certain lines of business. The ceding of insurance does not discharge the primary liability of CNA. A credit exposure exists with respect to property and casualty and life reinsurance ceded to the
extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations or to the extent that the reinsurer disputes the liabilities assumed under reinsurance agreements. Property and casualty reinsurance coverages are tailored to the specific risk
characteristics of each product line and CNA’s retained amount varies by type of coverage. Reinsurance contracts are purchased to protect specific lines of business such as property and workers’ compensation. Corporate catastrophe
reinsurance is also purchased for property and workers’ compensation exposure. Currently most reinsurance contracts are purchased on an excess of loss basis. CNA also utilizes facultative reinsurance in certain lines. In addition, CNA assumes
reinsurance, primarily through Hardy and as a member of various reinsurance pools and associations.

The
following table summarizes the amounts receivable from reinsurers:

CNA has established an allowance for doubtful accounts on reinsurance receivables. CNA
reviews the allowance quarterly and adjusts the allowance as necessary to reflect changes in estimates of uncollected balances. The allowance may also be reduced related to write-offs of reinsurance receivable balances.

CNA attempts to mitigate its credit risk related to reinsurance by entering into reinsurance arrangements with reinsurers
that have credit ratings above certain levels and by obtaining collateral. On a limited basis, CNA may enter into reinsurance agreements with reinsurers that are not rated, primarily captive reinsurers. The primary methods of obtaining collateral
are through reinsurance trusts, letters of credit and funds withheld balances. Such collateral was approximately $3.7 billion and $3.6 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011.

CNA’s largest recoverables from a single reinsurer at December 31, 2012, including prepaid reinsurance
premiums, were approximately $2.7 billion from subsidiaries of Berkshire Hathaway Group, $900 million from subsidiaries of Swiss Re Group and $350 million from subsidiaries of the Hartford Insurance Group. The recoverable from the Berkshire Hathaway
Group includes amounts related to third party reinsurance for which a



subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway has assumed the credit risk under the terms of the Loss Portfolio Transfer as discussed in Note 8.

The effects of reinsurance on earned premiums are shown in the following table:

Included in the direct and ceded earned premiums for the years ended December 31,
2012, 2011 and 2010 are $1.8 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion related to business that is 100% reinsured as a result of a significant captive program.

Life and accident and health premiums are primarily from long duration contracts; property and casualty premiums are primarily from short duration contracts.

Insurance claims and policyholders’ benefits reported on the Consolidated Statements of Income are net of
reinsurance recoveries of $1.5 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, including $814 million, $790 million and $735 million related to the significant captive program discussed above.

The impact of reinsurance on life insurance inforce is shown in the following table:

As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, CNA has ceded $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion of
claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, future policy benefits and policyholders’ funds as a result of business operations sold in prior years. Subject to certain exceptions, the purchasers assumed the third party reinsurance credit risk
of the sold business.



Note 17. Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)

The sum of the quarterly per share amounts may not equal per share amounts reported for
year-to-date periods. This is due to changes in the number of weighted average shares outstanding and the effects of rounding for each period.

(a)

Net income (loss) for the fourth quarter of 2012 includes an after tax non-cash ceiling test impairment charge of $97 million at HighMount related
to the carrying value of its natural gas and oil properties and catastrophe impacts incurred, net of reinsurance and including reinstatement premiums, of $171 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) recorded at CNA related to Storm Sandy.

(b)

Net income for the fourth quarter of 2011 was impacted by CNA unlocking assumptions related to its payout annuity contracts, resulting in a loss
recognition of $104 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests), as further discussed in Note 1.

Note 18. Legal Proceedings

The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.
The outcome of this litigation will not, in the opinion of management, materially affect the Company’s results of operations or equity.



Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies

Guarantees

In the course of selling business entities and assets to third parties, CNA has agreed to indemnify purchasers for losses arising out of breaches of representation and warranties with respect to the
business entities or assets being sold, including, in certain cases, losses arising from undisclosed liabilities or certain named litigation. Such indemnification provisions generally survive for periods ranging from nine months following the
applicable closing date to the expiration of the relevant statutes of limitation. As of December 31, 2012, the aggregate amount of quantifiable indemnification agreements in effect for sales of business entities, assets and third party loans
was $725 million.

In addition, CNA has agreed to provide indemnification to third party purchasers for
certain losses associated with sold business entities or assets that are not limited by a contractual monetary amount. As of December 31, 2012, CNA had outstanding unlimited indemnifications in connection with the sales of certain of its
business entities or assets that included tax liabilities arising prior to a purchaser’s ownership of an entity or asset, defects in title at the time of sale, employee claims arising prior to closing and in some cases losses arising from
certain litigation and undisclosed liabilities. These indemnification agreements survive until the applicable statutes of limitation expire, or until the agreed upon contract terms expire.

Offshore Rig Purchase Obligations

entered into four turnkey contracts with Hyundai Heavy Industries, Co. Ltd., (“Hyundai”) for the construction of four dynamically positioned, ultra-deepwater drillships, with deliveries scheduled in the second and fourth quarters of 2013
and in the second and fourth quarters of 2014. The aggregate cost of the four drillships, including commissioning, spares and project management, is expected to be approximately $2.6 billion, of which approximately $650 million has been paid. These
amounts are included in Construction in process within Property, plant and equipment in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The remaining $2.0 billion will be paid upon delivery of the drillships in 2013 and 2014.

In December of 2011 and August of 2012, Diamond Offshore entered into agreements for the construction of two moored
semisubmersible rigs designed to operate in water depths up to 6,000 feet with expected completion dates in the third quarter of 2013 and the second quarter of 2014. The rigs will be constructed utilizing the hulls of two of Diamond Offshore’s
mid-water floaters and the aggregate cost of the two rigs, including commissioning, spares and project management costs, is estimated to be approximately $680 million, of which approximately $93 million has been paid.

Loews Hotels

Loews Hotels has commitments aggregating approximately $520 million for acquisitions, development and renovation of hotel properties.

Note 20. Business Segments

The Company’s reportable segments are primarily based on its individual operating subsidiaries.
Each of the principal operating subsidiaries are headed by a chief executive officer who is responsible for the operation of its business and has the duties and authority commensurate with that position. Investment gains (losses) and the related
income taxes, excluding those of CNA, are included in the Corporate and other segment.

CNA’s results are
reported in four business segments: CNA Specialty, CNA Commercial, Life & Group Non-Core and Other. CNA Specialty provides a broad array of professional, financial and specialty property and casualty products and services, primarily through
insurance brokers and managing general underwriters. CNA Commercial includes property and casualty coverages sold to small businesses and middle market entities and organizations primarily through an independent agency distribution system. CNA
Commercial also includes commercial insurance and risk management products sold to large corporations primarily through insurance brokers. Life & Group Non-



Core primarily includes the results of the life and group lines of business that are in run-off. Other includes the operations of Hardy since its acquisition date of July 2, 2012, corporate
expenses, including interest on corporate debt, and the results of certain property and casualty business primarily in run-off, including CNA Re and A&EP. Hardy is a specialized Lloyd’s underwriter primarily of short-tail exposures in
marine and aviation, non-marine property, specialty lines and property treaty reinsurance.

Diamond Offshore
owns and operates offshore drilling rigs that are chartered on a contract basis for fixed terms by companies engaged in exploration and production of hydrocarbons. Offshore rigs are mobile units that can be relocated based on market demand. Diamond
Offshore’s fleet consists of 44 drilling rigs, including four new-build rigs which are under construction and two rigs being constructed utilizing the hulls of Diamond Offshore’s existing mid-water floaters. On December 31, 2012,
Diamond Offshore’s drilling rigs were located offshore 12 countries in addition to the United States.

Boardwalk Pipeline is engaged in the interstate transportation and storage of natural gas and natural gas liquids and
gathering and processing of natural gas. This segment consists of interstate natural gas pipeline systems originating in the Gulf Coast region, Oklahoma and Arkansas, and extending north and east through the midwestern states of Tennessee, Kentucky,
Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, natural gas storage facilities in four states and NGL pipelines and storage facilities in Louisiana, with approximately 14,410 miles of pipeline.

HighMount is engaged in the exploration, production and marketing of natural gas and oil (including condensate and NGLs),
primarily located in the Permian Basin in West Texas, as well as in the Oklahoma Mississippian Lime and Texas Panhandle regions.

Loews Hotels operates a chain of 19 hotels, 17 of which are in the United States and two are in Canada.

The Corporate and other segment consists primarily of corporate investment income, corporate interest expense and other unallocated expenses.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies
in Note 1. In addition, CNA does not maintain a distinct investment portfolio for each of its insurance segments, and accordingly, allocation of assets to each segment is not performed. Therefore, net investment income and investment gains (losses)
are allocated based on each segment’s carried insurance reserves, as adjusted.



The following tables set forth the Company’s consolidated revenues and
income (loss) by business segment:



(a)

Investment gains (losses) included in Revenues, Income (loss) before income tax and noncontrolling interests and Net income (loss) are as follows:

(b)

Income taxes and interest expense are as follows:



Note 21. Consolidating Financial Information

The following schedules present the Company’s consolidating balance sheet information at
December 31, 2012 and 2011, and consolidating statements of income information for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. These schedules present the individual subsidiaries of the Company and their contribution to the
consolidated financial statements. Amounts presented will not necessarily be the same as those in the individual financial statements of the Company’s subsidiaries due to adjustments for purchase accounting, income taxes and noncontrolling
interests. In addition, many of the Company’s subsidiaries use a classified balance sheet which also leads to differences in amounts reported for certain line items.

The Corporate and Other column primarily reflects the parent company’s investment in its subsidiaries, invested cash
portfolio and corporate long term debt. The elimination adjustments are for intercompany assets and liabilities, interest and dividends, the parent company’s investment in capital stocks of subsidiaries, and various reclasses of debit or credit
balances to the amounts in consolidation. Purchase accounting adjustments have been pushed down to the appropriate subsidiary.
