CNA FINANCIAL CORPORATION

CNA Financial Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “CNA”) was incorporated in 1967 and is an insurance
holding company. CNA’s property and casualty and remaining life & group insurance operations are primarily conducted by Continental Casualty Company (“CCC”), incorporated in 1897, and The Continental Insurance Company
(“CIC”), organized in 1853, and certain other affiliates. CIC became a subsidiary of CNA in 1995 as a result of the acquisition of The Continental Corporation (“Continental”). CNA accounted for 67.8%, 67.7% and 68.0% of our
consolidated total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.

CNA’s insurance products primarily
include commercial property and casualty coverages, including surety. CNA’s services include risk management, information services, warranty and claims administration. CNA’s products and services are primarily marketed through independent
agents, brokers and managing general underwriters to a wide variety of customers, including small, medium and large businesses, insurance companies, associations, professionals and other groups.

CNA’s property and casualty field structure consists of 49 underwriting locations across the United States. In addition,
there are five centralized processing operations which handle policy processing, billing and collection activities and also act as call centers to optimize service. The claims structure consists of two regional claim centers designed to efficiently
handle the high volume of low severity claims including property damage, liability and workers’ compensation medical only claims, and 16 principal claim offices handling the more complex claims. CNA also has a presence in Canada, Europe and
Singapore consisting of 19 branch operations and access to business placed at Lloyd’s of London (“Lloyd’s”) through Hardy Underwriting Bermuda Limited (“Hardy”).

CNA’s core business, commercial property and casualty insurance operations, includes Specialty, Commercial and
International. Other Non-Core business includes Life & Group Non-Core and Other.

Specialty

Specialty includes the following business groups:

Management & Professional Liability

: Management & Professional Liability provides management and
professional liability insurance and risk management services and other specialized property and casualty coverages. This group provides professional liability coverages to various professional firms, including architects, real estate agents,
accounting firms, law firms and other professional firms. Management & Professional Liability also provides directors and officers (“D&O”), employment practices, fiduciary and fidelity coverages. Specific areas of focus



include small and mid-size firms, public as well as privately held firms and not-for-profit organizations, where tailored products for these client segments are offered. Products within
Management & Professional Liability are distributed through brokers, independent agents and managing general underwriters. Management & Professional Liability, through CNA HealthCare, also offers insurance products to serve the health care
industry. Products include professional and general liability as well as associated standard property and casualty coverages, and are distributed on a national basis through brokers, independent agents and managing general underwriters. Key customer
groups include aging services, allied medical facilities, life sciences, dentists, physicians, hospitals and nurses and other medical practitioners.

Surety

: Surety offers small, medium and large contract and commercial surety bonds. Surety provides surety and
fidelity bonds in all 50 states through a network of independent agencies and brokers.

Warranty and Alternative
Risks

:

Warranty and Alternative Risks provides extended service contracts and related products that provide protection from the financial burden associated with mechanical breakdown and other related losses, primarily for vehicles
and portable electronic communication devices.

Commercial

Commercial’s property products include standard and excess property, marine and boiler and machinery coverages. Casualty
products include standard casualty insurance products such as workers’ compensation, general and product liability, commercial auto and umbrella coverages. Most insurance programs are provided on a guaranteed cost basis; however, CNA also
offers specialized loss-sensitive insurance programs.

These property and casualty

products are offered as part of
CNA’s Middle Market, Small Business and Other Commercial insurance groups. Other Commercial also includes total risk management services relating to claim and information services to the large commercial insurance marketplace, through a wholly
owned subsidiary, CNA ClaimPlus, Inc., a third party administrator.

International

International provides property and casualty insurance and specialty coverages on a global basis through its operations in
Canada, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Singapore as well as through its presence at Lloyd’s of London.

The International business is grouped into broad business units - Energy & Marine, Property, Casualty, Specialty, and
Healthcare & Technology - and is managed across three territorial platforms.

Canada:

Canada provides
standard commercial and specialty insurance products, primarily in the marine, oil & gas, construction, manufacturing and life science industries.

CNA Europe

: CNA Europe provides a diverse range of specialty products as well as commercial insurance products
primarily in the marine, property, financial services and healthcare & technology industries throughout Europe on both a domestic and cross border basis.

marine, property, casualty and specialty lines with risks located in many countries around the world. The capacity of and results from the syndicate are 100% attributable to CNA.

Life & Group Non-Core

Life & Group Non-Core primarily includes the results of CNA’s long term care business that is in run-off. Long term
care policies were sold on both an individual and group basis. While considered non-core, new enrollees in existing groups were accepted through February 1, 2016.



Other

Property and Casualty Claim and Claim Adjustment Expenses

The following loss reserve development table illustrates the change over time of reserves established for property and
casualty claim and claim adjustment expenses at the end of the preceding ten calendar years for CNA’s property and casualty insurance companies. The first section shows the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated year. The
second section, reading down, shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years with respect to the originally reported reserve liability. The third section, reading down, shows re-estimates of the originally recorded reserves as
of the end of each successive year, which is the result of CNA’s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries’ expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims. The last section compares the
latest re-estimated reserves to the reserves originally established, and indicates whether the original reserves were adequate or inadequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims.



The loss reserve development table is cumulative and, therefore, ending balances should not be
added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the current and prior years.

(a)

Effective January 1, 2010, CNA ceded its net asbestos and environmental pollution claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserves under a
retroactive reinsurance agreement as further discussed in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

(b)

As a result of the Hardy acquisition, net reserves were increased by $291 million.

(c)

In the third quarter of 2014, CNA commuted a workers’ compensation reinsurance pool which had the impact of $348 million of favorable gross
loss reserve development and $324 million of unfavorable ceded loss reserve development.



Please read information relating to CNA’s property and casualty claim and
claim adjustment expense reserves and reserve development set forth under Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”), and in Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements, included under Item 8.

Investments

Please read Item 7, MD&A – Investments and Notes 1, 3 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
included under Item 8.

Other

Competition:

The property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive both as to rate and
service. CNA competes with a large number of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities for both distributors and customers. Insurers compete on the basis of factors including products, price, services, ratings and financial strength.
CNA must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve its insurance products and services.

There are
approximately 2,700 individual companies that sell property and casualty insurance in the United States. Based on 2014 statutory net written premiums, CNA is the eighth largest commercial insurance writer and the 14th largest property and casualty
insurance organization in the United States.

Regulation:

The insurance industry is subject to comprehensive
and detailed regulation and supervision. Regulatory oversight by applicable agencies is exercised through review of submitted filings and information, examinations (both financial and market conduct), direct inquiries and interviews. Each domestic
and foreign jurisdiction has established supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers relative to licensing insurers and agents, approving policy forms, establishing reserve requirements, prescribing the form and content of statutory
financial reports and regulating capital adequacy and the type, quality and amount of investments permitted. Such regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations, which require that rates not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly
discriminatory, governance requirements and risk assessment practice and disclosure. In addition to regulation of dividends by insurance subsidiaries, intercompany transfers of assets may be subject to prior notice or approval by insurance
regulators, depending on the size of such transfers and payments in relation to the financial position of the insurance subsidiaries making the transfer or payment.

Domestic insurers are also required by state insurance regulators to provide coverage to insureds who would not otherwise be
considered eligible by the insurers. Each state dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks. CNA’s share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of its
respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each state.

Further, domestic insurance companies are
subject to state guaranty fund and other insurance-related assessments. Guaranty funds are governed by state insurance guaranty associations which levy assessments to meet the funding needs of insolvent insurer estates. Other insurance-related
assessments are generally levied by state agencies to fund various organizations including disaster relief funds, rating bureaus, insurance departments, and workers’ compensation second injury funds, or by industry organizations that assist in
the statistical analysis and ratemaking process and CNA has the ability to recoup certain of these assessments from policyholders.

As CNA’s insurance operations are conducted in a multitude of both domestic and foreign jurisdictions, CNA is subject to
a number of regulatory agency requirements in respect of a portion, or all, of its operations. These include, but are not limited to, the State of Illinois Department of Insurance (which is CNA’s global group-wide supervisor), the U.K.
Prudential Regulatory Authority and Financial Conduct Authority, the Bermuda Monetary Authority and the Office of Superintendent of Financial Institutions in Canada.

Hardy is also supervised by the Council of Lloyd’s, which is the franchisor for all Lloyd’s operations. The Council
of Lloyd’s has wide discretionary powers to regulate Lloyd’s underwriting, such as establishing the capital requirements for syndicate participation. In addition, the annual business plans of each syndicate are subject to the review and
approval of the Lloyd’s Franchise Board, which is responsible for business planning and monitoring for all syndicates.



Effective January 1, 2016, the European Union’s executive body, the European
Commission, implemented new capital adequacy and risk management regulations, Solvency II, that apply to CNA’s European operations. Additionally, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (“IAIS”) continues to consider
regulatory proposals addressing group supervision, capital requirements and enterprise risk management. The U.S. Federal Reserve, the U.S. Federal Insurance Office and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners are working with other global
regulators to define such proposals. It is not currently clear to what extent the IAIS activities will impact CNA as any final proposal would ultimately need to be legislated or regulated by each individual country or state.

Although the federal government does not currently directly regulate the business of insurance, federal legislative and
regulatory initiatives can impact the insurance industry. These initiatives and legislation include proposals relating to potential federal oversight of certain insurers; terrorism and natural catastrophe exposures; cybersecurity risk management;
federal financial services reforms; and certain tax reforms. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 was enacted on January 12, 2015. The reauthorization provides for a federal government backstop for insured terrorism risks
for another six years with increases to the insurer co-payment and program trigger. The existence of the mitigating effects of such law is part of the analysis of CNA’s overall risk posture for terrorism and, accordingly, its risk positioning
may change if such law were modified. CNA also continues to invest in the security network of its systems on an enterprise-wide basis, especially considering the implications of data and privacy breaches. This requires an investment of a significant
amount of resources by CNA on an ongoing basis. Potential implications of possible cybersecurity legislation on such current investment, if any, are uncertain. The foregoing proposals, either separately or in the aggregate, create a regulatory and
legal environment that may require changes in CNA’s business plan or significant investment of resources in order to operate in an effective and compliant manner.

Additionally, various legislative and regulatory efforts to reform the tort liability system have, and will continue to,
impact CNA’s industry. Although there has been some tort reform with positive impact to the insurance industry, new causes of action and theories of damages continue to be proposed in state court actions or by federal or state legislatures that
continue to expand liability for insurers and their policyholders.

dynamically-positioned drillships including the last of Diamond Offshore’s four newbuild drillships, the

Ocean BlackLion,

which was delivered in the second quarter of 2015. Diamond Offshore expects its harsh environment ultra-deepwater
semisubmersible rig, the

Ocean GreatWhite,

to be delivered in mid-2016.

A floater rig is a type of mobile offshore
drilling unit that floats and does not rest on the seafloor. This asset class includes self-propelled drillships and semisubmersible rigs. Semisubmersible rigs consist of an upper working and living deck resting on vertical columns connected to
lower hull members. Such rigs operate in a “semi-submerged” position, remaining afloat, off bottom, in a position in which the lower hull is approximately 55 feet to 90 feet below the water line and the upper deck protrudes well above the
surface. Semisubmersibles hold position while drilling by use of a series of small propulsion units or thrusters that provide dynamic positioning (“DP”) to keep the rig on location, or with anchors tethered to the seabed. Although DP
semisubmersibles are self-propelled, such rigs may be moved long distances with the assistance of tug boats. Non-DP, or moored, semisubmersibles require tug boats or the use of a heavy lift vessel to move between locations.

A drillship is an adaptation of a maritime vessel that is designed and constructed to carry out drilling operations by means
of a substructure with a moon pool centrally located in the hull. Drillships are typically self-propelled and are positioned over a drillsite through the use of a DP system similar to those used on semisubmersible rigs.

Diamond Offshore’s floater fleet (semisubmersibles and drillships) can be further categorized based on the nominal water
depth for each class of rig as follows:

Category

Rated Water Depth (a) (in feet)

Number of Units in Fleet

Ultra-Deepwater

7,501    to    12,000

12 (b)

Deepwater

5,000    to      7,500


Mid-Water

400    to      4,999


(a)

Rated water depth for semisubmersibles and drillships reflects the maximum water depth in which a floating rig has been designed to operate.
However, individual rigs are capable of drilling, or have drilled, in marginally greater water depths depending on various conditions (such as salinity of the ocean, weather and sea conditions).

(b)

Includes the

Ocean GreatWhite,

a harsh environment semisubmersible rig under construction.

Jack-up rigs are mobile, self-elevating drilling platforms equipped with legs that are lowered to the ocean floor. Diamond
Offshore’s jack-ups are used for drilling in water depths from 20 feet to 350 feet. The water depth limit in which a particular rig is able to operate is principally determined by the length of the rig’s legs. The rig hull includes the
drilling equipment, jacking system, crew quarters, loading and unloading facilities, storage areas for bulk and liquid materials, heliport and other related equipment. A jack-up rig is towed to the drillsite with its hull riding in the sea, as a
vessel, with its legs retracted. Once over a drillsite, the legs are lowered until they rest on the seabed and jacking continues with the legs penetrating the seabed until they are firm and stable, and resistance is sufficient to elevate the hull
above the surface of the water. After completion of drilling operations, the hull is lowered until it rests in the water and then the legs are retracted for relocation to another drillsite. All of Diamond Offshore’s jack-up rigs are equipped
with a cantilever system that enables the rig to cantilever or extend its drilling package over the aft end of the rig.



As of February 16, 2016, the

Ocean Scepter

, built in 2008, was operating
offshore Mexico for Exploración Producción (“PEMEX”), under a long term contract. In addition, Diamond Offshore has four other jack-up rigs which it is currently marketing for sale.

Fleet Enhancements and Additions:

Diamond Offshore’s long term strategy is to upgrade its fleet to meet
customer demand for advanced, efficient and high-tech rigs by acquiring or building new rigs when possible to do so at attractive prices, and otherwise by enhancing the capabilities of its existing rigs at a lower cost and shortened construction
period than newbuild construction would require. Since 2009, commencing with the acquisition of two newbuild, ultra-deepwater semisubmersible rigs, the

Ocean Courage

and

Ocean Valor

, Diamond Offshore has committed over $5.0 billion
towards upgrading its fleet. In mid 2015, Diamond Offshore took delivery of the

Ocean BlackLion

, the last of four ultra-deepwater drillships constructed in South Korea during Diamond Offshore’s most recent fleet enhancement cycle. The

Ocean GreatWhite

remains under construction in South Korea with delivery of the new rig expected to occur in mid-2016. Upon completion of acceptance testing, the rig is expected to commence drilling operations offshore Australia later this
year.

Diamond Offshore will evaluate further rig acquisition and enhancement opportunities as they arise. However,
Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance whether, or to what extent, it will continue to make rig acquisitions or enhancements to its fleet.

Pressure Control by the Hour:

In February of 2016, Diamond Offshore entered into a ten-year agreement with GE
Oil & Gas, (“GE”), to provide services with respect to certain blowout preventer and related well control equipment on Diamond Offshore’s four newbuild drillships. Such services include management of maintenance, certification and
reliability with respect to such equipment. In connection with the services agreement with GE, Diamond Offshore will sell the equipment to a GE affiliate and will lease back such equipment over separate ten-year operating leases.

Markets:

The principal markets for Diamond Offshore’s contract drilling services are the following:

●

South America, principally offshore Brazil and Trinidad and Tobago;

●

Australia and Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam;

●

the Middle East;

●

Europe, principally in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and Norway;

●

East and West Africa;

●

the Mediterranean; and

●

the Gulf of Mexico, including the U.S. and Mexico.

Diamond Offshore actively markets its rigs worldwide. From time to time Diamond Offshore’s fleet operates in various
other markets throughout the world.

Drilling Contracts:

Diamond Offshore’s contracts to provide offshore
drilling services vary in their terms and provisions. Diamond Offshore typically obtains its contracts through a competitive bid process, although it is not unusual for Diamond Offshore to be awarded drilling contracts following direct negotiations.
Drilling contracts generally provide for a basic fixed dayrate regardless of whether or not such drilling results in a productive well. Drilling contracts may also provide for reductions in rates during periods when the rig is being moved or when
drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns, adverse weather conditions or other circumstances. Under dayrate contracts, Diamond Offshore generally pays the operating expenses of the rig, including wages and the cost of
incidental supplies. Historically, dayrate contracts have accounted for the majority of Diamond Offshore’s revenues. In addition, from time to time, Diamond Offshore’s dayrate contracts may also provide for the ability to earn an incentive
bonus from its customer based upon performance.



The duration of a dayrate drilling contract is generally tied to the time
required to drill a single well or a group of wells, which Diamond Offshore refers to as a well-to-well contract, or a fixed period of time, in what Diamond Offshore refers to as a term contract. Many drilling contracts may be terminated by the
customer in the event the drilling rig is destroyed or lost or if drilling operations are suspended for an extended period of time as a result of a breakdown of equipment or, in some cases, due to events beyond the control of either party to the
contract. Certain of Diamond Offshore’s contracts also permit the customer to terminate the contract early by giving notice; in most circumstances, this requires the payment of an early termination fee by the customer. The contract term in many
instances may also be extended by the customer exercising options for the drilling of additional wells or for an additional length of time, generally at competitive market rates and mutually agreeable terms at the time of the extension. In periods
of decreasing demand for offshore rigs, drilling contractors may prefer longer term contracts to preserve dayrates at existing levels and ensure utilization, while customers may prefer shorter contracts that allow them to more quickly obtain the
benefit of declining dayrates. Moreover, drilling contractors may accept lower dayrates in a declining market in order to obtain longer-term contracts and add backlog.

Customers:

Diamond Offshore provides offshore drilling services to a customer base that includes major and independent
oil and gas companies and government-owned oil companies. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, Diamond Offshore performed services for 19, 35 and 39 different customers. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, one of Diamond Offshore’s customers in Brazil,
Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. (“Petrobras”), (a Brazilian multinational energy company that is majority-owned by the Brazilian government), accounted for 24%, 32% and 34% of Diamond Offshore’s annual total consolidated revenues.
During 2015, ExxonMobil and Anadarko each accounted for 12% of Diamond Offshore’s annual consolidated revenues. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of Diamond Offshore’s annual total consolidated revenues during 2015, 2014 or 2013.

As of February 16, 2016, Diamond Offshore’s contract backlog was $5.2 billion attributable to 11 customers. All four
of its drillships are currently contracted to work in the GOM. As of February 16, 2016, contract backlog attributable to Diamond Offshore’s expected operations in the GOM was $510 million, $653 million and $653 million for the years 2016, 2017
and 2018, respectively, and $626 million in the aggregate for the years 2019 to 2020 attributable to three customers.

Competition

:

Despite consolidation in previous years, the offshore contract drilling industry remains highly
competitive with numerous industry participants, none of which at the present time has a dominant market share. The industry may also experience additional consolidation in the future, which could create other large competitors. Some of Diamond
Offshore’s competitors may have greater financial or other resources than it does. Based on industry data as of the date of this report, there are approximately 840 mobile drilling rigs in service worldwide, including approximately 300 floater
rigs.

The offshore contract drilling industry is influenced by a number of factors, including global economies and demand
for oil and natural gas, current and anticipated prices of oil and natural gas, expenditures by oil and gas companies for exploration and development of oil and natural gas and the availability of drilling rigs.

Drilling contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis. Price is typically the primary factor in determining
which qualified contractor is awarded a job. Customers may also consider rig availability and location, a drilling contractor’s operational and safety performance record, and condition and suitability of equipment. Diamond Offshore believes it
competes favorably with respect to these factors.

Diamond Offshore competes on a worldwide basis, but competition may
vary significantly by region at any particular time. Competition for offshore rigs generally takes place on a global basis, as these rigs are highly mobile and may be moved, at a cost that may be substantial, from one region to another. It is
characteristic of the offshore contract drilling industry to move rigs from areas of low utilization and dayrates to areas of greater activity and relatively higher dayrates. Significant new rig construction and upgrades of existing drilling units
could also intensify price competition.

Governmental Regulation

:

Diamond Offshore’s operations are
subject to numerous international, foreign, U.S., state and local laws and regulations that relate directly or indirectly to its operations, including regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment, requiring removal and
clean-up under some



circumstances, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, and may include laws or regulations pertaining to climate change, carbon emissions or energy use.

Operations Outside the United States:

Diamond Offshore’s operations outside the U.S. accounted for approximately
79%, 85% and 89% of its total consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.

Properties:

Diamond Offshore owns an office building in Houston, Texas, where its corporate headquarters are located,
offices and other facilities in New Iberia, Louisiana, Aberdeen, Scotland, Macae, Brazil and Ciudad del Carmen, Mexico. Additionally, Diamond Offshore currently leases various office, warehouse and storage facilities in Australia, Egypt, Indonesia,
Louisiana, Malaysia, Romania, Singapore, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, the U.K. and Vietnam to support its offshore drilling operations.

BOARDWALK PIPELINE PARTNERS, LP

Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP (“Boardwalk Pipeline”) is engaged in integrated natural gas and natural gas liquids
and hydocarbons (herein referred to together as “NGLs”) transportation and storage and natural gas gathering and processing. Boardwalk Pipeline accounted for 9.3%, 8.6% and 8.4% of our consolidated total revenue for the years ended
December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.

We own approximately 51% of Boardwalk Pipeline comprised of 125,586,133 common units
and a 2% general partner interest. A wholly owned subsidiary of ours, Boardwalk Pipelines Holding Corp. (“BPHC”) is the general partner and holds all of Boardwalk Pipeline’s incentive distribution rights which entitle the general
partner to an increasing percentage of the cash that is distributed by Boardwalk Pipeline in excess of $0.4025 per unit per quarter.

Boardwalk Pipeline owns and operates approximately 14,090 miles of interconnected natural gas pipelines directly serving
customers in 13 states and indirectly serving customers throughout the northeastern and southeastern U.S. through numerous interconnections with unaffiliated pipelines. Boardwalk Pipeline also owns and operates more than 435 miles of NGL pipelines
in Louisiana and Texas. In 2015, its pipeline systems transported approximately 2.4 trillion cubic feet (“Tcf”) of natural gas and approximately 46.6 million barrels (“MMBbls”) of NGLs. Average daily throughput on Boardwalk
Pipeline’s natural gas pipeline systems during 2015 was approximately 6.7 billion cubic feet (“Bcf”). Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas storage facilities are comprised of 14 underground storage fields located in four states with
aggregate working gas capacity of approximately 205.0 Bcf and Boardwalk Pipeline’s NGL storage facilities consist of nine salt dome storage caverns located in Louisiana with an aggregate storage capacity of approximately 24.0 MMBbls. Boardwalk
Pipeline also owns three salt dome caverns and a brine pond for use in providing brine supply services and to support the NGL storage operations.

The pipeline and storage systems of Boardwalk Pipeline consist of the following:

The Gulf South pipeline system runs approximately 7,390 miles along the Gulf Coast in the states of Texas, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. The pipeline system has a peak-day delivery capacity of 8.3 Bcf per day and average daily throughput for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 2.8 Bcf per day. Gulf South has ten natural gas storage facilities. The
two natural gas storage facilities located in Louisiana and Mississippi have approximately 83.5 Bcf of working gas storage capacity and the eight salt dome natural gas storage caverns in Mississippi have approximately 46.0 Bcf of total storage
capacity, of which approximately 29.6 Bcf is working gas capacity. Gulf South also owns undeveloped land which is suitable for up to five additional storage caverns.

The Texas Gas pipeline system originates in Louisiana, East Texas and Arkansas and runs approximately 6,020 miles north and
east through Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, and into Ohio, with smaller diameter lines extending into Illinois. The pipeline system has a peak-day delivery capacity of 4.8 Bcf per day and average daily throughput for
the year ended December 31, 2015 was 2.6 Bcf per day. Texas Gas owns nine natural gas storage fields with 84.3 Bcf of working gas storage capacity.



The Gulf Crossing pipeline system originates in Texas and runs approximately 375
miles into Louisiana. The pipeline system has a peak-day delivery capacity of 1.9 Bcf per day and average daily throughput for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 1.2 Bcf per day.

Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream and Boardwalk Petrochemical Pipeline (collectively “Louisiana Midstream”) provide
transportation and storage services for natural gas, NGL’s and ethylene, fractionation services for NGL’s and brine supply services. These assets provide approximately 67.1 MMBbls of salt dome storage capacity, including approximately 7.6
Bcf of working natural gas storage capacity and approximately 24.0 MMBbls of salt dome NGL storage capacity, significant brine supply infrastructure including three salt dome caverns and approximately 270 miles of pipeline assets.

Louisiana Midstream owns and operates the Evangeline Pipeline (“Evangeline”), which is an approximately 180 mile
interstate ethylene pipeline that is capable of transporting approximately 2.6 billion pounds of ethylene per year between Texas and Louisiana, where it interconnects with Louisiana Midstream’s ethylene distribution system. Throughput for
Louisiana Midstream was 46.6 MMBbls for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Boardwalk Field Services operates natural gas
gathering, compression, treating and processing infrastructure primarily in south Texas with approximately 290 miles of pipeline.

In response to the change in the natural gas industry and the growth in the petrochemical industry, Boardwalk Pipeline is
currently engaged in the following growth projects. See

Liquidity and Capital Resources – Boardwalk Pipeline for further discussion of capital expenditures and financing.

Ohio to Louisiana Access Project: This project will provide long term firm natural gas transportation primarily from the
Marcellus and Utica production areas to Louisiana, and while not creating additional capacity, would make a portion of Boardwalk Pipeline’s Texas Gas system bi-directional. The project is supported by firm transportation contracts with
producers and end-users and has a weighted average contract life of approximately 13 years. The project is expected to be placed into service in the second quarter of 2016.

Southern Indiana Lateral Project: This project will consist of the construction of approximately 30 miles of pipeline
from Indiana to Kentucky, adding approximately 0.1 Bcf per day of peak-day transmission capacity to Boardwalk Pipeline’s Texas Gas system. The project is expected to be placed into service in the third quarter of 2016, with a weighted-average
contract life of 19 years.

Western Kentucky Market Lateral Project: This project consists of the construction of a
pipeline lateral to provide deliveries to a proposed new power plant in Western Kentucky, adding approximately 0.2 Bcf per day of peak-day transmission capacity to Boardwalk Pipeline’s Texas Gas system. The project is expected to be placed into
service in the third quarter of 2016, with a weighted-average contract life of 20 years.

Power Plant Project in South
Texas: Boardwalk Pipeline’s power plant project consists of the addition of compression facilities and modifications of existing facilities to increase the operating capacity of certain sections of the Gulf South pipeline, providing
transportation services of 0.2 Bcf per day to a new power plant in South Texas. The project is expected to be placed into service in the third quarter of 2016, with a weighted-average contract life of 20 years.

Northern Supply Access Project: This project will increase the peak-day transmission capacity on Boardwalk
Pipeline’s Texas Gas system by the addition of compression facilities and other system modifications to make this portion of the system bi-directional and is supported by precedent agreements for 0.4 Bcf per day of peak-day transmission
capacity. The project is expected to be placed into service in the first half of 2017, with a weighted-average contract life of 16 years. In October of 2015, one of the foundation shippers which contracted for 0.1 Bcf per day of peak-day
transmission capacity failed to post the required credit support on the contractually required date. Boardwalk Pipeline continues to work with the customer as well as explore all options for the capacity associated with that customer’s
precedent agreement, including adjusting the scope of the project to accommodate the reduced volume commitment. This project remains subject to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) regulatory approval to commence construction.



Sulphur Storage and Pipeline Expansion Project: Boardwalk Pipeline executed
a long term agreement to provide liquids transportation and storage services to support the development of a new ethane cracker plant in Louisiana. The project will involve significant storage and infrastructure development to serve petrochemical
customers near Boardwalk Pipeline’s Sulphur Hub and is expected to be placed into service in the second half of 2017.

Coastal Bend Header Project: Boardwalk Pipeline executed precedent agreements with foundation shippers to transport
natural gas to serve a planned liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) liquefaction terminal in Freeport, Texas. As part of the project Boardwalk Pipeline will construct an approximately 65-mile pipeline supply header with approximate 1.4 Bcf per
day of capacity to serve the terminal. Additionally, Boardwalk Pipeline will expand and modify its existing Gulf South pipeline facilities that will provide access to additional supply sources through various interconnects in South Texas and in the
Louisiana area. The project is expected to be placed into service in 2018, with a weighted-average contract life of 20 years. This project remains subject to FERC regulatory approval to commence construction.

Brine Development Project: Boardwalk Pipeline executed agreements with a petrochemical customer in Louisiana to provide
brine supply services subject to certain minimum take requirements. The first portion of the project, which was placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2015, consisted of constructing a pipeline to the customer’s facilities to supply brine
over a three year period. The second portion, expected to be placed in service in 2018, consists of providing brine supply services over a 15-year period through the development of additional wells and associated facilities.

Customers:

Boardwalk Pipeline serves a broad mix of customers, including producers of natural gas, and with
end-use customers including local distribution companies, marketers, electric power generators, industrial users and interstate and intrastate pipelines who, in turn, provide transportation and storage services for end-users. These customers are
located throughout the Gulf Coast, Midwest and Northeast regions of the U.S.

Competition:

Boardwalk
Pipeline competes with numerous other pipelines that provide transportation, storage and other services at many locations along its pipeline systems. Boardwalk Pipeline also competes with pipelines that are attached to natural gas supply sources
that are closer to some of its traditional natural gas market areas. In addition, regulators’ continuing efforts to increase competition in the natural gas industry have increased the natural gas transportation options of Boardwalk
Pipeline’s traditional customers. For example, as a result of regulators’ policies, capacity segmentation and capacity release have created an active secondary market which increasingly competes with Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas
pipeline services. Further, natural gas competes with other forms of energy available to Boardwalk Pipeline’s customers, including electricity, coal, fuel oils and alternative fuel sources.

The principal elements of competition among pipelines are availability of capacity, rates, terms of service, access to gas
supplies, flexibility and reliability of service. In many cases, the elements of competition, in particular flexibility, terms of service and reliability, are key differentiating factors between competitors. This is especially the case with capacity
being sold on a longer term basis. Boardwalk Pipeline is focused on finding opportunities to enhance its competitive profile in these areas by increasing the flexibility of its pipeline systems, such as modifying them to allow for bi-directional
flows, to meet the demands of customers, such as power generators and industrial users, and is continually reviewing its services and terms of service to offer customers enhanced service options.

Seasonality:

Boardwalk Pipeline’s revenues can be affected by weather, natural gas price levels, gas price
differentials between locations on its pipeline systems (basis spreads), gas price differentials between time periods, such as winter to summer (time period price spreads) and natural gas price volatility. Weather impacts natural gas demand for
heating needs and power generation, which in turn influences the short term value of transportation and storage across Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipeline systems. Colder than normal winters can result in an increase in the demand for natural gas for
heating needs and warmer than normal summers can impact cooling needs, both of which typically result in increased pipeline transportation revenues and throughput. While traditionally peak demand for natural gas occurs during the winter months
driven by heating needs, the increased use of natural gas for cooling needs during the summer months has partially reduced the seasonality of revenues. In 2015, approximately 53% of Boardwalk Pipeline’s operating revenues were recognized in the
first and fourth quarters of the year.



Governmental Regulation:

FERC regulates Boardwalk Pipeline’s
natural gas operating subsidiaries under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (“NGA”) and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. FERC regulates, among other things, the rates and charges for the transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate
commerce and the extension, enlargement or abandonment of facilities under its jurisdiction. Where required, Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas pipeline subsidiaries hold certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by FERC covering
certain of their facilities, activities and services. The maximum rates that may be charged by Boardwalk Pipeline’s subsidiaries operating under FERC’s jurisdiction, for all aspects of the natural gas transportation services it provides,
are established through FERC’s cost-of-service rate-making process. Key determinants in FERC’s cost-of-service rate-making process are the costs of providing service, the volumes of gas being transported, the rate design, the allocation of
costs between services, the capital structure and the rate of return a pipeline is permitted to earn. The maximum rates that may be charged by Boardwalk Pipeline for storage services on Texas Gas, with the exception of services associated with a
portion of the working gas capacity on that system, are established through FERC’s cost-of-service rate-making process. FERC has authorized Boardwalk Pipeline to charge market-based rates for its firm and interruptible storage services for the
majority of its natural gas storage facilities.

In October of 2014, Boardwalk Pipeline’s Gulf South subsidiary filed
a rate case with the FERC pursuant to Section 4 of the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (Docket No. RP15-65) in which Gulf South requested, among other things, a reconfiguration of the transportation rate zones on its system and, in general, an increase in
its tariff rates. In 2015, an uncontested settlement was reached with Gulf South’s customers and approved by the FERC. The settlement will become effective March 1, 2016.

The settlement provides for, among other things, (a) a system-wide rate design across the majority of the pipeline system; (b)
a fuel tracker for determining future fuel rates; (c) a moratorium which prevents Gulf South or its customers from modifying the settlement rates until May 1, 2023, with certain exceptions; and (d) an extension of all No Notice Service
(“NNS”) contracts to the end of the moratorium period at maximum rates, subject to each customer’s right to reduce capacity under those agreements from current levels by up to 6% on April 1, 2016 and by up to another 6% of their
remaining contract capacity by April 1, 2020. The NNS customers had to elect by December 1, 2015, whether they wanted to reduce their initial contracted capacity. Only two NNS customers elected to reduce their contracted capacity effective on April
1, 2016. The settled rates were moved into effect on November 1, 2015. Refunds for the difference between the rates as filed and as settled are required to be paid to customers by May 1, 2016. Please see “Gulf South Rate Case” under Item
7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”).

Boardwalk Pipeline is also regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) through the Pipeline and
Hazardous Material Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended by Title I of the Pipeline Safety Act of 1979 (“NGPSA”) and the Hazardous Liquids Pipeline Safety Act of 1979
(“HLPSA”). The NGPSA and HLPSA govern the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of interstate natural gas and NGL pipeline facilities. Boardwalk Pipeline has received authority from PHMSA to
operate certain natural gas pipeline assets under special permits that will allow it to operate those pipeline assets at higher than normal operating pressures of up to 0.80 of the pipe’s Specified Minimum Yield Strength (“SMYS”).
Operating at higher than normal operating pressures will allow these pipelines to transport all of the volumes Boardwalk Pipeline has contracted for with its customers. PHMSA retains discretion whether to grant or maintain authority for Boardwalk
Pipeline to operate its natural gas pipeline assets at higher pressures. PHMSA has also developed regulations that require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain high risk
areas along Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipelines and take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in highly populated areas. The NGPSA and HLPSA were most recently amended by the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job
Creation Act of 2011 (“2011 Act”) in 2012, with the 2011 Act requiring increased maximum civil penalties for certain violations to $200,000 per violation per day, and a total cap of $2 million. In addition, the 2011 Act reauthorized the
federal pipeline safety programs of PHMSA through 2015, and directs the Secretary of Transportation to undertake a number of reviews, studies and reports, some of which may result in more stringent safety controls or additional natural gas and
hazardous liquids pipeline safety rulemaking. A number of the provisions of the 2011 Act have the potential to cause owners and operators of pipeline facilities to incur significant capital expenditures and/or operating costs. New pipeline safety
legislation that will reauthorize the federal pipeline safety programs of PHMSA through 2019 will be under consideration. Passage of new legislation reauthorizing the PHMSA pipeline safety



programs is expected to require, among other things, pursuit of those legal mandates included in the 2011 Act but not acted upon by PHMSA.

The Surface Transportation Board (“STB”), has authority to regulate the rates Boardwalk Pipeline charges for service
on its ethylene pipelines. The STB requires that Boardwalk Pipeline’s transportation rates be reasonable and that its practices cannot unreasonably discriminate among its ethylene shippers.

Boardwalk Pipeline’s operations are also subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to
protection of the environment. Such laws and regulations impose, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation, handling, use, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances
and waste and in connection with spills, releases, discharges and emissions of various substances into the environment. Environmental regulations also require that Boardwalk Pipeline’s facilities, sites and other properties be operated,
maintained, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities.

Failure to comply with
these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of corrective or remedial obligations, the occurrence of delays in the development of projects and the issuance of orders
enjoining performance of some or all of Boardwalk Pipeline’s operations in the affected areas. While Boardwalk Pipeline believes that its past operations have not resulted in the incurrence of material costs with respect to these existing
environmental laws and regulations, it can provide no assurance that continued compliance with existing requirements will not materially affect them, or that the current regulatory standards will not become more onerous in the future, resulting in
more significant costs to maintain compliance or increased exposure to significant liabilities.

Properties:

Boardwalk Pipeline is headquartered in approximately 103,000 square feet of leased office space located in Houston, Texas. Boardwalk Pipeline also leases approximately 60,000 square feet of office space in Owensboro, Kentucky. Boardwalk
Pipeline’s operating subsidiaries own their respective pipeline systems in fee. However, substantial portions of these systems are constructed and maintained on property owned by others pursuant to rights-of-way, easements, permits, licenses or
consents.

Competition:

Competition
from other hotels and lodging facilities is vigorous in all areas in which Loews Hotels operates. The demand for hotel rooms is seasonal and dependent on general and local economic conditions. Loews Hotels properties also compete with facilities
offering similar services in locations other than those in which its hotels are located. Competition among luxury hotels is based primarily on quality of location, facilities and service. Competition among resort and commercial hotels is based on
price and facilities as well as location and service. Because of the competitive nature of the industry, hotels must continually make expenditures for updating, refurnishing and repairs and maintenance, in order to prevent competitive obsolescence.

Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, CNA Financial Corporation

If CNA determines that its recorded insurance reserves are insufficient to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and
claim adjustment expenses, CNA may need to increase its insurance reserves which would result in a charge to CNA’s earnings.

CNA maintains insurance reserves to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses,
including the estimated cost of the claims adjudication process, for reported and unreported claims. Insurance reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex management estimates developed utilizing a variety of actuarial
reserve estimation techniques as of a given reporting date. The reserve estimation process involves a high degree of judgment and variability and is subject to a number of variables which are highly uncertain. These variables can be affected by both
changes in internal processes and external events. Key variables include claims severity, frequency of claims, mortality, morbidity, discount rates, inflation, claims handling, policies and procedures, case reserving approach, underwriting and
pricing policies, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured event and the time of its ultimate settlement. Mortality is the relative incidence of death. Morbidity is the frequency and
severity of injury, illness, sickness and diseases contracted.

There is generally a higher degree of variability in
estimating required reserves for long-tail coverages, such as general liability and workers’ compensation, as they require a relatively longer period of time for claims to be reported and settled. The impact of changes in inflation and medical
costs are more pronounced for long-tail coverages due to the longer settlement period.

CNA is also subject to the
uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as industry practices and legal, judicial, social, economic and other environmental conditions change. These issues have had, and may continue to have, a negative
effect on CNA’s business by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims, resulting in further increases in CNA’s reserves. The effects of these and other unforeseen
emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely difficult to predict.

Emerging or potential claims and coverage issues
include, but are not limited to, uncertainty in future medical costs in workers’ compensation. In particular, medical cost inflation could be greater than expected due to new treatments, drugs and devices; increased health care utilization;
and/or the future costs of health care facilities. In addition, the relationship between workers’ compensation and government and private health care providers could change, potentially shifting costs to workers’ compensation.

In light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making the judgments necessary to establish
reserve levels, CNA continually reviews and changes its reserve estimates in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops from the actual reporting and settlement of claims and as the legal, regulatory and economic environment evolves. If
CNA’s recorded reserves are insufficient for any reason, the required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient. These charges could be substantial.

CNA’s actual experience could vary from the key assumptions used to determine active life reserves for long term care
policies.

CNA’s active life reserves for long term care policies are based on CNA’s best estimate
assumptions as of December 31, 2015 with no margin for adverse deviation. Key assumptions include morbidity, persistency (the percentage of policies remaining in force), discount rate and future premium rate increases. These assumptions, which are
critical bases for its reserve estimates are inherently uncertain. If actual experience varies from these assumptions or the future outlook for these assumptions changes, CNA may be required to increase its reserves. See the Life & Group
Non-Core Policyholder Reserves portion of Reserves – Estimates and Uncertainties section of MD&A in Item 7 for more information.



Estimating future experience for long term care policies is highly uncertain
because the required projection period is very long and there is limited historical data and industry data available to CNA, as only a small portion of the long term care policies which have been written to date are in claims paying status.
Morbidity and persistency trends can be volatile and may be negatively affected by many factors including, but not limited to policyholder behavior, socioeconomic factors, changes in health trends and advances in medical care.

A prolonged period during which interest rates remain at levels lower than those anticipated in CNA’s reserving would
result in shortfalls in investment income on assets supporting CNA’s obligations under long term care policies, which may require changes to its reserves. This risk is more significant for CNA’s long term care products because the long
potential duration of the policy obligations exceeds the duration of the supporting investment assets. In addition, CNA may not receive regulatory approval for the level of premium rate increases it requests. Any adverse deviation between the level
of future premium rate increases approved and the level included in CNA’s reserving assumptions may require an increase to its reserves.

If CNA’s estimated reserves are insufficient for any reason, including changes in assumptions, the required increase in
reserves would be recorded as a charge against earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient. These charges could be substantial.

Catastrophe losses are unpredictable and could result in material losses.

Catastrophe losses are an inevitable part of CNA’s business. Various events can cause catastrophe losses. These events
can be natural or man-made, and may include hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, severe winter weather, fires, floods, riots, strikes, civil commotion and acts of terrorism. The frequency and severity of these catastrophe events are inherently
unpredictable. In addition, longer-term natural catastrophe trends may be changing and new types of catastrophe losses may be developing due to climate change, a phenomenon that has been associated with extreme weather events linked to rising
temperatures, and includes effects on global weather patterns, greenhouse gases, sea, land and air temperatures, sea levels, rain, hail and snow.

The extent of CNA’s losses from catastrophes is a function of the total amount of its insured exposures in the affected
areas, the frequency and severity of the events themselves, the level of reinsurance assumed and ceded reinsurance reinstatement premiums and state residual market assessments, if any. As in the case of catastrophe losses generally, it can take a
long time for the ultimate cost to CNA to be finally determined, as a multitude of factors contribute to such costs, including evaluation of general liability and pollution exposures, additional living expenses, infrastructure disruption, business
interruption and reinsurance collectibility. Reinsurance coverage for terrorism events is provided only in limited circumstances, especially in regard to “unconventional” terrorism acts, such as nuclear, biological, chemical or
radiological attacks. As a result of the items discussed above, catastrophe losses are particularly difficult to estimate.

Additionally, claim frequency and severity for some lines of business can be correlated to an external factor such as economic
activity, financial market volatility, increasing health care costs or changes in the legal or regulatory environment. Claim frequency and severity can also be correlated to insureds’ use of common business practices, equipment, vendors or
software. This can result in multiple insured losses emanating out of the same underlying cause. In these instances, CNA may be subject to increased claim frequency and severity across multiple policies or lines of business concurrently. While CNA
does not define such instances as catastrophes for financial reporting purposes, they are similar to catastrophes in terms of the uncertainty and potential impact on its results.

CNA has exposure related to A&EP claims, which could result in material losses.

CNA’s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have exposures related to A&EP claims. CNA’s experience has
been that establishing claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for casualty coverages relating to A&EP claims is subject to uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims. Additionally, traditional actuarial methods and
techniques employed to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional property and casualty exposures are less precise in estimating claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for A&EP. As a result, estimating the ultimate cost of
both reported and unreported A&EP claims is subject to a higher degree of variability.



On August 31, 2010, CNA completed a retroactive reinsurance transaction under
which substantially all of its legacy A&EP liabilities were ceded to National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., subject to an aggregate limit of $4.0 billion (loss portfolio transfer or
“LPT”). The cumulative amount ceded under the loss portfolio transfer as of December 31, 2015 is $2.6 billion. If the other parties to the loss portfolio transfer do not fully perform their obligations, net losses incurred on A&EP
claims covered by the loss portfolio transfer exceed the aggregate limit of $4.0 billion or CNA determines it has exposures to A&EP claims not covered by the loss portfolio transfer, CNA may need to increase its recorded net reserves which would
result in a charge against earnings. These charges could be substantial.

CNA faces intense competition in its industry; CNA may be
adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business as well as the availability and cost of reinsurance.

All aspects of the insurance industry are highly competitive and CNA must continuously allocate resources to refine and
improve its insurance products and services. CNA competes with a large number of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities for both distributors and customers. Insurers compete on the basis of factors including products, price,
services, ratings and financial strength. The competitor insurer landscape has evolved substantially in recent years, with significant consolidation and new market entrants, resulting in increased pressures on CNA’s ability to remain
competitive, particularly in implementing pricing that is both attractive to CNA’s customer base and risk appropriate to CNA. In addition, the property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high
levels of price competition, resulting in less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium
rates. During periods in which price competition is high, CNA may lose business to competitors offering competitive insurance products at lower prices. As a result, CNA’s premium levels and expense ratio could be materially adversely impacted.

Additionally, CNA purchases reinsurance to help manage its exposure to risk. Under CNA’s ceded reinsurance
arrangements, another insurer assumes a specified portion of CNA’s exposure in exchange for a specified portion of policy premiums. Market conditions determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection CNA purchases, which affects
the level of its business and profitability, as well as the level and types of risk CNA retains. If CNA is unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance at a cost it deems acceptable, CNA may be unwilling to bear the increased risk and would reduce the
level of its underwriting commitments.

CNA may not be able to collect amounts owed to it by reinsurers, which could result in
higher net incurred losses.

CNA has significant amounts recoverable from reinsurers which are reported as
receivables on its balance sheets and are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves. The ceding of insurance does not, however, discharge CNA’s primary liability for
claims. As a result, CNA is subject to credit risk relating to its ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers. Certain of CNA’s reinsurance carriers have experienced credit downgrades by rating agencies within the term of CNA’s
contractual relationship which increases the likelihood that CNA will not be able to recover amounts due. In addition, reinsurers could dispute amounts which CNA believes are due to it. If the amounts CNA collects from reinsurers are less than the
amount recorded for any of the foregoing reasons, its net incurred losses will be higher.

CNA may not be able to collect amounts
owed to it by policyholders who hold deductible policies and/or who purchase retrospectively rated policies, which could result in higher net incurred losses.

A portion of CNA’s business is written under deductible policies. Under these policies, CNA is obligated to pay the
related insurance claims and are reimbursed by the policyholder to the extent of the deductible, which may be significant. As a result, CNA is exposed to credit risk to the policyholder. If the amounts CNA collects from policyholders are less than
the amounts recorded, its incurred losses will be higher.

Moreover, certain policyholders purchase retrospectively rated
workers’ compensation policies (i.e., policies in which premiums are adjusted after the policy period based on the actual loss experience of the policyholder during the policy period). Retrospectively rated policies expose CNA to additional
credit risk to the extent that the adjusted premium is greater than the original premium.



CNA may incur significant realized and unrealized investment losses and volatility in net
investment income arising from changes in the financial markets.

CNA’s investment portfolio is exposed to
various risks, such as interest rate, credit spread, issuer default, equity prices and foreign currency, which are unpredictable. Financial markets are highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions, monetary policies, domestic and international
geopolitical issues and many other factors. Changes in financial markets including fluctuations in interest rates, credit, equity prices and foreign currency prices, and many other factors beyond CNA’s control can adversely affect the value of
its investments, the realization of investment income and the rate at which it discounts certain liabilities.

CNA has
significant holdings in fixed maturity investments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. A decline in interest rates may reduce the returns earned on new fixed maturity investments, thereby reducing CNA’s net investment income, while
an increase in interest rates may reduce the value of its existing fixed maturity investments. The value of CNA’s fixed maturity investments is also subject to risk that certain investments may default or become impaired due to deterioration in
the financial condition of issuers of the investments CNA holds. Any such impairments which CNA deems to be other-than-temporary would result in a charge to earnings.

In addition, CNA invests a portion of its assets in equity securities and limited partnerships which are subject to greater
market volatility than its fixed maturity investments. Limited partnership investments generally provide a lower level of liquidity than fixed maturity or equity investments and therefore may also limit CNA’s ability to withdraw assets. As a
result of all of these factors, CNA may not earn an adequate return on its investments, may be required to write down the value of its investments and may incur losses on the disposition of its investments.

CNA is subject to capital adequacy requirements and, if it is unable to maintain or raise sufficient capital to meet these requirements,
regulatory agencies may restrict or prohibit CNA from operating its business.

Insurance companies such as CNA are
subject to capital adequacy standards set by regulators to help identify companies that merit further regulatory attention. These standards apply specified risk factors to various asset, premium and reserve components of CNA’s legal entity
statutory basis of accounting financial statements. Current rules, including those promulgated by insurance regulators and specialized markets such as Lloyd’s, require companies to maintain statutory capital and surplus at a specified minimum
level determined using the applicable jurisdiction’s regulatory capital adequacy formula. If CNA does not meet these minimum requirements, CNA may be restricted or prohibited from operating its business. If CNA is required to record a material
charge against earnings in connection with a change in estimate or the occurrence of an event or if it incurs significant losses related to its investment portfolio, CNA may violate these minimum capital adequacy requirements unless it is able to
raise sufficient additional capital. CNA may be limited in its ability to raise significant amounts of capital on favorable terms or at all.

Globally, insurance regulators are working cooperatively to develop a common framework for the supervision of internationally
active insurance groups. Finalization and adoption of this framework could increase CNA’s minimum regulatory capital requirement as well as significantly increase its cost of regulatory compliance.

CNA’s insurance subsidiaries, upon whom CNA depends for dividends in order to fund its working capital needs, are limited by
insurance regulators in their ability to pay dividends.

CNA is a holding company and is dependent upon dividends,
loans and other sources of cash from its subsidiaries in order to meet its obligations. Ordinary dividend payments or dividends that do not require prior approval by the insurance subsidiaries’ domiciliary insurance regulator are generally
limited to amounts determined by formula which varies by jurisdiction. If CNA is restricted, by regulatory rule or otherwise, from paying or receiving intercompany dividends, CNA may not be able to fund its working capital needs and debt service
requirements from available cash. As a result, CNA would need to look to other sources of capital which may be more expensive or may not be available at all.



Rating agencies may downgrade their ratings of CNA and thereby adversely affect its ability
to write insurance at competitive rates or at all.

Ratings are an important factor in establishing the
competitive position of insurance companies. CNA’s insurance company subsidiaries, as well as CNA’s public debt, are rated by rating agencies, namely, A.M. Best Company (“A.M. Best”), Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.
(“Moody’s”) and Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”). Ratings reflect the rating agency’s opinions of an insurance company’s or insurance holding company’s financial strength, capital adequacy, operating
performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and debt holders.

The rating
agencies may take action to lower CNA’s ratings in the future as a result of any significant financial loss or possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies. The severity of the impact on CNA’s business is
dependent on the level of downgrade and, for certain products, which rating agency takes the rating action. Among the adverse effects in the event of such downgrades would be the inability to obtain a material volume of business from certain major
insurance brokers, the inability to sell a material volume of CNA’s insurance products to certain markets and the required collateralization of certain future payment obligations or reserves.

In addition, it is possible that a lowering of our corporate debt ratings by certain of the rating agencies could result in an
adverse impact on CNA’s ratings, independent of any change in CNA’s circumstances.

Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, Diamond Offshore
Drilling, Inc.

The worldwide demand for Diamond Offshore’s drilling services has declined significantly as a result of the decline in oil
prices, which commenced during the second half of 2014 and has continued into 2016.

Demand for Diamond
Offshore’s drilling services depends in large part upon oil and natural gas industry offshore exploration and production activity and expenditure levels, which are directly affected by oil and gas prices and market expectations of potential
changes in oil and gas prices. Commencing in the second half of 2014, oil prices have declined precipitously and recently fell to a 12-year low of less than $30 per barrel. The dramatic reduction in commodity prices has caused a sharp decline in the
demand for offshore drilling services, including services that Diamond Offshore provides and adversely affected its operations and cash flows in 2015. A prolonged period of low oil prices would have a material adverse effect on many of Diamond
Offshore’s customers and, therefore its business.

Oil prices have been, and are expected to continue to be, volatile
and are affected by numerous factors beyond Diamond Offshore’s control, including:

●

worldwide supply and demand for oil and gas;

●

the level of economic activity in energy-consuming markets;

●

the worldwide economic environment or economic trends, such as recessions;

●

the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) to set and maintain production levels and pricing;

●

the level of production in non-OPEC countries;

●

civil unrest and the worldwide political and military environment, including uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or additional
outbreak of armed hostilities involving the Middle East, Russia, other oil-producing regions or other geographic areas or further acts of terrorism in the United States or elsewhere;

●

the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and gas;

●

the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves;



●

the rate of decline of existing and new oil and gas reserves and production;

●

available pipeline and other oil and gas transportation and refining capacity;

●

the ability of oil and gas companies to raise capital;

●

weather conditions, including hurricanes, which can affect oil and gas operations over a wide area;

●

natural disasters or incidents resulting from operating hazards inherent in offshore drilling, such as oil spills;

●

the policies of various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and gas reserves;

●

technological advances affecting energy consumption, including development and exploitation of alternative fuels or energy sources;

●

laws and regulations relating to environmental or energy security matters, including those purporting to address global climate change;

●

domestic and foreign tax policy; and

●

advances in exploration and development technology.

An increase in commodity demand and prices will not necessarily result in an immediate increase in offshore drilling activity
since Diamond Offshore’s customers’ project development times, reserve replacement needs, and expectations of future commodity demand, prices and supply of available competing rigs all combine to affect demand for its rigs.

Diamond Offshore’s business depends on the level of activity in the offshore oil and gas industry, which has been cyclical and is
significantly affected by many factors outside of its control.

Demand for Diamond Offshore’s drilling
services depends upon the level of offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production in markets worldwide, and those activities depend in large part on oil and gas prices, worldwide demand for oil and gas and a variety of political and
economic factors. The level of offshore drilling activity is also adversely affected when operators reduce or defer new investment in offshore projects, reduce or suspend their drilling budgets or reallocate their drilling budgets away from offshore
drilling in favor of other priorities, such as shale or other land-based projects, which could reduce demand for Diamond Offshore’s rigs and newbuilds. As a result, Diamond Offshore’s business and the oil and gas industry in general are
subject to cyclical fluctuations.

As a result of the cyclical fluctuations in the market, there have been periods of
lower demand, excess rig supply and lower dayrates, followed by periods of higher demand, shorter rig supply and higher dayrates. Diamond Offshore cannot predict the timing or duration of such fluctuations. Periods of lower demand or excess rig
supply intensify the competition in the industry and often result in periods of lower utilization and lower dayrates. During these periods, Diamond Offshore’s rigs may not obtain contracts for future work and may be idle for long periods of
time or may be able to obtain work only under contracts with lower dayrates or less favorable terms which could have a material adverse effect on Diamond Offshore’s business during these periods. Additionally, prolonged periods of low
utilization and dayrates could also result in the recognition of impairment charges on certain of Diamond Offshore’s drilling rigs if future cash flow estimates, based upon information available to management at the time, indicate that the
carrying value of these rigs may not be recoverable.

Diamond Offshore’s industry is highly competitive, with oversupply and
intense price competition.

The offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive with numerous industry
participants. Some of Diamond Offshore’s competitors may be larger companies, have larger or more technologically advanced fleets and have greater financial or other resources than it does. The drilling industry has experienced consolidation in
the past



and may experience additional consolidation, which could create additional large competitors. Drilling contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis. Price is typically the
primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job; however, rig availability and location, a drilling contractor’s safety record and the quality and technical capability of service and equipment may also be considered.

Recent new rig construction and upgrades of existing drilling rigs, cancelation or termination of contracts, as well as
established rigs coming off contract during 2015, have contributed to the current oversupply of drilling rigs intensifying price competition. Additional newbuild rigs entering the market are expected to further negatively impact rig utilization and
intensify price competition as rigs are delivered.

Diamond Offshore provides offshore drilling services to a customer
base that includes major and independent oil and gas companies and government-owned oil companies. During 2015, one of Diamond Offshore’s customers in Brazil, Petrobras, and Diamond Offshore’s five largest customers in the aggregate
accounted for 24% and 65%, of its annual total consolidated revenues. The loss of a significant customer could have a material adverse impact on Diamond Offshore’s financial results especially in a declining market where the number of Diamond
Offshore’s working drilling rigs is declining along with the number of its active customers. In addition, if a significant customer experiences liquidity constraints or other financial difficulties, it could materially adversely affect
utilization rates in the affected market and also displace demand for Diamond Offshore’s other drilling rigs and newbuilds as the resulting excess supply enters the market. While it is normal for Diamond Offshore’s customer base to change
over time as work programs are completed, the loss of or a significant reduction in the number of rigs contracted with any major customer may have a material adverse effect on Diamond Offshore’s future business.

Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance that its drilling contracts will not be terminated early or that its current backlog of
contract drilling revenue will be ultimately realized.

Currently, Diamond Offshore’s customers may terminate
their drilling contracts under certain circumstances, such as if the drilling rig is destroyed or lost, if Diamond Offshore suspends drilling operations for a specified period of time as a result of a breakdown of major equipment, excessive downtime
for repairs, failure to meet minimum performance criteria (including customer acceptance testing) or, in some cases, due to other events beyond the control of either party. Diamond Offshore’s drilling contract for the

Ocean BlackLion

,
for example, requires it to successfully complete certain testing procedures for the rig’s equipment, including the blowout preventers and well control systems. Diamond Offshore is currently undergoing the required testing. If these tests are
not successfully completed, Diamond Offshore’s customer has the right to terminate the drilling contract or may request a renegotiation of the terms of the contract.

In addition, some of Diamond Offshore’s drilling contracts permit the customer to terminate the contract after specified
notice periods often by tendering contractually specified termination amounts, which may not fully compensate Diamond Offshore for the loss of the contract. During depressed market conditions, certain customers have utilized such contract clauses to
seek to renegotiate or terminate a drilling contract or claim that Diamond Offshore has breached provisions of its drilling contracts in order to avoid their obligations to Diamond Offshore under circumstances where it believes it is in compliance
with the contracts. Additionally, because of depressed commodity prices, restricted credit markets, economic downturns, changes in priorities or strategy or other factors beyond Diamond Offshore’s control, a customer may no longer want or need
a rig that is currently under contract or may be able to obtain a comparable rig at a lower dayrate. For these reasons, customers may seek to renegotiate the terms of Diamond Offshore’s existing drilling contracts, terminate their contracts
without justification or repudiate or otherwise fail to perform their obligations under the contracts. Such renegotiations could include requests to lower the contract dayrate, lowering of a dayrate in exchange for additional contract term,
shortening the term on one contracted rig in exchange for additional term on another rig, early termination of a contract in exchange for a lump sum margin payout and many other possibilities. Diamond Offshore’s contract backlog may be
adversely impacted as a result of such contract renegotiations.

When a customer terminates a contract prior to the
contract’s scheduled expiration, Diamond Offshore’s contract backlog is adversely impacted, and it might not recover any compensation for the termination or any recovery Diamond Offshore might obtain may not fully compensate it for the
loss of the contract. In any case, the early termination of a contract may result in Diamond Offshore’s rig being idle for an extended period of time. Each of these results could have a material adverse effect on Diamond Offshore’s
business. In addition, if a customer cancels



a contract or if Diamond Offshore elects to terminate a contract due to the customer’s nonperformance and in either case Diamond Offshore is unable to secure a new contract on a timely basis
and on substantially similar terms, or if a contract is disputed or suspended for an extended period of time or if a contract is renegotiated, it could materially and adversely affect Diamond Offshore’s business.

Generally, Diamond Offshore’s contract backlog only includes future revenues under firm commitments; however, from time
to time, Diamond Offshore may report anticipated commitments for which definitive agreements have not yet been, but are expected to be, executed. Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance in such cases that it will be able to ultimately execute a
definitive agreement. In addition, for the reasons described above, Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance that its customers will be willing or able to fulfill their contractual commitments. Diamond Offshore’s inability to perform under its
contractual obligations or to execute definitive agreements, or its customers’ inability or unwillingness to fulfill their contractual commitments to Diamond Offshore, may have a material adverse effect on Diamond Offshore’s business.

Diamond Offshore may not be able to renew or replace expiring contracts for its rigs.

Diamond Offshore has a number of customer contracts that will expire in 2016 and 2017. Diamond Offshore’s ability to
renew or replace expiring contracts or obtain new contracts, and the terms of any such contracts, will depend on various factors, including market conditions and the specific needs of its customers. Given the highly competitive and historically
cyclical nature of the industry, Diamond Offshore may not be able to renew or replace the contracts or it may be required to renew or replace expiring contracts or obtain new contracts at dayrates that are below, and potentially substantially below,
existing dayrates, or that have terms that are less favorable than existing contracts or it may be unable to secure contracts for these rigs.

Diamond Offshore’s contract drilling expense includes fixed costs that will not decline in proportion to decreases in rig
utilization and dayrates.

Diamond Offshore’s contract drilling expense includes all direct and indirect
costs associated with the operation, maintenance and support of its drilling equipment, which is often not affected by changes in dayrates and utilization. During periods of reduced revenue and/or activity, certain of Diamond Offshore’s fixed
costs will not decline and often it may incur additional operating costs, such as fuel and catering costs, for which it is generally reimbursed by the customer when a rig is under contract. During times of reduced utilization, reductions in costs
may not be immediate as Diamond Offshore may incur additional costs associated with cold stacking of a rig (particularly if Diamond Offshore cold stacks a newer rig, such as a drillship, for which cold stacking costs are typically substantially
higher than for a jack-up rig or an older floater rig), or it may not be able to fully reduce the cost of its support operations in a particular geographic region due to the need to support the remaining drilling rigs in that region. A decline in
revenue due to lower dayrates and/or utilization may not be offset by a corresponding decrease in contract drilling expense and could have a material adverse effect on Diamond Offshore’s business.

Diamond Offshore may enter into drilling contracts that expose it to greater risks than it normally assumes.

From time to time, Diamond Offshore may enter into drilling contracts with national oil companies, government-controlled
entities or others that expose it to greater risks than it normally assumes, such as exposure to greater environmental or other liability and more onerous termination provisions giving the customer a right to terminate without cause or upon little
or no notice. Upon termination, these contracts may not result in a payment to Diamond Offshore, or if a termination payment is required, it may not fully compensate Diamond Offshore for the loss of a contract. In addition, the early termination of
a contract may result in a rig being idle for an extended period of time, which could adversely affect Diamond Offshore’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. While Diamond Offshore believes that the financial terms of
these contracts and its operating safeguards in place may partially mitigate these risks, it can provide no assurance that the increased risk exposure will not have a material negative impact on future operations or financial results.



Contracts for Diamond Offshore’s drilling rigs are generally fixed dayrate contracts,
and increases in Diamond Offshore’s operating costs could adversely affect the profitability on those contracts.

Diamond Offshore’s contracts for its drilling rigs generally provide for the payment of a fixed dayrate per rig operating
day, although some contracts do provide for a limited escalation in dayrate due to increased operating costs it incurs on the project. Many of Diamond Offshore’s operating costs, such as labor costs, are unpredictable and fluctuate based on
events beyond its control. In addition, equipment repair and maintenance expenses fluctuate depending on the type of activity the rig is performing, the age and condition of the equipment and general market factors impacting relevant parts,
components and services. The gross margin that Diamond Offshore realizes on these fixed dayrate contracts will fluctuate based on variations in its operating costs over the terms of the contracts. In addition, for contracts with dayrate escalation
clauses, Diamond Offshore may not be able to fully recover increased or unforeseen costs from its customers. Diamond Offshore’s inability to recover these increased or unforeseen costs from its customers could materially and adversely affect
its business.

Rig conversions, upgrades or newbuilds may be subject to delays and cost overruns.

From time to time, Diamond Offshore adds new capacity through conversions or upgrades to its existing rigs or through new
construction, such as the harsh environment, ultra-deepwater semisubmersible rig,

Ocean GreatWhite

, which is currently under construction. Projects of this type are subject to risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction
project resulting from numerous factors, including the following:

●

shortages of equipment, materials or skilled labor;

●

work stoppages;

●

unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment;

●

unanticipated cost increases or change orders;

●

weather interferences or storm damage;

●

difficulties in obtaining necessary permits or in meeting permit conditions;

●

design and engineering problems;

●

disputes with shipyards or suppliers;

●

availability of suppliers to recertify equipment for enhanced regulations;

●

customer acceptance delays;

●

shipyard failures or unavailability; and

●

failure or delay of third party service providers, civil unrest and labor disputes.

Failure to complete a rig upgrade or new construction on time, or failure to complete a rig conversion or new construction in
accordance with its design specifications may, in some circumstances, result in the delay, renegotiation or cancellation of a drilling contract, resulting in a loss of contract drilling backlog and revenue to Diamond Offshore. If a drilling contract
is terminated under these circumstances, Diamond Offshore may not be able to secure a replacement contract, or if it does secure a replacement contract, it may not contain equally favorable terms. In addition, impairment write-offs could result if a
rig’s carrying value becomes excessive due to spending over budget on a newbuild construction project or major rig upgrade.



Diamond Offshore’s business involves numerous operating hazards which could expose it
to significant losses and significant damage claims. Diamond Offshore is not fully insured against all of these risks and its contractual indemnity provisions may not fully protect Diamond Offshore.

Diamond Offshore’s operations are subject to the significant hazards inherent in drilling for oil and gas offshore, such
as blowouts, reservoir damage, loss of production, loss of well control, unstable or faulty sea floor conditions, fires and natural disasters such as hurricanes. The occurrence of any of these types of events could result in the suspension of
drilling operations, damage to or destruction of the equipment involved and injury or death to rig personnel, damage to producing or potentially productive oil and gas formations, and oil spillage, oil leaks, well blowouts and extensive uncontrolled
fires, any of which could cause significant environmental damage. In addition, offshore drilling operations are subject to marine hazards, including capsizing, grounding, collision and loss or damage from severe weather. Operations also may be
suspended because of machinery breakdowns, abnormal drilling conditions, failure of suppliers or subcontractors to perform or supply goods or services or personnel shortages. Any of the foregoing events could result in significant damage or loss to
Diamond Offshore’s properties and assets or the properties and assets of others, injury or death to rig personnel or others, significant loss of revenues and significant damage claims against Diamond Offshore, which could have a material
adverse effect on its business.

Diamond Offshore’s drilling contracts with its customers provide for varying levels
of indemnity and allocation of liabilities between its customers and Diamond Offshore with respect to the hazards and risks inherent in, and damages or losses arising out of, its operations, and Diamond Offshore may not be fully protected. Diamond
Offshore’s contracts with its customers generally provide that Diamond Offshore and its customers each assume liability for their respective personnel and property. Diamond Offshore’s contracts also generally provide that its customers
assume most of the responsibility for and indemnify Diamond Offshore against loss, damage or other liability resulting from, among other hazards and risks, pollution originating from the well and subsurface damage or loss, while Diamond Offshore
typically retains responsibility for and indemnifies its customers against pollution originating from the rig. However, in certain drilling contracts Diamond Offshore may not be fully indemnified by its customers for damage to their property and/or
the property of their other contractors. In certain contracts Diamond Offshore may assume liability for losses or damages (including punitive damages) resulting from pollution or contamination caused by negligent or willful acts of commission or
omission by Diamond Offshore, its suppliers and/or subcontractors, generally subject to negotiated caps on a per occurrence basis and/or on an aggregate basis for the term of the contract. In some cases, suppliers or subcontractors who provide
equipment or services to Diamond Offshore may seek to limit their liability resulting from pollution or contamination. Diamond Offshore’s contracts are individually negotiated, and the levels of indemnity and allocation of liabilities in them
can vary from contract to contract depending on market conditions, particular customer requirements and other factors existing at the time a contract is negotiated.

Additionally, the enforceability of indemnification provisions in Diamond Offshore’s contracts may be limited or
prohibited by applicable law or may not be enforced by courts having jurisdiction, and Diamond Offshore could be held liable for substantial losses or damages and for fines and penalties imposed by regulatory authorities. The indemnification
provisions of Diamond Offshore’s contracts may be subject to differing interpretations, and the laws or courts of certain jurisdictions may enforce such provisions while other laws or courts may find them to be unenforceable, void or limited by
public policy considerations, including when the cause of the underlying loss or damage is Diamond Offshore’s gross negligence or willful misconduct, when punitive damages are attributable to Diamond Offshore or when fines or penalties are
imposed directly against Diamond Offshore. The law with respect to the enforceability of indemnities varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and is unsettled under certain laws that are applicable to Diamond Offshore’s contracts. Current or
future litigation in particular jurisdictions, whether or not Diamond Offshore is a party, may impact the interpretation and enforceability of indemnification provisions in its contracts. There can be no assurance that Diamond Offshore’s
contracts with its customers, suppliers and subcontractors will fully protect it against all hazards and risks inherent in its operations. There can also be no assurance that those parties with contractual obligations to indemnify Diamond Offshore
will be financially able to do so or will otherwise honor their contractual obligations.

Diamond Offshore maintains
liability insurance, which includes coverage for environmental damage; however, because of contractual provisions and policy limits, Diamond Offshore’s insurance coverage may not adequately cover its losses and claim costs. In addition, certain
risks such as pollution, reservoir damage and environmental risks are generally not fully insurable. Also, Diamond Offshore does not typically purchase loss-of-hire insurance to



cover lost revenues when a rig is unable to work. Accordingly, it is possible that Diamond Offshore’s losses from the hazards it faces could have a material adverse effect on its business.

Diamond Offshore believes that the policy limit under its marine liability insurance is within the range that is
customary for companies of its size in the offshore drilling industry and is appropriate for its business. However, if an accident or other event occurs that exceeds Diamond Offshore’s coverage limits or is not an insurable event under its
insurance policies, or is not fully covered by contractual indemnity, it could have a material adverse effect on Diamond Offshore’s business. There can be no assurance that Diamond Offshore will continue to carry the insurance it currently
maintains, that its insurance will cover all types of losses or that Diamond Offshore will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates it considers to be reasonable or that Diamond Offshore will be able to obtain insurance against
some risks.

Diamond Offshore has elected to self-insure for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the
GOM.

Because the amount of insurance coverage available to Diamond Offshore has been limited, and the cost for
such coverage is substantial, Diamond Offshore self-insures for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the GOM. This results in a higher risk of losses, which could be material, that are not covered by third party
insurance contracts.

In addition, certain of Diamond Offshore’s shore-based facilities are located in geographic
regions that are susceptible to damage or disruption from hurricanes and other weather events. Future hurricanes or similar natural disasters that impact Diamond Offshore’s facilities, its personnel located at those facilities or its ongoing
operations may negatively affect its business for those periods. These negative effects may include reduced or lost sales and revenues; costs associated with interruption in operations and with resuming operations; reduced demand for Diamond
Offshore’s services from customers that were similarly affected by these events; lost market share; late deliveries; uninsured property losses; inadequate business interruption insurance; employee evacuations; and an inability to retain
necessary staff.

Significant portions of Diamond Offshore’s operations are conducted outside the United States and involve
additional risks not associated with United States domestic operations.

Diamond Offshore’s operations
outside the United States accounted for approximately 79%, 85% and 89% of its total consolidated revenues for 2015, 2014 and 2013 and include operations in South America, Australia and Southeast Asia, Europe, East and West Africa, the Mediterranean
and Mexico. Because Diamond Offshore operates in various regions throughout the world, it is exposed to risks of war, political disruption, civil disturbance, acts of terrorism, political corruption, possible economic and legal sanctions (such as
possible restrictions against countries that the U.S. government may consider to be state sponsors of terrorism) and changes in global trade policies. Diamond Offshore may not have insurance coverage for these risks, or it may not be able to obtain
adequate insurance coverage for such events at reasonable rates. Diamond Offshore’s operations may become restricted, disrupted or prohibited in any country in which any of the foregoing risks occur. In particular, the occurrence of any of
these risks or any of the following events could materially and adversely impact Diamond Offshore’s business:

●

political and economic instability;

●

piracy, terrorism or other assaults on property or personnel;

●

kidnapping of personnel;

●

seizure, expropriation, nationalization, deprivation, malicious damage or other loss of possession or use of property or equipment;

●

renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts;

●

disputes and legal proceedings in international jurisdictions;



●

changing social, political and economic conditions;

●

enactment of additional or stricter U.S. government or international sanctions;

●

imposition of wage and price controls, trade barriers or import-export quotas;

●

restrictive foreign and domestic monetary policies;

●

the inability to repatriate income or capital;

●

difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods;

●

fluctuations in currency exchange rates and restrictions on currency exchange;

●

regulatory or financial requirements to comply with foreign bureaucratic actions;

●

restriction or disruption of business activities;

●

limitation of access to markets for periods of time;

●

travel limitations or operational problems caused by public health threats;

●

difficulties in supplying, repairing or replacing equipment or transporting personnel in remote locations;

●

difficulties in obtaining visas or work permits for employees on a timely basis; and

●

changing taxation policies and confiscatory or discriminatory taxation.

Diamond Offshore is also subject to the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control and other U.S. laws
and regulations governing its international operations in addition to worldwide anti-bribery laws. In addition, international contract drilling operations are subject to various laws and regulations in countries in which Diamond Offshore operates,
including laws and regulations relating to:

●

the equipping and operation of drilling rigs;

●

import-export quotas or other trade barriers;

●

repatriation of foreign earnings or capital;

●

oil and gas exploration and development;

●

local content requirements;

●

taxation of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel; and

●

use and compensation of local employees and suppliers by foreign contractors.

Some foreign governments favor or effectively require the awarding of drilling contracts to local contractors, require use of
a local agent or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. These practices may adversely affect Diamond Offshore’s ability to compete in those regions. It is difficult to predict
what governmental regulations may be enacted in the future that could adversely affect the international offshore drilling industry. The actions of foreign governments may materially and adversely affect Diamond Offshore’s ability to compete.



In addition, the shipment of goods, including the movement of a drilling rig
across international borders, subjects Diamond Offshore to extensive trade laws and regulations. Diamond Offshore’s import activities are governed by unique customs laws and regulations that differ in each of the countries in which Diamond
Offshore operates and often impose record keeping and reporting obligations. The laws and regulations concerning import/export activity and record keeping and reporting requirements are complex and change frequently. These laws and regulations may
be enacted, amended, enforced and/or interpreted in a manner that could materially and adversely impact Diamond Offshore’s operations. Shipments can be delayed and denied export or entry for a variety of reasons, some of which may be outside of
Diamond Offshore’s control. Shipping delays or denials could cause unscheduled downtime for rigs. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal and civil penalties, economic sanctions, seizure of shipments and/or
the contractual withholding of monies owed to Diamond Offshore, among other things.

Diamond Offshore may be required to accrue
additional tax liability on certain of its foreign earnings.

Certain of Diamond Offshore’s international
rigs are owned and operated, directly or indirectly, by Diamond Foreign Asset Company (“DFAC”), a Cayman Islands subsidiary that it owns. It is Diamond Offshore’s intention to indefinitely reinvest future earnings of DFAC and its
foreign subsidiaries to finance foreign activities. Diamond Offshore does not expect to provide for U.S. taxes on any future earnings generated by DFAC and its foreign subsidiaries, except to the extent that these earnings are immediately subjected
to U.S. federal income tax. Should a future distribution be made from any unremitted earnings of this subsidiary, Diamond Offshore may be required to record additional U.S. income taxes, that, if material, could have a material adverse effect on
Diamond Offshore’s business.

Fluctuations in exchange rates and nonconvertibility of currencies could result in losses.

Due to Diamond Offshore’s international operations, Diamond Offshore has experienced currency exchange
losses where revenues are received and expenses are paid in nonconvertible currencies or where it does not effectively hedge an exposure to a foreign currency. Diamond Offshore may also incur losses as a result of an inability to collect revenues
because of a shortage of convertible currency available to the country of operation, controls over currency exchange or controls over the repatriation of income or capital.

Diamond Offshore relies on third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to secure equipment, components and parts used in
rig operations, conversions, upgrades and construction.

Diamond Offshore’s reliance on third-party
suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to provide equipment and services exposes it to volatility in the quality, price and availability of such items. Certain components, parts and equipment that are used in Diamond Offshore’s
operations may be available only from a small number of suppliers, manufacturers or service providers. The failure of one or more third-party suppliers, manufacturers or service providers to provide equipment, components, parts or services, whether
due to capacity constraints, production or delivery disruptions, price increases, quality control issues, recalls or other decreased availability of parts and equipment, is beyond Diamond Offshore’s control and could materially disrupt its
operations or result in the delay, renegotiation or cancellation of drilling contracts, thereby causing a loss of contract drilling backlog and/or revenue, as well as an increase in operating costs.

Additionally, Diamond Offshore’s suppliers, manufacturers and service providers could be negatively impacted by current
industry conditions or global economic conditions. If certain of Diamond Offshore’s suppliers, manufacturers or service providers were to experience significant cash flow issues, become insolvent or otherwise curtail or discontinue their
business as a result of such conditions, it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies or equipment available to Diamond Offshore and/or a significant increase in the price of such supplies and equipment, which could adversely impact
Diamond Offshore’s business.



Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP

Boardwalk Pipeline’s actual construction and development costs could exceed its forecast, and its cash flow from construction and
development projects may not be immediate, which may limit its ability to maintain or increase cash distributions.

Boardwalk Pipeline is engaged in multiple significant construction projects involving existing and new assets for which it has
expended or will expend significant capital and it expects to engage in additional growth projects of this type. The construction of new assets involves regulatory, environmental, legal, political, materials and labor cost, operational and other
risks that are difficult to predict and beyond Boardwalk Pipeline’s control. Any of these projects may not be completed on time or at all, may be impacted by significant cost overruns or may be materially changed prior to completion as a result
of developments or circumstances that Boardwalk Pipeline is not aware of when it commits to the project, including the ability of any foundation shipper to provide adequate credit support or to otherwise perform their obligations under any precedent
agreements. Any of these factors could result in material unexpected costs or have a material adverse effect on Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits from its growth projects.

Boardwalk Pipeline’s revenues and cash flows may not increase immediately on its expenditure of funds on a particular
project. For example, if Boardwalk Pipeline builds a new pipeline or expands an existing facility, the design, construction and development may occur over an extended period of time and Boardwalk Pipeline may not receive any increase in revenue or
cash flow from that project until after it is placed in service and customers begin using the new facilities.

Boardwalk Pipeline is
exposed to credit risk relating to nonperformance by its customers.

Credit risk relates to the risk of loss
resulting from the nonperformance by a customer of its contractual obligations. Credit risk exists in relation to Boardwalk Pipeline’s growth projects, both because foundation shippers have made long term commitments to Boardwalk Pipeline for
capacity on such projects and certain of the foundation shippers have agreed to provide credit support as construction progresses. If a foundation shipper fails to meet the contractual credit requirements, an adjustment to the scope of the project
could occur to accommodate a reduced volume commitment or Boardwalk Pipeline may be forced to find new customers to replace the defaulting customer, which could reduce the returns on the project. Boardwalk Pipeline’s exposure also relates to
receivables for services provided, future performance under firm agreements and volumes of gas owed by customers for imbalances or gas loaned by it to them under certain NNS and PAL services.

Boardwalk Pipeline relies on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of revenues. For 2015, no one customer
comprised more than 10% of its operating revenues, and the top ten customers comprised approximately 45% of revenues. If any of Boardwalk Pipeline’s significant customers have credit or financial problems which result in a delay or failure to
pay for services provided by Boardwalk Pipeline or contracted for with them, to post the required credit support for construction associated with its growth projects or to repay the gas they owe Boardwalk Pipeline, it could have a material adverse
effect on its business. In addition, Boardwalk Pipeline’s FERC gas tariffs only allow it to require limited credit support in the event that transportation customers are unable to pay for Boardwalk Pipeline’s services.

Natural gas producers comprise a significant portion of Boardwalk Pipeline’s revenues and support several of its growth
projects. For example, in 2015, approximately 50% of Boardwalk Pipeline’s revenues were generated from contracts with natural gas producers. During 2015, the prices of oil and natural gas declined significantly from an increase in supplies
mainly from shale production areas in the U.S. Should the prices of natural gas and oil remain at current levels for a sustained period of time, or decline further, Boardwalk Pipeline could be exposed to increased credit risk associated with its
producer customer group, which would adversely impact Boardwalk Pipeline’s business.



Boardwalk Pipeline may not be able to replace expiring natural gas transportation contracts
at attractive rates or on a long-term basis and may not be able to sell short-term services at attractive rates or at all due to market conditions such as narrower basis differentials and sustained changes in the levels of natural gas and oil prices
which adversely affect the value of its transportation services.

Transportation rates Boardwalk Pipeline is able
to charge customers are heavily influenced by longer-term trends in, for example, the amount and geographical location of natural gas production and demand for gas by end-users such as power plants, petrochemical facilities and LNG export
facilities. As a result of changes in longer-term trends, a sustained narrowing of basis differentials corresponding to traditional flow patterns on Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipeline systems (generally south to north and west to east) has occurred,
reducing the transportation rates and adversely impacting other contract terms Boardwalk Pipeline can negotiate with its customers for available transportation capacity and for contracts scheduled for renewal.

Each year, a portion of Boardwalk Pipeline’s firm natural gas transportation contracts expire and need to be renewed or
replaced. Over the past several years, Boardwalk Pipeline has renewed many expiring contracts at lower rates and for shorter terms than in the past, or not at all. Boardwalk Pipeline expects this trend to continue, mainly for contracts to transport
gas from west to east across its system, and therefore, it may not be able to sell its available capacity, extend expiring contracts with existing customers or obtain replacement contracts at attractive rates or for the same term as the expiring
contracts. The prevailing market conditions may also lead some of Boardwalk Pipeline’s customers, particularly customers that are experiencing financial difficulties, to seek to renegotiate existing contracts to terms that are less attractive
to it. These sustained conditions have had, and Boardwalk Pipeline expects will continue to have, a materially adverse effect on revenues, earnings and distributable cash flows.

In 2008 and 2009, Boardwalk Pipeline placed into service a number of large new pipelines and expansions of its system,
including its East Texas Pipeline, Southeast Expansion, Gulf Crossing Pipeline, and Fayetteville and Greenville Laterals. These projects were supported by firm transportation agreements with anchor shippers, typically having a term of ten years and
pricing and other terms negotiated based on then current market conditions, which included wider basis spreads and, correspondingly, higher transportation rates than those prevailing in the current market. As a result, in 2018 and 2019, Boardwalk
Pipeline will have significantly more transportation contract expirations than other years. Boardwalk Pipeline cannot predict what market conditions will prevail at the time such contracts expire, but if the contracts are renewed, it expects that
these contracts will renew at lower transportation rates than when the contracts were initially executed. For example, if these contracts were renewed at current transportation market rates, revenues earned from these transportation contracts would
be materially lower. If Boardwalk Pipeline is unable to renew or replace these and other expiring contracts when they expire, or if the terms of any such renewal or replacement contracts are not as favorable as the expiring agreements, its revenues
and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. These market factors and conditions could materially impact Boardwalk Pipeline’s business.

Changes in energy prices, including natural gas, oil and NGLs, impact supply of and demand for those commodities, which impact Boardwalk
Pipeline’s business.

Boardwalk Pipeline’s business is not significantly impacted by the short-term
change in commodity prices, however, its customers, a significant amount of which are producers, are directly impacted by changes in commodity prices, which can impact Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to renew contracts at existing capacities or
rates or impact the producer’s ability to make payment for the services it provides. The prices of natural gas, oil and NGLs fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors. If the
recent dramatic declines in the levels of natural gas, oil and NGLs prices mentioned above were to continue for a sustained period of time, the businesses of Boardwalk Pipeline’s producer customer group would be adversely affected which, in
turn, would reduce the demand for Boardwalk Pipeline’s services and could result in defaults or the non-renewal of contracted capacity when existing contracts expire. Conversely, future increases in the price of natural gas and NGLs could make
alternative energy and feedstock sources more competitive and reduce demand for natural gas and NGLs. A reduced level of demand for natural gas and NGLs could reduce the utilization of capacity on Boardwalk Pipeline’s systems, reduce the demand
for its services and could result in the non-renewal of contracted capacity as contracts expire and adversely impact its revenues, earnings and distributable cash flow.



Legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to pipeline safety that require the use of
new or more stringent safety controls, substantial changes to existing integrity management programs, or more stringent enforcement of applicable legal requirements could subject Boardwalk Pipeline to increased capital and operating costs and
operational delays.

Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipelines are subject to regulation by PHMSA of the DOT under the
NGPSA with respect to natural gas and the HLPSA with respect to NGLs. The NGPSA and HLPSA govern the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of natural gas and NGLs pipeline facilities. These laws have
resulted in the adoption of rules by PHMSA, that, among other things, require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections, correction of identified anomalies and other measures to
ensure pipeline safety in high consequence areas (HCAs), such as high population areas, areas unusually sensitive to environmental damage and commercially navigable waterways. In addition, states have adopted regulations similar to existing PHMSA
regulations for certain intrastate natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines, which regulations may impose more stringent requirements than found under federal law. Compliance with these rules has resulted in an overall increase in maintenance
costs. New laws or regulations adopted by PHMSA may impose more stringent requirements applicable to integrity management programs and other pipeline safety aspects of Boardwalk Pipeline’s operations, which could cause it to incur increased
capital and operating costs and operational delays.

The NGPSA and HLPSA were most recently updated by the 2011 Act, which
was signed into law in early 2012. Under the 2011 Act, maximum civil penalties for certain violations have been increased to $200,000 per violation per day, with a total cap of $2.0 million. The 2011 Act reauthorized the federal pipeline safety
programs of PHMSA through 2015, and directs the Secretary of Transportation to undertake a number of reviews, studies and reports, some of which may result in more stringent safety controls or inspections or additional natural gas and hazardous
liquids pipeline safety rulemaking. Among other things, the 2011 Act directed the Secretary of Transportation to promulgate rules relating to expanded integrity management requirements, automatic or remote-controlled valve use, excess flow valve
use, leak detection system installation, pipeline material strength testing and verification of maximum allowable pressures of certain pipelines. Although a number of the mandates imposed under the 2011 Act have yet to be acted upon by PHMSA, the
provisions of the 2011 Act continue to have the potential to cause owners and operators of pipeline facilities to incur significant capital expenditures and/or operating costs. New pipeline safety legislation that will reauthorize the federal
pipeline safety programs of PHMSA through 2019 will be under consideration. Passage of new legislation reauthorizing the PHMSA pipeline safety programs is expected to require, among other things, pursuit of those legal mandates included in the 2011
Act but not acted upon by PHMSA.

Further, Boardwalk Pipeline has entered into firm transportation contracts with shippers
that utilize the design capacity of certain of pipeline assets, assuming that Boardwalk Pipeline operates those pipeline assets at higher than normal operating pressures of up to 0.80 of the pipeline’s SMYS. Boardwalk Pipeline has authority
from PHMSA to operate those pipeline assets at such higher pressures; however, PHMSA retains discretion to withdraw or modify this authority. If PHMSA were to withdraw or materially modify such authority, Boardwalk Pipeline may not be able to
transport all of its contracted quantities of natural gas on its pipeline assets and could incur significant additional costs to re-obtain such authority or to develop alternate ways to meet its contractual obligations.

Boardwalk Pipeline may not continue making distributions to unitholders at the current distribution rate, or at all.

The amount of cash Boardwalk Pipeline has available to distribute to its unitholders principally depends upon the amount of
cash it generates from its operations and financing activities and the amount of cash it requires, or determines to use, for other purposes, all of which fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on a number of factors, many of which are beyond the
control of Boardwalk Pipeline. Some of the factors that influence the amount of cash Boardwalk Pipeline has available for distribution in any quarter include:

•

fluctuations in cash generated by its operations, including, as a result of the seasonality of its business, customer payment issues and the timing
of payments, general business conditions and market conditions, which impact, for example, contract renewals, pricing, basis spreads, time period price spreads, market rates and supply and demand for natural gas and Boardwalk Pipeline’s
services;



•

the level of capital expenditures Boardwalk Pipeline makes or anticipate making, including for expansion, growth projects and acquisitions;

•

the amount of cash necessary to meet current or anticipated debt service requirements and other liabilities;

•

fluctuations in working capital needs;

•

the ability to borrow funds and/or access capital markets on acceptable terms to fund operations or capital expenditures, including acquisitions,
and restrictions contained in its debt agreements;

•

the cost and form of payment for pending or anticipated acquisitions and growth or expansion projects and the timing and commercial success of any
such initiatives; and

•

unanticipated costs to operate Boardwalk Pipeline’s business, such as for maintenance and regulatory compliance.

There is no guarantee that unitholders will receive quarterly distributions from Boardwalk Pipeline. Boardwalk Pipeline’s
distributions are determined each quarter by the board of directors of its general partner based on the board’s consideration of Boardwalk Pipeline’s financial position, earnings, cash flow, current and future business needs and other
relevant factors at that time. Boardwalk Pipeline may reduce or eliminate distributions at any time it determines that its cash reserves are insufficient or are otherwise required to fund current or anticipated future operations, capital
expenditures, acquisitions, growth or expansion projects, debt repayment or other business needs.

Boardwalk Pipeline may not be
successful in executing its strategy to grow and diversify its business.

Boardwalk Pipeline relies primarily on
the revenues generated from its long-haul natural gas transportation and storage services. As a result, negative developments in these services have significantly greater impact on Boardwalk Pipeline’s financial condition and results of
operations than if it maintained more diverse assets. Boardwalk Pipeline is pursuing a strategy of growing and diversifying its business through acquisition and development of assets in complementary areas of the midstream energy sector, such as
liquids transportation and storage assets, among others. Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to grow, diversify and increase distributable cash flows will depend, in part, on its ability to close and execute on accretive acquisitions and projects.
Boardwalk Pipeline may not be successful in acquiring or developing such assets or may do so on terms that ultimately are not profitable. Any such transactions involve potential risks that may include, among other things:

•

the diversion of management’s and employees’ attention from other business concerns;

•

inaccurate assumptions about volume, revenues and project costs, including potential synergies;

•

a decrease in Boardwalk Pipeline’s liquidity as a result of using available cash or borrowing capacity to finance the acquisition or project;

•

a significant increase in interest expense or financial leverage if it incurs additional debt to finance the acquisition or project;

•

inaccurate assumptions about the overall costs of equity or debt;

•

an inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate the acquired business and assets or the developed assets;

•

unforeseen difficulties operating in new product areas or new geographic areas; and

•

changes in regulatory requirements or delays of regulatory approvals.



Additionally, acquisitions contain the following risks:

•

an inability to integrate successfully the businesses Boardwalk Pipeline acquires;

•

the assumption of unknown liabilities for which it is not indemnified, for which its indemnity is inadequate or for which its insurance policies
may exclude from coverage;

•

limitations on rights to indemnity from the seller; and

•

customer or key employee losses of an acquired business.

There is no certainty that Boardwalk Pipeline will be able to complete these acquisitions or projects on schedule, on budget or at all.

Boardwalk Pipeline may not be able to replace expiring gas storage contracts at attractive rates or on a long-term basis and may not be
able to sell short-term services at attractive rates or at all due to a sustained narrowing of price spreads between time periods and reduced volatility which adversely affect Boardwalk Pipeline’s storage services.

Boardwalk Pipeline owns and operates substantial natural gas storage facilities. The market for the storage and PAL services
that it offers is impacted by the factors and market conditions discussed above for Boardwalk Pipeline’s transportation services, and is also impacted by natural gas price differentials between time periods, such as winter to summer (time
period price spreads), and the volatility in time period price spreads. Market conditions have caused a sustained narrowing of time period price spreads and a sustained decline in the price volatility of natural gas, which has adversely impacted the
rates Boardwalk Pipeline can charge for its storage and PAL services and the value associated with these services, especially when compared to previous historical levels. These market factors and conditions have adversely impacted Boardwalk
Pipeline’s business.

Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas transportation and storage operations are subject to extensive
regulation by FERC, including rules and regulations related to the rates it can charge for its services and its ability to construct or abandon facilities. FERC’s rate-making policies could limit its ability to recover the full cost of
operating its pipelines, including earning a reasonable return.

Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas
transportation and storage

operations are subject to extensive regulation by FERC, including the types and terms of services Boardwalk Pipeline may offer to its customers, construction of new facilities, creation, modification or
abandonment of services or facilities, recordkeeping and relationships with affiliated companies. FERC action in any of these areas could adversely affect Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to compete for business, construct new facilities,
offer new services or recover the full cost of operating its pipelines. This regulatory oversight can result in longer lead times to develop and complete any future project than competitors that are not subject to FERC’s regulations. FERC can
also deny Boardwalk Pipeline the right to remove certain facilities from service.

FERC also regulates the rates Boardwalk
Pipeline can charge for its natural gas transportation and storage operations. For cost-based services, FERC establishes both the maximum and minimum rates Boardwalk Pipeline can charge. The basic elements that FERC considers are the costs of
providing service, the volumes of gas being transported, the rate design, the allocation of costs between services, the capital structure and the rate of return a pipeline is permitted to earn. Boardwalk Pipeline may not be able to earn a return or
recover all of its costs, including certain costs associated with pipeline integrity activities, through existing or future rates. FERC can challenge the existing rates on any of Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipelines. Such a challenge against
Boardwalk Pipeline could adversely affect its ability to charge rates that would cover future increases in its costs or even to continue to collect rates to maintain its current revenue levels that are designed to permit a reasonable opportunity to
recover current costs and depreciation and earn a reasonable return.



Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiaries Generally

In addition to the specific risks and uncertainties faced by our subsidiaries, as discussed above, we and all of our
subsidiaries face risks and uncertainties related to, among other things, terrorism, hurricanes and other natural disasters, competition, government regulation, dependence on key executives and employees, litigation, dependence on information
technology and compliance with environmental laws.

Acts of terrorism could harm us and our subsidiaries.

Future terrorist attacks and the continued threat of terrorism in this country or abroad, as well as possible retaliatory
military and other action by the United States and its allies, could have a significant impact on the assets and businesses of certain of our subsidiaries. CNA issues coverages that are exposed to risk of loss from a terrorism act. Terrorist acts or
the threat of terrorism, including increased political, economic and financial market instability and volatility in the price of oil and gas, could affect the market for Diamond Offshore’s drilling services and Boardwalk Pipeline’s
transportation, gathering and storage services. In addition, future terrorist attacks could lead to reductions in business travel and tourism which could harm Loews Hotels. While our subsidiaries take steps that they believe are appropriate to
secure their assets, there is no assurance that they can completely secure them against a terrorist attack or obtain adequate insurance coverage for terrorist acts at reasonable rates.

Changes in tax laws of jurisdictions in which we or our subsidiaries operate could adversely impact us.

Changes in federal, state or foreign tax laws applicable to us or our subsidiaries could materially and adversely impact our
and our subsidiaries’ tax liability, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including the amount of cash our subsidiaries have available to distribute to their shareholders, including us. In particular, potential changes to
tax laws governing tax credits or relating to the taxation of interest from municipal bonds, foreign earnings and publicly traded partnerships could have such adverse effects.

Our subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal, state and local governmental regulations.

The businesses operated by our subsidiaries are impacted by current and potential federal, state and local governmental
regulations which impose or might impose a variety of restrictions and compliance obligations on those companies. Governmental regulations can also change materially in ways that could adversely affect those companies. Risks faced by our
subsidiaries related to governmental regulation include the following:

CNA.

The insurance industry is subject
to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision. Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of CNA’s policyholders and third-party claimants rather than its investors. Each jurisdiction in which CNA does business
has established supervisory agencies that regulate its business, generally at the state level. Any changes in federal regulation could also impose significant burdens on CNA. In addition, the Lloyd’s marketplace sets rules under which its
members, including CNA’s Hardy syndicate, operate.

These rules and regulations relate to, among other things, the
standards of solvency (including risk-based capital measures), government-supported backstops for certain catastrophic events (including terrorism), investment restrictions, accounting and reporting methodology, establishment of reserves and
potential assessments of funds to settle covered claims against impaired, insolvent or failed private or quasi-governmental insurers.

Regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations which require that rates not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly
discriminatory. CNA may also be required by the jurisdictions in which it does business to provide coverage to persons who would not otherwise be considered eligible or restrict CNA from withdrawing from unprofitable lines of business or
unprofitable market areas. Each jurisdiction dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks. CNA’s share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of its
respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each jurisdiction.



Diamond Offshore.

Certain countries are subject to
restrictions, sanctions and embargoes imposed by the United States government or other governmental or international authorities. These restrictions, sanctions and embargoes prohibit or limit Diamond Offshore from participating in certain business
activities in those countries. Diamond Offshore’s operations are also subject to numerous local, state and federal laws and regulations in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions concerning the containment and disposal of hazardous
materials, the remediation of contaminated properties and the protection of the environment.

The offshore drilling industry is dependent on demand for services from the oil and gas exploration industry and, accordingly, can be affected by
changes in tax and other laws relating to the energy business generally. Diamond Offshore may be required to make significant expenditures for additional capital equipment or inspections and recertifications to comply with governmental laws and
regulations. It is also possible that these laws and regulations may, in the future, add significantly to Diamond Offshore’s operating costs or result in a reduction in revenues associated with downtime required to install such equipment, or
may otherwise significantly limit drilling activity.

In addition, Diamond Offshore’s business is negatively impacted
when it performs certain regulatory inspections, which Diamond Offshore refers to as a 5-year survey, or special survey, that are due every five years for each of its rigs. These special surveys are generally performed in a shipyard and require
scheduled downtime, which can negatively impact operating revenue. Operating expenses increase as a result of these special surveys due to the cost to mobilize the rigs to a shipyard, inspection costs incurred and repair and maintenance costs.
Repair and maintenance activities may result from the special survey or may have been previously planned to take place during this mandatory downtime. The number of rigs undergoing a 5-year survey will vary from year to year, as well as from quarter
to quarter. Diamond Offshore’s business may also be negatively impacted by intermediate surveys, which are performed at interim periods between 5-year surveys. Intermediate surveys are generally less extensive in duration and scope than a
5-year survey. Although an intermediate survey normally does not require shipyard time, the survey may require some downtime for the rig. Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance as to the exact timing and/or duration of downtime associated with
regulatory inspections, planned rig mobilizations and other shipyard projects.

In the aftermath of the 2010 Macondo well
blowout and the subsequent investigation into the causes of the event, new rules were implemented for oil and gas operations in the GOM and in many of the international locations in which Diamond Offshore operates, including new standards for well
design, casing and cementing and well control procedures, equipment inspections and certifications, as well as rules requiring operators to systematically identify risks and establish safeguards against those risks through a comprehensive safety and
environmental management system (“SEMS”). New regulations may continue to be announced, including rules regarding drilling systems and equipment, such as blowout preventer and well control systems and lifesaving systems, as well as rules
regarding employee training, engaging personnel in safety management and requiring third party audits of SEMS programs. Such new regulations could require modifications or enhancements to existing systems and equipment, or require new equipment, and
could increase Diamond Offshore’s operating costs and cause downtime for its rigs if it is required to take any of them out of service between scheduled surveys or inspections, or if it is required to extend scheduled surveys or inspections, to
meet any such new requirements. Diamond Offshore is not able to predict the likelihood, nature or extent of additional rulemaking, nor is it able to predict the future impact of these events on operations. Additional governmental regulations
concerning licensing, taxation, equipment specifications, training requirements or other matters could increase the costs of Diamond Offshore’s operations, and enhanced permitting requirements, as well as escalating costs borne by its
customers, could reduce exploration activity in the GOM and therefore demand for its services.

Governments in some
countries are increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of concessions, the exploration for oil and gas and other aspects of the oil and gas industry. The modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws
or regulations curtailing exploratory or developmental drilling for oil and gas for economic, environmental or other reasons could materially and adversely affect Diamond Offshore’s operations by limiting drilling opportunities.

Boardwalk Pipeline

. Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas transportation and storage operations are subject to
extensive regulation by FERC and PHMSA of the DOT among other federal and state authorities. In addition to FERC rules and regulations related to the rates Boardwalk Pipeline can charge for its services, federal regulations extend to pipeline
safety, operating terms and conditions of service, the types of services Boardwalk Pipeline may offer, construction or abandonment of facilities, accounting and record keeping, and relationships and transactions



with affiliated companies. These regulations can adversely impact Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to compete for business, construct new facilities, including by increasing the lead times to
develop projects, offer new services, or recover the full cost of operating its pipelines.

Our subsidiaries face significant risks
related to compliance with environmental laws.

Our subsidiaries have extensive obligations and financial exposure
related to compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws, many of which have become increasingly stringent in recent years and may in some cases impose strict liability, which could be substantial, rendering a person liable for
environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of that person. For example, Diamond Offshore could be liable for damages and costs incurred in connection with oil spills related to its operations, including for conduct of or
conditions caused by others. Boardwalk Pipeline is also subject to laws and regulations, including requiring the acquisition of permits or other approvals to conduct regulated activities, restricting the manner in which it disposes of waste,
requiring remedial action to remove or mitigate contamination resulting from a spill or other release, requiring capital expenditures to comply with pollution control requirements.

We and our subsidiaries are subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change.

The U.S. Congress and the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) as well as some states and regional groupings of
states have in recent years considered legislation or regulations to reduce emissions of Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”). In the absence of federal GHG-limiting legislation, the EPA had adopted rules under authority of the Clean Air Act that, among
other things, establish Potential for Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) construction and Title V operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that are also potential major sources of certain principal,
or criteria, pollutant emissions, which reviews could require securing PSD permits at covered facilities emitting GHGs and meeting “best available control technology” standards for those GHG emissions. In addition, the EPA has adopted
rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources in the U.S., including, among others, onshore processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities. In October 2015,
the EPA published a final reporting rule for certain onshore gathering and boosting systems consisting primarily of gathering pipelines, compressors and process equipment used to perform natural gas compression, dehydration and acid gas removal.

Moreover, the EPA proposed in August 2015 rules that will establish emission standards for methane and volatile organic
compounds released from new and modified oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing and transmissions facilities, as part of the current U.S. President administration’s efforts to reduce methane emissions from the oil and natural
gas sector by up to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025. The EPA is expected to finalize those rules in 2016. Furthermore, the EPA has passed a rule, known as the Clean Power Plan, to limit GHGs from power plants, but on February 9, 2016, the U.S.
Supreme Court stayed this rule while it is being challenged in the federal D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. If this rule survives legal challenge, then depending on the methods used to implement this rule, it could reduce demand for the oil and
natural gas that Boardwalk Pipeline’s customers produce. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact businesses of our energy subsidiaries, any
such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, and could have a material adverse effect on the businesses of our energy subsidiaries.

Any significant interruption in the operation of our facilities, systems and business functions or breach in our data security
infrastructure could result in a materially adverse effect on our operations.

We and our subsidiaries have become
more reliant on technology to help increase efficiency in our businesses. We are dependent upon operational and financial computer systems to process the data necessary to conduct almost all aspects of our businesses. Any failure of our or our
subsidiaries’ computer systems, or those of our or their customers, vendors or others with whom we and they do business, could materially disrupt business operations. Computer and other business facilities and systems could become unavailable
or impaired from a variety of causes, including among others, storms and other natural disasters, terrorist attacks, utility outages or complications encountered as existing systems are replaced or upgraded. In addition, it has been reported that
unknown entities or groups have mounted so-called “cyber attacks” on businesses and other organizations solely to disable or disrupt



computer systems, disrupt operations and, in some cases, steal data. Any cyber attacks that affect our or our subsidiaries’ facilities could have a material adverse effect on our and their
business or reputation.

A significant breach of our data security infrastructure, resulting from actions by our
employees, vendors, third party administrators or by unknown third parties, that impacts our data framework or causes a failure to protect personal information of customers or employees may result in operational impairments and financial losses, as
well as significant harm to our reputation.

The foregoing risks relating to disruption of service, interruption of
operations and data loss could expose us to monetary and reputational damages. In addition, potential exposure includes substantially increased compliance costs and requires computer system upgrades and security related investments. The breach of
confidential information also could give rise to legal liability and regulatory action under data protection and privacy laws and regulations, both in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Any such legal or regulatory action could have a material
adverse effect on our operations.

Loss of key vendor relationships or issues relating to the transitioning of vendor relationships
could result in a materially adverse effect on our and our subsidiaries’ operations.

We and our subsidiaries
rely on services and products provided by many vendors in the United States and abroad. These include, for example, vendors of computer hardware, software and services, as well as other critical materials and services. If one or more key vendors
becomes unable to continue to provide products or services at the requisite level, or fails to protect our proprietary information, including in some cases personal information of employees, customers or hotel guests, we and our subsidiaries may
experience a material adverse effect on our or their business or reputation.

We could incur impairment charges related to the
carrying value of the long-lived assets and goodwill of our subsidiaries.

Our subsidiaries regularly evaluate
their long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Most notably, we could incur impairment charges related to the carrying value of
offshore drilling equipment at Diamond Offshore, pipeline and storage assets at Boardwalk Pipeline and hotel properties owned by Loews Hotels.

In particular, Diamond Offshore is currently experiencing declining demand for certain offshore drilling rigs as a result of
excess rig supply in the industry due, in part, to the numerous newly constructed rigs that have or will enter the market. As a result, these rigs will negatively impact utilization which could result in Diamond Offshore incurring additional asset
impairments, rig retirements and/or rigs being scrapped.

We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when
events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment exists. The goodwill impairment test requires us to identify reporting units and estimate each unit’s fair value as of the testing date. We calculate the fair value of our
reporting units (each of our principal operating subsidiaries) based on estimates of future discounted cash flows, which reflect management’s judgments and assumptions regarding the appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate, future industry
conditions and operations and other factors. Asset impairment evaluations are, by nature, highly subjective. The use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different carrying values of our assets which could impact the
need to record an impairment charge and the amount of any charge taken.

We are a holding company and derive substantially all of
our income and cash flow from our subsidiaries.

We rely upon our invested cash balances and distributions from
our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations and to declare and pay any dividends to holders of our common stock. Our subsidiaries are separate and independent legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or
otherwise, to make funds available to us, whether in the form of loans, dividends or otherwise. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us is also subject to, among other things, the availability of sufficient earnings and funds in such
subsidiaries, applicable state laws, including in the case of the insurance subsidiaries of CNA, laws and rules governing the payment of dividends by regulated insurance companies, and their compliance with covenants in their respective loan
agreements. Claims



of creditors of our subsidiaries will generally have priority as to the assets of such subsidiaries over our claims and our creditors and shareholders.

We could have liability in the future for tobacco-related lawsuits.

As a result of our ownership of Lorillard, Inc. (“Lorillard”) prior to the separation of Lorillard from us in 2008
(the “Separation”), from time to time we have been named as a defendant in tobacco-related lawsuits and could be named as a defendant in additional tobacco-related suits, notwithstanding the completion of the Separation. In the Separation
Agreement entered into between us and Lorillard and its subsidiaries in connection with the Separation, Lorillard and each of its subsidiaries has agreed to indemnify us for liabilities related to Lorillard’s tobacco business, including
liabilities that we may incur for current and future tobacco-related litigation against us. An adverse decision in a tobacco-related lawsuit against us could, if the indemnification is deemed for any reason to be unenforceable or any amounts owed to
us thereunder are not collectible, in whole or in part, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and equity. We do not expect that the Separation will alter the legal exposure of either entity with respect to
tobacco-related claims. We do not believe that we have any liability for tobacco-related claims, and we have never been held liable for any such claims.

OVERVIEW

We are a holding company. Our subsidiaries are engaged in the following lines of business:

●

commercial property and casualty insurance (CNA Financial Corporation (“CNA”), a 90% owned subsidiary);

●

operation of offshore oil and gas drilling rigs (Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (“Diamond Offshore”), a 53% owned subsidiary);

●

transportation and storage of natural gas and natural gas liquids and gathering and processing of natural gas (Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP
(“Boardwalk Pipeline”), a 51% owned subsidiary); and

●

operation of a chain of hotels (Loews Hotels Holding Corporation (“Loews Hotels”), a wholly owned subsidiary).

See below for a discussion of discontinued operations.

Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this Report to “Loews Corporation,” “the Company,”
“Parent Company,” “we,” “our,” “us” or like terms refer to the business of Loews Corporation excluding its subsidiaries.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Item 8, Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.

Consolidated Financial Results

Consolidated net income for 2015 was $260 million, or $0.72 per share, compared to $591 million, or $1.55 per share, in 2014.
Net income in 2014 included discontinued operations reflecting the sale of HighMount Exploration & Production, LLC (“HighMount”) and CNA’s former life insurance subsidiary.

Income from continuing operations for 2015 was $260 million, or $0.72 per share, compared to $962 million, or $2.52 per share,
in 2014. The decline in income from continuing operations was primarily due to a reserve charge at CNA and asset impairment charges at Diamond Offshore. In addition, parent company investment income declined as a result of lower performance of
equity securities in the trading portfolio and decreased results from limited partnership investments.

CNA’s
earnings decreased primarily due to a reserve charge of $177 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) resulting from the unlocking of actuarial assumptions related to future policy benefit reserves for the long term care business. Excluding
this charge, CNA’s earnings declined year-over-year primarily due to lower limited partnership results and a $38 million charge (after tax and noncontrolling interests) related to a retroactive reinsurance agreement to cede its legacy asbestos
and environmental pollution liabilities. This earnings decline was partially offset by improved underwriting results driven by higher favorable net prior year development.

Diamond Offshore’s results for 2015 include asset impairment charges totaling $341 million (after tax and noncontrolling
interests) related to the carrying value of 17 drilling rigs, as well as lower rig utilization. In addition, earnings were impacted by a $20 million impairment charge to write off all goodwill associated with the Company’s investment in Diamond
Offshore as well as increased depreciation and interest expense. In 2014, Diamond Offshore recognized an asset impairment charge of $55 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests).

Boardwalk Pipeline’s earnings increase primarily stemmed from the impact of a $55 million charge (after tax and
noncontrolling interests) in 2014 related to the write off of all capitalized costs associated with the terminated Bluegrass project. Absent this charge, earnings were largely consistent with the prior year as additional revenues from the settlement
of the Gulf South rate case and a franchise tax refund related to settlement of prior tax periods were offset by lower natural gas storage revenues and increased depreciation and interest costs.



Loews Hotels’ earnings increased slightly as compared to the prior year as
higher income from Universal Orlando joint venture properties was partially offset by higher interest expense and increased tax expense due to an adjustment for prior years’ estimates and higher Florida state income taxes, reflecting increased
profits at the Universal Orlando and Miami properties.

Book value per share decreased to $51.67 at December 31, 2015 from
$51.70 at December 31, 2014. Book value per share excluding Accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) increased to $52.72 at December 31, 2015 from $50.95 at December 31, 2014.

Parent Company Structure

We are a holding company and derive substantially all of our cash flow from our subsidiaries. We rely upon our invested cash
balances and distributions from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations and to declare and pay any dividends to our shareholders. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to, among other things,
the availability of sufficient earnings and funds in such subsidiaries, applicable state laws, including in the case of the insurance subsidiaries of CNA, laws and rules governing the payment of dividends by regulated insurance companies (see Note
13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8) and compliance with covenants in their respective loan agreements. Claims of creditors of our subsidiaries will generally have priority as to the assets of such subsidiaries
over our claims and those of our creditors and shareholders.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied on a
consistent basis. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. In general, our estimates are based on historical experience, evaluation of current trends, information from third
party professionals and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the known facts and circumstances.

We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our Consolidated Financial
Statements as their application places the most significant demands on our judgment. Due to the inherent uncertainties involved with these types of judgments, actual results could differ significantly from estimates, which may have a material
adverse impact on our results of operations and/or equity.

Insurance Reserves

Insurance reserves are established for both short and long-duration insurance contracts. Short-duration contracts are
primarily related to property and casualty insurance policies where the reserving process is based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss, including amounts for known and unknown claims. Long-duration contracts are primarily related to long
term care and are estimated using actuarial estimates about morbidity and persistency as well as assumptions about expected investment returns and future premium rate increases. The reserve for unearned premiums on property and casualty contracts
represents the portion of premiums written related to the unexpired terms of coverage. The reserving process is discussed in further detail in the Reserves – Estimates and Uncertainties section below.

Reinsurance and Other Receivables

An exposure exists with respect to the collectibility of ceded property and casualty and life reinsurance to the extent that
any reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations or disputes the liabilities CNA has ceded under reinsurance agreements. An allowance for doubtful accounts on reinsurance receivables is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due
from reinsurers, reinsurer solvency, CNA’s past experience and current economic



conditions. Further information on CNA’s reinsurance receivables is included in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

Additionally, an exposure exists with respect to the collectibility of amounts due from customers on other receivables. An
allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances currently due as well as in the future, management’s experience and current economic conditions.

If actual experience differs from the estimates made by management in determining the allowances for doubtful accounts on
reinsurance and other receivables, net receivables as reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets may not be collected. Therefore, our results of operations and/or equity could be materially adversely affected.

Valuation of Investments and Impairment of Securities

We classify fixed maturity securities and equity securities as either available-for-sale or trading which are both carried at
fair value. Fair value represents the price that would be received in a sale of an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date, the determination of which requires us to make a significant number of
assumptions and judgments. Securities with the greatest level of subjectivity around valuation are those that rely on inputs that are significant to the estimated fair value and that are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally
from or corroborated by observable market data. These unobservable inputs are based on assumptions consistent with what we believe other market participants would use to price such securities. Further information on fair value measurements is
included in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

CNA’s investment
portfolio is subject to market declines below amortized cost that may be other-than-temporary and therefore result in the recognition of impairment losses in earnings. Factors considered in the determination of whether or not a decline is
other-than-temporary include a current intention or need to sell the security or an indication that a credit loss exists. Significant judgment exists regarding the evaluation of the financial condition and expected near-term and long term prospects
of the issuer, the relevant industry conditions and trends, and whether CNA expects to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. Further information on CNA’s process for evaluating impairments is
included in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

Long Term Care Policies

Future policy benefit reserves for CNA’s long term care policies are based on certain assumptions including morbidity,
persistency, discount rates and future premium rate increases. The adequacy of the reserves is contingent on actual experience related to these key assumptions. If actual experience differs from these assumptions, the reserves may not be adequate,
requiring CNA to add to reserves.

A prolonged period during which interest rates remain at levels lower than those
anticipated in CNA’s reserving discount rate assumption could result in shortfalls in investment income on assets supporting CNA’s obligations under long term care policies, which may also require an increase to CNA’s reserves. In
addition, CNA may not receive regulatory approval for the premium rate increases it requests.

These changes to CNA’s
reserves could materially adversely impact our results of operations and equity. The reserving process is discussed in further detail in the Reserves – Estimates and Uncertainties section below.

Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations

We make a significant number of assumptions in order to estimate the liabilities and costs related to our pension and
postretirement benefit obligations under our benefit plans. The assumptions that have the most impact on pension costs are the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. These assumptions are evaluated relative to
current market factors such as inflation, interest rates and broader capital market expectations. Changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense.



In determining the discount rate assumption, we utilized current market
information and liability information, including a discounted cash flow analysis of our pension and postretirement obligations. In particular, the basis for our discount rate selection was the yield on indices of highly rated fixed income debt
securities with durations comparable to that of our plan liabilities. The yield curve was applied to expected future retirement plan payments to adjust the discount rate to reflect the cash flow characteristics of the plans. The yield curves and
indices evaluated in the selection of the discount rate are comprised of high quality corporate bonds that are rated AA by an accepted rating agency.

In determining the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption, we considered the historical performance of
the investment portfolio as well as the long term market return expectations based on the investment mix of the portfolio and the expected investment horizon.

Further information on our pension and postretirement benefit obligations is in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included under Item 8.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable. The Company uses a probability-weighted cash flow analysis to test property and equipment for impairment based on relevant market data. If an asset is determined to be impaired, a loss is recognized to reduce the
carrying amount to the fair value of the asset. Management’s cash flow assumptions are an inherent part of our asset impairment evaluation and the use of different assumptions could produce results that differ from the reported amounts.

Goodwill

Goodwill is
required to be evaluated on an annual basis and whenever, in management’s judgment, there is a significant change in circumstances that would be considered a triggering event. Management must apply judgment in assessing qualitatively whether
events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Factors such as a reporting unit’s planned future operating results, long term growth outlook and
industry and market conditions are considered. Judgment is also applied in determining the estimated fair value of reporting units’ assets and liabilities for purposes of performing quantitative goodwill impairment tests. Management uses all
available information to make these fair value determinations, including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets and observed market multiples.

Income Taxes

Deferred
income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return bases of assets and liabilities. Any resulting future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely
than not, and a valuation allowance is established for any portion of a deferred tax asset that management believes may not be realized. The assessment of the need for a valuation allowance requires management to make estimates and assumptions about
future earnings, reversal of existing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies. If actual experience differs from these estimates and assumptions, the recorded deferred tax asset may not be fully realized, resulting in an increase
to income tax expense in our results of operations. In addition, the ability to record deferred tax assets in the future could be limited resulting in a higher effective tax rate in that future period.

The Company has not established deferred tax liabilities for certain of its foreign earnings as it intends to indefinitely
reinvest those earnings to finance foreign activities. However, if these earnings become subject to U.S. federal tax, any required provision could have a material impact on our financial results.

CNA Financial

Reserves – Estimates and Uncertainties

The level of reserves CNA maintains represents its best estimate, as of a particular point in time, of what the ultimate
settlement and administration of claims will cost based on CNA’s assessment of facts and circumstances known at that time. Reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex estimates that CNA derives, generally
utilizing a variety of actuarial reserve estimation techniques, from numerous assumptions and expectations about future events, both internal and external, many of which are highly uncertain. As noted below, CNA reviews its reserves for each segment
of its business periodically and any such review could result in the need to increase reserves in amounts which could be material and could adversely affect its results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength and corporate
debt ratings. Further information on reserves is provided in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

Property
and Casualty Claim and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves

CNA maintains loss reserves to cover its estimated ultimate
unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, including the estimated cost of the claims adjudication process, for claims that have been reported but not yet settled (case reserves) and claims that have been incurred but not reported
(“IBNR”). Claim and claim adjustment expense reserves are reflected as liabilities and are included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets under the heading “Insurance Reserves.” Adjustments to prior year reserve estimates, if
necessary, are reflected in results of operations in the period that the need for such adjustments is determined. The carried case and IBNR reserves as of each balance sheet date are provided in the discussion that follows and in Note 8 of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

CNA is subject to the uncertain effects of emerging or
potential claims and coverage issues that arise as industry practices and legal, judicial, social, economic and other environmental conditions change. These issues have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on CNA’s business by
either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims.

Emerging
or potential claims and coverage issues include, but are not limited to, uncertainty in future medical costs in workers’ compensation. In particular, medical cost inflation could be greater than expected due to new treatments, drugs and
devices, increased health care utilization and/or the future costs of health care facilities. In addition, the relationship between workers’ compensation and government and private health care providers could change, potentially shifting costs
to workers’ compensation.

The impact of these and other unforeseen emerging or potential claims and coverage issues
is difficult to predict and could materially adversely affect the adequacy of CNA’s claim and claim adjustment expense reserves and could lead to future reserve additions.

CNA’s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries also have actual and potential exposures related to asbestos and
environmental pollution (“A&EP”) claims. CNA’s experience has been that establishing reserves for casualty coverages relating to A&EP claims and the related claim adjustment expenses are subject to uncertainties that are
greater than those presented by other claims. Additionally, traditional actuarial methods and techniques employed to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional property and casualty exposures are less precise in estimating claim and
claim adjustment reserves for A&EP. As a result, estimating the ultimate cost of both reported and unreported A&EP claims is subject to a higher degree of variability.

To mitigate the risks posed by CNA’s exposure to A&EP claims and claim adjustment expenses, CNA completed a
transaction with National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), under which substantially all of CNA’s legacy A&EP liabilities were ceded to NICO effective January 1, 2010 (loss portfolio transfer or “LPT”).



The loss portfolio transfer is a retroactive reinsurance contract. The cumulative
amounts ceded under the loss portfolio transfer exceed the consideration paid, therefore CNA has recognized a deferred retroactive reinsurance gain. This deferred gain is recognized in earnings in proportion to actual recoveries under the loss
portfolio transfer. Over the life of the contract, there is no economic impact as long as any additional losses are within the limit of the contract.

See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 for further discussion of the loss
portfolio transfer, its impact on CNA’s results of operations and the deferred retroactive reinsurance gain.

Historically, CNA performed its actuarial review of A&EP claims in the fourth quarter. In 2014, CNA was unable to complete
the fourth quarter review because it determined that additional information and analysis of inuring third-party reinsurance recoveries was required. The reserve review was completed in the second quarter of 2015 and CNA management adopted the second
quarter of the year as the timing for all future annual A&EP claims actuarial reviews.

Establishing Property & Casualty Reserve Estimates

In developing claim and claim adjustment expense (“loss” or “losses”) reserve estimates,
CNA’s actuaries perform detailed reserve analyses that are staggered throughout the year. The data is organized at a reserve group level. A reserve group can be a line of business covering a subset of insureds such as commercial automobile
liability for small or middle market customers, it can encompass several lines of business provided to a specific set of customers such as dentists, or it can be a particular type of claim such as construction defect. Every reserve group is reviewed
at least once during the year. The analyses generally review losses gross of ceded reinsurance and apply the ceded reinsurance terms to the gross estimates to establish estimates net of reinsurance. In addition to the detailed analyses, CNA reviews
actual loss emergence for all products each quarter.

The detailed analyses use a variety of generally accepted actuarial
methods and techniques to produce a number of estimates of ultimate loss. CNA’s actuaries determine a point estimate of ultimate loss by reviewing the various estimates and assigning weight to each estimate given the characteristics of the
reserve group being reviewed. The reserve estimate is the difference between the estimated ultimate loss and the losses paid to date. The difference between the estimated ultimate loss and the case incurred loss (paid loss plus case reserve) is
IBNR. IBNR calculated as such includes a provision for development on known cases (supplemental development) as well as a provision for claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported (pure IBNR).

Most of CNA’s business can be characterized as long-tail. For long-tail business, it will generally be several years
between the time the business is written and the time when all claims are settled. CNA’s long-tail exposures include commercial automobile liability, workers’ compensation, general liability, medical professional liability, other
professional liability and management liability coverages, assumed reinsurance run-off and products liability. Short-tail exposures include property, commercial automobile physical damage, marine, surety and warranty. Property and casualty insurance
operations contain both long-tail and short-tail exposures. Other non-core operations contain long-tail exposures.

Various methods are used to project ultimate loss for both long-tail and short-tail exposures including, but not limited to,
the following:

●

paid development;

●

incurred development;

●

loss ratio;

●

Bornhuetter-Ferguson using paid loss;

●

Bornhuetter-Ferguson using incurred loss;



●

frequency times severity; and

●

stochastic modeling.

The paid development method estimates ultimate losses by reviewing paid loss patterns and applying them to accident or policy
years with further expected changes in paid loss. Selection of the paid loss pattern may require consideration of several factors including the impact of inflation on claims costs, the rate at which claims professionals make claim payments and close
claims, the impact of judicial decisions, the impact of underwriting changes, the impact of large claim payments and other factors. Claim cost inflation itself may require evaluation of changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property, changes
in the cost of medical care, changes in the cost of wage replacement, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors. Because this method assumes that losses are paid at a consistent rate, changes in any of these factors can impact the
results. Since the method does not rely on case reserves, it is not directly influenced by changes in the adequacy of case reserves.

For many reserve groups, paid loss data for recent periods may be too immature or erratic for accurate predictions. This
situation often exists for long-tail exposures. In addition, changes in the factors described above may result in inconsistent payment patterns. Finally, estimating the paid loss pattern subsequent to the most mature point available in the data
analyzed often involves considerable uncertainty for long-tail products such as workers’ compensation.

The incurred
development method is similar to the paid development method, but it uses case incurred losses instead of paid losses. Since the method uses more data (case reserves in addition to paid losses) than the paid development method, the incurred
development patterns may be less variable than paid patterns. However, selection of the incurred loss pattern typically requires analysis of all of the same factors described above. In addition, the inclusion of case reserves can lead to distortions
if changes in case reserving practices have taken place, and the use of case incurred losses may not eliminate the issues associated with estimating the incurred loss pattern subsequent to the most mature point available.

The loss ratio method multiplies earned premiums by an expected loss ratio to produce ultimate loss estimates for each
accident or policy year. This method may be useful for immature accident or policy periods or if loss development patterns are inconsistent, losses emerge very slowly, or there is relatively little loss history from which to estimate future losses.
The selection of the expected loss ratio typically requires analysis of loss ratios from earlier accident or policy years or pricing studies and analysis of inflationary trends, frequency trends, rate changes, underwriting changes and other
applicable factors.

The Bornhuetter-Ferguson method using paid loss is a combination of the paid development method and
the loss ratio method. This method normally determines expected loss ratios similar to the approach used to estimate the expected loss ratio for the loss ratio method and typically requires analysis of the same factors described above. This method
assumes that future losses will develop at the expected loss ratio level. The percent of paid loss to ultimate loss implied from the paid development method is used to determine what percentage of ultimate loss is yet to be paid. The use of the
pattern from the paid development method typically requires consideration of the same factors listed in the description of the paid development method. The estimate of losses yet to be paid is added to current paid losses to estimate the ultimate
loss for each year. For long-tail lines, this method will react very slowly if actual ultimate loss ratios are different from expectations due to changes not accounted for by the expected loss ratio calculation.

The Bornhuetter-Ferguson method using incurred loss is similar to the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method using paid loss except that
it uses case incurred losses. The use of case incurred losses instead of paid losses can result in development patterns that are less variable than paid patterns. However, the inclusion of case reserves can lead to distortions if changes in case
reserving have taken place, and the method typically requires analysis of the same factors that need to be reviewed for the loss ratio and incurred development methods.

The frequency times severity method multiplies a projected number of ultimate claims by an estimated ultimate average loss for
each accident or policy year to produce ultimate loss estimates. Since projections of the ultimate number of claims are often less variable than projections of ultimate loss, this method can provide more reliable results for reserve groups where
loss development patterns are inconsistent or too variable to be relied on exclusively. In addition, this method can more directly account for changes in coverage that impact the number and



size of claims. However, this method can be difficult to apply to situations where very large claims or a substantial number of unusual claims result in volatile average claim sizes. Projecting
the ultimate number of claims may require analysis of several factors including the rate at which policyholders report claims to CNA, the impact of judicial decisions, the impact of underwriting changes and other factors. Estimating the ultimate
average loss may require analysis of the impact of large losses and claim cost trends based on changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property, changes in the cost of medical care, changes in the cost of wage replacement, judicial decisions,
legislative changes and other factors.

Stochastic modeling produces a range of possible outcomes based on varying
assumptions related to the particular reserve group being modeled. For some reserve groups, CNA uses models which rely on historical development patterns at an aggregate level, while other reserve groups are modeled using individual claim
variability assumptions supplied by the claims department. In either case, multiple simulations are run and the results are analyzed to produce a range of potential outcomes. The results will typically include a mean and percentiles of the possible
reserve distribution which aid in the selection of a point estimate.

For many exposures, especially those that can be
considered long-tail, a particular accident or policy year may not have a sufficient volume of paid losses to produce a statistically reliable estimate of ultimate losses. In such a case, CNA’s actuaries typically assign more weight to the
incurred development method than to the paid development method. As claims continue to settle and the volume of paid loss increases, the actuaries may assign additional weight to the paid development method. For most of CNA’s products, even the
incurred losses for accident or policy years that are early in the claim settlement process will not be of sufficient volume to produce a reliable estimate of ultimate losses. In these cases, CNA will not assign any weight to the paid and incurred
development methods. CNA will use the loss ratio, Bornhuetter-Ferguson and frequency times severity methods. For short-tail exposures, the paid and incurred development methods can often be relied on sooner primarily because CNA’s history
includes a sufficient number of years to cover the entire period over which paid and incurred losses are expected to change. However, CNA may also use the loss ratio, Bornhuetter-Ferguson and frequency times severity methods for short-tail
exposures.

For other more complex reserve groups where the above methods may not produce reliable indications, CNA uses
additional methods tailored to the characteristics of the specific situation.

Periodic Reserve Reviews

The reserve analyses performed by CNA’s actuaries result in point estimates. Each quarter, the results of the detailed
reserve reviews are summarized and discussed with CNA’s senior management to determine the best estimate of reserves. CNA’s senior management considers many factors in making this decision. The factors include, but are not limited to, the
historical pattern and volatility of the actuarial indications, the sensitivity of the actuarial indications to changes in paid and incurred loss patterns, the consistency of claims handling processes, the consistency of case reserving practices,
changes in CNA’s pricing and underwriting, pricing and underwriting trends in the insurance market and legal, judicial, social and economic trends.

CNA’s recorded reserves reflect its best estimate as of a particular point in time based upon known facts, consideration
of the factors cited above and its judgment. The carried reserve may differ from the actuarial point estimate as the result of CNA’s consideration of the factors noted above as well as the potential volatility of the projections associated with
the specific reserve group being analyzed and other factors affecting claims costs that may not be quantifiable through traditional actuarial analysis. This process results in management’s best estimate which is then recorded as the loss
reserve.

Currently, CNA’s recorded reserves are modestly higher than the actuarial point estimate. For Commercial,
Specialty and International, the difference between CNA’s reserves and the actuarial point estimate is primarily driven by uncertainty with respect to immature accident years, claim cost inflation, changes in claims handling, changes to the
tort environment which may adversely impact claim costs and the effects from the economy. For CNA’s legacy A&EP liabilities, the difference between CNA’s reserves and the actuarial point estimate is primarily driven by the potential
tail volatility of run-off exposures.



The key assumptions fundamental to the reserving process are often different for
various reserve groups and accident or policy years. Some of these assumptions are explicit assumptions that are required of a particular method, but most of the assumptions are implicit and cannot be precisely quantified. An example of an explicit
assumption is the pattern employed in the paid development method. However, the assumed pattern is itself based on several implicit assumptions such as the impact of inflation on medical costs and the rate at which claim professionals close claims.
As a result, the effect on reserve estimates of a particular change in assumptions typically cannot be specifically quantified, and changes in these assumptions cannot be tracked over time.

CNA’s recorded reserves are management’s best estimate. In order to provide an indication of the variability
associated with CNA’s net reserves, the following discussion provides a sensitivity analysis that shows the approximate estimated impact of variations in significant factors affecting CNA’s reserve estimates for particular types of
business. These significant factors are the ones that CNA believes could most likely materially affect the reserves. This discussion covers the major types of business for which CNA believes a material deviation to its reserves is reasonably
possible. There can be no assurance that actual experience will be consistent with the current assumptions or with the variation indicated by the discussion. In addition, there can be no assurance that other factors and assumptions will not have a
material impact on CNA’s reserves.

The three areas for which CNA believes a significant deviation to its net
reserves is reasonably possible are (i) professional liability, management liability and surety products; (ii) workers’ compensation and (iii) general liability.

Professional liability and management liability products and surety products include professional liability coverages provided
to various professional firms, including architects, real estate agents, small and mid-sized accounting firms, law firms and other professional firms. They also include D&O, employment practices, fiduciary, fidelity and surety coverages, as well
as insurance products serving the health care delivery system. The most significant factor affecting reserve estimates for these liability coverages is claim severity. Claim severity is driven by the cost of medical care, the cost of wage
replacement, legal fees, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors. Underwriting and claim handling decisions such as the classes of business written and individual claim settlement decisions can also impact claim severity. If the
estimated claim severity increases by 9%, CNA estimates that the net reserves would increase by approximately $500 million. If the estimated claim severity decreases by 3%, CNA estimates that net reserves would decrease by approximately $150
million. CNA’s net reserves for these products were approximately $5.4 billion as of December 31, 2015.

For
workers’ compensation, since many years will pass from the time the business is written until all claim payments have been made, claim cost inflation on claim payments is the most significant factor affecting workers’ compensation reserve
estimates. Workers’ compensation claim cost inflation is driven by the cost of medical care, the cost of wage replacement, expected claimant lifetimes, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors. If estimated workers’
compensation claim cost inflation increases by 100 basis points for the entire period over which claim payments will be made, CNA estimates that its net reserves would increase by approximately $400 million. If estimated workers’ compensation
claim cost inflation decreases by 100 basis points for the entire period over which claim payments will be made, CNA estimates that its net reserves would decrease by approximately $350 million. Net reserves for workers’ compensation were
approximately $4.3 billion as of December 31, 2015.

For general liability, the most significant factor affecting reserve
estimates is claim severity. Claim severity is driven by changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property, the cost of medical care, the cost of wage replacement, judicial decisions, legislation and other factors. If the estimated claim
severity for general liability increases by 6%, CNA estimates that its net reserves would increase by approximately $200 million. If the estimated claim severity for general liability decreases by 3%, CNA estimates that its net reserves would
decrease by approximately $100 million. Net reserves for general liability were approximately $3.6 billion as of December 31, 2015.

Given the factors described above, it is not possible to quantify precisely the ultimate exposure represented by claims and
related litigation. As a result, CNA regularly reviews the adequacy of its reserves and reassesses its reserve estimates as historical loss experience develops, additional claims are reported and settled and additional information becomes available
in subsequent periods. In reviewing CNA’s reserve estimates, CNA makes adjustments in the period that the need for such adjustments is determined. These reviews have resulted in CNA’s



identification of information and trends that have caused CNA to change its reserves in prior periods and could lead to the identification of a need for additional material increases or decreases
in claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, which could materially affect our results of operations and equity and CNA’s business and insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings positively or negatively. See the Ratings section of
this MD&A for further information regarding CNA’s financial strength and corporate debt ratings.

Life & Group Non-Core Policyholder Reserves

CNA maintains both claim and claim adjustment expense reserves as well as future policy benefit reserves for policyholder
benefits for the Life & Group Non-Core business. Claim and claim expense reserves consist of estimated reserves for long term care policyholders that are currently receiving benefits, including claims that have been incurred but are not yet
reported. In developing the claim and claim adjustment expense reserve estimates for CNA’s long term care policies, its actuaries perform a detailed claim experience study on an annual basis. The study reviews the sufficiency of existing
reserves for policyholders currently on claim and includes an evaluation of expected benefit utilization and claim duration. CNA’s recorded claim and claim adjustment expense reserves reflect its best estimate after incorporating the results of
the most recent study. In addition, claim and claim adjustment reserves are also maintained for structured settlement obligations that are not funded by annuities related to certain property and casualty claimants. Future policy benefit reserves
represent the active life reserves related to CNA’s long term care policies and are the present value of expected future benefit payments and expenses less expected future premiums. The determination of these reserves is fundamental to its
financial results and requires management to make estimates and assumptions about expected investment and policyholder experience over the life of the contract. Since many of these contracts may be in force for several decades, these assumptions are
subject to significant estimation risk.

While the structured settlement obligations arise under short duration contracts,
long duration contract principles and actuarial methods are used to determine management’s best estimate of the required claim and claim adjustment reserve.



Under GAAP, reserves for long term care future policy benefits and the unfunded
structured settlement annuity claim and claim adjustment expense reserves were first established based on CNA’s actuarial best estimate assumptions at the date the contract was issued plus a margin for adverse deviation. Actuarial assumptions
include estimates of morbidity, persistency, discount rates and expenses over the life of the contracts. These assumptions are locked in throughout the life of the contract unless a premium deficiency develops. The impact of differences between the
actuarial assumptions and actual experience is reflected in results of operations each period.

Long term care policies
provide benefits for nursing home, assisted living and home health care subject to various daily and lifetime caps. Policyholders must continue to make periodic premium payments to keep the policy in force. Generally CNA has the ability to increase
policy premiums, subject to state regulatory approval.

The actuarial assumptions that management believes are subject to
the most variability are morbidity, persistency and discount rate. Persistency can be affected by policy lapses and death. Discount rate is influenced by the investment yield on assets supporting long term care reserves which is subject to interest
rate and market volatility. There is limited historical company and industry data available to CNA for long term care morbidity and mortality, as only a portion of the policies written to date are in claims paying status. As a result of this
variability, CNA’s long term care reserves may be subject to material increases if actual experience develops adversely to its expectations.

Annually, management assesses the adequacy of its GAAP long term care future policy benefit reserves as well as the claim and
claim adjustment expense reserves for unfunded structured settlement obligations by performing a gross premium valuation (“GPV”) to determine if there is a premium deficiency. Under the GPV, management estimates required reserves using
best estimate assumptions, including anticipated future premium rate increases, as of the date of the assessment without provisions for adverse deviation. The GPV reserves are then compared to the recorded reserves. If the GPV reserves are greater
than the existing net GAAP reserves (i.e. reserves net of any deferred acquisition costs asset), the existing net GAAP reserves are unlocked and are increased to the greater amount. Any such increase is reflected in CNA’s results of operations
in the period in which the need for such adjustment is determined, and could materially adversely affect our results of operations and equity and CNA’s business and insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings.

Prior to December 31, 2015, the active life reserves for long term care were based on actuarial assumptions established at
policy issuance. The December 31, 2014 GPV indicated the carried reserves included a margin of approximately $100 million. The December 31, 2015 GPV indicated a premium deficiency of $296 million. A summary of the changes in the GPV results is
presented in the table below:

December 31, 2015 premium deficiency

$

(296

)

The premium deficiency was primarily driven by changes in morbidity assumptions in particular
by higher claim incidence, reflective of trends observed in CNA’s emerging experience. There are a variety of factors that impact claim incidence rates, including, but not limited to, policyholder behavior, socioeconomic factors, changes in
health trends and advances in medical care. The premium deficiency was also adversely affected by changes in persistency assumptions, primarily from lower projected active life mortality rates. Adverse changes from morbidity and persistency were
somewhat offset by increases in planned rate increase actions and changes in discount rate assumptions. The increase in planned rate actions was primarily due to updated assumptions on the approval rate and timing of future premium rate increases in
CNA’s group block. Changes in discount rate assumptions were



primarily due to changes in future interest rate assumptions, contemplating both near-term market indications and long-term normative assumptions. Changes in expenses and other assumptions
had a small adverse impact on the premium deficiency.

The indicated premium deficiency necessitated a charge to income
that was effected by the write off of the entire long term care deferred acquisition cost asset of $289 million and an increase to active life reserves of $7 million. As a result, the long term care active life reserves carried as of December 31,
2015 represent management’s best estimate assumptions at that date with no margin for adverse deviation. Since there is no margin in the carried reserves, CNA may have to unlock its reserve assumptions in the future. Factors that could affect
the need to unlock reserve assumptions include the significance and persistence of variances between actual experience and the expected results contemplated in the best estimate reserves as well as changes in CNA’s outlook of the future.

In addition to the premium deficiency, CNA’s annual experience study of claim reserves indicated a deficiency of $9
million. The deficiency was primarily related to updating claim frequency assumptions on incurred but not reported claims, offset by favorable severity on existing claims. The total impact of the premium deficiency and claim reserve deficiency was
$177 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests).

The table below summarizes the estimated pretax impact on
CNA’s results of operations from various hypothetical revisions to its assumptions. CNA has assumed that revisions to such assumptions would occur in each policy type, age and duration within each policy group and would occur absent any
changes, mitigating or otherwise, in the other assumptions. Although such hypothetical revisions are not currently required or anticipated, CNA believes they could occur based on past variances in experience and its expectations of the ranges of
future experience that could reasonably occur. The hypothetical revisions have been updated from the disclosures in prior periods to be reflective of CNA’s updated best estimate assumptions as of December 31, 2015 in support of its active life
reserves. As a result, in some cases the scenarios described below are not directly comparable to prior periods. Persistency now reflects active life mortality and lapse whereas prior periods reflected total lives. Discount rates now reflect future
interest rates only whereas prior periods reflected future interest rates and changes in CNA’s existing investment portfolio yield. The hypothetical scenarios for morbidity and premium rate actions are comparable to prior periods.

2015 Compared with 2014

Income from continuing operations decreased $411 million in 2015 as compared with 2014. Results in 2015 were negatively
impacted by a $177 million charge (after tax and noncontrolling interests) related to recognition of a premium deficiency and a small deficiency in claim reserves in CNA’s long term care business as further discussed in the Reserves –
Estimates and Uncertainties section of this MD&A. In addition, results in 2015 decreased $78 million ($46 million after tax and noncontrolling interests) as compared to 2014 as a result of the application of retroactive reinsurance accounting to
adverse reserve development ceded under the 2010 A&EP loss portfolio transfer, as further discussed in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. In addition, results in 2015 included lower net investment
income and investment losses driven by lower limited partnership results and higher other than temporary impairment (“OTTI”) losses, partially offset by improved underwriting results. Results in 2014 were impacted by a $31 million (after
tax and noncontrolling interests) loss on a coinsurance transaction related to the sale of CNA’s former life insurance subsidiary.

Compared with 2013

Income from continuing operations decreased $27 million in 2014 as compared with 2013 due to
lower net investment income of $215 million, primarily driven by reduced limited partnership results, lower favorable net prior year development and a $31 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) loss on the coinsurance transaction. These
decreases were partially offset by an increase of $38 million ($22 million after tax and noncontrolling interests) in investment gains, improved current accident year underwriting results and the prior year impact of a $111 million (after tax and
noncontrolling interests) deferred gain under retroactive reinsurance accounting related to the loss portfolio transfer. Further information on net prior year development for 2014 and 2013 is included in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included under Item 8.



CNA Property and Casualty Insurance Operations

CNA’s property and casualty insurance operations consist of professional, financial, specialty property and casualty
products and services and commercial insurance and risk management products.

In evaluating the results of the property
and casualty businesses, CNA utilizes the loss ratio, the expense ratio, the dividend ratio and the combined ratio. These ratios are calculated using GAAP financial results. The loss ratio is the percentage of net incurred claim and claim adjustment
expenses to net earned premiums. The expense ratio is the percentage of insurance underwriting and acquisition expenses, including the amortization of deferred acquisition costs, to net earned premiums. The dividend ratio is the ratio of
policyholders’ dividends incurred to net earned premiums. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss, expense and dividend ratios. In addition, CNA also utilizes rate, retention and new business in evaluating operating trends. Rate represents
the average change in price on policies that renew excluding exposure change. Retention represents the percentage of premium dollars renewed in comparison to the expiring premium dollars from policies available to renew. New business represents
premiums from policies written with new customers and additional policies written with existing customers.

For International, this does not include Hardy new business.

2015 Compared with 2014

Net written premiums decreased $115 million in 2015 as compared with 2014. This decrease was driven by the unfavorable effect
of foreign currency exchange rates, the 2014 termination of a specialty product managing general underwriter relationship in Canada and unfavorable premium development at Hardy, for International, lower new business in Specialty and the residual
effect of previous underwriting actions undertaken in certain business classes, offset by positive rate, higher retention and new business in Commercial. Net earned premiums decreased $283 million in 2015 as compared with 2014, consistent with the
trend in net written premiums.

Net operating income decreased $42 million in 2015 as compared with 2014. The decrease in
net operating income was due to lower net investment income and less favorable underwriting results in International, partially offset by improved underwriting results in Commercial. Catastrophe losses were $85 million (after tax and noncontrolling
interests) in 2015 as compared to catastrophe losses of $92 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) in 2014.

Favorable net prior year development of $218 million and $50 million was recorded in 2015 and 2014. Further information on net
prior year development is included in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

Specialty’s combined ratio increased 1.1 points in 2015 as compared with 2014. The loss ratio increased 0.1 point due to
deterioration in the current accident year loss ratio, primarily offset by higher net favorable prior year development. The expense ratio increased 1.0 point in 2015 as compared with 2014, driven by increased underwriting expenses and the
unfavorable effect of lower net earned premiums.

Commercial’s combined ratio improved 7.8 points in 2015 as compared
with 2014. The loss ratio improved 10.2 points, due to favorable net prior year development for 2015 as compared to unfavorable net prior year development for 2014 and an improved current accident year loss ratio. The expense ratio increased 2.4
points in 2015 as compared with 2014, due to higher expenses including increased commissions, the favorable impact in 2014 of recoveries on insurance receivables written off in prior years and the unfavorable effect of lower net earned premiums.



International’s combined ratio increased 5.2 points in 2015 as compared with
2014. The loss ratio increased 6.0 points, primarily due to less favorable net prior year development and an increase in the current accident year loss ratio driven by large losses. The expense ratio improved 0.8 points as compared with 2014, due to
lower expenses, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of lower net earned premiums.

2014 Compared with 2013

Net written premiums decreased $263 million in 2014 as compared with 2013. The decrease in net written premiums was primarily
driven by a lower level of new business, reflecting competitive market conditions in Commercial and Specialty, underwriting actions taken in certain business classes in Commercial and a 2013 commutation by Hardy, partially offset by continued rate
increases in Commercial. Net earned premiums decreased $58 million in 2014 as compared with 2013, consistent with decreases in net written premiums.

Net operating income decreased $157 million in 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily due to lower net investment income, less
favorable net prior year development and a legal settlement benefit of $28 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) in 2013 for Commercial, partially offset by improved current accident year underwriting results in Specialty and Commercial.
Catastrophe losses were $92 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) in 2014 as compared to $100 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) in 2013.

Favorable net prior year development decreased by $105 million, from $155 million in 2013 to $50 million in 2014. Further
information on net prior year development is included in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

Specialty’s combined ratio increased 0.5 points in 2014 as compared with 2013. The loss ratio increased 0.3 points due to
less favorable net prior year development, partially offset by improvement in the current accident year loss ratio.

Commercial’s combined ratio and loss ratio in 2014 were largely consistent with 2013. The expense ratio improved 0.3
points in 2014 as compared with 2013, primarily due to the favorable impact of recoveries on insurance receivables written off in prior years.

International’s combined ratio improved 0.7 points in 2014 as compared with 2013. The loss ratio increased 0.1 points,
due to the higher current accident year loss ratio, substantially offset by the impact of commutations. The expense ratio improved 0.8 points in 2014 as compared with 2013, primarily due to decreased acquisition expenses.

Other Non-Core Operations

Other Non-Core primarily includes the results of CNA’s long term care business that is in run-off and also includes
certain CNA corporate expenses, including interest on corporate debt and the results of certain property and casualty business in run-off, including CNA Re and A&EP. Long term care policies were sold on both an individual and group basis. While
considered non-core, new enrollees in existing groups were accepted through February 1, 2016.

2015 Compared with 2014

Net loss from continuing operations increased $264 million in 2015 as compared with 2014, driven by a $296 million charge
related to recognition of a premium deficiency and a $9 million deficiency in claim reserves in CNA’s long term care business. The impact of both of these items was $177 million (after-tax and noncontrolling interests), as further discussed in
the Reserves – Estimates and Uncertainties section of this MD&A. As a result of recognizing the premium deficiency, the actuarial assumptions used to determine long term care Future policy benefit reserves were unlocked. The December 31,
2015 Future policy benefit reserves for long term care are based on CNA’s best estimate assumptions with no margin for adverse deviation. Since there is no margin in the carried reserves, CNA may have to unlock its reserve assumptions in the
future. Factors that could affect the need to unlock reserve assumptions include the significance and persistence of variances between actual experience and the expected results contemplated in the best estimate reserves as well as changes in
CNA’s outlook of the future. The periodic operating results for this business in 2016 will reflect any variance between actual experience and the expected results contemplated in CNA’s best estimate reserves.

Excluding the effects of these items, results in 2015 were also negatively affected by higher morbidity in CNA’s long
term care business. Results in 2014 were negatively affected by a $31 million loss (after-tax and noncontrolling interests) on a coinsurance transaction related to the sale of CNA’s former life insurance subsidiary.

Results in 2015 were also negatively impacted by an increase in gross A&EP claim reserves. While all of this reserve
development is reinsured under the loss portfolio transfer, only a portion of the reinsurance recovery is currently recognized because of the application of retroactive reinsurance accounting. As a result, the comparison with 2014 was negatively
affected by $78 million ($46 million after tax and noncontrolling interests), as further discussed in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. Additionally, results in 2015 benefited from lower interest expense
due to the maturity of higher coupon debt in the fourth quarter of 2014.



2014 Compared with 2013

Results from continuing operations increased $107 million in 2014 as compared with 2013, primarily driven by the prior year
impact of a $111 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) deferred gain under retroactive reinsurance accounting related to the loss portfolio transfer. Results in 2014 included a $50 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) benefit
related to a postretirement plan curtailment, substantially offset by a $49 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) lump sum pension plan settlement, as further discussed in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included
under Item 8.

Results in CNA’s long term care and life settlement business improved in 2014, but that improvement
was substantially offset by the $31 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) loss on the coinsurance transaction related to the sale of CNA’s former life insurance subsidiary and results for CNA’s remaining structured settlements.
The improved results in long term care were driven by higher net investment income attributable to a higher invested asset base and portfolio allocation of tax-exempt bonds, rate increase actions and the slightly more favorable net morbidity and
persistency.

Diamond Offshore

Diamond Offshore’s pretax income is primarily a function of contract drilling revenue earned less contract drilling
expenses incurred or recognized. The two most significant variables affecting Diamond Offshore’s contract drilling revenues are dayrates earned and rig utilization rates achieved by its rigs, each of which is a function of rig supply and demand
in the marketplace. These factors are not within Diamond Offshore’s control and are difficult to predict. Diamond Offshore generally recognizes revenue from dayrate drilling contracts as services are performed, consequently, when a rig is idle,
no dayrate is earned and revenue will decrease as a result. Revenues can also be affected as a result of the acquisition or disposal of rigs, rig mobilizations, required surveys and shipyard projects. In connection with certain drilling contracts,
Diamond Offshore may receive fees for the mobilization of equipment. In addition, some of Diamond Offshore’s drilling contracts require downtime before the start of the contract to prepare the rig to meet customer requirements for which it may
or may not be compensated.

Diamond Offshore’s pretax income is also a function of varying levels of operating
expenses. Operating expenses generally are not affected by changes in dayrates, and short term reductions in utilization do not necessarily result in lower operating expenses. For instance, if a rig is to be idle for a short period of time, few
decreases in operating expenses may actually occur since the rig is typically maintained in a prepared or “warm stacked” state with a full crew. In addition, when a rig is idle, Diamond Offshore is responsible for certain operating
expenses such as rig fuel and supply boat costs, which are typically costs of the operator when a rig is under contract. However, if the rig is to be idle for an extended period of time, Diamond Offshore may reduce the size of a rig’s crew and
take steps to “cold stack” the rig, which lowers expenses and partially offsets the impact on pretax income. The cost of cold stacking a rig can vary depending on the type of rig. The costs of cold stacking a drillship, for example, is
typically substantially higher than the cost of cold stacking a jack-up rig or an older floater rig.

Operating expenses
represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation and maintenance of Diamond Offshore’s drilling equipment. The principal components of Diamond Offshore’s operating costs are, among other things, direct and indirect
costs of labor and benefits, repairs and maintenance, freight, regulatory inspections, boat and helicopter rentals and insurance. Labor and repair and maintenance costs represent the most significant components of Diamond Offshore’s operating
expenses. In general, labor costs increase primarily due to higher salary levels, rig staffing requirements and costs associated with labor regulations in the geographic regions in which Diamond Offshore’s rigs operate. In addition, the costs
associated with training new and seasoned employees can be significant. Costs to repair and maintain equipment fluctuate depending upon the type of activity the drilling rig is performing, as well as the age and condition of the equipment and the
regions in which Diamond Offshore’s rigs are working.

Pretax income is negatively impacted when Diamond Offshore
performs certain regulatory inspections, which it refers to as a 5-year survey, or special survey, that are due every five years for each of Diamond Offshore’s rigs. Operating revenue decreases because these special surveys are generally
performed during scheduled downtime in a shipyard. Operating expenses increase as a result of these special surveys due to the cost to mobilize the rigs to a shipyard, inspection costs incurred and repair and maintenance costs which are recognized
as incurred. Repair and



maintenance activities may result from the special survey or may have been previously planned to take place during this mandatory downtime. The number of rigs undergoing a 5-year survey will vary
from year to year, as well as from quarter to quarter.

In addition, pretax income may also be negatively impacted by
intermediate surveys, which are performed at interim periods between 5-year surveys. Intermediate surveys are generally less extensive in duration and scope than a 5-year survey. Although an intermediate survey may require some downtime for the
drilling rig, it normally does not require dry-docking or shipyard time, except for rigs, generally older than 15 years that are located in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) sector of the North Sea.

During 2016, Diamond Offshore expects to spend approximately 535 days for the mobilization of rigs and contract acceptance
testing, including days associated with mobilization and acceptance testing for the

Ocean GreatWhite

, which is under construction and expected to be delivered in mid-2016 and rig modifications and acceptance testing for the

Ocean
BlackRhino

, which is scheduled to begin operating under a new contract in January of 2017. Diamond Offshore expects the

Ocean Endeavor

to be unavailable through mid-2016 as it demobilizes out of the Black Sea. Diamond Offshore can provide
no assurance as to the exact timing and/or duration of downtime associated with regulatory inspections, planned rig mobilizations and other shipyard projects.

In April 2015, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (an agency established by the U.S. Department of the
Interior that governs the offshore drilling industry on the Outer Continental Shelf) announced proposed rules that, when enacted, will include more stringent design requirements for well control equipment used in offshore drilling operations. Based
on Diamond Offshore’s assessment of the proposed rules, it believes that it may need to incur significant capital costs to comply with the additional design requirements to enable its cold-stacked mid-water semisubmersibles to return to work in
U.S. waters.

Diamond Offshore is self-insured for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the
U.S. Gulf of Mexico (“GOM”). If a named windstorm in the GOM causes significant damage to Diamond Offshore’s rigs or equipment, it could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Under its insurance policy, Diamond Offshore carries physical damage insurance for certain losses other than those caused by named windstorms in the GOM for which its deductible for physical damage is $25 million per occurrence. Diamond Offshore
does not typically retain loss-of-hire insurance policies to cover its rigs.

In addition, under its current insurance
policy, Diamond Offshore carries marine liability insurance covering certain legal liabilities, including coverage for certain personal injury claims, and generally covering liabilities arising out of or relating to pollution and/or environmental
risk. Diamond Offshore believes that the policy limit for its marine liability insurance is within the range that is customary for companies of its size in the offshore drilling industry and is appropriate for Diamond Offshore’s business.
Diamond Offshore’s deductibles for marine liability coverage, including for personal injury claims, are $25 million for the first occurrence and vary in amounts ranging between $5 million and, if aggregate claims exceed certain thresholds, up
to $100 million for each subsequent occurrence, depending on the nature, severity and frequency of claims that might arise during the policy year.

Recent Developments

Market fundamentals in the oil and gas industry deteriorated further in the fourth quarter of 2015 and have continued to
decline in 2016. In early January 2016, oil prices fell to a 12-year low below $30 per barrel, with some industry analysts predicting even lower commodity prices before any market recovery. Oil markets continue to be volatile due to a number of
geopolitical and economic factors. These factors, combined with significant operating losses incurred during the fourth quarter of 2015 by some independent and national oil companies and exploration and production companies, have caused most of
these companies to announce additional cuts to their already reduced 2016 capital spending plans, reflecting delays in planned drilling or exploration projects, and, in some cases, termination of projects altogether. Rig tenders are infrequent and
have generally been limited to short-term or well-to-well work not commencing until 2017 or later. There have been very few rig tenders thus far in 2016.

The offshore floater market is currently faced with an oversupply of drilling rigs, which thus far has only been slightly
abated by the cold stacking and retirement of rigs. The number of available rigs continues to grow as contracted rigs come off contract and newbuilds are delivered, increasing competition. Competition for the limited number of



drilling jobs continues to be intense with some operators bidding multiple rigs on the same job, in some cases, bidding rigs of both higher and lower specifications. Operators are also continuing
to attempt to sublet previously contracted rigs for which capital spending programs have been delayed or canceled. Industry analysts have predicted that the offshore contract drilling market may remain depressed with further declines in dayrates and
utilization likely in 2016 and 2017.

As a result of the depressed market conditions and continued pessimistic outlook for
the near term, certain of Diamond Offshore’s customers, as well as those of its competitors, have attempted to renegotiate or terminate existing drilling contracts. Such renegotiations could include requests to lower the contract dayrate,
lowering of a dayrate in exchange for additional contract term, shortening the term on one contracted rig in exchange for additional term on another rig, early termination of a contract in exchange for a lump sum margin payout and many other
possibilities. In addition to the potential for renegotiations, some of Diamond Offshore’s drilling contracts permit the customer to terminate the contract early after specified notice periods, sometimes resulting in no payment to Diamond
Offshore or sometimes resulting in a contractually specified termination amount, which may not fully compensate it for the loss of the contract. During depressed market conditions, certain customers have utilized such contract clauses to seek to
renegotiate or terminate a drilling contract or claim that Diamond Offshore has breached provisions of its drilling contracts in order to avoid their obligations to Diamond Offshore under circumstances where it believes it is in compliance with the
contracts. Particularly during depressed market conditions, the early termination of a contract may result in a rig being idle for an extended period of time, which could adversely affect Diamond Offshore’s business. When a customer terminates
a contract prior to the contract’s scheduled expiration, Diamond Offshore’s contract backlog is also adversely impacted.

Diamond Offshore’s results of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2015 have been materially
impacted by depressed market conditions in the offshore drilling industry. Diamond Offshore currently expects that these adverse market conditions will continue for the foreseeable future. The continuation of these conditions for an extended period
could result in more of its rigs being without contracts and/or cold stacked or scrapped and could further materially and adversely affect Diamond Offshore’s business. When Diamond Offshore cold stacks or elects to scrap a rig, they evaluate
the rig for impairment. During 2015, Diamond Offshore recognized an aggregate impairment loss of $861 million, including an impairment loss of $499 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2015.

As of February 16, 2016, 17 of Diamond Offshore’s rigs were not subject to a drilling contract with a customer, including
14 rigs that have been cold stacked. Of the cold stacked rigs, four jack-up rigs are currently being marketed for sale. A previously cold stacked jack-up rig

was sold in February of 2016.

Globally, the ultra-deepwater and deepwater floater markets continue to be depressed. Diminished or nonexistent demand,
combined with an oversupply of rigs has caused floater dayrates to decline significantly. Offshore drilling contractors have been approached by customers with binding contracts, who have sought to and have successfully renegotiated such contracts at
lower rates to obtain some financial relief in the current market, and, in some cases, have terminated contracts with and without compensation to the associated drilling contractor. Industry analysts expect offshore drillers to continue to scrap
older, lower specification rigs; however, newer and higher specification rigs have not been immune to the recycling trend. In addition, industry analysts predict that the number of uncontracted floaters may more than double by the end of 2016.

Newbuild rig deliveries and established rigs coming off contract continue to fuel an oversupply of floaters in both the
ultra-deepwater and deepwater markets. In an effort to manage the oversupply of rigs and potentially avoid the cost of cold stacking newly-built rigs, which, in the case of dynamically-positioned rigs, can be significant, several drilling
contractors have exercised options to delay the delivery of rigs by the shipyard or have exercised their right to cancel orders due to the late delivery of rigs. As of the date of this report, based on industry data, there are approximately 54
competitive, or non-owner-operated, newbuild floaters on order, 32 of which are not yet contracted for future work. In addition, based on industry reports, there are currently 20 newbuild floaters scheduled for delivery in 2016, of which only four
rigs have been contracted for future work; however, industry analysts predict that delivery dates may shift as newbuild owners negotiate with their respective shipyards.



While conditions in the mid-water market vary slightly by region, mid-water rigs
have been adversely impacted by (i) lower demand, (ii) declining dayrates, (iii) increased regulatory requirements, including more stringent design requirements for well control equipment, which could significantly increase the capital needed to
comply with design requirements that would permit such rigs to work in U.S. waters, (iv) the challenges experienced by lower specification units in this segment as a result of more complex customer specifications, and (v) the intensified competition
resulting from the migration of some deepwater and ultra-deepwater units to compete against mid-water units. To date, the mid-water market has seen the highest number of cold-stacked and scrapped rigs. Since 2012, Diamond Offshore has sold 12 of its
mid-water rigs for scrap. As market conditions remain challenging, Diamond Offshore expects higher specification rigs to take the place of lower specification units, where possible, leading to additional lower specification rigs being cold stacked
or ultimately scrapped.

Impact of changes in tax laws or their interpretation

Diamond Offshore operates through various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world. As a result, it is
subject to highly complex tax laws, treaties and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates, which may change and are subject to interpretation. Changes in laws, treaties and regulations and the interpretation of such laws, treaties and
regulations may put Diamond Offshore at risk for future tax assessments and liabilities which could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and our results of operations and cash flows. Further information
is provided in Notes 10 and 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

Contract Drilling Backlog

The following table reflects Diamond Offshore’s contract drilling backlog as of February 16, 2016 (based on contract
information known at that time), October 1, 2015 (the date reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for quarter ended September 30, 2015) and February 9, 2015 (the date reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2014). Contract drilling backlog as presented below includes only firm commitments (typically represented by signed contracts) and is calculated by multiplying the contracted operating dayrate by the firm contract period and adding one-half of any
potential rig performance bonuses. Diamond Offshore’s calculation also assumes full utilization of its drilling equipment for the contract period (excluding scheduled shipyard and survey days); however, the amount of actual revenue earned and
the actual periods during which revenues are earned will be different than the amounts and periods shown in the tables below due to various factors. Utilization rates, which generally approach 92% - 98% during contracted periods, can be adversely
impacted by downtime due to various operating factors including, but not limited to, weather conditions and unscheduled repairs and maintenance. Contract drilling backlog excludes revenues for mobilization, demobilization, contract preparation and
customer reimbursables. No revenue is generally earned during periods of downtime for regulatory surveys. Changes in Diamond Offshore’s contract drilling backlog between periods are generally a function of the performance of work on term
contracts, as well as the extension or modification of existing term contracts and the execution of additional contracts. In addition, under certain circumstances, Diamond Offshore’s customers may seek to terminate or renegotiate its contracts.

2015 Compared with 2014

Contract drilling revenue decreased $377 million in 2015 as compared with 2014, and contract drilling expense decreased $296
million during the same period. Contract drilling revenue decreased primarily due to a decrease in revenue earned by both mid-water and jack-up fleets, partially offset by an increase in revenue earned by both ultra-deepwater and deepwater floaters.
The decrease in contract drilling revenue also reflects a decrease in revenue earning days primarily due to cold stacking, rig sales and incremental downtime between contracts for several rigs, partially offset by incremental revenue earning days
for newly constructed and upgraded or enhanced rigs.

Revenue generated by ultra-deepwater floaters increased $352 million
in 2015 as compared with 2014 primarily as a result of an increase in utilization of $248 million and higher average daily revenue earned of $104 million. Total revenue earning days increased primarily due to incremental revenue days for Diamond
Offshore’s newbuild drillships, the

Ocean Endeavor,

offshore Romania,

and the

Ocean Monarch,

offshore Australia, partially offset by fewer revenue earning days for Diamond Offshore’s other ultra-deepwater floaters,
including the early termination of drilling contracts for the

Ocean Baroness

and

Ocean Clipper

. Average daily revenue increased in 2015 primarily due to revenue associated with the operation of three additional drillships and the

Ocean Endeavor

, including higher amortized mobilization and contract preparation revenue and a favorable dayrate adjustment for the

Ocean Courage

.

Revenue generated by deepwater floaters increased $54 million in 2015 as compared with 2014 primarily due to an increase in
utilization of $55 million. The increase in revenue earning days resulted from incremental operating days for four rigs after prolonged periods of nonproductive time for planned upgrades and surveys, as well as warm stacking between contracts,
partially offset by fewer revenue earning days due to the cold stacking of the

Ocean Star

and additional non-revenue earning days for rig mobilization and repairs.

Revenue generated by mid-water floaters decreased $689 million in 2015 as compared with 2014 primarily due to a decrease in
utilization of $688 million. The decrease in revenue earning days resulted from the cold stacking or retirement of 12 mid-water rigs and the idling of the

Ocean Guardian

and

Ocean Quest

between contracts, partially offset by
incremental revenue earning days for the

Ocean Patriot

, operating in the North Sea, and the

Ocean Ambassador,

which is expected to complete its contract offshore Mexico in the first quarter of 2016.



Revenue generated by jack-up rigs decreased $94 million in 2015 as compared with
2014, primarily due to reduced utilization for five rigs that were under contract in 2014, but were cold stacked and marketed for sale at the end of 2015. In addition, revenue for 2015 was negatively impacted by a negotiated dayrate reduction for
the remaining actively marketed jack-up rig, the

Ocean Scepter

.

A net loss of $156 million in 2015 and net income
of $183 million in 2014 resulted in a change of $339 million due to the impact of a $341 million asset impairment charge (after tax and noncontrolling interests) in 2015 related to the carrying value of 17 drilling rigs, as compared to the prior
year when Diamond Offshore recorded a $55 million asset impairment charge (after tax and noncontrolling interests) related to the carrying values of six drilling rigs. Results in 2015 also include the recognition of a $20 million impairment charge
to write off all goodwill associated with the Company’s investment in Diamond Offshore as well as higher depreciation and interest expense.

2014 Compared with 2013

Contract drilling revenue decreased $107 million in 2014 as compared with 2013. Contract drilling revenue decreased primarily
due to fewer overall revenue earning days, partially offset by higher average daily revenue primarily earned by ultra-deepwater floaters.

Revenue generated by ultra-deepwater floaters increased $133 million in 2014 as compared with 2013 as a result of higher
average daily revenue of $219 million, including the recognition of incremental mobilization and contract preparation fees of $51 million, partially offset by a decrease in utilization of $86 million. Average daily revenue increased primarily due to
several rigs operating under higher dayrates as compared to 2013. The reduction in revenue earning days is primarily due to incremental downtime for inspections and shipyard projects, including the

Ocean Confidence

life-extension project,
downtime in between contracts and rig mobilizations, partially offset by a reduction in unscheduled downtime for repairs and incremental revenue earning days for the

Ocean BlackHawk

which was placed in service in 2014.

Revenue generated by deepwater floaters decreased $123 million in 2014 as compared with 2013 primarily due to lower
utilization of $131 million, partially offset by higher average daily revenue of $8 million which reflected an increase in amortized mobilization and contract preparation revenue. The decrease in revenue earning days was the result of unplanned
downtime associated with the warm stacking of rigs between contracts and incremental scheduled downtime for surveys and shipyard projects and rig mobilizations, partially offset by incremental revenue earning days for the

Ocean Onyx

which was
placed into service during 2014.

Revenue generated by mid-water floaters decreased $121 million in 2014 as compared with
2013 primarily due to lower utilization of $62 million and lower average daily revenue of $59 million. The decrease in revenue earning days reflects the net impact of unplanned downtime associated with the cold stacking of rigs, unpaid equipment
repairs and downtime between contracts, partially offset by a reduction in planned downtime for shipyard projects and regulatory inspections. The decrease in average daily revenue primarily reflects lower amortized mobilization and contract
preparation revenue of $36 million and the

Ocean Quest

operating in Vietnam at a lower dayrate in 2014 as compared with 2013, partially offset by higher dayrates earned by Diamond Offshore’s North Sea rigs.

Revenue generated by jack-up rigs increased $4 million in 2014 as compared with 2013 primarily due to an increase in average
daily revenue of $14 million as a result of higher dayrates earned by several jack-up rigs during 2014, partially offset by lower utilization of $9 million compared to the prior year period.



Net income decreased $74 million in 2014 as compared with 2013 primarily
reflecting the decrease in revenue, the impact of a $109 million impairment loss ($55 million after tax and noncontrolling interests) related to the carrying value of Diamond Offshore’s semisubmersible rigs, higher general and administrative
expense and depreciation expense, as well as an increase in interest expense related to the $1.0 billion of senior unsecured notes issued in November of 2013. General and administrative costs for 2014 include higher employee compensation and
termination benefits paid to certain current and former key executives. These increases were partially offset by a $9 million gain ($3 million after tax and noncontrolling interests) recognized on the sale of the previously held for sale jack-up rig

Ocean Spartan

in the second quarter of 2014. Diamond Offshore recognized a charge for an uncollectible receivable of $23 million ($9 million after tax and noncontrolling interests) in 2013.

Diamond Offshore’s effective tax rate decreased in 2014 as compared with 2013 primarily due to differences in the mix of
Diamond Offshore’s domestic and international pretax earnings and losses. Also contributing to the lower 2014 effective tax rate was the reversal of $55 million ($27 million after noncontrolling interests) of reserves for uncertain tax
positions in various foreign jurisdictions which were settled in Diamond Offshore’s favor or for which the statute of limitations had expired. The 2013 period was negatively impacted by a provision of $57 million ($27 million after
noncontrolling interests) related to an uncertain tax position in Egypt, partially offset by the impact of The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which reduced income tax expense by $28 million ($13 million after noncontrolling interests).

As Diamond Offshore’s rigs frequently operate in different tax jurisdictions as they move from contract to contract, its
effective tax rate can fluctuate substantially and its historical effective tax rates may not be sustainable and could increase materially.

Boardwalk
Pipeline

Boardwalk Pipeline derives revenues primarily from the transportation and storage of natural gas and natural
gas liquids (“NGLs”) and gathering and processing of natural gas for third parties. Transportation services consist of firm natural gas transportation, where the customer pays a capacity reservation charge to reserve pipeline capacity at
receipt and delivery points along pipeline systems, plus a commodity and fuel charge on the volume of natural gas actually transported, and interruptible natural gas transportation, where the customer pays to transport gas only when capacity is
available and used. Boardwalk Pipeline offers firm natural gas storage services in which the customer reserves and pays for a specific amount of storage capacity, including injection and withdrawal rights, and interruptible storage and parking and
lending (“PAL”) services where the customer receives and pays for capacity only when it is available and used. Boardwalk Pipeline also transports and stores NGLs. Boardwalk Pipeline’s NGL contracts for most of its services are fee
based or based on minimum volume requirements, while others are dependent on actual volumes transported. Boardwalk Pipeline’s NGL storage rates are market-based and contracts are typically fixed price arrangements with escalation clauses.
Boardwalk Pipeline is not in the business of buying and selling natural gas and NGLs other than for system management purposes, but changes in natural gas and NGLs prices may impact the volumes of natural gas or NGLs transported and stored by
customers on its systems. Due to the capital intensive nature of its business, Boardwalk Pipeline’s operating costs and expenses typically do not vary significantly based upon the amount of products transported, with the exception of fuel
consumed at its compressor stations and not included in a fuel tracker.

Market Conditions and Contract Renewals

Transportation rates that Boardwalk Pipeline is able to charge customers are heavily influenced by longer term trends in, for
example, the amount and geographical location of natural gas production and demand for gas by end users such as power plants, petrochemical facilities and liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) export facilities. Changes in certain longer term
trends such as the development of gas production from the Marcellus and Utica production areas located in the northeastern U.S. and changes to related pipeline infrastructure have resulted in a sustained narrowing of basis differentials
corresponding to traditional flow patterns on Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas pipeline systems (generally south to north and west to east), reducing the transportation rates and adversely impacting other contract terms that Boardwalk Pipeline
can negotiate with its customers for available transportation capacity and for contracts due for renewal for Boardwalk Pipeline’s transportation services. These conditions have had, and Boardwalk Pipeline expects will continue to have, a
material adverse effect on Boardwalk Pipeline’s revenues, earnings and distributable cash flows. Further, during 2015, the prices of oil and natural gas declined significantly



from an increase in supplies mainly from shale production areas in the U.S. which has adversely impacted the businesses of certain of Boardwalk Pipeline’s producer customers. If the recent
declines in prices were to continue for a sustained period of time, the businesses of other members of Boardwalk Pipeline’s producer customer group could be adversely affected which, in turn, would reduce the demand for Boardwalk
Pipeline’s services and could result in the non-renewal of contracted capacity, or the renewal of capacity at lower rates when existing contracts expire.

A substantial portion of Boardwalk Pipeline’s transportation capacity is contracted for under firm transportation
agreements. Actual revenues recognized from capacity reservation and minimum bill charges in 2015 were $940 million. Approximate projected revenues from capacity reservation and minimum bill charges under committed firm transportation agreements in
place as of December 31, 2015, for each of the full years 2016 and 2017 are $1,010 million and $1,030 million. The amounts shown for 2015 and 2016 increased approximately $30 million and $110 million from what was previously reported in our
2014 10-K. Approximately half of the increase in each year is due to contract renewals during 2015 and new contracts that were entered into in 2015. The remainder is due to the settled Gulf South rate case, which resulted in a general increase in
rates, and the extension to 2023 of certain NNS contracts. Included in these revenues are approximately $25 million for 2017 that are anticipated under executed precedent transportation agreements for projects that are subject to regulatory
approval to commence construction. Additional revenues Boardwalk Pipeline has recognized and may receive under firm transportation agreements based on actual utilization of the contracted pipeline facilities or any expected revenues for periods
after the expiration dates of the existing agreements or execution of precedent agreements associated with growth projects or events that occurred subsequent to December 31, 2015 are not included in these amounts.

Each year a portion of Boardwalk Pipeline’s firm transportation agreements expire and need to be renewed or replaced.
Over the past several years, Boardwalk Pipeline has renewed many expiring transportation contracts at lower rates and for shorter terms than in the past, or not renewed the contracts at all which has materially adversely impacted transportation
revenues. Capacity not renewed and available for sale on a short term basis has been and continues to be sold under short term firm or interruptible contracts at rates reflective of basis spreads, which generally have been lower than historical
rates, or in some cases not sold at all. Rates for short term and interruptible transportation services are influenced by the factors discussed above but can be more heavily affected by shorter term conditions such as current and forecasted weather.

Demand has increased to transport gas from north to south, instead of south to north as had been the traditional flow
pattern. This demand is being driven primarily by increases in gas production from the Marcellus and Utica production areas and growing demand for natural gas in the Gulf Coast area from new and planned power plants, petrochemical facilities and LNG
export facilities. This flow pattern has resulted in growth opportunities for Boardwalk Pipeline that require significant capital expenditures, among other things, to make parts of Boardwalk Pipeline’s system bi-directional, and in many
instances, will utilize existing pipeline capacity that has been turned back to Boardwalk Pipeline by customers that have not renewed expiring contracts. These projects have lengthy planning and construction periods and as a result, will not
contribute to Boardwalk Pipeline’s earnings and cash flows until they are placed into service over the next several years. In some instances the projects remain subject to regulatory approval to commence construction. These projects are also
subject to the risk that they may not be completed, may be impacted by significant cost overruns or may be materially changed prior to completion as a result of future developments or circumstances that Boardwalk Pipeline cannot predict at this
time.

The value of Boardwalk Pipeline’s storage and PAL services (comprised of parking gas for customers and/or
lending gas to customers) is affected by natural gas price differentials between time periods, such as winter to summer (time period price spreads), price volatility of natural gas and other factors. Boardwalk Pipeline’s storage and parking
services have greater value when the natural gas futures market is in contango (a positive time period price spread, meaning that current price quotes for delivery of natural gas further in the future are higher than in the nearer term), while its
lending service has greater value when the futures market is backwardated (a negative time period price spread, meaning that current price quotes for delivery of natural gas in the nearer term are higher than further in the future). The value of
both storage and PAL services may also be favorably impacted by increased volatility in the price of natural gas, which allows Boardwalk Pipeline to optimize the value of its storage and PAL capacity.



Boardwalk Pipeline has seen the value of its storage and PAL services adversely
impacted by some of the market factors discussed above, as well as there being fewer market participants from a decrease in the number of marketers taking storage positions, which has contributed to a narrowing of time period price spreads. Although
in recent months, Boardwalk Pipeline has seen an increase in volatility that has allowed it to lock in favorable price spreads, generally, these factors have reduced the rates it can charge and the capacity it can sell under its storage and PAL
services.

Pipeline System Maintenance

Boardwalk Pipeline incurs substantial costs for ongoing maintenance of its pipeline systems and related facilities, including
those incurred for pipeline integrity management activities, equipment overhauls, general upkeep and repairs. These costs are not dependent on the amount of revenues earned from its natural gas transportation services. The Pipeline and Hazardous
Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) has developed regulations that require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain areas along pipelines and take additional
measures to protect pipeline segments located in highly populated areas. These regulations have resulted in an overall increase in ongoing maintenance costs, including maintenance capital and maintenance expense. PHMSA has proposed more stringent
regulations, including expanded integrity management requirements, automatic or remote-controlled valve use, leak detection system installation, pipeline material strength testing and verification of maximum allowable pressures of certain pipelines,
which if implemented, could require Boardwalk Pipeline to incur significant additional costs.

Maintenance costs may be
capitalized or expensed, depending on the nature of the activities. For any given reporting period, the mix of projects that Boardwalk Pipeline undertakes will affect the amounts it records as property, plant and equipment on its balance sheet or
recognize as expenses, which impacts Boardwalk Pipeline’s earnings. In 2016, Boardwalk Pipeline expects to incur approximately $330 million to maintain its pipeline systems, of which approximately $130 million is expected to be maintenance
capital. In 2015, these costs were $352 million, of which $143 million was recorded as maintenance capital. The projected decrease of approximately $22 million is primarily driven by the completion, in 2015, of maintenance activities associated with
certain brine facilities. The maintenance capital amounts discussed above reflect pipeline integrity upgrades associated with certain segments of Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas pipelines which will be completed over the ensuing three years.

Credit Risk

Credit
risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from the nonperformance by a customer of its contractual obligations. Boardwalk Pipeline actively monitors its customers’ credit profiles, as well as, the portion of its revenues generated from
investment-grade and non-investment-grade customers. Approximately $1.0 billion of operating revenues in 2015 were earned from Boardwalk Pipeline’s top 50 customers. While almost all of these customers are rated investment-grade by at least one
of the major credit rating agencies, many oil and gas producers have recently had their ratings placed under review.

Credit risk also exists in relation to Boardwalk Pipeline’s growth projects, both because the foundation shippers have
made long-term commitments to it for capacity on such projects and certain of the foundation shippers have agreed to provide credit support as construction progresses. A large majority of these foundation shippers are rated investment-grade by at
least one of the major credit rating agencies. As discussed elsewhere in this filing, Boardwalk Pipeline had one customer fail to post the required credit support on the contractually required date.

Natural gas producers comprise a significant portion of Boardwalk Pipeline’s revenues. For example, in 2015,
approximately 50% of its revenues were generated from contracts with natural gas producers. During 2015, the prices of oil and natural gas declined significantly due to an increase in supplies mainly from shale production areas in the U.S. Should
the prices of natural gas and oil remain at current levels for a sustained period of time, or decline further, Boardwalk Pipeline could be exposed to increased credit risk associated with its producer customer group. Boardwalk Pipeline continues to
monitor its credit risk carefully, especially as it relates to customers that may be affected by the current oil and natural gas markets.



Gulf South Rate Case

In October of 2014, Boardwalk Pipeline’s Gulf South subsidiary filed a rate case with the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (“FERC”) pursuant to Section 4 of the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (Docket No. RP15-65), in which Gulf South requested, among other things, a reconfiguration of the transportation rate zones on the Gulf South system and, in general,
an increase in its tariff rates. In 2015, an uncontested settlement was reached with Gulf South’s customers and approved by the FERC. The settlement will become effective March 1, 2016.

The settlement provides for, among other things, (a) a system-wide rate design across the majority of the pipeline system; (b)
a fuel tracker for determining future fuel rates; (c) a moratorium which prevents Gulf South or its customers from modifying the settlement rates until May 1, 2023, with certain exceptions; and (d) an extension of all No Notice Service
(“NNS”) contracts to the end of the moratorium period at maximum rates, subject to each customer’s right to reduce capacity under those agreements from current levels by up to 6% on April 1, 2016, and by up to another 6% of their
remaining contract capacity by April 1, 2020. The NNS customers had to elect by December 1, 2015, whether they wanted to reduce their initial contracted capacity. Only two NNS customers elected to reduce their contracted capacity effective on April
1, 2016.

The settled rates were moved into effect on November 1, 2015. Refunds for the difference between the rates as
filed and as settled are required to be paid to customers by May 1, 2016. For 2015, Boardwalk Pipeline recognized $20 million of additional operating revenues as a result of the rate case. Based on current, contracted capacity, and the elections
made by Gulf South’s NNS customers, Boardwalk Pipeline expects to recognize approximately $30 million in net revenues as a result of the rate case in 2016.

2015 Compared with 2014

Total revenues increased $18 million in 2015 as compared with 2014. This increase is primarily due to higher transportation
revenues of $39 million resulting from growth projects recently placed into service and includes $20 million of additional revenues from the Gulf South rate case. The recently acquired Evangeline pipeline contributed an additional $11 million and
Boardwalk Pipeline received $8 million of proceeds related to a business interruption claim. These increases were partially offset by the comparably warm weather experienced in the early part of the 2015 period in Boardwalk Pipeline’s market
areas, a decrease in fuel retained due to lower natural gas prices and the effects of market and contract renewal conditions discussed above. Storage and PAL revenues were lower by $20 million primarily as a result of the effects of unfavorable
market conditions on time period price spreads

.



Operating expenses decreased $80 million for 2015 as compared with 2014. This
decrease is primarily due to a $94 million prior year charge to write off all capitalized costs associated with the terminated Bluegrass project, a $10 million franchise tax refund related to settlement of prior tax periods and a decrease in fuel
and transportation expense due to lower natural gas prices. These decreases were partially offset by higher depreciation expense of $35 million from an increase in the asset base, including the Evangeline acquisition and a change in the estimated
lives of certain older, low-pressure assets. Maintenance expense increased by $15 million primarily due to pipeline system maintenance activities as discussed above and the Evangeline acquisition. Interest expense increased $11 million primarily due
to higher average debt balances as compared with 2014, lower capitalized interest related to capital projects and the expensing of previously deferred costs related to the refinancing of the revolving credit facility.

Net income for 2015 increased $56 million as compared with 2014, primarily reflecting the prior year Bluegrass charge of $55
million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) and higher revenues partially offset by higher depreciation and interest expense as discussed above.

2014 Compared with 2013

Total revenues increased $4 million in 2014, compared with 2013. This increase is primarily due to a $27 million increase in
transportation and other revenues generally due to the colder than normal winter weather in Boardwalk Pipeline’s market areas and growth projects which were recently placed into service, partially offset by lower firm transportation revenues
due to the effects of the market and contract renewal conditions discussed above. Additionally, revenues increased $13 million from fuel retained primarily due to higher natural gas prices and $15 million from gas sales associated with the Flag City
processing plant, which were offset by gas purchases recorded in Operating expenses. Storage and parking and lending revenues were lower by $22 million primarily as a result of the effects of unfavorable market conditions on natural gas time period
price spreads. The 2013 period was favorably impacted by a $30 million gain from the sale of storage gas.

Operating
expenses increased $155 million in 2014, compared with 2013. This increase is primarily due to a charge of $94 million to write off previously capitalized costs incurred for the Bluegrass Project, a project with The Williams Companies, Inc. which
was dissolved due to cost escalations, construction delays and lack of customer commitments. The higher operating expenses were also caused by a $27 million increase in fuel and transportation expenses primarily driven by gas purchases for the Flag
City processing plant which were offset in revenues and the effects of higher natural gas prices on fuel, a $17 million increase in depreciation expense primarily due to an increase in the asset base and a $12 million increase in operation and
maintenance expenses primarily due to increased maintenance expense projects.

Net income for 2014 decreased $60 million
as compared to 2013 period primarily reflecting the Bluegrass Project related charge and higher operations, maintenance and depreciation expense, partially offset by the prior year goodwill impairment charge of $16 million (after tax and
noncontrolling interests) discussed further below.



Loews Hotels

2015 Compared with 2014

Operating revenues increased $129 million in 2015 as compared with 2014 primarily due to the acquisition of two hotels during
2015 and three hotels during 2014.

Operating and depreciation expenses increased $116 million and $17 million in 2015 as
compared with 2014 primarily due to the acquisition of two hotels during 2015 and three hotels during 2014.

Equity income
increased $18 million in 2015 as compared with 2014 primarily due to improved performance of the Universal Orlando joint ventures, partially offset by a $5 million impairment of a joint venture equity interest in a hotel property.

Interest expense increased $7 million in 2015 as compared with 2014 primarily due to higher debt levels, including
refinancings and new property-level debt incurred to fund acquisitions.

Net income increased slightly as compared to the
prior year as higher income from Universal Orlando joint venture properties was partially offset by the negative impact of transaction and transition costs for hotels acquired during the year and higher interest expense. In addition, the effective
tax rate increased due to an adjustment for prior years’ estimate and a higher state tax accrual for an increase in the ratio of Florida based income.

2014 Compared with 2013

Operating revenues increased $75 million in 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily due to acquisitions in 2014 and the reopening
in January of 2014 of the Loews Regency New York Hotel, which was closed for renovation in 2013. These increases were partially offset by the reduction in revenue recognized by Loews Hotels as a result of the sale of equity interests in two hotels
in July of 2013. For periods following the sale of these equity interests, Loews Hotels’ share of earnings or losses for these hotels is included in Equity income from joint ventures.

Operating expenses increased $52 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to the addition of three hotels and the
reopening of the Loews Regency New York Hotel, partially offset by a reduction in expenses as a result of the sale of equity interests in two hotels.



Equity income from joint venture properties increased $12 million in 2014 as
compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to improved performance of the Universal Orlando properties, including the addition of Universal’s Cabana Bay Beach Resort.

Interest expense increased $5 million in 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily due to the refinancing of a $125 million mortgage
loan for a new $300 million mortgage loan and incremental interest expense from property-level debt incurred to fund acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by the reduction in interest expense as a result of the sale of equity interests
in two hotels.

Corporate and Other

Corporate and Other operations consist primarily of investment income at the Parent Company, corporate interest expenses and
other corporate administrative costs. Investment income includes earnings on cash and short term investments held at the Parent Company level to meet current and future liquidity needs, as well as results of limited partnership investments and the
trading portfolio.

The following table summarizes the results of operations for Corporate and Other for the years ended
December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 as presented in Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8:

2015 Compared with 2014

Net investment income decreased by $72 million in 2015 as compared with 2014 primarily due to lower performance of equities
and derivative related securities in the trading portfolio and lower results from limited partnership investments.

Net
results decreased by $51 million in 2015 as compared with 2014 primarily due to the change in revenues discussed above and increased corporate overhead expenses.

2014 Compared with 2013

Net investment income decreased by $47 million in 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily due to lower results from limited
partnership investments and lower performance of fixed income investments and equity based investments, partially offset by improved performance of foreign currency related investments in the trading portfolio.

Interest expense increased $12 million in 2014, primarily due to a May of 2013 public offering of $500 million aggregate
principal amount of 2.6% senior notes due May 15, 2023 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.1% senior notes due May 15, 2043.



Net results decreased $42 million in 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily due to
the change in revenues and expenses discussed above.

Discontinued Operations

Losses from discontinued operations (after tax and noncontrolling interests) were $371 million and $554 million for the years
ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. Results for the year ended December 31, 2014 reflect an impairment charge of $138 million related to the sale of HighMount, a ceiling test impairment charge of $19 million and losses from HighMount operations of $37
million, including exit and disposal costs related to the sale. Results for the year ended December 31, 2013 include a goodwill impairment charge of $382 million and a ceiling test impairment charge of $186 million.

Results for the year ended December 31, 2014 also include income from CAC operations of $12 million and an impairment charge
of $189 million recorded in connection with the sale of the CAC business. CAC operations had income of $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CNA Financial

Cash Flows

CNA’s primary operating cash flow sources are premiums and investment income from its insurance subsidiaries. CNA’s
primary operating cash flow uses are payments for claims, policy benefits and operating expenses, including interest expense on corporate debt. Additionally, cash may be paid or received for income taxes.

For 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $1.4 billion for each of 2015 and 2014. In 2015, cash provided by
operating activities reflected lower premiums collected and decreased receipts relating to returns on limited partnerships, offset by lower net claim payments. In 2014, cash provided by operating activities reflected increased receipts relating to
returns on limited partnerships and lower net claim payments, substantially offset by increased tax payments. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 billion in 2013. In 2013, CNA contributed $75 million to the CNA Retirement Plan.

Cash flows from investing activities include the purchase and disposition of available-for-sale financial instruments and may
include the purchase and sale of businesses, land, buildings, equipment and other assets not generally held for resale.

Net cash used by investing activities was $372 million for 2015, as compared with $918 million and $898 million for 2014 and
2013. The cash flow from investing activities is affected by various factors such as the anticipated payment of claims, financing activity, asset/liability management and individual security buy and sell decisions made in the normal course of
portfolio management.

Cash flows from financing activities may include proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity
securities, outflows for shareholder dividends or repayment of debt and outlays to reacquire equity instruments. Net cash used by financing activities was $807 million, $519 million and $264 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013. Cash used by financing
activities reflected an increased special shareholder dividend in 2015 as compared to 2014. Additionally, in 2014, CNA issued $550 million of senior notes.

Liquidity

CNA
believes that its present cash flows from operations, investing activities and financing activities are sufficient to fund its current and expected working capital and debt obligation needs and CNA does not expect this to change in the near term.
There are currently no amounts outstanding under CNA’s $250 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility and no borrowings outstanding through CNA’s membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago (“FHLBC”).



CNA has an effective Registration Statement on Form S-3 registering the future
sale of an unlimited amount of its debt and equity securities.

Dividends

Dividends of $3.00 per share of CNA’s common stock, including a special dividend of $2.00 per share, were declared and
paid in 2015. On February 5, 2016, CNA’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share and a special dividend of $2.00 per share, payable March 9, 2016 to shareholders of record on February 22, 2016. The declaration and
payment of future dividends is at the discretion of CNA’s Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including CNA’s earnings, financial condition, business needs, and regulatory constraints.

Ratings

Ratings
are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. CNA’s insurance company subsidiaries are rated by major rating agencies and these ratings reflect the rating agency’s opinion of the insurance
company’s financial strength, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security and may be revised or withdrawn at any time
by the issuing organization. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating. One or more of these agencies could take action in the future to change the ratings of CNA’s insurance subsidiaries.

The table below reflects the various group ratings issued by A.M. Best Company (“A.M. Best”), Moody’s
Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”). The table also includes the ratings for CNA senior debt.

Diamond Offshore

Cash and investments totaled $130 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $250 million at December 31, 2014. In 2015,
Diamond Offshore paid regular cash dividends totaling $69 million. On February 8, 2016, Diamond Offshore announced that its Board of Directors was discontinuing its quarterly regular cash dividend.

Cash provided by operating activities was $736 million in 2015, compared to $993 million in 2014, a decrease of $257 million,
primarily due to a decrease in cash receipts from contract drilling services of $445 million, partially offset by a $144 million net decrease in cash payments for contract drilling and general and administrative expenses, including
personnel-related, maintenance, mobilization and other rig operating costs and lower income taxes paid, net of refunds of $44 million. The decline in cash receipts from and cash payments related to contract drilling services both reflect an
aggregate decline in Diamond Offshore’s contract drilling operations as well as its efforts to control costs. The $73 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to higher cash payments
related to contract drilling expenses of $77 million and higher interest payments of $51 million on senior notes.



Diamond Offshore is currently obligated under a construction agreement for the
ultra-deepwater semisubmersible, the

Ocean GreatWhite

. Construction continues with delivery expected in mid-2016. The estimated total project cost, including shipyard costs, capital spares, commissioning, project management and shipyard
supervision, but excluding capitalized interest, is $764 million, of which $242 million has been incurred as of December 31, 2015.

For 2016, Diamond Offshore has budgeted approximately $675 million for capital expenditures of which approximately $525
million is expected to be spent on completion of the construction of the

Ocean GreatWhite

. Diamond Offshore’s 2016 capital spending program also includes an estimated $150 million for ongoing capital maintenance and replacement programs.

Depending on market and other conditions, Diamond Offshore may purchase shares of its outstanding common stock in the
open market or otherwise. Diamond Offshore did not purchase any shares of its outstanding common stock in 2015. During 2014, Diamond Offshore purchased 1.9 million shares of its outstanding common stock at an aggregate cost of $88 million.

Diamond Offshore’s credit agreement provides for a $1.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, to be used
for general corporate purposes, and maturing in 2020. As of December 31, 2015, Diamond Offshore had no loans or letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement and is in compliance with all covenant requirements.

As of December 31, 2015, Diamond Offshore had $287 million in commercial paper notes outstanding with a weighted average
interest rate of 0.86% and a weighted average remaining term of 5.8 days that was repaid in January of 2016. As of February 16, 2016, Diamond Offshore had no commercial paper notes outstanding.

During February of 2016, Diamond Offshore borrowed $305 million in Eurodollar loans under the credit agreement, which bear
interest at 1.6% and will mature on February 29, 2016. As of February 16, 2016, Diamond Offshore had an additional $1.2 billion available under the credit agreement.

As of December 31, 2015, Diamond Offshore had an aggregate $2.0 billion in long-term, unsecured senior notes outstanding, of
which $500 million will mature in 2019 and the remainder will mature at various times beginning in 2023.

In January of
2016, Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) announced that it would be reviewing Diamond Offshore’s long-term corporate credit and unsecured debt rating and short-term credit rating for commercial paper, which are
currently Baa2 and Prime-2, for possible downgrade. Diamond Offshore’s current corporate credit rating is BBB+ and its short-term credit rating is A2 for Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”). Market conditions and other factors,
many of which are outside of Diamond Offshore’s control, could cause its credit ratings to be lowered. A downgrade in Diamond Offshore’s credit ratings could adversely impact its cost of issuing additional debt and the amount of additional
debt that it could issue and could restrict Diamond Offshore’s access to its commercial paper program and capital markets and its ability to raise additional debt or rollover existing maturities. As a consequence, Diamond Offshore may not be
able to issue additional debt in amounts and/or with terms that it considers to be reasonable. One or more of these occurrences could limit Diamond Offshore’s ability to pursue other business opportunities.

Certain of Diamond Offshore’s international rigs are owned and operated, directly or indirectly, by Diamond Foreign Asset
Company (“DFAC”), and as a result of Diamond Offshore’s intention to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of DFAC and its foreign subsidiaries to finance Diamond Offshore’s foreign activities, Diamond Offshore does not expect such
earnings to be available for distribution to its stockholders or to finance its domestic activities. To the extent available, Diamond Offshore expects to utilize the operating cash flows generated by and cash reserves of DFAC, and the operating cash
flows available to and cash reserves of Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. to meet each entity’s respective working capital requirements and capital commitments. Diamond Offshore, may, from time to time, issue debt or equity securities, or a
combination thereof, to finance capital expenditures, the acquisition of assets and businesses or for general corporate purposes. Diamond Offshore’s ability to access the capital markets by issuing debt or equity securities will be dependent on
its results of operations, current financial condition, current credit ratings, current market conditions and other factors beyond its control.



Boardwalk Pipeline

At December 31, 2015 and 2014, cash and investments amounted to $4 million and $8 million. Funds from operations for 2015
amounted to $576 million, compared to $514 million in 2014. In 2015 and 2014, Boardwalk Pipeline’s capital expenditures were $375 million and $404 million, consisting of a combination of growth and maintenance capital. In 2015 and 2014,
Boardwalk Pipeline paid cash distributions of $102 million and $99 million to its partners. Boardwalk Pipeline expects total capital expenditures to be approximately $850 million in 2016, primarily related to growth projects discussed further in
Item 1 and increased pipeline system maintenance expenditures. A summary of the estimated total costs of the growth projects and inception to date spending, as of December 31, 2015, are as follows:

In May 2015, Boardwalk Pipeline entered into an amended credit facility which increased the
borrowing capacity of the revolving credit facility to $1.5 billion and extended the maturity date to May 26, 2020. As of February 16, 2016, Boardwalk Pipeline had outstanding borrowings of $470 million resulting in over $1.0 billion of available
borrowing capacity and is in compliance with all covenant requirements under the credit facility.

Boardwalk Pipeline
anticipates that for 2016 its existing capital resources, including the revolving credit facility, a subordinated loan agreement with a subsidiary of the Company and cash flows from operating activities will be adequate to fund its operations,
including its planned capital expenditures. The subordinated loan agreement provides borrowings of up to $300 million with a draw period through December 31, 2016 and matures in July of 2024, subject to certain mandatory pre-payment requirements.
Boardwalk Pipeline may seek to access the capital markets to fund some or all capital expenditures for future growth projects or acquisitions, or to repay or refinance all or a portion of its indebtedness, a significant amount of which matures in
the next five years.

Most of Boardwalk Pipeline’s senior unsecured debt is rated by independent credit rating
agencies. Boardwalk Pipeline’s credit ratings affect its ability to access the public and private debt markets, as well as the terms and the cost of borrowings. The ability to satisfy financing requirements or fund planned growth capital
expenditures will depend upon Boardwalk Pipeline’s future operating performance and the ability to access the capital markets, which are affected by economic factors in its industry as well as other financial and business factors, some of which
are beyond Boardwalk Pipeline’s control. The table below reflects the various group ratings issued by S&P, Moody’s and Fitch Ratings, Inc. (“Fitch”) for Boardwalk Pipeline’s senior unsecured notes and that of its
operating subsidiaries having outstanding rated debt as of February 17, 2016.

Loews Hotels

Cash and investments totaled $93 million at December 31, 2015, as compared to $84 million at December 31, 2014.

In 2015 and January of 2016, Loews Hotels purchased three hotel properties and a joint venture equity interest in a hotel
property for approximately $445 million, funded with capital contributions from us and property level debt. In 2015, Loews Hotels received proceeds of $177 million from mortgage loan agreements in connection with one of the 2015 acquisitions and
refinancing of $83 million in existing debt. Funds for future capital expenditures, including acquisitions of new properties, renovations and working capital requirements are expected to be provided from operations, newly incurred debt, existing
cash balances and advances or capital contributions from us.

During 2016, Loews Hotels plans on making capital
improvements of approximately $75 million in connection with extensive renovations to several hotel properties, during which time the revenues and earnings of Loews Hotels are expected to be adversely affected.

Corporate and Other

Parent Company cash and investments, net of receivables and payables at December 31, 2015 totaled $4.3 billion, as compared to
$5.1 billion at December 31, 2014. In 2015, we received $816 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, including a special dividend from CNA of $485 million. Cash outflows included, among other corporate overhead costs, the payment of $1.3 billion
to fund treasury stock purchases, $29 million to purchase shares of Diamond Offshore, $90 million of cash dividends to our shareholders and net cash contributions of approximately $260 million to our subsidiaries, primarily Loews Hotels.

As of December 31, 2015, there were 339,897,547 shares of Loews common stock outstanding. Depending on market and other
conditions, we may purchase our shares and shares of our subsidiaries outstanding common stock in the open market or otherwise. In 2015, we purchased 33.3 million shares of Loews common stock and 1.1 million shares of Diamond Offshore.

In April of 2015, Fitch Ratings, Inc. downgraded our unsecured debt from A+ to A and the outlook remains stable. Our current
unsecured debt ratings are A2 for Moody’s and A+ for S&P with a stable outlook for both. In December of 2015, S&P affirmed our A+ corporate and issuer credit ratings in connection with S&P’s newly published criteria on
investment holding companies. We have an effective Registration Statement on Form S-3 registering the future sale of an unlimited amount of our debt and equity securities. From time to time, we consider issuance of Parent Company indebtedness under
this registration statement.

We continue to pursue conservative financial strategies while seeking opportunities for
responsible growth. These include the expansion of existing businesses, full or partial acquisitions and dispositions, and opportunities for efficiencies and economies of scale.

In February of 2016, Diamond Offshore entered into a ten-year agreement with GE Oil & Gas
(“GE”) to provide services with respect to certain blowout preventer and related well control equipment on its four newbuild drillships. Such services include management of maintenance, certification and reliability with respect to such
equipment. In connection with the services agreement with GE, Diamond Offshore will sell the equipment to a GE affiliate for an aggregate $210 million and will lease back such equipment over separate ten-year operating leases. Future commitments for
the full term under the services agreement and leases are estimated to aggregate approximately $650 million.

Further
information on our commitments, contingencies and guarantees is provided in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

INVESTMENTS

Investment
activities of non-insurance subsidiaries primarily include investments in fixed income securities, including short term investments. The Parent Company portfolio also includes equity securities, including short sales and derivative instruments, and
investments in limited partnerships. These types of investments generally present greater volatility, less liquidity and greater risk than fixed income investments and are included within Results of Operations – Corporate and Other.

We enter into short sales and invest in certain derivative instruments that are used for asset and liability management
activities, income enhancements to our portfolio management strategy and to benefit from anticipated future movements in the underlying markets. If such movements do not occur as anticipated, then significant losses may occur. Monitoring procedures
include senior management review of daily detailed reports of existing positions and valuation fluctuations to ensure that open positions are consistent with our portfolio strategy.



Credit exposure associated with non-performance by the counterparties to
derivative instruments is generally limited to the uncollateralized change in fair value of the derivative instruments recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We mitigate the risk of non-performance by monitoring the creditworthiness of
counterparties and diversifying derivatives to multiple counterparties. We occasionally require collateral from our derivative investment counterparties depending on the amount of the exposure and the credit rating of the counterparty.

Insurance

CNA maintains
a large portfolio of fixed maturity and equity securities, including large amounts of corporate and government issued debt securities, residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, and other asset-backed securities and investments in
limited partnerships which pursue a variety of long and short investment strategies across a broad array of asset classes. CNA’s investment portfolio supports its obligation to pay future insurance claims and provides investment returns which

Net investment income after tax and noncontrolling interests decreased $131 million in 2015 as
compared with 2014. The decrease was driven by limited partnership investments, which returned 3.0% in 2015 as compared with 9.7% in the prior year. Income from fixed maturity securities decreased by $30 million, after tax and noncontrolling
interests, driven by a $22 million, after tax and noncontrolling interests, change in estimate effected by a change in accounting principle to better reflect the yield on fixed maturity securities that have call provisions. Additionally, income from
fixed maturity securities decreased due to lower reinvestment rates, partially offset by favorable changes in estimates for prepayments for asset-backed securities. Additional information on the accounting change is included in Note 1 of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

Net investment income after tax and noncontrolling interests
decreased $95 million in 2014 as compared with 2013. The decrease was primarily driven by limited partnerships, which produced a rate of return of 9.7% as compared with 18.3% in the prior year. This was partially offset by an increase in fixed
maturity securities investment income, after tax and noncontrolling interests, due to additional investments in tax-exempt securities.

Net realized investment results decreased $66 million in 2015 as compared with 2014, driven by
higher OTTI losses recognized in earnings and lower net realized investment gains on sales of securities. Net realized investment gains increased $22 million in 2014 as compared with 2013, driven by higher net realized investment gains on sales of
securities. Further information on CNA’s realized gains and losses, including CNA’s OTTI losses and derivative gains (losses), as well as CNA’s impairment decision process, is set forth in Notes 1 and 3 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included under Item 8.

Duration

A primary objective in the management of the investment portfolio is to optimize return relative to corresponding liabilities
and respective liquidity needs. CNA’s views on the current interest rate environment, tax regulations, asset class valuations, specific security issuer and broader industry segment conditions and the domestic and global economic conditions, are
some of the factors that enter into an investment decision. CNA also continually monitors exposure to issuers of securities held and broader industry sector exposures and may from time to time adjust such exposures based on its views of a specific
issuer or industry sector.

A further consideration in the management of the investment portfolio is the characteristics
of the corresponding liabilities and the ability to align the duration of the portfolio to those liabilities and to meet future liquidity needs, minimize interest rate risk and maintain a level of income sufficient to support the underlying
insurance liabilities. For portfolios where future liability cash flows are determinable and typically long term in nature, CNA segregates investments for asset/liability management purposes. The segregated investments support the long term care and
structured settlement liabilities in the Life & Group Non-Core business.

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE

For a discussion of accounting standards updates that have been adopted or will be adopted in the future, please read Note 1
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this Report as well as some statements in periodic press releases
and some oral statements made by our officials and our subsidiaries during presentations about us, are “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”).
Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, any statement that may project, indicate or imply future results, events, performance or achievements, and may contain the words “expect,” “intend,” “plan,”
“anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. In addition, any statement concerning future financial performance (including
future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects, and possible actions taken by us or our subsidiaries, which may be provided by management are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act.

Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are inherently subject to
a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected. These risks and uncertainties include, among others:



Risks and uncertainties primarily affecting us and our insurance subsidiaries

●

the risks and uncertainties associated with CNA’s insurance reserves, as outlined under “Results of Operations by Business Segment –
CNA Financial – Reserves – Estimates and Uncertainties” in this MD&A, including the sufficiency of the reserves and the possibility for future increases, which would be reflected in the results of operations in the period that the
need for such adjustment is determined;

●

the risk that the other parties to the transaction in which, subject to certain limitations, CNA ceded its legacy A&EP liabilities will not
fully perform their obligations to CNA, the uncertainty in estimating loss reserves for A&EP liabilities and the possible continued exposure of CNA to liabilities for A&EP claims that are not covered under the terms of the transaction;

●

the performance of reinsurance companies under reinsurance contracts with CNA;

●

the impact of competitive products, policies and pricing and the competitive environment in which CNA operates, including changes in CNA’s

Developments in any of these or other areas of risk and uncertainty, which are more fully described elsewhere in this Report
and our other filings with the SEC, could cause our results to differ materially from results that have been or may be anticipated or projected. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking
statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Report and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update these statements to reflect any change in our expectations or beliefs or any change in events,
conditions or circumstances on which any forward-looking statement is based.



Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

We are a large diversified holding company. As such, we and our subsidiaries have significant amounts of financial instruments
that involve market risk. Our measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair value of our financial instruments. Changes in the trading portfolio are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Market risk
exposure is presented for each class of financial instrument held by us at December 31, assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described below. We believe that the various rates of adverse market movements represent a measure
of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions. The estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected actual loss, even under
adverse conditions, because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ. In addition, since our investment portfolio is subject to change based on our portfolio management strategy as well as in response to changes in the market, these estimates
are not necessarily indicative of the actual results which may occur.

Exposure to market risk is managed and monitored by
senior management. Senior management approves our overall investment strategy and has responsibility to ensure that the investment positions are consistent with that strategy with an acceptable level of risk. We may manage risk by buying or selling
instruments or entering into offsetting positions.

Interest Rate Risk – We have exposure to interest rate risk
arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk by utilizing instruments such as interest rate swaps, commitments to purchase securities, options, futures and forwards. We
monitor our sensitivity to interest rate changes by revaluing financial assets and liabilities using a variety of different interest rates. The Company uses duration and convexity at the security level to estimate the change in fair value that would
result from a change in each security’s yield. Duration measures the price sensitivity of an asset to changes in the yield rate. Convexity measures how the duration of the asset changes with interest rates. The duration and convexity analysis
takes into account the unique characteristics (e.g., call and put options and prepayment expectations) of each security, in determining the hypothetical change in fair value. The analysis is performed at the security level and is aggregated up to
the asset category level.

The evaluation is performed by applying an instantaneous change in the yield rates by varying
magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in rates would have on the recorded market value of our investments and the resulting effect on shareholders’ equity. The analysis presents the sensitivity of the market
value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices which we believe are reasonably possible over a one year period.

The sensitivity analysis estimates the change in the fair value of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities that were
held on December 31, 2015 and 2014 due to an instantaneous change in the yield of the security at the end of the period of 100 basis points, with all other variables held constant.

The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates,
while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Accordingly, the analysis may not be indicative of, is not intended to provide, and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes of market interest rates on
our earnings or shareholders’ equity. Further, the computations do not contemplate any actions we could undertake in response to changes in interest rates.

Our debt is primarily denominated in U.S. Dollars and has been primarily issued at fixed rates, therefore, interest expense
would not be impacted by interest rate shifts. The impact of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on fixed rate debt would result in a decrease in market value of $481 million and $606 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014. The impact of a
100 basis point decrease would result in an increase in market value of $519 million and $671 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014. At December 31, 2015, the impact of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on variable rate debt would
increase interest expense by approximately $4 million on an annual basis.



Equity Price Risk – We have exposure to equity price risk as a result of our
investment in equity securities and equity derivatives. Equity price risk results from changes in the level or volatility of equity prices which affect the value of equity securities or instruments that derive their value from such securities or
indexes. Equity price risk was measured assuming an instantaneous 25% decrease in the underlying reference price or index from its level at December 31, 2015 and 2014, with all other variables held constant. A model was developed to analyze the
observed changes in the value of limited partnerships held by the Company over a multiple year period along with the corresponding changes in various equity indices. The result of the model allowed us to estimate the change in value of limited
partnerships when equity markets decline by 25%.

Foreign Exchange Rate Risk – Foreign exchange rate risk arises from
the possibility that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will impact the value of financial instruments. We have foreign exchange rate exposure when we buy or sell foreign currencies or financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency,
which is reduced through the use of forward contracts. Our foreign transactions are primarily denominated in Japanese yen, Saudi Arabian riyals, Chinese yuan and European Monetary Unit. The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 20% decrease
in the foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar from their levels at December 31, 2015 and 2014, with all other variables held constant.

Commodity Price Risk – We have exposure to price risk as a result of our investments in commodities. Commodity price risk
results from changes in the level or volatility of commodity prices that impact instruments which derive their value from such commodities. Commodity price risk was measured assuming an instantaneous increase of 20% from their levels at December 31,
2015 and 2014.

Credit Risk – We are exposed to credit risk relating to the risk of loss resulting from the
nonperformance by a customer of its contractual obligations. Although nearly all of the Company’s customers pay for its services on a timely basis, the Company actively monitors the credit exposure to its customers. Certain of the
Company’s subsidiaries may perform credit reviews of customers and may require customers to provide cash collateral, post a letter of credit, prepay for services or provide other credit enhancements.

rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices) on the basis of those entered into for trading purposes and other than trading purposes.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for us. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial
statements.

There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any control system, however well designed, including
the possibility of human error and the possible circumvention or overriding of controls. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to
their costs. Management must make judgments with respect to the relative cost and expected benefits of any specific control measure. The design of a control system also is based in part upon assumptions and judgments made by management about the
likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that a control will be effective under all potential future conditions. As a result, even an effective system of internal control over financial reporting can provide no more than reasonable
assurance with respect to the fair presentation of financial statements and the processes under which they were prepared.

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. In making
this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)

. Based on this assessment, our management believes that, as
of December 31, 2015, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.

Our independent registered public
accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued an audit report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The report of Deloitte & Touche LLP follows this Report.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Loews Corporation

New York, NY

We have
audited the internal control over financial reporting of Loews Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the
company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 of the Company and our report dated February 19, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedules.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Loews Corporation

New York, NY

We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Loews Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Loews Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated

Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 19, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Loews Corporation and Subsidiaries

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of presentation

– Loews Corporation is a holding company. Its subsidiaries are engaged in
the following lines of business: commercial property and casualty insurance (CNA Financial Corporation (“CNA”), a 90% owned subsidiary); the operation of offshore oil and gas drilling rigs (Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.
(“Diamond Offshore”), a 53% owned subsidiary); transportation and storage of natural gas and natural gas liquids and gathering and processing of natural gas (Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP (“Boardwalk Pipeline”), a 51% owned
subsidiary); and the operation of a chain of hotels (Loews Hotels Holding Corporation (“Loews Hotels”), a wholly owned subsidiary). Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “Company,” “Loews” and
“Registrant” as used herein mean Loews Corporation excluding its subsidiaries and the term “Net income (loss) attributable to Loews Corporation” as used herein means Net income (loss) attributable to Loews Corporation
shareholders.

Loews segments are CNA Financial, including Specialty, Commercial, International and Other Non-Core;
Diamond Offshore; Boardwalk Pipeline; Loews Hotels; and Corporate and other. See Note 20 for additional information on segments.

Principles of consolidation

– The Consolidated Financial Statements include all subsidiaries and intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The equity method of accounting is used for investments in associated companies in which the Company generally has an interest of 20% to 50%.

Accounting estimates

– The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Investments

– The Company classifies its fixed maturity securities and equity securities as either
available-for-sale or trading, and as such, they are carried at fair value. Short term investments are carried at fair value. Changes in fair value of trading securities are reported within Net investment income on the Consolidated Statements of
Income. Changes in fair value related to available-for-sale securities are reported as a component of Other comprehensive income. Losses may be recognized within the Consolidated Statements of Income when a decline in value is determined by the
Company to be other-than-temporary.

The cost of fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale is adjusted
for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, which are included in Net investment income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The amortization of premium and accretion of discount for fixed maturity securities takes into
consideration call and maturity dates that produce the lowest yield. This represents a change from prior reporting periods as previously the amortization of premiums was to maturity. This change in estimate, effected by a change in accounting
principle, will result in a better reflection of the yield on fixed maturity securities with call provisions. This change, which was adopted in the fourth quarter of 2015, decreased Net investment income and the amortized cost of fixed maturity
securities by $39 million in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015. This adjustment decreased basic and diluted net income per share by $0.06 for the
year ended December 31, 2015.

To the extent that unrealized gains on fixed income securities supporting long term care
products and structured settlements not funded by annuities would result in a premium deficiency if those gains were realized, a related decrease in Deferred acquisition costs and/or increase in Insurance reserves are recorded, net of tax and
noncontrolling interests, as a reduction of net unrealized gains through Other comprehensive income (“Shadow Adjustments”). Shadow Adjustments decreased $159 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) and increased $679 million
(after tax and noncontrolling interests) for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, net unrealized gains on investments included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) were correspondingly
reduced by $996 million and $1.2 billion (after tax and noncontrolling interests).



For asset-backed securities included in fixed maturity securities, the Company
recognizes income using an effective yield based on anticipated prepayments and the estimated economic life of the securities. When estimates of prepayments change, the effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments to date and
anticipated future payments. The amortized cost of high credit quality fixed rate securities is adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been applied since the acquisition of the securities. Such adjustments are
reflected in Net investment income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Interest income on lower rated and variable rate securities is determined using the prospective yield method.

The Company’s carrying value of investments in limited partnerships is its share of the net asset value of each
partnership, as determined by the General Partner. Certain partnerships for which results are not available on a timely basis are reported on a lag, primarily three months or less. These investments are accounted for under the equity method and
changes in net asset values are recorded within Net investment income on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Investments in derivative securities are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported as a component of
Investment gains (losses), Income (loss) from trading portfolio, or Other comprehensive income (loss), depending on their hedge designation. A derivative is typically defined as an instrument whose value is “derived” from an underlying
instrument, index or rate, has a notional amount, requires little or no initial investment and can be net settled. Derivatives include, but are not limited to, the following types of investments: interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and
floors, put and call options, warrants, futures, forwards, commitments to purchase securities, credit default swaps and combinations of the foregoing. Derivatives embedded within non-derivative instruments (such as call options embedded in
convertible bonds) must be split from the host instrument when the embedded derivative is not clearly and closely related to the host instrument.

A security is impaired if the fair value of the security is less than its cost adjusted for accretion, amortization and
previously recorded other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) losses, otherwise defined as an unrealized loss. When a security is impaired, the impairment is evaluated to determine whether it is temporary or other-than-temporary.

Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether an OTTI loss has occurred for a security. CNA follows a
consistent and systematic process for determining and recording an OTTI loss. CNA has established a committee responsible for the OTTI process referred to as the Impairment Committee. The Impairment Committee is responsible for evaluating all
securities in an unrealized loss position on at least a quarterly basis.

The Impairment Committee’s assessment of
whether an OTTI loss has occurred incorporates both quantitative and qualitative information. Fixed maturity securities that CNA intends to sell, or it more likely than not will be required to sell before recovery of amortized cost, are considered
to be other-than-temporarily impaired and the entire difference between the amortized cost basis and fair value of the security is recognized as an OTTI loss in earnings. The remaining fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position are
evaluated to determine if a credit loss exists. The factors considered by the Impairment Committee include: (i) the financial condition and near term and long term prospects of the issuer, (ii) whether the debtor is current on interest and
principal payments, (iii) credit ratings of the securities and (iv) general market conditions and industry or sector specific outlook. CNA also considers results and analysis of cash flow modeling for asset-backed securities, and when appropriate,
other fixed maturity securities.

The focus of the analysis for asset-backed securities is on assessing the sufficiency
and quality of underlying collateral and timing of cash flows based on scenario tests. If the present value of the modeled expected cash flows equals or exceeds the amortized cost of a security, no credit loss is judged to exist and the asset-backed
security is deemed to be temporarily impaired. If the present value of the expected cash flows is less than amortized cost, the security is judged to be other-than-temporarily impaired for credit reasons and that shortfall, referred to as the credit
component, is recognized as an OTTI loss in earnings. The difference between the adjusted amortized cost basis and fair value, referred to as the non-credit component, is recognized as OTTI in Other comprehensive income. In subsequent reporting
periods, a change in intent to sell or further credit impairment on a security whose fair value has not deteriorated will cause the non-credit component originally recorded as OTTI in Other comprehensive income to be recognized as an OTTI loss in
earnings.



CNA performs the discounted cash flow analysis using stressed scenarios to
determine future expectations regarding recoverability. Significant assumptions enter into these cash flow projections including delinquency rates, probable risk of default, loss severity upon a default, over collateralization and interest coverage
triggers and credit support from lower level tranches.

CNA applies the same impairment model as described above for the
majority of non-redeemable preferred stock securities on the basis that these securities possess characteristics similar to debt securities and that the issuers maintain their ability to pay dividends. For all other equity securities, in determining
whether the security is other-than-temporarily impaired, the Impairment Committee considers a number of factors including, but not limited to: (i) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost, (ii)
the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, (iii) the intent and ability of CNA to retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value and (iv) general market conditions and industry
or sector specific outlook.

Joint venture investments

– The Company has 20% to 50% interests in operating
joint ventures related to hotel properties and had joint venture interests in the former Bluegrass Project, as discussed in Note 2, that are accounted for under the equity method. The Company’s investment in these entities was $234 million and
$158 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and reported in Other assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Equity income (loss) for these investments was $43 million, $(62) million and $12 million for the years ended
December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 and reported in Other operating expenses on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income. Some of these investments are variable interest entities (“VIE”) as defined in the accounting guidance
because the entities will require additional funding from each equity owner throughout the development and construction phase and are accounted for under the equity method since the Company is not the primary beneficiary. The maximum exposure to
loss for the VIE investments is $348 million, consisting of the amount of the investment and debt guarantees.

Hedging

– The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging
instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Company also formally assesses (both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis) whether the derivatives
that are used in hedging transactions have been highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. When it is determined that
a derivative for which hedge accounting has been designated is not (or ceases to be) highly effective, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. See Note 3 for additional information on the Company’s use of derivatives.

Securities lending activities

– The Company lends securities for the purpose of enhancing income or to finance
positions to unrelated parties who have been designated as primary dealers by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Borrowers of these securities must deposit and maintain collateral with the Company of no less than 100% of the fair value of the
securities loaned. U.S. Government securities and cash are accepted as collateral. The Company maintains effective control over loaned securities and, therefore, continues to report such securities as investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.



Securities lending is typically done on a matched-book basis where the collateral
is invested to substantially match the term of the loan. This matching of terms tends to limit risk. In accordance with the Company’s lending agreements, securities on loan are returned immediately to the Company upon notice. Collateral is not
reflected as an asset of the Company. There was no collateral held at December 31, 2015 and 2014.

– Premiums on property and casualty insurance contracts are recognized in proportion to the underlying risk insured which are principally earned ratably over the duration of the policies. Premiums on long term care contracts are
earned ratably over the policy year in which they are due. The reserve for unearned premiums represents the portion of premiums written relating to the unexpired terms of coverage.

Insurance receivables include balances due currently or in the future, including amounts due from insureds related to losses
under high deductible policies, and are presented at unpaid balances, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Amounts are considered past due based on policy payment terms. That allowance is determined based on periodic evaluations of aged
receivables, management’s experience and current economic conditions. Insurance receivables and any related allowance are written off after collection efforts are exhausted or a negotiated settlement is reached.

Property and casualty contracts that are retrospectively rated contain provisions that result in an adjustment to the initial
policy premium depending on the contract provisions and loss experience of the insured during the experience period. For such contracts, CNA estimates the amount of ultimate premiums that it may earn upon completion of the experience period and
recognizes either an asset or a liability for the difference between the initial policy premium and the estimated ultimate premium. CNA adjusts such estimated ultimate premium amounts during the course of the experience period based on actual
results to date. The resulting adjustment is recorded as either a reduction of or an increase to the earned premiums for the period.

Contract drilling revenue from dayrate drilling contracts is recognized as services are performed. In connection with such
drilling contracts, Diamond Offshore may receive fees (either lump-sum or dayrate) for the mobilization of equipment. These fees are earned as services are performed over the initial term of the related drilling contracts. Absent a contract,
mobilization costs are recognized currently. From time to time, Diamond Offshore may receive fees from its customers for capital improvements to their rigs. Diamond Offshore defers such fees received and recognizes these fees into revenue on a
straight-line basis over the period of the related drilling contract. Diamond Offshore capitalizes the costs of such capital improvements and depreciates them over the estimated useful life of the improvement.

Revenues from transportation and storage services are recognized in the period the service is provided based on contractual
terms and the related transported and stored volumes. The majority of Boardwalk Pipeline’s operating subsidiaries are subject to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) regulations and, accordingly, certain revenues collected
may be subject to possible refunds to its customers. An estimated refund liability is recorded considering regulatory proceedings, advice of counsel and estimated total exposure.

Claim and claim adjustment expense reserves

– Claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, except reserves for
structured settlements not associated with asbestos and environmental pollution (“A&EP”), workers’ compensation lifetime claims and accident and health claims are not discounted and are based on (i) case basis estimates for losses
reported on direct business, adjusted in the aggregate for ultimate loss expectations; (ii) estimates of incurred but not reported losses; (iii) estimates of losses on assumed reinsurance; (iv) estimates of future expenses to be incurred in the
settlement of claims; (v) estimates of salvage and subrogation recoveries and (vi) estimates of amounts due from insureds related to losses under high deductible policies. Management considers current conditions and trends as well as past CNA and
industry experience in establishing these estimates. The effects of inflation, which can be significant, are implicitly considered in the reserving process and are part of the recorded reserve balance. Ceded claim and claim adjustment expense
reserves are reported as a component of Receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Claim and claim adjustment
expense reserves are presented net of anticipated amounts due from insureds related to losses under deductible policies of $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. A significant portion of these amounts are supported by
collateral. CNA also has an allowance for uncollectible deductible



amounts, which is presented as a component of the allowance for doubtful accounts included in Receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Structured settlements have been negotiated for certain property and casualty insurance claims. Structured settlements are
agreements to provide fixed periodic payments to claimants. CNA’s obligations for structured settlements not funded by annuities are included in claim and claim adjustment expense reserves and carried at present values determined using interest
rates ranging from 5.5% to 8.0% at December 31, 2015 and 2014. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the discounted reserves for unfunded structured settlements were $560 million and $582 million, net of discount of $880 million and $924 million.

Workers’ compensation lifetime claim reserves are calculated using mortality assumptions determined through statutory
regulation and economic factors. Accident and health claim reserves are calculated using mortality and morbidity assumptions based on CNA and industry experience. Workers’ compensation lifetime claim reserves and accident and health claim
reserves are discounted at interest rates ranging from 3.5% to 6.8% at December 31, 2015 and 2014. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, such discounted reserves totaled $2.6 billion and $2.5 billion, net of discount of $653 million and $654 million.

Future policy benefits reserves

– Future policy benefit reserves represent the active life reserves related to
CNA’s long term care policies and are computed using the net level premium method, which incorporates actuarial assumptions as to morbidity, persistency, discount rate and expenses. Expense assumptions primarily relate to claim adjudication.
Actuarial assumptions generally vary by plan, age at issue and policy duration. The initial assumptions are determined at issuance, include a margin for adverse deviation and are locked in throughout the life of the contract unless a premium
deficiency develops. If a premium deficiency emerges, the assumptions are unlocked and deferred acquisition costs, if any, and the future policy benefit reserves are adjusted. The December 31, 2015 gross premium valuation indicated a premium
deficiency of $296 million. The indicated premium deficiency necessitated a charge to income that was effected by the write off of the entire long term care deferred acquisition cost asset of $289 million and an increase to active life reserves of
$7 million. As a result, the long term care active life reserves carried as of December 31, 2015 represent management’s best estimate assumptions at that date with no margin for adverse deviation. Interest rates for long term care products
range from 6.6% to 7.0% at December 31, 2015 and 4.5% to 7.9% as of December 31, 2014.

Guaranty fund and other
insurance-related assessments

– Liabilities for guaranty fund and other insurance-related assessments are accrued when an assessment is probable, when it can be reasonably estimated and when the event obligating the entity to pay an imposed
or probable assessment has occurred. Liabilities for guaranty funds and other insurance-related assessments are not discounted and are included as part of Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the
liability balances were $129 million and $131 million.

Reinsurance

– Reinsurance accounting allows for
contractual cash flows to be reflected as premiums and losses. To qualify for reinsurance accounting, reinsurance agreements must include risk transfer. To meet risk transfer requirements, a reinsurance contract must include both insurance risk,
consisting of underwriting and timing risk, and a reasonable possibility of a significant loss for the assuming entity.

Reinsurance receivables related to paid losses are presented at unpaid balances. Reinsurance receivables related to unpaid
losses are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves. Reinsurance receivables are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The
cost of reinsurance is primarily accounted for over the life of the underlying reinsured policies using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the underlying policies or over the reinsurance contract period. The ceding of insurance
does not discharge the primary liability of CNA.

CNA has established an allowance for doubtful accounts on reinsurance
receivables which relates to both amounts already billed on ceded paid losses as well as ceded reserves that will be billed when losses are paid in the future. The allowance for doubtful accounts on reinsurance receivables is estimated on the basis
of periodic evaluations of balances due from reinsurers, reinsurer solvency, management’s experience and current economic conditions. Reinsurer financial strength ratings are updated and reviewed on an annual basis or sooner if CNA becomes
aware of significant changes related to a reinsurer. Because billed receivables generally approximate 4% or less of total



reinsurance receivables, the age of the reinsurance receivables related to paid losses is not a significant input into the allowance analysis. Changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts on
reinsurance receivables are presented as a component of Insurance claims and policyholders’ benefits on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Amounts are considered past due based on the reinsurance contract terms. Reinsurance receivables related to paid losses and
any related allowance are written off after collection efforts have been exhausted or a negotiated settlement is reached with the reinsurer. Reinsurance receivables related to paid losses from insolvent insurers are written off when the settlement
due from the estate can be reasonably estimated. At the time reinsurance receivables related to paid losses are written off, any required adjustment to reinsurance receivables related to unpaid losses is recorded as a component of Insurance claims
and policyholders’ benefits on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Reinsurance contracts that do not effectively
transfer the economic risk of loss on the underlying policies are recorded using the deposit method of accounting, which requires that premium paid or received by the ceding company or assuming company be accounted for as a deposit asset or
liability. CNA had $3 million recorded as deposit assets at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and $8 million and $9 million recorded as deposit liabilities as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. Income on reinsurance contracts accounted for under the deposit
method is recognized using an effective yield based on the anticipated timing of payments and the remaining life of the contract. When the anticipated timing of payments changes, the effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments to date
and the estimated timing of future payments. The deposit asset or liability is adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been applied since the inception of the contract.

A loss portfolio transfer is a retroactive reinsurance contract. If the cumulative claim and allocated claim adjustment
expenses ceded under a loss portfolio transfer exceed the consideration paid, the resulting gain from such excess is deferred and amortized into earnings in future periods in proportion to actual recoveries under the loss portfolio transfer. In the
period in which an excess arises, a portion of the deferred gain is cumulatively recognized in earnings as if the revised estimate was available at the inception date of the loss portfolio transfer.

Deferred acquisition costs

– Deferrable acquisition costs include commissions, premium taxes and certain
underwriting and policy issuance costs which are incremental direct costs of successful contract acquisitions. Deferred acquisition costs related to long term care contracts issued prior to January 1, 2004 include costs which vary with and are
primarily related to the acquisition of business.

Acquisition costs related to property and casualty business are
deferred and amortized ratably over the period the related premiums are earned.

As noted under Future policy benefit
reserves, all of the long term care deferred acquisition costs of $289 million were written off as of December 31, 2015 in recognition of a premium deficiency. Deferred acquisition costs related to long term care contracts are amortized over the
premium-paying period of the related policies using assumptions consistent with those used for computing future policy benefit reserves for such contracts. Assumptions are made at the date of policy issuance or acquisition and are consistently
applied during the lives of the contracts. Deviations from estimated experience are included in results of operations when they occur. For these contracts, the amortization period is typically the estimated life of the policy.

CNA evaluates deferred acquisition costs for recoverability. Anticipated investment income is considered in the determination
of the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs. Adjustments, if necessary, are recorded in current period results of operations.

Deferred acquisition costs are presented net of ceding commissions and other ceded acquisition costs. Unamortized deferred
acquisition costs relating to contracts that have been substantially changed by a modification in benefits, features, rights or coverages that were not anticipated in the original contract are not deferred and are included as a charge to operations
in the period during which the contract modification occurred.



Investments in life settlement contracts and related revenue recognition

– Prior to 2002, CNA purchased investments in life settlement contracts. CNA obtained the ownership and beneficiary rights of an underlying life insurance policy through a life settlement contract with the owner of the life insurance contract.

CNA accounts for its investments in life settlement contracts using the fair value method. Under the fair value method,
each life settlement contract is carried at its fair value at the end of each reporting period. The change in fair value, life insurance proceeds received and periodic maintenance costs, such as premiums, necessary to keep the underlying policy in
force, are recorded in Other revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

The fair value of CNA’s investments
in life settlement contracts were $74 million and $82 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The cash receipts and payments related to life settlement contracts are included in
Cash flows from operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

The following table details the values
for life settlement contracts. The determination of fair value is discussed in Note 4.

CNA uses an actuarial model to estimate the aggregate face amount of life insurance that is
expected to mature in each future year and the corresponding fair value. This model projects the likelihood of the insured’s death for each inforce policy based upon CNA’s estimated mortality rates, which may vary due to the relatively
small size of the portfolio of life settlement contracts. The number of life settlement contracts presented in the table above is based upon the average face amount of inforce policies estimated to mature in each future year.

The increase (decrease) in fair value recognized for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 on contracts still held
was $1 million, $8 million and $(2) million. The gains recognized during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 on contracts that settled were $24 million, $25 million and $15 million.

Goodwill

– Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets of acquired entities.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or when certain triggering events require additional tests. Subsequent reversal of a goodwill impairment charge is not permitted. See Note 7 for additional information on goodwill.

Property, plant and equipment

– Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation,
depletion and amortization (“DD&A”). Depreciation is computed principally by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the various classes of properties. Leaseholds and leasehold improvements are depreciated or
amortized over the terms of the related leases (including optional renewal periods where appropriate) or the estimated lives of improvements, if less than the lease term.



The principal service lives used in computing provisions for depreciation are as
follows:

Years

Pipeline equipment

30 to 50

Offshore drilling equipment

15 to 30

Other

3 to 40

Impairment of long-lived assets

– The Company reviews its long-lived assets for
impairment when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets and intangibles with finite lives, under certain circumstances, are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair
value. Assets to be disposed of and assets not expected to provide any future service potential to the Company are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.

Income taxes

– The Company and its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated tax return. Deferred income taxes are
recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return bases of assets and liabilities, based on enacted tax rates and other provisions of the tax law. The effect of a change in tax laws or rates on deferred tax assets
and liabilities is recognized in income in the period in which such change is enacted. Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not, and a valuation allowance is established for any
portion of a deferred tax asset that management believes may not be realized.

The Company recognizes uncertain tax
positions that it has taken or expects to take on a tax return. The tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having
full knowledge of all relevant information. See Note 10 for additional information on the provision for income taxes.

Pension and postretirement benefits

– The Company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of its defined
benefit plans in Other assets or Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in funded status related to prior service costs and credits and actuarial gains and losses are recognized in the year in which the changes occur through
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The Company measures its benefit plan assets and obligations at December 31. Annual service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of prior service costs and credits and
amortization of actuarial gains and losses are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Stock based
compensation

– The Company records compensation expense upon issuance of share-based payment awards for all awards it grants, modifies or cancels primarily on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, generally three to four
years. The share-based payment awards are valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive in the valuation of these awards. These assumptions
include the term that the awards are expected to be outstanding, an estimate of the volatility of the underlying stock price, applicable risk-free interest rates and the dividend yield of the Company’s stock.

The Company recognized compensation expense that decreased net income by $14 million, $12 million and $11 million for the
years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Several of the Company’s subsidiaries also maintain their own stock option plans. The amounts reported above include the Company’s share of expense related to its subsidiaries’ plans.

Net income per share

– Companies with complex capital structures are required to present basic and diluted net
income per share. Basic net income per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stock by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net income per share reflects the
potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock.



For each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, approximately 0.3
million, 0.6 million and 0.9 million potential shares attributable to exercises under the Loews Corporation Stock Option Plan were included in the calculation of diluted net income per share. For those same periods, approximately 4.8 million, 2.3
million and 1.5 million Stock Appreciation Rights (“SARs”) were not included in the calculation of diluted net income per share due to the exercise price being greater than the average stock price.

Foreign currency

– Foreign currency translation gains and losses are reflected in Shareholders’ equity as a
component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The Company’s foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheet accounts are translated at the exchange rates in effect at each reporting date and income statement accounts are translated at
the average exchange rates. Foreign currency transaction losses of $8 million, $22 million and $3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were included in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Regulatory accounting

– The majority of Boardwalk Pipeline’s operating subsidiaries are regulated by FERC.
GAAP for regulated entities requires Texas Gas Transmission, LLC (“Texas Gas”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Boardwalk Pipeline, to report certain assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the manner in which
independent third party regulators establish rates. Accordingly, certain costs and benefits are capitalized as regulatory assets and liabilities in order to provide for recovery from or refund to customers in future periods. Regulatory accounting is
not applicable to Boardwalk Pipeline’s other FERC regulated entities.

Supplementary cash flow information

– Cash payments made for interest on long term debt, net of capitalized interest, amounted to $513 million, $501 million and $415 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Cash payments for federal, foreign, state and local
income taxes amounted to $110 million, $189 million and $183 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Investing activities exclude $3 million and $43 million of accrued capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2015
and 2013 and include $14 million of previously accrued capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2014.

Updated accounting guidance not yet adopted –

In May of 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).” The core principle of the new accounting guidance is that a company should recognize revenue to depict
the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new accounting guidance provides a five-step analysis of
transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized and requires enhanced disclosures about revenue. In August of 2015, the FASB formally amended the effective date of this update to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2017, including interim periods, and it can be adopted either retrospectively or with a cumulative effect adjustment at the date of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on its
consolidated financial statements.

In May of 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-09, “Financial Services

–

Insurance (Topic 944): Disclosures about Short-Duration Contracts.” The updated accounting guidance requires enhanced disclosures to provide additional information about insurance liabilities for short-duration contracts. The updated guidance
is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the effect the updated guidance will have on its financial statement
disclosures.

In January of 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, “Financial Instruments

–

Overall (Subtopic
825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.” The updated accounting guidance requires changes to the reporting model for financial instruments. The primary change for the Company is expected to be the
requirement for equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The updated
guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the effect the updated guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.



Note 2. Acquisitions and Divestitures

CNA Financial

On August 1, 2014, CNA completed the sale of CAC, its former life insurance subsidiary, which is reported as discontinued
operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income for years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. See Note 19 for further discussion of discontinued operations.

In connection with the sale of CAC, CNA entered into a 100% coinsurance agreement on a separate small block of annuity
business outside of CAC. The coinsurance agreement required the transfer of assets with a book value equal to the ceded reserves on the inception date of the contract. Because a substantial portion of the assets supporting these liabilities are held
in trust for the benefit of the original cedant, those assets were transferred on a funds withheld basis. Under this approach CNA maintains legal ownership of the assets, but the investment income and realized gains and losses on those assets inure
to the reinsurer. As a result, the $31 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) difference between market value and book value of the funds withheld assets at the coinsurance contract’s inception was recognized in Other operating
expenses in 2014.

HighMount

On September 30, 2014, the Company sold HighMount Exploration & Production LLC (“HighMount”), its former natural
gas and oil exploration and production subsidiary. As of December 31, 2014, the Company had no remaining natural gas and oil properties. The results of this sold business are reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of
Income for years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. See Note 19 for further discussion of discontinued operations.

Boardwalk Pipeline

In October of 2014, Boardwalk Pipeline acquired Boardwalk Petrochemical, formerly known as Chevron Petrochemical Pipeline,
LLC, which owns the Evangeline ethylene pipeline system for $295 million in cash, subject to customary adjustments. This acquisition was made as part of Boardwalk Pipeline’s long term growth and diversification strategy and to complement
existing natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) and ethylene midstream assets. The purchase price was funded through borrowings under Boardwalk Pipeline’s revolving credit facility. Boardwalk Pipeline recorded $20 million of identifiable
finite-lived intangible assets and $22 million of goodwill.

In 2013, Boardwalk Pipeline executed a series of agreements
with the Williams Companies, Inc. (“Williams”) to develop the Bluegrass Project. In 2014, the Company expensed the previously capitalized project costs related to the development process due to cost escalations, construction delays and the
lack of customer commitments, resulting in a charge of $94 million ($55 million after tax and noncontrolling interests), inclusive of a $10 million charge recorded by Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP. This charge was recorded within Other operating
expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. In the fourth quarter of 2014, Boardwalk Pipeline and Williams dissolved the Bluegrass project entities.

Loews Hotels

In 2015,
Loews Hotels paid a total of approximately $330 million to acquire two hotels and in 2014, acquired three hotels for a total cost of approximately $230 million. These acquisitions were funded with a combination of cash and property-level debt.

Based on current facts and circumstances, the Company believes the unrealized losses presented
in the table above are not indicative of the ultimate collectibility of the current amortized cost of the securities, but rather are attributable to changes in interest rates, credit spreads and other factors, including volatility in the energy and
metals and mining sectors due to declines in the price of oil and other commodities. As of December 31, 2015, the Company held fixed maturity securities and equity securities with an estimated fair value of $2.5 billion and a cost or amortized cost
of $2.7 billion in the energy and metals and mining sectors. The portion of these securities in a gross unrealized loss position had an estimated fair value of $1.4 billion and a cost or amortized cost of $1.6 billion. The Company has no current
intent to sell securities with unrealized losses, nor is it more likely than not that it will be required to sell prior to recovery of amortized cost; accordingly, the Company has determined that there are no additional OTTI losses to be recorded at
December 31, 2015.



The following table presents the activity related to the pretax credit loss
component reflected in Retained earnings on fixed maturity securities still held at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 for which a portion of an OTTI loss was recognized in Other comprehensive income.

Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because certain securities may be
called or prepaid. Securities not due at a single date are allocated based on weighted average life.

Limited Partnerships

The carrying value of limited partnerships as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 was approximately $3.3 billion and $3.7 billion
which includes undistributed earnings of $952 million and $1.3 billion. Limited partnerships comprising 70.8% of the total carrying value are reported on a current basis through December 31, 2015 with no reporting lag, 12.8% are reported on a one
month lag and the remainder are reported on more than a one month lag. The number of limited partnerships held and the strategies employed provide diversification to the limited partnership portfolio and the overall invested asset portfolio.

Limited partnerships comprising 76.6% and 78.6% of the carrying value at December 31, 2015 and 2014 employ hedge fund
strategies that generate returns through investing in marketable securities in the public fixed income and equity markets. Limited partnerships comprising 23.4% and 18.6% of the carrying value at December 31, 2015 and 2014 were invested in private
debt and equity, and the remaining limited partnerships were primarily invested in real estate strategies. Hedge fund strategies include both long and short positions in fixed income, equity and derivative instruments. These hedge fund strategies
may seek to generate gains from mispriced or undervalued securities, price differentials between securities, distressed investments, sector rotation or various arbitrage disciplines. Within hedge fund strategies, approximately 56.4% were equity
related, 28.9% pursued a multi-strategy approach, 11.4% were focused on distressed investments and 3.3% were fixed income related at December 31, 2015.



The ten largest limited partnership positions held totaled $1.5 billion and $1.8
billion as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. Based on the most recent information available regarding the Company’s percentage ownership of the individual limited partnerships, the carrying value reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets
represents approximately 2.8% and 3.9% of the aggregate partnership equity at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related income reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Income represents approximately 2.8%, 4.3% and 3.7% of the changes in total
partnership equity for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.

While the Company generally does not invest in
highly leveraged partnerships, there are risks which may result in losses due to short-selling, derivatives or other speculative investment practices. The use of leverage increases volatility generated by the underlying investment strategies.

The Company’s limited partnership investments contain withdrawal provisions that generally limit liquidity for a period
of thirty days up to one year and in some cases do not permit withdrawals until the termination of the partnership. Typically, withdrawals require advance written notice of up to 90 days.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivatives in the normal course of business, primarily in an attempt to reduce its exposure to market risk
(principally interest rate risk, credit risk, equity price risk, commodity price risk and foreign currency risk) stemming from various assets and liabilities. The Company’s principal objective under such strategies is to achieve the desired
reduction in economic risk, even if the position does not receive hedge accounting treatment.

The Company enters into
interest rate swaps, futures and forward commitments to purchase securities to manage interest rate risk. Credit derivatives such as credit default swaps are entered into to modify the credit risk inherent in certain investments. Forward contracts,
futures, swaps and options are used primarily to manage foreign currency and commodity price risk.

In addition to the
derivatives used for risk management purposes described above, the Company may also use derivatives for purposes of income enhancement. Income enhancement transactions include but are not limited to interest rate swaps, call options, put options,
credit default swaps, index futures and foreign currency forwards. See Note 4 for information regarding the fair value of derivative instruments.

Investment Commitments

As of December 31, 2015, the Company had committed approximately $398 million to future capital calls from various third party
limited partnership investments in exchange for an ownership interest in the related partnerships.

The Company invests in
various privately placed debt securities, including bank loans, as part of its overall investment strategy and has committed to additional future purchases, sales and funding. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had commitments to purchase or fund
additional amounts of $138 million and sell $67 million under the terms of such securities.

Investments on Deposit

Securities with carrying values of approximately $2.8 billion and $3.0 billion were deposited by CNA’s insurance
subsidiaries under requirements of regulatory authorities and others as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.

Cash and
securities with carrying values of approximately $364 million and $361 million were deposited with financial institutions as collateral for letters of credit as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. In addition, cash and securities were deposited in trusts
with financial institutions to secure reinsurance and other obligations with various third parties. The carrying values of these deposits were approximately $263 million and $302 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.



Note 4. Fair Value

Fair value is the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following fair value hierarchy is used in selecting inputs, with the highest priority given to Level 1, as these are the most transparent or reliable:

●

Level 1 – Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.

●

Level 2 – Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not
active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets.

●

Level 3 – Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are not observable.

Prices may fall within Level 1, 2 or 3 depending upon the methodology and inputs used to estimate fair value for each specific
security. In general, the Company seeks to price securities using third party pricing services. Securities not priced by pricing services are submitted to independent brokers for valuation and, if those are not available, internally developed
pricing models are used to value assets using a methodology and inputs the Company believes market participants would use to value the assets. Prices obtained from third-party pricing services or brokers are not adjusted by the Company.

The Company performs control procedures over information obtained from pricing services and brokers to ensure prices received
represent a reasonable estimate of fair value and to confirm representations regarding whether inputs are observable or unobservable. Procedures include: (i) the review of pricing service or broker pricing methodologies, (ii) back-testing,
where past fair value estimates are compared to actual transactions executed in the market on similar dates, (iii) exception reporting, where period-over-period changes in price are reviewed and challenged with the pricing service or broker based on
exception criteria, (iv) detailed analysis, where the Company performs an independent analysis of the inputs and assumptions used to price individual securities and (v) pricing validation, where prices received are compared to prices independently
estimated by the Company.



The fair values of CNA’s life settlement contracts are included in Other
assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Equity options purchased are included in Equity securities, and all other derivative assets are included in Receivables. Derivative liabilities are included in Payable to brokers. Assets and liabilities
measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized in the tables below:

Securities may be transferred in or out of levels within the fair value hierarchy
based on the availability of observable market information and quoted prices used to determine the fair value of the security. The availability of observable market information and quoted prices varies based on market conditions and trading volume.
There were $63 million of transfers from Level 2 to Level 1 and $52 million of transfers from Level 1 to Level 2 during the year ended December 31, 2015. There were $24 million of transfers from Level 2 to Level 1 and $1 million of transfers from
Level 1 to Level 2 during the year ended December 31, 2014. The Company’s policy is to recognize transfers between levels at the beginning of quarterly reporting periods.

Valuation Methodologies and Inputs

The following section describes the valuation methodologies and relevant inputs used to measure different financial
instruments at fair value, including an indication of the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the instruments are generally classified.

Fixed
Maturity Securities

Level 1 securities include highly liquid and exchange traded bonds and redeemable preferred
stock, valued using quoted market prices. Level 2 securities include most other fixed maturity securities as the significant inputs are observable in the marketplace. All classes of Level 2 fixed maturity securities are valued using a methodology
based on information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets, a discounted cash flow methodology or a combination of both when necessary. Common inputs for all classes of fixed maturity securities include prices
from recently executed transactions of similar securities, marketplace quotes, benchmark yields, spreads off benchmark yields, interest rates and U.S. Treasury or swap curves. Specifically for asset-backed securities, key inputs include prepayment
and default projections based on past performance of the underlying collateral and current market data. Fixed maturity securities are primarily assigned to Level 3 in cases where broker/dealer quotes are significant inputs to the valuation and there
is a lack of transparency as to whether these quotes are based on information that is observable in the marketplace. Level 3 securities also include private placement debt securities whose fair value is determined using internal models with inputs
that are not market observable.

Equity Securities

Level 1 equity securities include publicly traded securities valued using quoted market prices. Level 2 securities are
primarily non-redeemable preferred stocks and common stocks valued using pricing for similar securities, recently executed transactions and other pricing models utilizing market observable inputs. Level 3 securities are primarily priced using
broker/dealer quotes and internal models with inputs that are not market observable.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Exchange traded derivatives are valued using quoted market prices and are classified within Level 1 of the fair value
hierarchy. Level 2 derivatives primarily include currency forwards valued using observable market forward rates. Over-the-counter derivatives, principally interest rate swaps, total return swaps, commodity swaps, equity warrants and options, are
valued using inputs including broker/dealer quotes and are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy, depending on the amount of transparency as to whether these quotes are based on information that is observable in the
marketplace.

Short Term Investments

Securities that are actively traded or have quoted prices are classified as Level 1. These securities include money market
funds and treasury bills. Level 2 primarily includes commercial paper, for which all inputs are market observable. Fixed maturity securities purchased within one year of maturity are classified consistent with fixed maturity securities discussed
above. Short term investments as presented in the tables above differ from the amounts presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets because certain short term investments, such as time deposits, are not measured at fair value.



Other Invested Assets

Level 1 securities include exchange traded open-end funds valued using quoted market prices. Level 2 securities include
overseas deposits which can be redeemed at net asset value in 90 days or less.

Life Settlement Contracts

The fair values of life settlement contracts are determined as the present value of the anticipated death benefits less
anticipated premium payments based on contract terms that are distinct for each insured, as well as CNA’s own assumptions for mortality, premium expense, and the rate of return that a buyer would require on the contracts, as no comparable
market pricing data is available.

Significant Unobservable Inputs

The following tables present quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs utilized by the Company in the
fair value measurements of Level 3 assets. Valuations for assets and liabilities not presented in the tables below are primarily based on broker/dealer quotes for which there is a lack of transparency as to inputs used to develop the valuations. The
quantitative detail of unobservable inputs from these broker quotes is neither provided nor reasonably available to the Company.

For fixed maturity securities, an increase to the credit spread assumptions would
result in a lower fair value measurement. For equity securities, an increase in the private offering price would result in a higher fair value measurement. For life settlement contracts, an increase in the discount rate risk premium or decrease in
the mortality assumption would result in a lower fair value measurement.

Financial Assets and Liabilities Not Measured at Fair Value

The carrying amount, estimated fair value and the level of the fair value hierarchy of the Company’s financial assets and
liabilities which are not measured at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are presented in the following tables. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of short term debt and long term debt exclude capital lease obligations. The
carrying amounts reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash and short term investments not carried at fair value and certain other assets and liabilities approximate fair value due to the short term nature of these items.

The following methods and assumptions were used in estimating the fair value of these
financial assets and liabilities.

The fair values of mortgage loans, included in Other invested assets, were based on the
present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the current interest rate for similar financial instruments, adjusted for specific loan risk.

Fair value of debt was based on observable market prices when available. When observable market prices were not available, the
fair value of debt was based on observable market prices of comparable instruments adjusted for differences between the observed instruments and the instruments being valued or is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on current
incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.

Offshore Drilling Equipment

Purchase of Assets

In
2015, Diamond Offshore took delivery of one ultra-deepwater drillship. The net book value of this newly constructed rig was $655 million at December 31, 2015, of which $225 million was reported in Construction in process at December 31, 2014. At
December 31, 2015, Construction in Process included $270 million related to one rig still under construction.



In 2014, Diamond Offshore took delivery of three ultra-deepwater drillships and
two deepwater floaters. The aggregate net book value of these newly constructed rigs was $2.7 billion at December 31, 2014, of which $1.3 billion was reported in Construction in process at December 31, 2013. At December 31, 2014, Construction in
process included $439 million related to two rigs still under construction.

Sale of Assets

At December 31, 2015, $14 million net book value of five jack-up rigs held for sale was included in Other assets on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. One of these jack-up rigs held for sale was sold in February 2016 for $8 million. In addition, during 2015, nine rigs with an aggregate net book value of $5 million were sold at a nominal gain.

In 2014, Diamond Offshore sold a jack-up rig for $17 million, resulting in a gain of $9 million ($3 million after tax and
noncontrolling interests).

This gain was recorded in Other revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Asset Impairments

During 2015, in response to a continued deterioration of the market fundamentals in the oil and gas industry, including the
dramatic decline in oil prices, significant cutbacks in customer capital spending plans and contract cancellations by customers, as well as pending regulatory requirements in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Diamond Offshore evaluated 25 of its drilling
rigs for impairment. Based on this evaluation, Diamond Offshore determined that 17 of these rigs, consisting of two ultra-deepwater, one deepwater and nine mid-water floaters and five jack-up rigs, were impaired.

Diamond Offshore utilizes an undiscounted projected probability-weighted cash flow analysis in testing an asset for potential
impairment. A matrix of assumptions is developed for each rig under evaluation using multiple utilization/dayrate scenarios, to each of which Diamond Offshore assigns a probability of occurrence. Diamond Offshore arrives at a projected
probability-weighted cash flow for each rig based on the respective matrix and compares such amount to the carrying value of the asset to assess recoverability.

The underlying assumptions and assigned probabilities of occurrence for utilization and dayrate scenarios are developed using
a methodology that examines historical data for each rig, which considers the rig’s age, rated water depth and other attributes and then assesses its future marketability in light of the current and projected market environment at the time of
assessment. Other assumptions, such as operating, maintenance and inspection costs, are estimated using historical data adjusted for known developments and future events that are anticipated by management at the time of the assessment.

Diamond Offshore estimated the fair value of 16 of the impaired rigs utilizing a market approach, which required it to
estimate the value that would be received for each rig in the principal or most advantageous market for that rig in an orderly transaction between market participants. Such estimates were based on various inputs, including historical contracted
sales prices for similar rigs in the fleet, nonbinding quotes from rig brokers and/or indicative bids, where applicable. The fair value of the one remaining rig impaired in 2015 is estimated using an income approach, as Diamond Offshore has
determined that the most likely use for this rig would be to cold stack the rig and reintroduce it into the market at a later date. The fair value of this rig was determined by discounting its future cash flows and includes assumptions which utilize
significant unobservable inputs, including those related to estimated dayrate revenue, rig utilization, estimated equipment upgrade and regulatory survey costs, as well as estimated proceeds that may be received on ultimate disposition of the rig.
The fair value estimates are representative of Level 3 fair value measurements due to the significant level of estimation involved and the lack of transparency as to the inputs used.

Diamond Offshore recognized aggregate impairment losses of $861 million ($341 million after tax and noncontrolling interests)
for the year ended December 31, 2015. Of the rigs impaired in 2015, five mid-water rigs were sold during 2015 and five jack-up rigs are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2015. Six rigs impaired in 2015 were
cold stacked at the end of 2015, and the remaining impaired rig is expected to be sold for scrap after completion of its contract in 2016. The $175 million aggregate carrying value



of these impaired rigs is reported in Property, plant and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2015.

In the third quarter of 2014, Diamond Offshore determined it would retire and scrap six rigs, including a rig upon completion
of its contract term in 2015. Diamond Offshore performed an impairment analysis to determine whether the carrying amount of these assets was recoverable. Based on this analysis, an impairment loss was recognized aggregating $109 million ($55 million
after tax and noncontrolling interests) for the year ended December 31, 2014. The fair value was determined through discussions and a quote from a rig broker, and for the rig under contract using an internally developed income approach, which are
Level 3 inputs of the fair value hierarchy. In the fourth quarter of 2014, two of the rigs were scrapped and at December 31, 2014, the carrying value of the remaining rigs amounted to $9 million. The remaining rigs impaired in 2014 were sold in
2015.

The impairment losses recorded during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 are reported within Other
operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. No impairment loss was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2013.

Diamond Offshore’s assumptions are necessarily subjective and are an inherent part of the asset impairment evaluation. If
market fundamentals in the oil and gas industry deteriorate further or if Diamond Offshore is unable to secure new or extend existing contracts for its current, actively-marketed drilling fleet or reactivate any of its cold stacked rigs or if
Diamond Offshore experiences unfavorable changes to actual dayrates and rig utilization, additional impairment losses may be required to be recognized in future periods.

As a result of the continued deterioration of the market fundamentals in the oil and gas
industry, the Company assessed the carrying value of goodwill related to its investment in Diamond Offshore. An impairment charge of $20 million was recorded in Other operating expenses in the third quarter of 2015 to write-off all goodwill
attributable to Diamond Offshore.

Note 8. Claim and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves

CNA’s property and casualty insurance claim and claim adjustment expense reserves represent the
estimated amounts necessary to resolve all outstanding claims, including claims that are incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) as of the reporting date. CNA’s reserve projections are based primarily on detailed analysis of the facts
in each case, CNA’s experience with similar cases and various historical development patterns. Consideration is given to such historical patterns as field reserving trends and claims settlement practices, loss payments, pending levels of unpaid
claims and product mix, as well as court decisions, economic conditions including inflation and public attitudes. All of these factors can affect the estimation of claim and claim adjustment expense reserves.

Establishing claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, including claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for
catastrophic events that have occurred, is an estimation process. Many factors can ultimately affect the final settlement of a claim and, therefore, the necessary reserve. Changes in the law, results of litigation, medical costs, the cost of repair
materials and labor rates can all affect ultimate claim costs. In addition, time can be a critical part



of reserving determinations since the longer the span between the incidence of a loss and the payment or settlement of the claim, the more variable the ultimate settlement amount can be.
Accordingly, short-tail claims, such as property damage claims, tend to be more reasonably estimable than long-tail claims, such as workers’ compensation, general liability and professional liability claims. Adjustments to prior year reserve
estimates, if necessary, are reflected in the results of operations in the period that the need for such adjustments is determined. There can be no assurance that CNA’s ultimate cost for insurance losses will not exceed current estimates.

Catastrophes are an inherent risk of the property and casualty insurance business and have contributed to material
period-to-period fluctuations in CNA’s results of operations and/or equity. CNA reported catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, of $141 million, $156 million and $169 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Catastrophe
losses in 2015 related primarily to U.S. weather-related events.

Favorable net prior year development of $50 million, $14 million and $9 million was recorded
in Life & Group Non-Core for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. The favorable net prior year development for the year ended December 31, 2015 was driven by favorable claim severity.

Premium development can occur in the property and casualty business when there is a change in exposure on auditable policies
or when premium accruals differ from processed premium. Audits on policies usually occur in a period after the expiration date of the policy.

For the year ended December 31, 2013, favorable premium development for International is primarily due to a commutation
recorded at Hardy.

The commutation of a third-party capital provider’s 15% participation in the 2012 year of account resulted in
recognition of the 15% share of year of account premiums, losses and expenses.

A&EP Reserves

In 2010, Continental Casualty Company (“CCC”) together with several of CNA’s insurance subsidiaries completed a
transaction with National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., under which substantially all of CNA’s legacy A&EP liabilities were ceded to NICO (loss portfolio transfer or “LPT”). At the
transaction effective date, CNA ceded approximately $1.6 billion of net A&EP claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserves to NICO under a retroactive reinsurance agreement with an aggregate limit of $4.0 billion. The $1.6 billion of
claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserves ceded to NICO was net of $1.2 billion of ceded claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserves under existing third party reinsurance contracts. The NICO aggregate reinsurance limit also
covers credit risk on the existing third party reinsurance related to these liabilities. CNA paid NICO a reinsurance premium of $2.0 billion and transferred to NICO billed third party reinsurance receivables related to A&EP claims with a net
book value of $215 million, resulting in total consideration of $2.2 billion.

Through December 31, 2013, CNA recorded
$0.9 billion of additional amounts ceded under the LPT. As a result, the cumulative amounts ceded under the loss portfolio transfer exceeded the $2.2 billion consideration paid, resulting in a deferred retroactive reinsurance gain. This deferred
gain is recognized in earnings in proportion to actual recoveries under the loss portfolio transfer. Over the life of the contract, there is no economic impact as long



as any additional losses are within the limit under the contract. In a period in which the estimate of ceded losses is changed, the required change to the deferred gain is cumulatively recognized
in earnings as if the revised estimate was available at the inception of the LPT. The effect of the deferred retroactive reinsurance benefit is recorded in Insurance claims and policyholders’ benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

The following table presents the impact of the loss portfolio transfer on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

During 2013, unfavorable development was recorded for accident years 2000 and prior related to
A&EP claims due to an increase in ultimate claim severity and higher than anticipated claim reporting, as well as increased defense costs. Additionally, CNA recognized a provision for uncollectible third-party reinsurance which increased the
expected recovery from NICO.

The fourth quarter of 2014 A&EP reserve review was not completed in 2014 because
additional information and analysis on inuring third party reinsurance recoveries were needed to finalize the review. The review was finalized in the second quarter of 2015. Unfavorable development was due to a decrease in anticipated future
reinsurance recoveries related to asbestos claims and higher than expected severity on pollution claims. CNA adopted the second quarter of the year as the timing for all future annual A&EP claims actuarial reviews.

As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the cumulative amounts ceded under the LPT were $2.6 billion and $2.5 billion. The
unrecognized deferred retroactive reinsurance benefit was $241 million and $176 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.

NICO established a collateral trust account as security for its obligations to CNA. The fair value of the collateral trust
account was $2.8 billion and $3.4 billion as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. In addition, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. guaranteed the payment obligations of NICO up to the full aggregate reinsurance limit as well as certain of NICO’s performance
obligations under the trust agreement. NICO is responsible for claims handling and billing and collection from third-party reinsurers related to CNA’s A&EP claims.

In connection with the planned relocation of CNA’s global headquarters, on
February 12, 2016, CNA agreed to sell the current principal executive offices of CNA. Concurrently, CNA agreed to lease back the current office space until the relocation of the global headquarters under a separate lease agreement, which is expected
to occur in 2018. These anticipated lease agreements include expected future minimum lease payments of $9 million in 2016, $10 million in 2017, $4 million in 2018, $0 in 2019, $5 million in 2020 and $138 million thereafter through the remainder of
the seventeen year lease term on the new office space.

Note 10. Income Taxes

The Company and its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. The Company has
entered into a separate tax allocation agreement with CNA, a majority-owned subsidiary in which its ownership exceeds 80%. The agreement provides that the Company will: (i) pay to CNA the amount, if any, by which the Company’s consolidated
federal income tax is reduced by virtue of inclusion of CNA in the Company’s return or (ii) be paid by CNA an amount, if any, equal to the federal income tax that would have been payable by CNA if it had filed a separate consolidated return.
The agreement may be canceled by either of the parties upon thirty days written notice.

For 2013 through 2015, the
Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has accepted the Company into the Compliance Assurance Process (“CAP”), which is a voluntary program for large corporations. Under CAP, the IRS conducts a real-time audit and works
contemporaneously with the Company to resolve any issues prior to the filing of the tax return. The Company believes this approach should reduce tax-related uncertainties, if any. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the Company
believes that any adjustments resulting from audits will not have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The Company and/or its subsidiaries also file income tax returns in various state, local and foreign
jurisdictions. These returns, with few exceptions, are no longer subject to examination by the various taxing authorities before 2011.

Diamond Offshore, which is not included in the Company’s consolidated federal income tax return, files income tax returns
in the U.S. federal, various state and foreign jurisdictions. Tax years that remain subject to examination by these jurisdictions include years 2009 to 2015. The 2013 federal income tax return is currently under examination.

Provision has been made for the expected U.S. federal income tax liabilities applicable to undistributed earnings of
subsidiaries, except for certain subsidiaries for which the Company intends to invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely to finance foreign activities, or recover such undistributed earnings tax-free. The determination of the amount of the
unrecognized deferred tax liability on approximately $2.0 billion of undistributed earnings related to foreign subsidiaries is not practicable.

At December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, $49 million, $51 million and $76 million of unrecognized
tax benefits related to Diamond Offshore would affect the effective tax rate if recognized.

The Company recognizes
interest accrued related to: (i) unrecognized tax benefits in Interest expense and (ii) tax refund claims in Other revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company recognizes penalties in Income tax expense on the Consolidated
Statements of Income. Interest amounts recorded by the Company were insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. The Company recorded income tax expense of $2 million and $38 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and
2013 and income tax benefit of $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 related to penalties.



During 2013, Diamond Offshore received notification from the Egyptian tax
authorities proposing a $1.2 billion increase in taxable income for the years 2006 to 2008. In December of 2013, Diamond Offshore accrued an additional $57 million of expense for uncertain tax positions in Egypt for all open years. During the first
quarter of 2014, Diamond Offshore settled certain disputes for the years 2006 through 2008 with the Egyptian tax authorities, resulting in a net reduction to income tax expense of $17 million. One issue for the 2006 through 2008 period remains open,
which Diamond Offshore appealed. The court case is scheduled to occur in the first quarter of 2016. Diamond Offshore has sought assistance from an agency of the U.S. Treasury Department, pursuant to international tax treaties and continues to
believe that its position will, more likely than not, be sustained. However, if Diamond Offshore’s position is not sustained, tax expense and related penalties would increase by approximately $53 million related to this issue for the 2006
through 2008 tax years as of December 31, 2015.

During the third quarter of 2014, Diamond Offshore reversed $36 million
of reserves for uncertain tax positions, including $6 million for interest and $11 million for penalties, related to a favorable court decision in Brazil resulting in the closure of the 2004 and 2005 tax years, approval from Malaysian tax
authorities for the settlement of tax liabilities and penalties for the years 2003 through 2008 and the expiration of the statute of limitations in Mexico for the 2008 tax year.

Due to the 2015 expiration of the statute of limitations in Mexico for the 2009 tax year for one of Diamond Offshore’s
subsidiaries operating in Mexico, Diamond Offshore reversed an $11 million accrual for an uncertain tax position of which $4 million is interest and $1 million is penalty.

Federal net operating loss carryforwards of $138 million expire in 2034 and 2035.
Net operating loss carryforwards in foreign tax jurisdictions of $66 million expire between 2020 and 2025 and $32 million can be carried forward indefinitely. Federal tax credit carryforwards of $83 million have indefinite lives and $46 million of
foreign tax credit carryforwards expire in 2024 and 2025.

Although realization of deferred tax assets is not assured,
management believes it is more likely than not that the recognized deferred tax assets will be realized through recoupment of ordinary and capital taxes paid in prior carryback years and through future earnings, reversal of existing temporary
differences and available tax planning strategies.

The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law on
January 2, 2013. The act extended, through 2013, several expired or expiring temporary business provisions, commonly referred to as “extenders,” which were retroactively extended to the beginning of 2012. As required by GAAP, the effects
of new legislation are recognized when signed into law. The Company reduced 2013 tax expense by $28 million as a result of recognizing the 2012 effect of the extenders.

At December 31, 2015, the aggregate of long term debt maturing in each of the next five years
is approximately as follows: $1.1 billion in 2016, $657 million in 2017, $455 million in 2018, $1.2 billion in 2019, $1.2 billion in 2020, and $6.0 billion thereafter. Long term debt is generally redeemable in whole or in part at the greater of
the principal amount or the net present value of scheduled payments discounted at the specified treasury rate plus a margin.

CNA Financial

CNA is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago (“FHLBC”). FHLBC membership provides participants with
access to additional sources of liquidity through various programs and services. As a requirement of membership in the FHLBC, CNA held $17 million of FHLBC stock as of December 31, 2015, giving it access to approximately $349 million of additional
liquidity. As of December 31, 2015, CNA has no outstanding borrowings from the FHLBC.

During the third quarter of 2015,
CNA entered into a new credit agreement with a syndicate of banks and simultaneously terminated the previous credit agreement. The new credit agreement established a five-year $250 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility which may be used
for general corporate purposes. At CNA’s election, the commitments under the new credit agreement may be increased from time to time up to an additional aggregate amount of $100 million and the new credit agreement includes two optional
one-year extensions prior to the first and second anniversary of the closing date, subject to applicable consents. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreements and CNA was in compliance with all
covenants.

Diamond Offshore

Diamond Offshore has a $1.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility. In October 2015, Diamond Offshore entered into
an extension agreement of the revolving credit facility which, among other things, provides for a one-year extension of the maturity date for most of the lenders. The extended revolving credit facility matures in October 2020, except for $40 million
of commitments that mature in March 2019 and $60 million of commitments that mature in October 2019. In addition, Diamond Offshore also has the option to increase the revolving commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to an additional
$500 million from time to time, upon receipt of additional commitments from new or existing lenders, and to request one additional one-year extension of the maturity date. Up to $250 million of the facility may be used for the issuance of
performance or other standby letters of credit and up to $100 million may be used for swingline loans. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit agreement.

As of December 31, 2015, Diamond Offshore had $287 million outstanding of commercial paper supported by its existing $1.5
billion revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2015, the commercial paper notes had a weighted average interest rate of 0.9% and a weighted average remaining term of 5.8 days.

In July of 2015, Diamond Offshore repaid $250 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.9% senior notes due July 1, 2015,
primarily with funds obtained through the issuance of additional commercial paper.



Boardwalk Pipeline

Boardwalk Pipeline intends to refinance all of the outstanding $250 million aggregate principal amount of 5.9% notes due 2016
on a long term basis and has sufficient available capacity under their revolving credit facility to extend the amount that would otherwise come due in less than one year. The Boardwalk Pipeline Senior Notes due in 2016 are included in Long term debt
on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In March of 2015, Boardwalk Pipeline completed a public offering of an additional
$250 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.0% senior notes due December 15, 2024. Boardwalk Pipeline originally issued $350 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.0% senior notes due December 15, 2024 in November of 2014. During 2015,
Boardwalk Pipeline used the net proceeds from this offering to retire all of the outstanding $250 million aggregate principal amount of 4.6% notes that matured on June 1, 2015 and repaid at maturity the entire $275 million aggregate principal amount
of its 5.1% senior notes.

In May of 2015, Boardwalk Pipeline entered into an amended revolving credit agreement having
aggregate lending commitments of $1.5 billion and a maturity date of May 26, 2020. Outstanding borrowings under Boardwalk’s revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $375 million and $120 million with a weighted-average
interest rate on the borrowings of 1.7% and 1.5%. At December 31, 2015, Boardwalk Pipeline was in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility and had available borrowing capacity of $1.1 billion.

During 2015, Boardwalk Pipeline repaid the $200 million of outstanding borrowings and terminated all related commitments of
their variable-rate term loan.

Loews Hotels

In September of 2015, Loews Hotels entered into an $87 million mortgage loan agreement which bears interest at London
Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus an applicable margin. The mortgage loan agreement is due October 1, 2018 and includes two optional one-year extensions, subject to applicable conditions.

Common Stock Dividends

Dividends of $0.25 per share on the Company’s common stock were declared and paid in 2015, 2014 and 2013.

There are no restrictions on the Company’s retained earnings or net income with regard to payment of dividends. However,
as a holding company, Loews relies upon invested cash balances and distributions from its subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to declare and pay any dividends to holders of its common stock. The ability of the Company’s subsidiaries to
pay dividends is subject to, among other things, the availability of sufficient earnings and funds in such subsidiaries, compliance with covenants in their respective loan agreements and applicable state laws, including in the case of the insurance
subsidiaries of CNA, laws and rules governing the payment of dividends by regulated insurance companies. See Note 13 for a discussion of the regulatory restrictions on CNA’s availability to pay dividends.

Subsidiary Equity Transactions

The Company purchased 1.1 million shares of Diamond Offshore common stock at an aggregate cost of $29 million during 2015. The
Company’s percentage ownership interest in Diamond Offshore increased as a result of these transactions, from 52% to 53%. The Company’s purchase price of the shares was lower than the carrying value of its investment in Diamond Offshore,
resulting in an increase to Additional paid-in capital (“APIC”) of $5 million.

Boardwalk Pipeline sold 7.1
million common units under an equity distribution agreement with certain broker-dealers during 2015 and received net proceeds of $115 million, including a $2 million contribution from the Company to maintain its 2% general partner interest. The
Company’s percentage ownership interest in Boardwalk Pipeline declined as a result of this transaction, from 53% to 51%. The Company’s carrying value exceeded the issuance price of the common units, resulting in a decrease to APIC of $2
million and an increase to AOCI of $1 million.

Treasury Stock

The Company repurchased 33.3 million, 14.6 million and 4.9 million shares of its common stock at aggregate costs of $1.3
billion, $622 million and $218 million during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. As of December 31, 2015 all outstanding treasury stock was retired. Upon retirement, treasury stock was eliminated through a reduction to common stock,
APIC and retained earnings.

Note 13. Statutory Accounting Practices

CNA’s insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in various jurisdictions. These subsidiaries prepare
statutory financial statements in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the respective jurisdictions’ insurance regulators. Domestic prescribed statutory accounting practices are set forth in a variety of publications
of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) as well as state laws, regulations and general administrative rules. These statutory accounting principles vary in certain respects from GAAP. In converting from statutory
accounting principles to GAAP, the more significant adjustments include deferral of policy acquisition costs and the inclusion of net unrealized holding gains or losses in shareholders’ equity relating to certain fixed maturity securities.



CNA has a prescribed practice as it relates to the accounting under Statement of
Statutory Accounting Principles No. 62R (“SSAP No. 62R”),

Property and Casualty Reinsurance

, paragraphs 67 and 68 in conjunction with the 2010 loss portfolio transfer with NICO as further discussed in Note 8. The prescribed practice
allows CNA to aggregate all third party AE&P reinsurance balances administered by NICO in Schedule F and to utilize the loss portfolio transfer as collateral for the underlying third-party reinsurance balances for purposes of calculating the
statutory reinsurance penalty. This prescribed practice increased statutory capital and surplus at December 31, 2015 by $90 million.

The long term care premium deficiency discussed in Note 1 was recorded on a GAAP basis. There was no premium deficiency for
statutory accounting purposes. Statutory accounting principles requires the use of prescribed discount rates in calculating the reserves for long term care future policy benefits which are lower than the discount rates used on a GAAP basis and
results in higher carried reserves relative to GAAP reserves.

The payment of dividends by CNA’s insurance
subsidiaries without prior approval of the insurance department of each subsidiary’s domiciliary jurisdiction is generally limited by formula. Dividends in excess of these amounts are subject to prior approval by the respective insurance
regulator.

Dividends from CCC are subject to the insurance holding company laws of the State of Illinois, the domiciliary
state of CCC. Under these laws, ordinary dividends, or dividends that do not require prior approval by the Illinois Department of Insurance (“Department”) are determined based on the greater of the prior year’s statutory net income or
10% of statutory surplus as of the end of the prior year, as well as timing and amount of dividends paid in the preceding 12 months. Additionally, ordinary dividends may only be paid from earned surplus, which is calculated by removing unrealized
gains from unassigned surplus. As of December 31, 2015, CCC is in a positive earned surplus position. The maximum allowable dividend CCC could pay during 2016 that would not be subject to the Department’s prior approval is $1.1 billion, less
dividends paid during the preceding 12 months measured at that point in time. CCC paid dividends of $900 million in 2015. The actual level of dividends paid in any year is determined after an assessment of available dividend capacity, holding
company liquidity and cash needs as well as the impact the dividends will have on the statutory surplus of the applicable insurance company.

Combined statutory capital and surplus and statutory net income (loss), determined in accordance with accounting practices
prescribed or permitted by insurance and/or other regulatory authorities for the Combined Continental Casualty Companies and the life company, are presented in the table below.

(a)

Information derived from the statutory-basis financial statements to be filed with insurance regulators.

CNA’s domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements. RBC is a method
developed by the NAIC to determine the minimum amount of statutory capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile. The formula for determining the amount of RBC
specifies various factors, weighted based on the perceived degree of risk, which are applied to certain financial balances and financial activity. The adequacy of a company’s actual capital is evaluated by a comparison to the RBC results, as
determined by the formula. Companies below minimum RBC requirements are classified within certain levels, each of which requires specified corrective action.

The statutory capital and surplus presented above for CCC was approximately 266% and 270% of company action level RBC at
December 31, 2015 and 2014. Company action level RBC is the level of RBC which triggers a heightened level of regulatory supervision. The statutory capital and surplus of CCC’s foreign insurance subsidiaries, which is not significant to the
overall statutory capital and surplus, also met or exceeded their respective regulatory and other capital requirements.



Note 14. Benefit Plans

Pension Plans – The Company has several non-contributory defined benefit plans for eligible employees.
Benefits for certain plans are determined annually based on a specified percentage of annual earnings (based on the participant’s age or years of service) and a specified interest rate (which is established annually for all participants)
applied to accrued balances. The benefits for another plan which covers salaried employees are based on formulas which include, among others, years of service and average pay. The Company’s funding policy is to make contributions in accordance
with applicable governmental regulatory requirements.

Other Postretirement Benefit Plans – The Company has several
postretirement benefit plans covering eligible employees and retirees. Participants generally become eligible after reaching age 55 with required years of service. Actual requirements for coverage vary by plan. Benefits for retirees who were covered
by bargaining units vary by each unit and contract. Benefits for certain retirees are in the form of a Company health care account.

Benefits for retirees reaching age 65 are generally integrated with Medicare. Other retirees, based on plan provisions, must
use Medicare as their primary coverage, with the Company reimbursing a portion of the unpaid amount; or are reimbursed for the Medicare Part B premium or have no Company coverage. The benefits provided by the Company are basically health and, for
certain retirees, life insurance type benefits.

The Company funds certain of these benefit plans, and accrues
postretirement benefits during the active service of those employees who would become eligible for such benefits when they retire. The Company uses December 31 as the measurement date for its plans.

The expected long term rate of return for plan assets is determined based on widely-accepted
capital market principles, long term return analysis for global fixed income and equity markets as well as the active total return oriented portfolio management style. Long term trends are evaluated relative to market factors such as inflation,
interest rates and fiscal and monetary policies, in order to assess the capital market assumptions as applied to the plan. Consideration of diversification needs and rebalancing is maintained.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts
reported for the health care plans. An increase or decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate of 1% in each year would not have a significant impact on the Company’s service and interest cost as of December 31, 2015. An increase of 1%
in each year would increase the Company’s accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2015 by $2 million and a decrease of 1% in each year would decrease the Company’s accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as
of December 31, 2015 by $3 million.

In 2015, CNA eliminated future benefit accruals associated with the CNA Retirement Plan
effective June 30, 2015. This amendment resulted in a $55 million curtailment which is a decrease in the plan benefit obligation liability and a reduction of the unrecognized actuarial losses included in AOCI. In connection with the curtailment, CNA
remeasured the plan benefit obligation which resulted in an increase in the discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation from 3.9% to 4.0%.

During 2014, CNA offered a limited-time lump sum settlement payment opportunity to the majority of the terminated vested
participants of the CNA Retirement Plan. Settlement payments of $253 million were made from CNA Retirement Plan assets and an $84 million settlement charge was recorded by the Company in the fourth quarter of 2014 to recognize a portion of the
unrecognized actuarial losses previously reflected in AOCI. This settlement charge is included in Other operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

In the second quarter of 2014, CNA eliminated certain postretirement medical benefits associated with the CNA Health and Group
Benefits Program. This change was a negative plan amendment which resulted in an $86 million curtailment gain reported in Other operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. In connection with the plan amendment, CNA remeasured the
plan benefit obligation which resulted in a decrease to the discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation from 3.6% to 3.1%.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $3.2
billion and $3.4 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014.

The Company employs a total return approach whereby a mix of
equity and fixed maturity securities are used to maximize the long term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk and to manage cash flows according to plan requirements. The target allocation of plan assets is 40% to 60% invested in equity
securities and limited partnerships, with the remainder primarily invested in fixed maturity securities. The intent of this strategy is to minimize the Company’s expenses by generating investment returns that exceed the growth of the plan
liabilities over the long run. Risk tolerance is established after careful consideration of the plan liabilities, plan funded status and corporate financial conditions. The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of fixed maturity, equity
and short term securities. Alternative investments, including limited partnerships, are used to enhance risk adjusted long term returns while improving portfolio diversification. At December 31, 2015, the Company had committed $105 million to future
capital calls from various third party limited partnership investments in exchange for an ownership interest in the related partnerships. Investment risk is monitored through annual liability measurements, periodic asset/liability studies and
quarterly investment portfolio reviews.

The limited partnership investments are recorded at fair value, which represents the
plans’ share of the net asset value of each partnership. The share of the net asset value of each partnership is determined by the General Partner and is based upon the fair value of the underlying investments, which are valued using varying
market approaches. Level 2 includes limited partnership investments which can be redeemed at net asset value in 90 days or less. Level 3 includes limited partnership investments with withdrawal provisions greater than 90 days, or for which
withdrawals are not permitted until the termination of the partnership. Within hedge fund strategies, approximately 57% were equity related, 37% pursued a multi-strategy approach and 6% were focused on distressed investments at December 31, 2015.

For a discussion of the valuation methodologies used to measure fixed maturity securities, equities and short term
investments, see Note 4.

Savings Plans – The Company and its subsidiaries have several contributory
savings plans which allow employees to make regular contributions based upon a percentage of their salaries. Matching contributions are made up to specified percentages of employees’ contributions. The contributions by the Company and its
subsidiaries to these plans amounted to $115 million, $125 million and $120 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.

Stock Option Plans – In 2012, shareholders approved the amended and restated Loews Corporation 2000 Stock Option Plan
(the “Loews Plan”). The aggregate number of shares of Loews common stock for which options or SARs may be granted under the Loews Plan is 18,000,000 shares, and the maximum number of shares of Loews common stock with respect to which
options or SARs may be granted to any individual in any calendar year is 1,200,000 shares. The exercise price per share may not be less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Generally, options and SARs vest ratably
over a four-year period and expire in ten years.

Note 15. Reinsurance

CNA cedes insurance to reinsurers to limit its maximum loss, provide greater diversification of risk,
minimize exposures on larger risks and to exit certain lines of business. The ceding of insurance does not discharge the primary liability of CNA. A credit exposure exists with respect to property and casualty and life reinsurance ceded to the
extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations or to the extent that the reinsurer disputes the liabilities assumed under reinsurance agreements. Property and casualty reinsurance coverages are tailored to the specific risk
characteristics of each product line and CNA’s retained amount varies by type of coverage. Reinsurance contracts are purchased to protect specific lines of business such as property and workers’ compensation. Corporate catastrophe
reinsurance is also purchased for property and workers’ compensation exposure. Currently most reinsurance contracts are purchased on an excess of loss basis. CNA also utilizes facultative reinsurance in certain lines. In addition, CNA assumes
reinsurance, primarily through Hardy and as a member of various reinsurance pools and associations.

The following table

CNA has established an allowance for doubtful accounts on reinsurance receivables. CNA reviews
the allowance quarterly and adjusts the allowance as necessary to reflect changes in estimates of uncollectible balances. The allowance may also be reduced by write-offs of reinsurance receivable balances.



CNA attempts to mitigate its credit risk related to reinsurance by entering into
reinsurance arrangements with reinsurers that have credit ratings above certain levels and by obtaining collateral. On a limited basis, CNA may enter into reinsurance agreements with reinsurers that are not rated, primarily captive reinsurers. The
primary methods of obtaining collateral are through reinsurance trusts, letters of credit and funds withheld balances. Such collateral was approximately $3.2 billion and $3.4 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014.

CNA’s largest recoverables from a single reinsurer, including ceded unearned premium reserves as of December 31, 2015
were approximately $2.4 billion from subsidiaries of Berkshire Hathaway Group, $284 million from the Gateway Rivers Insurance Company and $207 million from subsidiaries of the Hartford Insurance Group. The recoverable from the Berkshire Hathaway
Group includes amounts related to third party reinsurance for which NICO has assumed the credit risk under the terms of the loss portfolio transfer as discussed in Note 8.

and 2013 are $3.3 billion, $2.6 billion and $2.2 billion related to property business that is 100% reinsured under a significant third party captive program. The third party captives that participate in this program are affiliated with the
non-insurance company policyholders, therefore this program provides a means for the policyholders to self-insure this property risk. CNA receives and retains a ceding commission.

Accident and health premiums are from long duration contracts; property and casualty premiums are from short duration
contracts.

Insurance claims and policyholders’ benefits reported on the Consolidated Statements of Income are net of
reinsurance recoveries of $2.6 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, including $2.3 billion, $1.5 billion and $712 million related to the significant third party captive program discussed above.
Reinsurance recoveries in 2014 were unfavorably affected by the commutation of a workers’ compensation reinsurance pool.

Diamond Offshore.

Note 17. Legal Proceedings

The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. The
outcome of this litigation will not, in the opinion of management, materially affect the Company’s results of operations or equity.

Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies

CNA Financial

In the course of selling business entities and assets to third parties, CNA agreed to guarantee the performance of certain
obligations of a previously owned subsidiary and to indemnify purchasers for losses arising out of breaches of representation and warranties with respect to the business entities or assets sold, including, in certain cases, losses arising from
undisclosed liabilities or certain named litigation. Such guarantee and indemnification agreements in effect for sales of business entities, assets and third party loans may include provisions that survive indefinitely. As of December 31, 2015, the
aggregate amount related to quantifiable guarantees was $375 million and the aggregate amount related to indemnification agreements was $260 million. Should CNA be required to make payments under the guarantee, it would have the right to seek
reimbursement in certain cases from an affiliate of a previously owned subsidiary.

In addition, CNA has agreed to provide
indemnification to third-party purchasers for certain losses associated with sold business entities or assets that are not limited by a contractual monetary amount. As of December 31, 2015, CNA had outstanding unlimited indemnifications in
connection with the sales of certain of its business entities or assets that included tax liabilities arising prior to a purchaser’s ownership of an entity or asset, defects in title at the time of sale, employee claims arising prior to closing
and in some cases losses arising from certain litigation and



undisclosed liabilities. Certain provisions of the indemnification agreements survive indefinitely, while others survive until the applicable statutes of limitation expire, or until the agreed
upon contract terms expire.

In the normal course of business, CNA also provided guarantees, if the primary obligor fails
to perform, to holders of structured settlement annuities provided by a previously owned subsidiary, which are estimated to mature through 2120. The potential amount of future payments CNA could be required to pay under these guarantees was
approximately $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2015. CNA does not believe a payable is likely under these guarantees, as CNA is the beneficiary of a trust that must be maintained at a level that approximates the discounted reserves for these
annuities.

Diamond Offshore

In February of 2016, Diamond Offshore entered into a ten-year agreement with GE Oil & Gas (“GE”) to provide
services with respect to certain blowout preventer and related well control equipment on its four newbuild drillships. Such services include management of maintenance, certification and reliability with respect to such equipment. In connection with
the services agreement with GE, Diamond Offshore will sell the equipment to a GE affiliate for an aggregate $210 million and will lease back such equipment over separate ten-year operating leases. Diamond Offshore does not expect to realize any gain
or loss on these sale and leaseback transactions. Future commitments for the full term under the services agreement and leases are estimated to aggregate approximately $650 million.

Diamond Offshore is financially obligated under a contract with Hyundai Heavy Industries, Co. Ltd. (“Hyundai”) for
the construction of a dynamically positioned, harsh environment semisubmersible drilling rig. The total cost of the rig including shipyard costs, capital spares, commissioning, project management and shipyard supervision is estimated to be $764
million. The remaining contractual payment of $440 million is due upon delivery of the rig, which is expected to occur in mid-2016.

Note 19. Discontinued Operations

As discussed in Note 2, HighMount and the CAC business are classified and presented as discontinued
operations.

In 2014 and 2013, HighMount recorded ceiling test impairment charges of $29 million and $291
million ($19 million and $186 million after tax) related to the carrying value of its natural gas and oil properties. The 2014 write-down was primarily attributable to insufficient reserve additions from exploration activities due to variability in
well performance where HighMount was testing different horizontal target zones and hydraulic fracture designs. The 2013 write-downs were primarily attributable to negative reserve revisions due to variability in well performance where HighMount was
testing different horizontal target zones and hydraulic fracture designs and due to reduced



average NGL prices used in the ceiling test calculations. Had the effects of HighMount’s cash flow hedges not been considered in calculating the ceiling limitation, the impairments would
have been $29 million and $301 million ($18 million and $192 million after tax) for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.

Recognition of a ceiling test impairment charge was considered a triggering event for purposes of assessing any potential
impairment of goodwill at HighMount under a two-step process. The first step compared HighMount’s estimated fair value to its carrying value. Due to the continued low market prices for natural gas and NGLs, the history of quarterly ceiling test
write-downs during 2013 and the then potential for future impairments, and negative reserve revisions recognized during 2013, HighMount reassessed its goodwill impairment analysis. To determine fair value, HighMount used a market approach which
required significant estimates and assumptions and utilized significant unobservable inputs, representing a Level 3 fair value measurement. These estimates and assumptions primarily included, but were not limited to, earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization, production and reserves, control premium, discount rates and required capital expenditures. These valuation techniques were based on analysis of comparable public companies, adjusted for HighMount’s growth
profile. In the first step, HighMount determined that its carrying value exceeded its fair value requiring HighMount to perform the second step and to estimate the fair value of its assets and liabilities. The carrying value of goodwill was limited
to the amount that HighMount’s estimated fair value exceeded the fair value of assets and liabilities. As a result, HighMount recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $584 million ($382 million after tax) for the year ended December 31, 2013,
consisting of all of its remaining goodwill.

Note 20. Business Segments

The Company’s reportable segments are primarily based on its individual operating subsidiaries. Each
of the principal operating subsidiaries are headed by a chief executive officer who is responsible for the operation of its business and has the duties and authority commensurate with that position. Investment gains (losses) and the related income
taxes, excluding those of CNA, are included in the Corporate and other segment.

CNA’s results are reported in four
business segments: Specialty, Commercial, International and Other Non-Core. Specialty provides a broad array of professional, financial and specialty property and casualty products and services, through a network of independent agents, brokers
and managing general underwriters. Commercial includes property and casualty coverages sold to small businesses and middle market entities and organizations primarily through an independent agency distribution system. Commercial also includes
commercial insurance and risk management products sold to large corporations primarily through insurance brokers. International provides management and professional liability coverages as well as a broad range of other property and casualty
insurance



products and services abroad through a network of brokers, independent agencies and managing general underwriters, as well as the Lloyd’s of London marketplace. Other Non-Core primarily
includes the results of CNA’s long term care business that is in run-off and also includes certain corporate expenses, including interest on corporate debt, and the results of certain property and casualty business in run-off, including CNA Re
and A&EP.

Diamond Offshore owns and operates offshore drilling rigs that are chartered on a contract basis for fixed
terms by companies engaged in exploration and production of hydrocarbons. Offshore rigs are mobile units that can be relocated based on market demand. Diamond Offshore’s fleet consists of 32 drilling rigs, including one newbuild rig which is
under construction, and four jack-up rigs which are being marketed for sale. On December 31, 2015, Diamond Offshore’s drilling rigs were located offshore of seven countries in addition to the United States.

Boardwalk Pipeline is engaged in the interstate transportation and storage of natural gas and NGLs and gathering and
processing of natural gas. This segment consists of interstate natural gas pipeline systems originating in the Gulf Coast region, Oklahoma and Arkansas, and extending north and east through the midwestern states of Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois,
Indiana and Ohio, natural gas storage facilities in four states and NGL pipelines and storage facilities in Louisiana and Texas, with approximately 14,525 miles of pipeline.

Loews Hotels operates a chain of 24 hotels, 23 of which are in the United States and one of which is in Canada.

The Corporate and other segment consists primarily of corporate investment income, corporate interest expense and other
unallocated expenses.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of
significant accounting policies in Note 1. In addition, CNA does not maintain a distinct investment portfolio for every insurance segment, and accordingly, allocation of assets to each segment is not performed. Therefore, a significant portion of
net investment income and investment gains (losses) are allocated based on each segment’s carried insurance reserves, as adjusted.

The following tables set forth the Company’s consolidated revenues and income (loss) by business segment:

Note 21. Consolidating Financial Information

The following schedules present the Company’s consolidating balance sheet information at December 31,
2015 and 2014, and consolidating statements of income information for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. These schedules present the individual subsidiaries of the Company and their contribution to the consolidated financial
statements. Amounts presented will not necessarily be the same as those in the individual financial statements of the Company’s subsidiaries due to adjustments for purchase accounting, income taxes and noncontrolling interests. In addition,
many of the Company’s subsidiaries use a classified balance sheet which also leads to differences in amounts reported for certain line items.

The Corporate and other column primarily reflects the parent company’s investment in its subsidiaries, invested cash
portfolio and corporate long term debt. The elimination adjustments are for intercompany assets and liabilities, interest and dividends, the parent company’s investment in capital stocks of subsidiaries, and various reclasses of debit or credit
balances to the amounts in consolidation. Purchase accounting adjustments have been pushed down to the appropriate subsidiary.

this Report under the captions entitled “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting” and “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” and are incorporated herein by reference.

There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
