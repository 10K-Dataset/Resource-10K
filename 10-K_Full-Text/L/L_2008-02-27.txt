INDEX
TO ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM
10-K FILED WITH THE

SECURITIES
AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

For
the Year Ended December 31, 2007


PART
I

Unless
the context otherwise requires, references in this report to “Loews
Corporation,” “we,” “our,” “us” or like terms refer to the business of Loews
Corporation excluding its subsidiaries.

Item
1. Business.

We are a holding company. Our
subsidiaries are engaged in the following lines of business:

·

commercial
      property and casualty insurance (CNA Financial Corporation, an 89% owned
      subsidiary);

·

production
      and sale of cigarettes (Lorillard, Inc., a wholly owned
      subsidiary);

·

operation
      of offshore oil and gas drilling rigs (Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc., a
      51% owned subsidiary);

·

exploration,
      production and marketing of natural gas and natural gas liquids (HighMount
      Exploration & Production LLC, a wholly owned
    subsidiary);

·

operation
      of interstate natural gas transmission pipeline systems (Boardwalk
      Pipeline Partners, LP, a 70% owned subsidiary);
  and

·

operation
      of hotels (Loews Hotels Holding Corporation, a wholly owned
      subsidiary).

Please read information relating to our
major business segments from which we derive revenue and income contained in
Note 25 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item
8.

On July 31, 2007, HighMount Exploration
& Production LLC (“HighMount”) acquired, through its subsidiaries, certain
exploration and production assets, and assumed certain related obligations, from
subsidiaries of Dominion Resources, Inc. for $4.0 billion, subject to
adjustment. The acquired business consists primarily of natural gas exploration
and production operations located in the Permian Basin in Texas, the Antrim
Shale in Michigan and the Black Warrior Basin in Alabama, with estimated proved
reserves totaling approximately 2.5 trillion cubic feet equivalent. These
properties produce predominantly natural gas and related natural gas liquids and
are characterized by long reserve lives and high well completion success rates.
The acquisition was funded with approximately $2.4 billion in cash and $1.6
billion of debt. Please read Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, included in Item 8.

In January of 2008, we sold Bulova
Corporation (“Bulova”) to Citizen Watch Co., Ltd. for approximately $250
million, subject to adjustment. Consequently, Bulova’s results have been
reclassified in our Consolidated Financial Statements to discontinued operations
for all periods presented. Please read Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements, included in Item 8.

Proposed Separation of
Lorillard:

On December 17, 2007, we announced that our Board
of Directors has approved a plan to dispose of our entire ownership interest in
Lorillard, Inc. (“Lorillard”) in a tax-free manner, resulting in the elimination
of the Carolina Group, and all of the Carolina Group stock, and establishing
Lorillard as an independent public company. The disposition, which we refer to
as the “Separation,” would be accomplished through our (i) redemption of all
outstanding Carolina Group stock in exchange for shares of Lorillard common
stock, with holders of Carolina Group stock receiving one share of Lorillard
common stock in exchange for each share of Carolina Group stock they currently
own, and (ii) disposition of our remaining Lorillard common stock in an exchange
offer for shares of outstanding Loews common stock or, if we determine not to
effect the exchange offer, or if the exchange offer is not fully subscribed, as
a pro rata dividend to holders of Loews common stock.

The consummation of the Separation is
conditioned on, among other things, our receipt of a favorable ruling from the
Internal Revenue Service and an opinion of counsel as to the tax-free nature of
the Separation, the effectiveness of the registration statement filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission by Lorillard with respect to our distribution
of shares of Lorillard common stock, the absence of any material changes or
developments and market conditions.


Item 1.
Business

Carolina Group Tracking
Stock

:

Pending
consummation of the Separation, we have a two class common stock
structure:  Loews common stock and Carolina Group stock. Carolina
Group stock, commonly called a tracking stock, reflects the economic performance
of a defined group of our assets and liabilities, referred to as the Carolina
Group. Please read Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
included in Item 8.

We have attributed the following assets
and liabilities to the Carolina Group:

·

our
      100% stock ownership interest in
Lorillard;

·

notional,
      intergroup debt owed by the Carolina Group to the Loews Group, which we
      describe below, bearing interest at the annual rate of 8.0% and, subject
      to optional prepayment, due December 31, 2021 (as of February 12, 2008,
      $218 million principal amount was
outstanding);

·

any
      and all liabilities, costs and expenses of ours, and our subsidiaries,
      including Lorillard and its predecessors, arising out of or related to
      tobacco or otherwise arising out of the past, present or future business
      of Lorillard, or its subsidiaries or predecessors, or claims arising out
      of or related to the sale of any businesses previously sold by Lorillard
      or its subsidiaries or predecessors, in each case, whether grounded in
      tort, contract, statute or otherwise, whether pending or asserted in the
      future;

·

all
      net income or net losses arising from the assets and liabilities that are
      reflected in the Carolina Group and all net proceeds from any disposition
      of those assets, in each case, after deductions to reflect dividends paid
      to holders of Carolina Group stock or credited to the Loews Group in
      respect of its intergroup interest;
and

·

any
      acquisitions or investments made from assets reflected in the Carolina
      Group.

As of February 15, 2008, there were
108,459,891 shares of Carolina Group stock outstanding representing a 62.4%
economic interest in the Carolina Group.

The Loews Group consists of all of our
assets and liabilities other than the 62.4% economic interest in the Carolina
Group represented by the outstanding Carolina Group stock, and includes as an
asset the notional intergroup debt of the Carolina Group referred to
above.

The creation of the Carolina Group and
the issuance of Carolina Group stock does not change our ownership of Lorillard,
Inc. or Lorillard, Inc.’s status as a separate legal entity. The Carolina Group
and the Loews Group are notional groups that are intended to reflect the
performance of the defined sets of assets and liabilities of each group. The
Carolina Group and the Loews Group are not separate legal entities and the
attribution of our assets and liabilities to the Loews Group or the Carolina
Group does not affect title to the assets or responsibility for the liabilities
so attributed.

Each outstanding share of Carolina Group
Stock has 3/10 of a vote per share. Holders of our common stock and of Carolina
Group stock are shareholders of Loews Corporation and are subject to the risks
related to an equity investment in us.

Upon consummation of the Separation, the
Carolina Group will cease to exist. At that time we intend to restate our
Certificate of Incorporation to reflect the elimination of the Carolina Group
and the Carolina Group Stock.

CNA
FINANCIAL CORPORATION

CNA Financial Corporation (together with
its subsidiaries, “CNA”) was incorporated in 1967 and is an insurance holding
company. CNA’s property and casualty insurance operations are conducted by
Continental Casualty Company (“CCC”), incorporated in 1897, and The Continental
Insurance Company (“CIC”), organized in 1853, and its affiliates. CIC became a
subsidiary of CNA in 1995 as a result of the acquisition of The Continental
Corporation (“Continental”). CNA accounted for 53.8%, 58.6% and 62.3% of our
consolidated total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.

CNA serves a wide variety of customers,
including small, medium and large businesses, associations, professionals, and
groups and individuals with a broad range of insurance and risk management
products and services.


Item 1.
Business

CNA
Financial Corporation – (Continued)

CNA’s insurance products primarily
include commercial property and casualty coverages. CNA’s services include risk
management, information services, warranty and claims administration. CNA’s
products and services are marketed through independent agents, brokers, managing
general agents and direct sales.

CNA’s core business, commercial property
and casualty insurance operations, is reported in two business segments:
Standard Lines and Specialty Lines. CNA’s non-core operations are managed in two
business segments: Life & Group Non-Core and Other Insurance. These segments
are managed separately because of differences in their product lines and
markets.

Standard
Lines

Standard Lines works with an independent
agency distribution system and network of brokers to market a broad range of
property and casualty insurance products and services primarily to small,
middle-market and large businesses and organizations domestically. The Standard
Lines operating model focuses on underwriting performance, relationships with
selected distribution sources and understanding customer needs. Property
products provide standard and excess property coverages, as well as marine
coverage, and boiler and machinery. Casualty products provide standard casualty
insurance products such as workers’ compensation, general and product liability
and commercial auto coverage through traditional products. Most insurance
programs are provided on a guaranteed cost basis; however, CNA has the
capability to offer specialized, loss-sensitive insurance programs to those
customers viewed as higher risk and less predictable in exposure.

These property and casualty products are
offered as part of CNA’s Business and Commercial insurance groups. CNA’s
Business insurance group serves its smaller commercial accounts and the
Commercial insurance group serves its middle markets and its larger risks. In
addition, Standard Lines provides total risk management services relating to
claim and information services to the large commercial insurance marketplace,
through a wholly owned subsidiary, CNA ClaimPlus, Inc., a third party
administrator.

Specialty
Lines

Specialty Lines provides professional,
financial and specialty property and casualty products and services, both
domestically and abroad, through a network of brokers, managing general
underwriters and independent agencies. Specialty Lines provides solutions for
managing the risks of its clients, including architects, lawyers, accountants,
healthcare professionals, financial intermediaries and public and private
companies. Product offerings also include surety and fidelity bonds and vehicle
warranty services.

Specialty Lines includes the following
business groups:

U.S. Specialty
Lines:

U.S. Specialty Lines provides management and
professional liability insurance and risk management services, and other
specialized property and casualty coverages, primarily in the United States.
This group provides professional liability coverages to various professional
firms, including architects, realtors, small and mid-sized accounting firms, law
firms and technology firms. U.S. Specialty Lines also provides directors and
officers (“D&O”), employment practices, fiduciary and fidelity coverages.
Specific areas of focus include small and mid-size firms as well as privately
held firms and not-for-profit organizations where tailored products for this
client segment are offered. Products within U.S. Specialty Lines are distributed
through brokers, agents and managing general underwriters.

U.S. Specialty Lines, through CNA
HealthPro, also offers insurance products to serve the healthcare delivery
system. Products, which include professional liability as well as associated
standard property and casualty coverages, are distributed on a national basis
through a variety of channels including brokers, agents and managing general
underwriters. Key customer segments include long term care facilities, allied
healthcare providers, life sciences, dental professionals and mid-size and large
healthcare facilities and delivery systems.

Also included in U.S. Specialty Lines is
Excess and Surplus (“E&S”). E&S provides specialized insurance and other
financial products for selected commercial risks on both an individual customer
and program basis. Customers insured by E&S are generally viewed as higher
risk and less predictable in exposure than those covered by standard
insurance


Item 1.
Business

CNA
Financial Corporation – (Continued)

markets.
E&S’s products are distributed throughout the United States through
specialist producers, program agents and brokers.

Surety:

Surety
consists primarily of CNA Surety and its insurance subsidiaries and offers
small, medium and large contract and commercial surety bonds. CNA Surety
provides surety and fidelity bonds in all 50 states through a combined network
of independent agencies. CNA owns approximately 62% of CNA Surety.

Warranty:

Warranty
provides vehicle warranty service contracts that protect individuals from the
financial burden associated with mechanical breakdown.

CNA Global:

CNA
Global consists of subsidiaries operating in Europe, Latin America, Canada and
Hawaii. These affiliates offer property and casualty insurance to small and
medium size businesses and capitalize on strategic indigenous
opportunities.

Life
& Group Non-Core

The Life & Group Non-Core segment
primarily includes the results of the life and group lines of business that have
either been sold or placed in run-off. CNA continues to service its existing
individual long term care commitments, its payout annuity business and its
pension deposit business. CNA also manages a block of group reinsurance and life
settlement contracts. These businesses are being managed as a run-off operation.
CNA’s group long term care and indexed group annuity contracts, while considered
non-core, continue to be actively marketed.

Other
Insurance

Other Insurance includes certain
corporate expenses, including interest on corporate debt, and the results of
certain property and casualty business primarily in run-off, including CNA Re.
This segment also includes the results related to the centralized adjusting and
settlement of asbestos and environmental pollution (“A&E”)
claims.

Please read Item 7, “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations by
Business Segment – CNA Financial” for information with respect to each
segment.

(a)

Trade
      ratios reflect the results of CNA’s property and casualty insurance
      subsidiaries. Trade ratios are industry measures of property and casualty
      underwriting results. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is the
      percentage of net incurred claim and claim adjustment expenses and the
      expenses incurred related to uncollectible reinsurance receivables to net
      earned premiums. The primary difference in this ratio between accounting
      principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and
      statutory accounting practices (“SAP”) is related to the treatment of
      active life reserves (“ALR”) related to long term care insurance products
      written in property and casualty insurance subsidiaries. For GAAP, ALR is
      classified as claim and claim adjustment expense reserves whereas for SAP,
      ALR is classified as unearned premium reserves. The expense ratio, using
      amounts determined in accordance with GAAP, is the percentage of
      underwriting and acquisition expenses (including the amortization of
      deferred acquisition expenses) to net earned premiums. The expense ratio,
      using amounts determined in accordance with SAP, is the percentage of
      acquisition and underwriting expenses (with no deferral of acquisition
      expenses) to net written premiums. The dividend ratio, using amounts
      determined in accordance with GAAP, is the ratio of policyholders’
      dividends incurred to net earned premiums. The dividend ratio, using
      amounts determined in accordance with SAP, is the ratio of policyholders’
      dividends paid to net earned premiums. The combined ratio is the sum of
      the loss and loss adjustment expense, expense and dividend
      ratios.

(b)

Other
      data is determined in accordance with SAP. Life statutory capital and
      surplus as a percent of total liabilities is determined after excluding
      separate account liabilities and reclassifying the statutorily required
      Asset Valuation Reserve to surplus.

(c)

Surplus
      includes the property and casualty companies’ equity ownership of the life
      company’s capital and surplus.

Property
and Casualty Claim and Claim Adjustment Expenses

The following loss reserve development
table illustrates the change over time of reserves established for property and
casualty claim and claim adjustment expenses at the end of the preceding ten
calendar years for CNA’s property and casualty insurance operations. The table
excludes CNA’s life subsidiaries, and as such, the carried reserves will not
agree


Item 1.

to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. The first section shows
the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated year. The second
section, reading down, shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of
successive years with respect to the originally reported reserve liability. The
third section, reading down, shows re-estimates of the originally recorded
reserves as of the end of each successive year, which is the result of CNA’s
property and casualty insurance subsidiaries’ expanded awareness of additional
facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims. The last section
compares the latest re-estimated reserves to the reserves originally
established, and indicates whether the original reserves were adequate or
inadequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims.

The loss reserve development table for
property and casualty companies is cumulative and, therefore, ending balances
should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes
activity for both the current and prior years. Additionally, the development
amounts in the table below are the amounts prior to consideration of any related
reinsurance bad debt allowance impacts.

CNA
Financial Corporation – (Continued)

(a)

Ceded
      recoverable includes reserves transferred under retroactive reinsurance
      agreements of $784 as of December 31,
1999.

(b)

Effective
      January 1, 2001, CNA established a new life insurance company, CNA Group
      Life Assurance Company (“CNAGLA”). Further, on January 1, 2001 $1,055 of
      reserves were transferred from CCC to
CNAGLA.

(c)

Effective
      October 31, 2002, CNA sold CNA Reinsurance Company Limited. As a result of
      the sale, net reserves were reduced by
$1,316.

Please read information relating to
CNA’s property and casualty claim and claim adjustment expense reserves and
reserve development set forth in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”), and in Notes 1 and 9
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item
8.

Investments

Please read Item 7, MD&A –
Investments and Notes 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, included in Item 8.

Other

Competition:

The
property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive both as to rate
and service. CNA’s consolidated property and casualty subsidiaries compete not
only with other stock insurance companies, but also with mutual insurance
companies, reinsurance companies and other entities for both producers and
customers. CNA must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve its
insurance products and services.

Rates among insurers vary according to
the types of insurers and methods of operation. CNA competes for business not
only on the basis of rate, but also on the basis of availability of coverage
desired by customers, ratings and quality of service, including claim adjustment
services.

There are approximately 2,300 individual
companies that sell property and casualty insurance in the United States. CNA’s
consolidated property and casualty subsidiaries ranked as the 13th largest
property and casualty insurance organization and CNA is the seventh largest
commercial insurance writer in the United States based upon 2006 statutory net
written premiums.

Regulation:

The
insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and
supervision throughout the United States. Each state has established supervisory
agencies with broad administrative powers relative to licensing insurers and
agents, approving policy forms, establishing reserve requirements, fixing
minimum interest rates for accumulation of surrender values and maximum interest
rates of policy loans, prescribing the form and content of statutory financial
reports and regulating solvency and the type, quality and amount of investments
permitted. Such regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations, which
require that rates not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. In
addition to regulation of dividends by insurance subsidiaries, intercompany
transfers of assets may be subject to prior notice or approval by the state
insurance regulators, depending on the size of such transfers and payments in
relation to the financial position of the insurance affiliates making the
transfer or payment.

Insurers are also required by the states
to provide coverage to insureds who would not otherwise be considered eligible
by the insurers. Each state dictates the types of insurance and the level of
coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks. CNA’s share of these
involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of its respective share
of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each state.

Further,
insurance companies are subject to state guaranty fund and other
insurance-related assessments. Guaranty fund assessments are levied by the state
departments of insurance to cover claims of insolvent insurers. Other
insurance-related assessments are generally levied by state agencies to fund
various organizations including disaster relief funds, rating bureaus, insurance
departments, and workers’ compensation second injury funds, or by industry
organizations that assist in the statistical analysis and ratemaking
process.

Reform
of the U.S. tort liability system is another issue facing the insurance
industry. Over the last decade, many states have passed some type of reform. In
recent years, for example, significant state general tort reforms have been
enacted in Georgia, Ohio, Mississippi and South Carolina. Specific state
legislation addressing state asbestos reform has been passed in Ohio, Georgia,
Florida and Texas in past years as well. Although these states’ legislatures
have begun to address their litigious environments, some reforms are being
challenged in the courts and it will take some time before they are finalized.
Even though there has been some tort reform success, new causes of action and
theories of damages


Item 1.
Business

CNA
Financial Corporation – (Continued)

continue
to be proposed in state court actions or by legislatures. For example, some
state legislatures are considering legislation addressing direct actions against
insurers related to bad faith claims. As a result of this unpredictability in
the law, insurance underwriting and rating are expected to continue to be
difficult in commercial lines, professional liability and some specialty
coverages and therefore could materially adversely affect our results of
operations and equity.

Although the federal government and its
regulatory agencies do not directly regulate the business of insurance, federal
legislative and regulatory initiatives can impact the insurance industry in a
variety of ways. These initiatives and legislation include tort reform
proposals; proposals addressing natural catastrophe exposures; terrorism risk
mechanisms; federal regulation of insurance; and various tax proposals affecting
insurance companies.

In addition, CNA’s domestic insurance
subsidiaries are subject to risk-based capital requirements. Risk-based capital
is a method developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to
determine the minimum amount of statutory capital appropriate for an insurance
company to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size
and risk profile. The formula for determining the amount of risk-based capital
specifies various factors, weighted based on the perceived degree of risk, which
are applied to certain financial balances and financial activity. The adequacy
of a company’s actual capital is evaluated by a comparison to the risk-based
capital results, as determined by the formula. Companies below minimum
risk-based capital requirements are classified within certain levels, each of
which requires specified corrective action. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
all of CNA’s domestic insurance subsidiaries exceeded the minimum risk-based
capital requirements.

Subsidiaries with insurance operations
outside the United States are also subject to regulation in the countries in
which they operate. CNA has operations in the United Kingdom, Canada and other
countries.

Properties:

The
333 S. Wabash Avenue building, located in Chicago, Illinois and owned by
Continental Casualty Company (“CCC”), a wholly owned subsidiary of CNA, serves
as the executive office for CNA and its insurance subsidiaries. CNA owns or

Item 1.
Business

LORILLARD,
INC.

Lorillard is engaged, through its
subsidiaries, in the production and sale of cigarettes and is the third largest
manufacturer of cigarettes in the United States. Newport, which is Lorillard’s
flagship brand, is a menthol flavored premium cigarette brand and the top
selling menthol and second largest selling cigarette brand overall in the United
States. In addition to the Newport brand, the Lorillard product line has five
additional brand families marketed under the Kent, True, Maverick, Old Gold and
Max brand names. These six brands include 44 different product offerings which
vary in price, taste, flavor, length and packaging.  Lorillard’s major
trademarks outside of the United States were sold in 1977. Newport accounted for
approximately 91.8% of Lorillard’s sales volume in 2007.  Lorillard
accounted for 22.2%, 21.8% and 23.0% of our consolidated total revenue for the
years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Legislation and
Regulation

.  Lorillard’s business operations are subject to a
variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations governing, among other
things, publication of health warnings on cigarette packaging, advertising and
sales of tobacco products, restrictions on smoking in public places and fire
safety standards. New legislation and regulations are proposed and reports have
been published by government sponsored committees and others recommending
additional regulation of tobacco products.

Lorillard cannot predict the ultimate
outcome of these proposals, reports and recommendations. If they are enacted,
certain of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on Lorillard’s
business and our financial position or results of operations in the
future.

Federal
Regulation

:  The Federal Comprehensive Smoking Education Act,
which became effective in 1985, requires that cigarette packaging and
advertising display one of the following four warning statements, on a rotating
basis:

(1)
“SURGEON GENERAL’S WARNING: Smoking Causes Lung Cancer, Heart Disease,
Emphysema, and may Complicate Pregnancy.”

(2)
“SURGEON GENERAL’S WARNING: Quitting Smoking Now Greatly Reduces Serious Risks
to Your Health.”

(3)
“SURGEON GENERAL’S WARNING: Smoking By Pregnant Women May Result in Fetal
Injury, Premature Birth, and Low Birth Weight.”

(4)
“SURGEON GENERAL’S WARNING: Cigarette Smoke Contains Carbon
Monoxide.”

This law also requires that each company
that manufactures, packages or imports cigarettes shall annually provide to the
Secretary of Health and Human Services a list of the ingredients added to
tobacco in the manufacture of cigarettes. This list of ingredients may be
submitted in a manner that does not identify the company that uses the
ingredients or the brand of cigarettes that contain the
ingredients.

In addition, bills have been introduced
in Congress, including those that would:

·

prohibit
      all tobacco advertising and
promotion;

·

require
      new health warnings on cigarette packages and
  advertising;

·

authorize
      the establishment of various anti-smoking education
    programs;

·

provide
      that current federal law should not be construed to relieve any person of
      liability under common or state
law;

·

permit
      state and local governments to restrict the sale and distribution of
      cigarettes;

·

direct
      the placement of advertising of tobacco
  products;

·

provide
      that cigarette advertising not be deductible as a business
      expense;


Item 1.
Business

Lorillard,
Inc. – (Continued)

·

prohibit
      the mailing of unsolicited samples of cigarettes and otherwise restrict
      the sale or distribution of cigarettes in retail stores, by mail or over
      the internet;

·

impose
      an additional, or increase existing, excise taxes on
      cigarettes;

·

require
      that cigarettes be manufactured in a manner that will cause them, under
      certain circumstances, to be self-extinguishing;
  and

·

subject
      cigarettes to regulation in various ways by the U.S. Department of Health
      and Human Services or other regulatory
agencies.

In 1996, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (“FDA”) published regulations that would have extensively
regulated the distribution, marketing and advertising of cigarettes, including
the imposition of a wide range of labeling, reporting, record keeping,
manufacturing and other requirements. Challenges to the FDA’s assertion of
jurisdiction over cigarettes made by Lorillard and other manufacturers were
upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in March of 2000 when that Court ruled that
Congress did not give the FDA authority to regulate tobacco products under the
federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.

Since the Supreme Court decision,
various proposals and recommendations have been made for additional federal and
state legislation to regulate cigarette manufacturers, including a bill granting
the FDA authority to regulate tobacco products that was introduced in Congress
in February of 2007. The bill, which is supported by Philip Morris and opposed
by Lorillard, Reynolds American, Inc. (“RAI”) and most other cigarette
manufacturers, was considered in hearings by Congressional committees in both
houses of Congress during 2007, and one Senate committee has approved the bill
with certain modifications. No further hearings have been scheduled in Congress
at this time.

The proposed bill would:

·

require
      larger and more severe health warnings on packs and
    cartons;

·

ban
      the use of descriptors on tobacco products, such as “low-tar” and
      “light”;

·

require
      the disclosure of ingredients and additives to
  consumers;

·

require
      pre-market approval by the FDA for claims made with respect to reduced
      risk or reduced exposure products;

·

require
      the reduction or elimination of nicotine or any other compound in
      cigarettes;

·

allow
      the FDA to mandate the use of reduced risk technologies in conventional
      cigarettes;

·

allow
      the FDA to place more severe restrictions on the advertising, marketing
      and sales of cigarettes;

·

permit
      inconsistent state regulation of labeling and advertising and eliminate
      the existing federal preemption of such regulation;
  and

·

grant
      the FDA the regulatory authority to impose broad additional
      restrictions.

The legislation would allow the FDA to
reinstate its prior regulations or adopt new or additional
regulations.

In February of 2001, a committee of the
Institute of Medicine, a private, non-profit organization which advises the
federal government on medical issues, convened and issued a report recommending
that Congress enact legislation. The committee suggested enabling a suitable
agency to regulate tobacco-related products that purport to reduce exposure to
tobacco toxicants or reduce risk of disease, and implement other policies
designed to reduce the harm from tobacco use. The report recommended regulation
of all tobacco products, including potentially reduced exposure products, known
as PREPs.


Item 1.
Business

Lorillard,
Inc. – (Continued)

In 2002, certain public health groups
petitioned the FDA to assert jurisdiction over several PREP type products that
have been introduced into the marketplace. These groups assert that claims made
by manufacturers of these products allow the FDA to regulate the manufacture,
advertising and sale of these products as drugs or medical devices under the
Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. The agency has received comments on these petitions
but has taken no action.

In late 2002 Philip Morris, the largest
U.S. manufacturer of cigarettes, filed a request for rulemaking petition with
the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) seeking changes in the existing FTC
regulatory scheme for measuring and reporting tar and nicotine to the federal
government and for inclusion in cigarette advertising. The agency has received
comments on these petitions but has taken no action.

Environmental Tobacco
Smoke

:  Various publications and studies by governmental
entities have reported that environmental tobacco smoke (“ETS”) presents health
risks. In addition, public health organizations have issued statements on the
adverse health effects of ETS, and scientific papers have been published that
address the health problems associated with ETS exposure. Various cities and
municipalities have restricted public smoking in recent years, and these
restrictions have been based at least in part on the publications regarding the
health risks believed to be associated with ETS exposure.

The governmental entities that have
published these reports have included the Surgeon General of the United States,
first in 1986 and again in 2006. The 2006 report, for instance, concluded that
there is no risk-free level of exposure to ETS. In 2000, the Department of
Health and Human Services listed ETS as a known human carcinogen. In 1993, the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) concluded that ETS is a human lung
carcinogen in adults and causes respiratory effects in children.

Agencies of state governments also have
issued publications regarding ETS, including reports by California entities that
were published in 1997, 1999 and 2006. In the 2006 study, the California Air
Resources Board determined that ETS is a toxic air contaminant. Based on these
or other findings, public health concerns regarding ETS could lead to the
imposition of additional restrictions on public smoking, including
bans.

State and Local
Regulation:

Many state, local and municipal governments and
agencies, as well as private businesses, have adopted legislation, regulations
or policies which prohibit or restrict, or are intended to discourage, smoking,
including legislation, regulations or policies prohibiting or restricting
smoking in various places such as public buildings and facilities, stores,
restaurants and bars and on airline flights and in the workplace. This trend has
increased significantly since the release of the EPA’s report regarding ETS in
1993.

Two states, Massachusetts and Texas,
have enacted legislation requiring each manufacturer of cigarettes sold in those
states to submit an annual report identifying for each brand sold certain “added
constituents,” and providing nicotine yield ratings and other information for
certain brands. Neither law allows for the public release of trade secret
information.

A New York law which became effective in
June of 2004 requires cigarettes sold in that state to meet a mandated standard
for ignition propensity. Lorillard developed proprietary technology to comply
with the standards and was compliant by the effective date. Since the passage of
the New York law, an additional 21 states have passed similar laws utilizing the
same technical standards. The effective dates of these laws range from May of
2006 to January of 2010.

Other similar laws and regulations have
been enacted or considered by other state and local governments. Lorillard
cannot predict the impact which these regulations may have on its business,
though if enacted, they could have a material adverse effect on Lorillard’s
business and our financial position or results of operations in the
future.

Excise Taxes and
Assessments:

Cigarettes
are subject to substantial federal, state and local excise taxes in the United
States and, in general, such taxes have been increasing. The federal excise tax
on cigarettes is $19.50 per thousand cigarettes (or $0.39 per pack of 20
cigarettes). State excise taxes, which are levied upon and paid by the
distributors, are also in effect in the fifty states, the District of Columbia
and many municipalities. Increases in state excise taxes on cigarette sales were
enacted in 10 states during 2007 and ranged from $0.20 per pack to $1.00 per
pack. Proposals for additional increases in federal, state and local excise
taxes continue to be considered. In 2007, the combined state and municipal taxes
ranged from $0.07 to $3.66 per pack of cigarettes.


Item 1.
Business

Lorillard,
Inc. – (Continued)

A federal law enacted in October of 2004
repealed the federal supply management program for tobacco growers and
compensated tobacco quota holders and growers with payments to be funded by an
assessment on tobacco manufacturers and importers. Cigarette manufacturers and
importers are responsible for paying 96.3% of a $10.14 billion payment to
tobacco quota holders and growers over a ten-year period. The law provides that
payments will be based on shipments for domestic consumption.

Advertising and
Marketing

:  Newport is the only Lorillard brand that receives
advertising and promotion support. The predominant form of promotion in the
industry and for Lorillard consists of retail price reduction programs, such as
discounting or lowering the price of a pack or carton of cigarettes in the
retail store, and free pack with purchase promotions. These programs are
developed, implemented and executed by Lorillard’s sales force through
agreements with retail chain accounts and independent retailers.

Lorillard employs other promotion
methods to communicate with its adult consumers as well as with adult smokers of
competitive products. These promotional programs include the use of direct
marketing communications, retail coupons, relationship marketing and promotional
materials intended to be displayed at retail. Lorillard regularly reviews the
results of its promotional spending activities and adjusts its promotional
spending programs in an effort to maintain its competitive position.
Accordingly, sales promotion costs in any particular fiscal period are not
necessarily indicative of costs that may be realized in subsequent
periods.

Advertising plays a relatively lesser
role in Lorillard’s overall marketing strategy. Lorillard advertises Newport in
a limited number of magazines that meet certain requirements regarding the age
and composition of their readership.

Advertising of tobacco products through
television and radio has been prohibited since 1971. In addition, on November
23, 1998, Lorillard and the three other largest cigarette manufacturers entered
into a Master Settlement Agreement (“MSA”) with 46 states, the District of
Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and certain other U.S. territories to
settle certain health care cost recovery and other claims. These manufacturers
had previously settled similar claims brought by the four remaining states which
together with the MSA are generally referred to as the “State Settlement
Agreements.”  Under the State Settlement Agreements, the participating
cigarette manufacturers agreed to severe restrictions on their advertising and
promotion activities including, among other things, restrictions:

·

prohibiting
      the targeting of youth in the advertising, promotion or marketing of
      tobacco products;

·

banning
      the use of cartoon characters in all tobacco advertising and
      promotion;

·

limiting
      each tobacco manufacturer to one event sponsorship during any twelve-month
      period, which may not include major team sports or events in which the
      intended audience includes a significant percentage of
    youth;

·

banning
      all outdoor advertising of tobacco products with the exception of small
      signs at retail establishments that sell tobacco
  products;

·

banning
      tobacco manufacturers from offering or selling apparel and other
      merchandise that bears a tobacco brand name, subject to specified
      exceptions;

·

prohibiting
      the distribution of free samples of tobacco products except within
      adult-only facilities;

·

prohibiting
      payments for tobacco product placement in various media;
    and

·

banning
      gift offers based on the purchase of tobacco products without sufficient
      proof that the intended gift recipient is an
  adult.

Many states, cities and counties have
enacted legislation or regulations further restricting tobacco advertising.
There may be additional local, state and federal legislative and regulatory
initiatives relating to the advertising and promotion of cigarettes in the
future. Lorillard cannot predict the impact of such initiatives on its marketing
and sales efforts.

Lorillard funds a Youth Smoking
Prevention Program, which is designed to discourage youth from smoking by
promoting parental involvement and assisting parents in discussing the issue of
smoking with their children. Lorillard is

also a
founding and principal member of the Coalition for Responsible Tobacco Retailing
which through its “We Card” program trains retailers in how to prevent the
purchase of cigarettes by underage persons. In addition, Lorillard has adopted
guidelines established by the National Association of Attorneys General to
restrict advertising in magazines with large readership among people under the
age of 18.

Customers and
Distribution:

Lorillard sells its products primarily to
wholesale distributors, who in turn service retail outlets, chain store
organizations, and government agencies, including the U.S. Armed Forces. Upon
completion of the manufacturing process, Lorillard ships cigarettes to public
distribution warehouse facilities for rapid order fulfillment to wholesalers and
other direct buying customers. Lorillard retains a portion of its manufactured
cigarettes at its Greensboro central distribution center and Greensboro cold
storage facility for future finished goods replenishment.

As of December 31, 2007, Lorillard had
approximately 600 direct buying customers servicing more than 400,000 retail
accounts. Lorillard does not sell cigarettes directly to consumers. During 2007,
2006 and 2005, sales made by Lorillard to the McLane Company, Inc. comprised
24%, 23% and 21%, respectively, of Lorillard’s revenues. No other customer
accounted for more than 10% of 2007, 2006 or 2005 sales. Lorillard does not have
any backlog orders.

Most of Lorillard’s customers buy
cigarettes on a next-day-delivery basis. Customer orders are shipped from public
distribution warehouses via third party carriers. Lorillard does not ship
products directly to retail stores. Approximately 90% of Lorillard’s customers
purchase cigarettes using electronic funds transfer, which provides immediate
payment to Lorillard.

Raw Materials and
Manufacturing:

In its production of cigarettes, Lorillard uses
domestic and foreign grown burley and flue-cured leaf tobaccos, as well as
aromatic tobaccos grown primarily in Turkey and other Near Eastern countries. A
domestic supplier manufactures all of Lorillard’s reconstituted
tobacco.

Lorillard purchases more than 90% of its
domestic leaf tobacco from Alliance One International, Inc. Lorillard directs
Alliance One in the purchase of tobacco according to Lorillard’s specifications
for quality, grade, yield, particle size, moisture content, and other
characteristics. Alliance One purchases and processes the whole leaf and then
dries and packages it for shipment to and storage at Lorillard’s Danville,
Virginia facility. If Alliance One becomes unwilling or unable to supply leaf
tobacco to Lorillard, Lorillard believes that it can readily obtain high-quality
leaf tobacco from well-established, alternative industry sources.

Due to the varying size and quality of
annual crops and other economic factors, tobacco prices have historically
fluctuated. In 2004, a federal law eliminated historical U.S. price supports
that accompanied production controls which inflated the market price of U.S.
tobacco. Lorillard believes the elimination of production controls and price
supports has favorably impacted the cost of U.S. tobacco.

Lorillard stores its tobacco in 29
storage warehouses on its 130 acre Danville, Virginia facility. To protect
against loss, amounts of all types and grades of tobacco are stored in separate
warehouses. Because of the aging requirements for tobacco, Lorillard maintains
large quantities of leaf tobacco at all times. Lorillard believes its current
tobacco supplies are adequately balanced for its present production
requirements. If necessary, Lorillard can purchase aged tobacco in the open
market to supplement existing inventories.

Lorillard produces cigarettes at its
Greensboro, North Carolina manufacturing plant, which has a production capacity
of approximately 185 million cigarettes per day and approximately 43 billion
cigarettes per year. Through various automated systems and sensors, Lorillard
actively monitors all phases of production to promote quality and compliance
with applicable regulations.

Research and
Development

:  Lorillard’s research and development team
evaluates new products and line extensions and assesses new technologies and
scientific advancements to respond to marketplace demands and developing
regulatory requirements. Current tobacco-related research activities include:
analysis of cigarette components, including cigarette paper, filters, tobacco
and ingredients, analysis of mainstream and sidestream smoke, and modification
of cigarette design.

Properties

:

Lorillard’s
manufacturing facility is located on approximately 80 acres in Greensboro, North
Carolina. This 942,600 square-foot plant contains modern high-speed cigarette
manufacturing machinery. The Greensboro facility

Lorillard,
Inc. – (Continued)

also
includes a warehouse with shipping and receiving areas totaling 54,800 square
feet. In addition, Lorillard owns tobacco receiving and storage facilities
totaling approximately 1,400,000 square feet in Danville, Virginia. Lorillard’s
executive offices are located in a 130,000 square-foot, four-story office
building in Greensboro. Its 93,800 square-foot research facility is also located
in Greensboro.

Lorillard’s principal properties are
owned in fee. With minor exceptions, Lorillard owns all of the machinery it
uses. Lorillard believes that its properties and machinery are in generally good
condition. Lorillard leases sales offices in major cities throughout the United
States, a cold-storage facility in Greensboro and warehousing space in 20 public
distributing warehouses located throughout the United States.

Competition:

The
domestic market for cigarettes is highly competitive. Competition is primarily
based on a brand’s price, including the level of discounting and other
promotional activities, positioning, consumer loyalty, retail display, quality
and taste.

Lorillard’s principal competitors are
the two other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers, Philip Morris and RAI.
Lorillard also competes with numerous other smaller manufacturers and importers
of cigarettes, including deep discount cigarette manufacturers. Lorillard
believes its ability to compete even more effectively has been restrained in
some marketing areas as a result of retail merchandising contracts offered by
Philip Morris and RAI which limit the retail shelf space available to
Lorillard’s brands. As a result, in some retail locations Lorillard is limited
in competitively supporting its promotional programs, which may constrain
sales.

DIAMOND
OFFSHORE DRILLING, INC.

Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.
(“Diamond Offshore”), is engaged, through its subsidiaries, in the business of
owning and operating drilling rigs that are used in the drilling of offshore oil
and gas wells on a contract basis for companies engaged in exploration and
production of hydrocarbons. Diamond Offshore owns 44 offshore rigs and also has
two premium jack-up drilling rigs, the

Ocean Scepter

and the

Ocean Shield

, currently under
construction. Diamond Offshore accounted for 14.2%, 11.9% and 8.2% of our
consolidated total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.

Diamond Offshore owns and operates 30
semisubmersible rigs, consisting of 10 high specification and 20 intermediate
rigs. Semisubmersible rigs consist of an upper working and living deck resting
on vertical columns connected to lower hull members. Such rigs operate in a
“semi-submerged” position, remaining afloat, off bottom, in a position in which
the lower hull is approximately 55 feet to 90 feet below the water line and the
upper deck protrudes well above the surface. Semisubmersible rigs are typically
anchored in position and remain stable for drilling in the semi-submerged
floating position due in part to their wave transparency characteristics at the
water line. Semisubmersible rigs can also be held in position through the use of
a computer controlled thruster (“dynamic-positioning”) system to maintain the
rig’s position over a drillsite. Three semisubmersible rigs in Diamond
Offshore’s fleet have this capability.

Diamond Offshore’s high specification
semisubmersible rigs are generally capable of working in water depths of 4,000
feet or greater or in harsh environments and have other advanced features, as
compared to intermediate semisubmersible rigs. As of January 28, 2008, eight of
the ten high specification semisubmersible rigs were located in the U.S. Gulf of
Mexico (“GOM”), while the remaining two rigs were located offshore Brazil and
Malaysia.

Diamond Offshore’s intermediate
semisubmersible rigs generally work in maximum water depths up to 4,000 feet. As
of January 28, 2008, Diamond Offshore had 19 intermediate semisubmersible rigs
drilling offshore or undergoing contract preparation activities in various
offshore locations around the world. Two of these intermediate semisubmersible
rigs were located in the GOM; three were located offshore Mexico; four were
located in the North Sea, three were located offshore Australia, four were
located offshore Brazil and one each was located offshore Egypt, Indonesia and
Trinidad and Tobago.

Diamond Offshore’s remaining
intermediate semisubmersible, the

Ocean Monarch,

is currently
in Singapore where construction activities are underway to upgrade this rig to a
high specification unit. In 2006, Diamond Offshore began


Item 1.
Business

Diamond
Offshore Drilling, Inc. – (Continued)

the major
upgrade of the

Ocean
Monarch

, a Victory-class semisubmersible that was acquired in August 2005
for $20 million. The modernized rig is being designed to operate in up to 10,000
feet of water in a moored configuration for an estimated cost of approximately
$305 million. Through December 31, 2007, Diamond Offshore had spent $181 million
related to this project. The

Ocean Monarch

is expected to
be ready for deepwater service in the fourth quarter of 2008. The rig will then
return to the GOM where it is expected to begin operating under contract in
early 2009.

Diamond Offshore owns and operates 13
jack-up drilling rigs. Jack-up rigs are mobile, self-elevating drilling
platforms equipped with legs that are lowered to the ocean floor until a
foundation is established to support the drilling platform. The rig hull
includes the drilling rig, jacking system, crew quarters, loading and unloading
facilities, storage areas for bulk and liquid materials, heliport and other
related equipment. Diamond Offshore’s jack-up rigs are used for drilling in
water depths from 20 feet to 350 feet. The water depth limit of a particular rig
is principally determined by the length of the rig’s legs. A jack-up rig is
towed to the drillsite with its hull riding in the sea, as a vessel, with its
legs retracted. Once over a drillsite, the legs are lowered until they rest on
the seabed and jacking continues until the hull is elevated above the surface of
the water. After completion of drilling operations, the hull is lowered until it
rests in the water and then the legs are retracted for relocation to another
drillsite.

As of January 28, 2008, seven of
Diamond Offshore’s 13 jack-up rigs were located in the GOM. Four of those rigs
are independent-leg cantilevered units, two are mat-supported cantilevered
units, and one is a mat-supported slot unit. Of Diamond Offshore’s six remaining
jack-up rigs, all of which are independent-leg cantilevered units, two were
located offshore Mexico, one was located offshore Indonesia, one was located
offshore Egypt, one was located offshore Croatia and the other rig was located
offshore Qatar.

In addition, Diamond Offshore has two
high performance premium jack-up rigs currently under construction. The two new
drilling units, the

Ocean
Scepter

and the

Ocean
Shield,

are being constructed in Brownsville, Texas and Singapore,
respectively, at an aggregate expected cost of approximately $320 million,
including drill pipe and capitalized interest, of which $249 million had been
spent through December 31, 2007. Each new-build jack-up rig will be equipped
with a 70-foot cantilever package, be capable of drilling depths of up to 35,000
feet and have a hook load capacity of two million pounds. Diamond Offshore
expects delivery of both of these units during the second quarter of 2008. The

Ocean Shield

is
expected to begin working under a one year contract offshore Australia beginning
in the second quarter of 2008.

Diamond Offshore has one drillship,
the

Ocean Clipper,

which was located offshore Brazil as of January 28, 2008. Drillships, which are
typically self-propelled, are positioned over a drillsite through the use of
either an anchoring system or a dynamic-positioning system similar to those used
on certain semisubmersible rigs. Deep water drillships compete in many of the
same markets as do high specification semisubmersible rigs.

Markets:

The
principal markets for Diamond Offshore’s contract drilling services are the
following:

·

the
      Gulf of Mexico, including the United States and
  Mexico;

·

Europe,
      principally in the United Kingdom, or U.K., and
  Norway;

·

the
      Mediterranean Basin, including Egypt, Libya and Tunisia; and other parts
      of Africa;

·

South
      America, principally in Brazil;

·

Australia
      and Asia, including Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam;
  and

·

the
      Middle East, including Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi
  Arabia.

Diamond Offshore actively markets its
rigs worldwide. From time to time Diamond Offshore’s fleet operates in various
other markets throughout the world as the market demands.

Diamond Offshore believes its
presence in multiple markets is valuable in many respects. For example, Diamond
Offshore believes that its experience with safety and other regulatory matters
in the U.K. has been beneficial in Australia and in the Gulf of Mexico, while
production experience gained through Brazilian and North Sea operations has
potential application worldwide. Additionally, Diamond Offshore believes its
performance for a customer in one market segment


Item 1.
Business

Diamond
Offshore Drilling, Inc. – (Continued)

or area
enables it to better understand that customer’s needs and better serve that
customer in different market segments or other geographic
locations.

Diamond Offshore’s contracts to provide
offshore drilling services vary in their terms and provisions. Diamond Offshore
typically obtains its contracts through competitive bidding, although it is not
unusual for Diamond Offshore to be awarded drilling contracts without
competitive bidding. Drilling contracts generally provide for a basic drilling
rate on a fixed dayrate basis regardless of whether or not such drilling results
in a productive well. Drilling contracts may also provide for lower rates during
periods when the rig is being moved or when drilling operations are interrupted
or restricted by equipment breakdowns, adverse weather conditions or other
conditions beyond the control of Diamond Offshore. Under dayrate contracts,
Diamond Offshore generally pays the operating expenses of the rig, including
wages and the cost of incidental supplies. Historically, dayrate contracts have
accounted for a substantial portion of Diamond Offshore’s revenues. In addition,
from time to time, Diamond Offshore’s dayrate contracts may also provide for the
ability to earn an incentive bonus from its customers based upon
performance.

A dayrate drilling contract generally
extends over a period of time covering either the drilling of a single well or a
group of wells, which Diamond Offshore refers to as a well-to-well contract, or
a fixed term, which Diamond Offshore refers to as a term contract, and may be
terminated by the customer in the event the drilling unit is destroyed or lost
or if drilling operations are suspended for a period of time as a result of a
breakdown of equipment or, in some cases, due to other events beyond the control
of either party to the contract. In addition, certain of Diamond Offshore’s
contracts permit the customer to terminate the contract early by giving notice,
and in some circumstances may require the payment of an early termination fee by
the customer. The contract term in many instances may also be extended by the
customer exercising options for the drilling of additional wells or for an
additional length of time, generally at competitive market rates and mutually
agreeable terms at the time of the extension.

Customers:

Diamond
Offshore provides offshore drilling services to a customer base that includes
major and independent oil and gas companies and government-owned oil companies.
During 2007, Diamond Offshore performed services for 49 different customers,
none of which accounted for 10.0% or more of Diamond Offshore’s annual total
consolidated revenues. During 2006, Diamond Offshore performed services for 51
different customers with Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (which acquired
Kerr-McGee Oil & Gas Corporation, (“Kerr-McGee”), in mid – 2006) and
Petroleo Brasileiro S.A., (“Petrobras”), accounting for 10.6% and 10.4% of
Diamond Offshore’s annual total consolidated revenues, respectively. During
2005, Diamond Offshore performed services for 53 different customers with
Petrobras and Kerr-McGee accounting for 10.7% and 10.3% of Diamond Offshore’s
annual total consolidated revenues, respectively.

Competition

:

The offshore
contract drilling industry is highly competitive with numerous industry
participants, none of which at the present time has a dominant market share.
Some of Diamond Offshore’s competitors may have greater financial or other
resources than Diamond Offshore. Mergers among oil and gas exploration and
production companies have reduced the number of available customers. The
drilling industry has experienced consolidation in recent years and may
experience additional consolidation, which could create additional large
competitors.

Significant new rig construction and
upgrades of existing drilling units could also intensify price competition.
Diamond Offshore believes that as of the date of this report there are currently
150 jack-up rigs and floaters (semisubmersible rigs and drillships) on order and
scheduled for delivery between 2008 and 2011. Improvements in dayrates and
expectations of sustained improvements in rig utilization rates and dayrates may
result in the construction of additional new rigs. At the same time, anticipated
shortages of sufficient rig capacity to meet future requirements on the part of
the operators may cause the operators to contract for additional new build
equipment. The resulting increases in rig supply could result in depressed rig
utilization and greater price competition from both existing competitors, as
well as new entrants into the offshore drilling market. As of the date of this
report, not all of the rigs currently under construction have contracted for
future work, which may further intensify price competition as scheduled delivery
dates occur. In addition, competing contractors are able to adjust localized
supply and demand imbalances by moving rigs from areas of low utilization and
dayrates to areas of greater activity and relatively higher
dayrates.

Governmental
Regulation

:  Diamond Offshore’s operations are subject to
numerous international, U.S., state and local laws and regulations that relate
directly or indirectly to Diamond Offshore’s operations, including regulations
controlling the discharge of materials into the environment, requiring removal
and clean-up under some circumstances, or otherwise

relating
to the protection of the environment.

:  Diamond Offshore’s operations outside the United
States accounted for approximately 50.0%, 43.0% and 45.0% of Diamond Offshore’s
total consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and
2005, respectively.

Properties:

Diamond
Offshore owns an eight-story office building containing approximately 182,000
net rentable square feet on approximately 6.2 acres of land located in Houston,
Texas, where Diamond Offshore has its corporate headquarters, two buildings
totaling 39,000 square feet and 20 acres of land in New Iberia, Louisiana, for
its offshore drilling warehouse and storage facility, and a 13,000 square foot

warehouse and storage facilities in Louisiana, Australia, Brazil, Indonesia,
Norway, The Netherlands, Malaysia, Qatar, Singapore, Egypt, Trinidad and Tobago
and Mexico to support its offshore drilling operations.

HIGHMOUNT
EXPLORATION & PRODUCTION LLC

On July 31, 2007, HighMount acquired
certain exploration and production assets, and assumed certain related
obligations from subsidiaries of Dominion Resources, Inc. (“Dominion”) for $4.0
billion, subject to adjustment. HighMount accounted for 1.7% of our
consolidated total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007.

In addition, as used in this discussion
of HighMount’s business, “gross wells” refers to the total number of wells in
which HighMount owns a working interest and “net wells” refers to the sum of
each of the gross wells multiplied by the percentage working interest owned by
HighMount in  such well.  “Gross acres” refers to the total
number of acres with respect to which HighMount owns or leases an interest and
“net acres” is the sum of each unit of gross acres covered by a lease or other
arrangement multiplied by Highmount’s percentage mineral interest in such gross
acreage.

HighMount is engaged in the exploration,
production and marketing of natural gas, NGLs (predominantly ethane and propane)
and, to a small extent, oil, primarily in the Permian Basin in Texas, the Antrim
Shale in Michigan and the Black Warrior Basin in Alabama. HighMount holds
interests in developed and undeveloped acreage, wellbores and well facilities,
which generally take the form of working interests in leases that have varying
terms. HighMount’s interests in these properties are, in many cases, held
jointly with third parties and may be subject to royalty, overriding royalty,
carried, net profits, working and other similar interests and contractual
arrangements with other parties as is customary in the oil and gas industry.
HighMount also owns or has interests in gathering systems which transport
natural gas and NGLs, principally from its producing wells, to processing plants
and pipelines owned by third parties.


Item 1.
Business

HighMount
Exploration & Production LLC – (Continued)

As of December 31, 2007, HighMount owned 2.5
Tcfe of net proved reserves. HighMount produced approximately 286 MMcfe per day
of natural gas, NGLs and oil during 2007. HighMount’s estimated total proved
reserves consist of 1.9 Tcf of natural gas, 90.6 MMBbl of NGLs, and 5.7 MMBbl of
oil and condensate, of which 73% were classified as proved developed. HighMount
holds leasehold or drilling rights in 1.1 million net acres, of which 0.7
million (or 61%) is developed acreage and the balance is held for future
exploration and development drilling opportunities. HighMount participated in
the drilling of 242 wells during 2007, of which 236 (or 98%) are productive
wells.

Reserves:

HighMount’s
net proved reserves disclosed in this report represent its share of proved
reserves based on its net revenue interest in each property. Estimated proved
reserves as of December 31, 2007 are based upon studies for each of HighMount’s
properties prepared by HighMount staff engineers and reviewed by Ryder Scott
Company, L.P., HighMount’s independent consulting petroleum engineers.
Calculations were prepared using standard geological and engineering methods
generally accepted by the petroleum industry and in accordance with Securities
and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) guidelines.

The following table sets forth
HighMount’s proved reserves at December 31, 2007, based on prevailing prices as
of that date of $6.80 per MMBtu for natural gas, $62.16 per Bbl for NGLs and

HighMount’s properties typically have
relatively long reserve lives, high well completion success rates and
predictable production profiles. Based on December 31, 2007 proved reserves
and HighMount’s average production from these properties during 2007, the
average reserve-to-production index of HighMount’s proved reserves is 21
years.

In order to replenish reserves as they
are depleted by production, and to increase reserves, HighMount further develops
its existing acreage by drilling new wells and, where available, employing new
technologies and drilling strategies designed to enhance production from
existing wells. Highmount seeks to opportunistically acquire additional acreage
in the Permian Basin, Antrim Shale and Black Warrior Basin, as well as other
locations where its management has identified an opportunity.

HighMount utilizes its own marketing and
sales personnel to market the natural gas and NGLs that it produces to large
energy companies and intrastate pipelines and gathering companies. Production is
typically sold and delivered directly to a pipeline at liquid pooling points or
at the tailgates of various processing plants, where it then enters a pipeline
system. Permian Basin sales prices are primarily at a Houston Ship Channel
Index, Antrim sales are at a MichCon Index and Black Warrior sales are at a
Southern Natural Gas Pipeline Index.

To manage the risk of fluctuations in
prevailing commodity prices, HighMount enters into commodity and basis forward
agreements. In the future, HighMount may enter into other price risk management
instruments to hedge pricing risk on a portion of its projected
production.

HighMount also competes in the marketing of produced natural gas and NGLs. Some
of HighMount’s competitors have substantially larger financial and other
resources than HighMount. Factors that affect HighMount’s ability to acquire
producing properties include available funds, available information about the
property and standards established by HighMount for minimum projected return on
investment. Competition for sales of natural gas and NGLs is also presented by
alternative fuel sources, including heating oil, imported liquefied natural gas
and other fossil fuels.

Regulation:

All of
HighMount’s operations are conducted onshore in the United States. The U.S. oil
and gas industry, and HighMount’s operations, are subject to regulation at the
federal, state and local level. Such regulation includes requirements with
respect to, among other things: permits to drill and to conduct other
operations; provision of financial assurances (such as bonds) covering drilling
and well operations; the location of wells; the method of drilling and
completing wells; the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells
are drilled; the plugging and abandoning of wells; the marketing, transportation
and reporting of production; and the valuation and payment of royalties; the
size of drilling and spacing units (regarding the density of wells which may be
drilled in a particular area); the unitization or pooling of properties; maximum
rates of production from wells; venting or flaring of natural gas and the
ratability of production.

The Federal Energy Policy Act of 2005
amended the Natural Gas Act to prohibit natural gas market manipulation by any
entity, directed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) to facilitate
market transparency in the sale or transportation of physical natural gas and
significantly increased the penalties for violations of the Natural Gas Act of
1938 (“NGA”), the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, or FERC regulations or orders
thereunder. In addition, HighMount owns and operates gas gathering lines and
related facilities which are regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation
(“DOT”) and state agencies with respect to safety and operating
conditions.

HighMount’s operations are also subject
to federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of
contaminants into the environment, the generation, storage, transportation and
disposal of contaminants, and the protection of public health, natural
resources, wildlife and the environment. In most instances, the regulatory
requirements relate to the handling and disposal of drilling and production
waste products, water and air pollution control procedures, and the remediation
of petroleum-product contamination. In addition, HighMount’s operations may
require it to obtain permits for, among other things, air emissions, discharges
into surface waters, and the construction and operation of underground injection
wells or surface pits to dispose of produced saltwater and other non-hazardous
oilfield wastes. HighMount could be required, without regard to fault or the
legality of the original disposal, to remove or remediate previously disposed
wastes, to suspend or cease operations in contaminated areas or to perform
remedial well plugging operations or cleanups to prevent future
contamination.

Properties:

In
addition to its interests in oil and gas producing properties, HighMount leases
an aggregate of approximately 116,000 square feet of office space in three
locations in Houston, Texas, which includes its corporate headquarters, and
approximately 100,000 square feet of office space in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and
Traverse City, Michigan which is used in its operations. HighMount also leases
other surface rights and office, warehouse and storage facilities necessary to
operate its business.

BOARDWALK
PIPELINE PARTNERS, LP

Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP
(“Boardwalk Pipeline”) is engaged in the interstate transportation and storage
of natural gas. Boardwalk Pipeline accounted for 3.7%, 3.5% and 3.6% of our
consolidated total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.

As of February 15, 2008, we owned
approximately 70% of Boardwalk Pipeline, comprised of 53,256,122 common units,
33,093,878 subordinated units and a 2% general partner interest. A wholly owned
subsidiary of ours is the general

partner
and holds all of Boardwalk Pipeline’s incentive distribution rights, which
entitle the general partner to an increasing percentage of the cash that is
distributed by Boardwalk Pipeline in excess of $0.4025 per unit per
quarter.

Boardwalk Pipeline owns and operates
two interstate natural gas pipeline systems, with approximately 13,550 miles of
pipeline, directly serving customers in 11 states and indirectly serving
customers throughout the northeastern and southeastern United States through
numerous interconnections with unaffiliated pipelines. In 2007, its pipeline
systems transported approximately 1.3 trillion cubic feet (“Tcf”) of gas.
Average daily throughput on its pipeline systems during 2007 was approximately
3.6 billion cubic feet (“Bcf”). Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas storage
facilities are comprised of 11 underground storage fields located in four states
with aggregate working gas capacity of approximately 155.0 Bcf.

As discussed below, Boardwalk is
currently undertaking several significant pipeline and storage expansion
projects.

Boardwalk Pipeline conducts all of its
operations through two subsidiaries:

·

Gulf
      South Pipeline Company, L.P. (“Gulf South”) operates approximately 7,700
      miles of natural gas pipeline, located in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi,
      Alabama and Florida having a peak-day delivery capacity of approximately
      4.5 Bcf per day, and two natural gas storage fields located in Louisiana
      and Mississippi with aggregate designated working gas capacity of
      approximately 83.0 Bcf.

·

Texas
      Gas Transmission LLC (“Texas Gas”) operates approximately 5,850 miles of
      natural gas pipeline located in Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi,
      Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, and Illinois having a peak-day
      delivery capacity of approximately 3.8 Bcf per day, and nine natural gas
      storage fields located in Indiana and Kentucky with aggregate designated
      working gas capacity of approximately 72.0
Bcf.

Boardwalk Pipeline transports and
stores natural gas for a broad mix of customers, including local distribution
companies (“LDC”s), municipalities, interstate and intrastate pipelines, direct
industrial users, electric power generation plants, marketers and
producers.

Seasonality:

Boardwalk
Pipeline’s revenues are seasonal in nature and are affected by weather and
natural gas price volatility. Weather impacts natural gas demand for power
generation and heating purposes, which in turn influences the value of
transportation and storage across its pipeline systems. Colder than normal
winters or warmer than normal summers typically result in increased pipeline
transportation revenues. Natural gas prices are also volatile, influencing
drilling and production which can affect revenues from Boardwalk Pipeline’s
storage and parking and lending (“PAL”) services. Peak demand for natural gas
occurs during the winter months, caused by the heating load. During 2007,
approximately 55.7% of Boardwalk Pipeline’s total operating revenues were
recognized in the first and fourth calendar quarters.

Regulation:

The
FERC regulates pipelines under the NGA and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978.
FERC regulates, among other things, the rates and charges for the transportation
and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce, the extension, enlargement or
abandonment of jurisdictional facilities, and the financial accounting of
certain regulated pipeline companies. Gulf South is permitted to charge
market-based storage rates pursuant to authority granted by the FERC. Boardwalk
Pipeline is also regulated by the DOT with regard to safety requirements in the
design, construction, operation and maintenance of interstate natural gas
pipelines.

Where required, Texas Gas and Gulf
South hold certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by the FERC
covering their facilities, activities and services. The FERC also prescribes
accounting treatment for items for regulatory purposes and may periodically
audit the books and records of Texas Gas and Gulf South.

The maximum rates that may be charged by
Boardwalk Pipeline for gas transportation and, in the case of Texas Gas, for
storage services, are established through the FERC cost-of-service rate-making
process. Key determinants in the cost-of-service rate-making process are the
costs of providing service, the allowed rate of return on capital investments,
throughput assumptions, the allocation of costs and the rate design. The allowed
rate of return must be approved by the FERC in each rate case. Texas Gas is
prohibited from placing new rates into effect prior to November 1, 2010, and
neither of Boardwalk Pipeline’s operating subsidiaries has any obligation to
file a new rate case.


Item 1.
Business

Boardwalk
Pipeline Partners, LP – (Continued)

Boardwalk Pipeline’s operations are
also subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating
to protection of the environment.

Competition:

Boardwalk
Pipeline competes with numerous intrastate and interstate pipelines throughout
its service territory to provide transportation and storage services for its
customers. Competition is particularly strong in the Midwest and Gulf Coast
states where Boardwalk Pipeline competes with numerous existing pipelines and
several new pipeline projects that are under way, including the Rockies Express
Pipeline that will transport natural gas from northern Colorado to eastern Ohio;
the Heartland Gas Pipeline currently in operation in Indiana; the proposed
Mid-Continent Express pipeline that would transport gas from Texas to Alabama;
and the Southeast Header Supply System that is currently being constructed and
would transport gas from Perryville, Louisiana to markets in Florida. The
principal elements of competition among pipelines are rates, terms of service,
access to supply and flexibility and reliability of service. In addition,
regulators’ continuing efforts to increase competition in the natural gas
industry have increased the natural gas transportation options of Boardwalk
Pipeline’s traditional customers. As a result of the regulators’ policies,
segmentation and capacity release have created an active secondary market which
increasingly competes with Boardwalk Pipeline’s services, particularly on its
Texas Gas system.

Boardwalk Pipeline’s business is, in
part, dependent on the volumes of natural gas consumed in the United States.
Boardwalk Pipeline’s competitors attempt to attract new supply to their
pipelines, including those that are currently connected to markets served by
Boardwalk Pipeline. Boardwalk Pipeline competes with these entities to maintain
current business levels and to serve new demand and markets. In addition,
natural gas competes with other forms of energy available to its customers,
including electricity, coal and fuel oils.

Expansion
Projects

East Texas to Mississippi
Expansion:

In June of 2007, the FERC granted Boardwalk
Pipeline the authority to construct, own and operate a pipeline expansion
consisting of approximately 242 miles of 42-inch pipeline from DeSoto Parish in
western Louisiana to near Harrisville, Mississippi and approximately 110,000
horsepower of new compression, having approximately 1.7 Bcf of new peak-day
transmission capacity. Customers have contracted at fixed rates for 1.4 Bcf
per day of firm transportation capacity on a long term basis (with a
weighted average term of approximately 6.8 years) from Carthage, Texas, which
represents substantially all of the normal operating capacity. The pipeline
facilities from Keatchie, Louisiana in DeSoto Parish to interconnects with Texas
Gas near Bosco, Louisiana, and Columbia Gulf Transmission pipeline at Delhi,
Louisiana began flowing gas on December 31, 2007. The remaining pipeline
facilities from Delhi, Louisiana to Harrisville, Mississippi began flowing gas
during January of 2008. Boardwalk Pipeline is in the process of commissioning
the remaining compression facilities associated with this project, which it
expects to complete during the second quarter of 2008.

Gulf Crossing
Project:

Boardwalk Pipeline is pursuing construction of a new
interstate pipeline that will begin near Sherman, Texas and proceed to the
Perryville, Louisiana area. The project will be owned by Boardwalk Pipeline’s
newly formed interstate pipeline subsidiary, Gulf Crossing Pipeline Company, LLC
(“Gulf Crossing”), and will consist of approximately 357 miles of 42-inch
pipeline having up to approximately 1.7 Bcf of peak-day transmission capacity.
Additionally, Gulf Crossing has entered into, subject to regulatory approval:
(i) an operating lease for up to 1.4 Bcf per day of capacity on the Gulf South
pipeline system (including capacity on the Southeast Expansion and capacity on a
portion of the East Texas to Mississippi Expansion) to make deliveries to an
interconnect with Transcontinental Pipe Line Company (“Transco”) in Choctaw
County, Alabama (“Transco 85”); and (ii) an operating lease with Enogex, a third
party intrastate pipeline, which will bring certain gas supplies to its
system. Customers have contracted at fixed rates for 1.1 Bcf per day
of long term firm transportation capacity (with a weighted average term of
approximately 9.5 years). The certificate application for this project was filed
with the FERC on June 19, 2007, and Boardwalk Pipeline expects this project to
be in service during the first quarter of 2009.

Southeast
Expansion:

In September of 2007, FERC granted Boardwalk
Pipeline the authority to construct, own and operate a pipeline expansion
originating near Harrisville, Mississippi and extending to an interconnect with
Transco 85. This expansion will initially consist of approximately 112 miles of
42-inch pipeline having approximately 1.2 Bcf of peak-day transmission capacity.
To accommodate volumes expected to come from the Gulf Crossing leased capacity
discussed above, this project will be expanded to 2.2 Bcf of peak-day
transmission capacity. In addition, FERC approved Boardwalk Pipeline’s 260 MMcf
per day operating lease with Destin Pipeline Company which will provide
Boardwalk Pipeline enhanced access to markets in Florida. Customers have
contracted at fixed rates for 660 MMcf

Business

Boardwalk

per day
of firm transportation capacity on a long term basis (with a
weighted-average term of 8.7 years), in addition to the capacity leased to Gulf
Crossing discussed above. Construction has commenced and Boardwalk Pipeline
expects this project to be in service during the second quarter of
2008.

Fayetteville and Greenville
Laterals:

Boardwalk Pipeline is pursuing the construction of
two laterals connected to its Texas Gas pipeline system to transport gas from
the Fayetteville Shale area in Arkansas to markets directly and indirectly
served by Boardwalk Pipeline’s existing interstate pipelines. The Fayetteville
Lateral will originate in Conway County, Arkansas and proceed southeast through
the Bald Knob, Arkansas, area to an interconnect with the Texas Gas mainline in
Coahoma County, Mississippi and consist of approximately 165 miles of 36-inch
pipeline with an initial design of approximately 0.8 Bcf of peak-day
transmission capacity. The Greenville Lateral will originate at the Texas Gas
mainline near Greenville, Mississippi and proceed east to the Kosciusko,
Mississippi, area consisting of approximately 95 miles of pipeline with an
initial design capacity of approximately 0.8 Bcf of peak-day transmission
capacity. The Greenville Lateral will allow customers to access additional
markets, primarily in the Midwest, Northeast and Southeast. Customers have
contracted at fixed rates for 575 MMcf per day of initial capacity, with options
for additional capacity that, if exercised, could add 325 MMcf per day of
capacity.  The certificate application for this project was filed with
the FERC on July 11, 2007. Boardwalk Pipeline expects the first 60 miles of the
Fayetteville Lateral to be in service during the third quarter of 2008 and the
remainder of the Fayetteville and Greenville Laterals to be in service during
the first quarter of 2009.

Pipeline Expansion Project Costs and
Timing:

Boardwalk Pipeline currently estimates that the total
cost of the pipeline expansion projects discussed above will be approximately
$4.5 billion, of which approximately $2.0 billion was spent
or committed to material that was on order as of December 31, 2007. These
estimated costs assume that Boardwalk Pipeline will receive the necessary
regulatory approvals to commence construction by June 1, 2008 on Gulf Crossing
and the Fayetteville and Greenville Laterals and that Boardwalk Pipeline will
receive the regulatory approvals to operate the pipelines on certain of its
projects at higher pressures, which will allow Boardwalk Pipeline to utilize a
higher percentage of the pipeline capacity. Delays in receipt of any of these
approvals will result in higher costs and additional delays in the expected
in-service dates, which would also result in delays of revenues Boardwalk
Pipeline would have received had these delays not occurred, and in certain
instances will result in the payment of penalties to certain
customers.

The increase in estimated total costs
and delays reflects, among other things, higher costs due to scope changes,
adverse weather conditions, delays in the receipt of regulatory approvals, and
the effects of the strong demand for and limited supply of qualified
contractors, labor and materials and equipment which has occurred as a result of
the number of large, complex pipeline construction projects being constructed in
2007 and 2008. These difficult market conditions have resulted in higher
contractor costs, higher costs for labor, materials, construction equipment and
other equipment and parts, as well as shortages of skilled labor. These
conditions are expected to persist and it is possible that they could result in
further cost increases and delays.

Western Kentucky Storage Expansion
Phase II:

In December of 2006, the FERC issued a certificate
approving the Phase II storage expansion project which expanded the working gas
capacity in Boardwalk Pipeline’s western Kentucky storage complex by
approximately 9.0 Bcf. This project is supported by binding commitments from
customers to contract on a long term basis (with a weighted-average term of 8.3
years) for the full additional capacity at the Texas Gas maximum applicable
rate. The project was placed in service in November of 2007.

W

estern Kentucky Storage Expansion
Phase III:

Boardwalk Pipeline has signed 10 year precedent
agreements for 5.1 Bcf of storage capacity for its Phase III storage project.
The certificate application for this project was filed with the FERC on June 25,
2007, seeking approval to develop up to 8.3 Bcf of new storage capacity if Texas
Gas is granted market-based rate authority for the new storage capacity being
proposed. The cost of this project will be dependent on the ultimate size of the
expansion. Boardwalk Pipeline expects 5.4 Bcf of storage capacity to be in
service in 2008.

Magnolia Storage
Facility:

Boardwalk Pipeline was developing a salt dome
storage cavern near Napoleonville, Louisiana. Operational tests, which were
completed in July of 2007, indicated that due to geological and other anomalies
that could not be corrected, Boardwalk Pipeline will be unable to place the
cavern in service as expected. As a result, Boardwalk Pipeline has elected to
abandon that cavern and is exploring the possibility of securing a new site on
which a new cavern could be developed.

(c)

A
      Loews Hotels subsidiary is a 50% owner of these hotels located at the
      Universal Orlando theme park, through a joint venture with Universal
      Studios and the Rank Group. The hotels are constructed on land leased by
      the joint venture from the resort’s owners and are being operated by Loews
      Hotels pursuant to a management
contract.

(d)

Owned
      by the Hotel JV described below.

Loews Hotels has a 25% interest in a
joint venture (the “Hotel JV”) with a single investor, pursuant to which they
will, subject to their respective approval rights set forth in the joint venture
agreement, co-invest up to $300 million, of which Loews Hotels has committed $75
million and the investor has committed $225 million, for the acquisition and
development of hotels and resorts to be operated by Loews Hotels. In August of
2007, the Hotel JV entered into an agreement to purchase, when completed, a
hotel property currently being constructed as part of a mixed use development
project in midtown Atlanta. Loews Hotels expects to open the hotel in
2010.

The hotels owned by Loews Hotels are
subject to mortgage indebtedness totaling approximately $234 million at December
31, 2007 with interest rates ranging from 4.5% to 6.3%, and maturing between
2009 and 2028. In addition, certain hotels are held under leases which are
subject to formula derived rental increases, with rentals aggregating
approximately $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.

Competition from other hotels and
lodging facilities is vigorous in all areas in which Loews Hotels operates. The
demand for hotel rooms in many areas is seasonal and dependent on general and
local economic conditions. Loews Hotels properties also compete with facilities
offering similar services in locations other than those in which its hotels are
located. Competition among luxury hotels is based primarily on location and
service. Competition among resort and commercial hotels is based on price as
well as location and service. Because of the competitive nature of the industry,
hotels must continually make expenditures for updating, refurnishing and repairs
and maintenance, in order to prevent competitive obsolescence.

Item
1A.  RISK FACTORS.

Our business faces many risks. We
have described below some of the more significant risks which we and our
subsidiaries face. There may be additional risks that we do not yet know of or
that we do not currently perceive to be significant that may also impact our
business or the business of our subsidiaries.

Each of the risks and uncertainties
described below could lead to events or circumstances that have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial
condition or equity and/or the business, results of operations, financial
condition or equity of one or more of our subsidiaries. In addition, the risks
and uncertainties described below relating to our Carolina Group stock and our
Lorillard subsidiary could lead to a material loss in the value of the Carolina
Group stock.

You should carefully consider and
evaluate all of the information included in this Report and any subsequent
reports we may file with the SEC or make available to the public before
investing in any securities issued by us. Our subsidiaries, CNA Financial
Corporation, Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and Boardwalk Pipeline Partners,
LP, are public companies and file reports with the SEC. You are also cautioned
to carefully review and consider the information contained in the reports filed
by those subsidiaries before investing in any of their securities.

We
are a holding company and derive substantially all of our cash flow from our
subsidiaries.

We rely upon our invested cash
balances and distributions from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary
to meet our obligations and to declare and pay any dividends to holders of our
common stock and Carolina Group stock. Our subsidiaries are separate and
independent legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to
make funds available to us, whether in the form of loans, dividends or
otherwise. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us is also
subject to, among other things, the availability of sufficient funds in such
subsidiaries, applicable state laws, including in the case of the insurance
subsidiaries of CNA, laws and rules governing the payment of dividends by
regulated insurance companies. Claims of creditors of our subsidiaries will
generally have priority as to the assets of such subsidiaries over our claims
and our creditors and shareholders.

Our
recent acquisition of HighMount creates risks and uncertainties.

On July 31, 2007, HighMount acquired
certain exploration and production assets, and assumed certain related
obligations, from subsidiaries of Dominion for approximately $4.0 billion.

As with any acquisition,
our acquisition of HighMount involves potential risks, including, among other
things:

·

variations
      from assumptions about the amount of recoverable reserves, production
      volumes, revenues and costs and the future price of natural gas and
      NGLs;

·

an
      inability to successfully integrate the
  business;

·

difficulty
      in hiring, training or retaining qualified personnel to manage and operate
      the business;

·

an
      inability to coordinate organizations, systems and facilities needed to
      operate HighMount as a stand-alone business, independent from Dominion,
      including reliance on transition services to be provided by
      Dominion;

·

the
      assumption of unknown liabilities and limitations on our rights to
      indemnity from Dominion;

·

the
      diversion of management’s and employees’ attention from other business
      concerns; and

·

unforeseen
      difficulties operating in a new
industry.

In connection with the acquisition,
we conducted a customary due diligence review of the acquired business,
including among other things, assessment of recoverable reserves, title to
acquired assets, development and operating costs and potential environmental and
other liabilities. Such assessments are inexact and inherently uncertain. In
connection with the assessments, we performed a review of HighMount’s
properties, but such a review will not reveal all existing or potential
problems. In the course of our due diligence, we did not inspect every well,

facility

or
pipeline. We could not


Item
1A.  Risk Factors

necessarily
observe structural and environmental problems or reserves. We were not able to
obtain contractual indemnities from Dominion for many pre-closing liabilities
and risks, known or unknown, and assumed many such risks. The incurrence of an
unexpected liability or the failure of the business to perform in accordance
with our expectations could have a material adverse effect on our financial
position and results of operations.

Risks
Related to the Separation

We
will face different risks after the Separation.

If the Separation is consummated, we
will have a different operational and financial profile than before the
Separation. We will no longer own any of the outstanding stock of Lorillard, our
balance sheet will no longer reflect the assets and liabilities of Lorillard and
our income statement and statement of cash flows will no longer reflect
Lorillard’s operations. We expect that our total market capitalization will
decrease following the Separation. In addition, because we will no longer be
entitled to receipt of dividends from Lorillard, our ability to pay dividends
and to finance capital expenditures, working capital and acquisitions may be
adversely affected.

We
could have liability for tobacco-related lawsuits after the
Separation.

As a result of our ownership of
Lorillard, from time to time we have been named as a defendant in
tobacco-related lawsuits. We are currently a defendant in four such lawsuits and
could be named as a defendant in additional tobacco-related suits, even after
the consummation of the Separation. In the Separation Agreement which is to be
entered into between us and Lorillard at or prior to the time of the Separation,
Lorillard and each of its subsidiaries will agree to indemnify us for
liabilities related to Lorillard’s tobacco business, including liabilities that
we may incur for tobacco-related litigation against us. An adverse decision in a
tobacco-related lawsuit against us could, if the indemnification is deemed for
any reason to be unenforceable or any amounts owed to us thereunder are not
collectible, in whole or in part, have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition, results of operations and equity.

Risks
Related to an Investment in Our Carolina Group Stock

We
cannot be certain that we will continue to pay dividends on our Carolina Group
stock.

Determinations as to the future
dividends on Carolina Group stock primarily will depend on the dividends paid to
us by our subsidiaries, our capital requirements and other factors that our
board of directors considers relevant. The amount of dividends that legally
could be paid on Carolina Group stock if the Carolina Group were a separate
Delaware corporation may be greater than the amount actually available for the
payment of dividends under Delaware law and our charter. Furthermore, our
ability to pay dividends on Carolina Group stock may be reduced by dividends
that we pay on our common stock.

Our board of directors reserves the
right to declare and pay dividends on Carolina Group stock, and could, in its
sole discretion, declare and pay dividends, or refrain from declaring and paying
dividends, on Carolina Group stock. Our board of directors may take such actions
regardless of the amounts available for the payment of dividends on Carolina
Group stock, the amount of prior dividends declared on Carolina Group stock, the
voting or liquidation rights of Carolina Group stock, or any other
factor.

The
independence of the board of directors of Lorillard, Inc. and the board of
directors of its wholly owned subsidiary, Lorillard Tobacco Company, may affect
Lorillard’s payment of dividends to us and thereby inhibit our ability or
willingness to pay dividends and make other distributions on our Carolina Group
stock.

Our ability and willingness to pay
dividends and make other distributions on Carolina Group stock, including
dividends and distributions following a disposition of substantially all of the
assets attributed to the Carolina Group, will depend on a number of factors,
including whether the independent board of directors of Lorillard Tobacco
Company causes Lorillard Tobacco Company to declare and pay dividends to its
parent, Lorillard, Inc. and whether, in turn, the independent board of directors
of Lorillard, Inc. causes Lorillard, Inc. to declare and pay dividends to us. In
the event that Lorillard Tobacco Company or Lorillard, Inc. does not distribute
its earnings, we are unlikely to pay dividends on Carolina Group stock. To the
extent Lorillard, Inc. does not distribute net proceeds following the sale of
substantially all


Item
1A.  Risk Factors

of the
assets attributed to the Carolina Group, we will not be required to apply the
net proceeds to pay dividends to holders of Carolina Group stock or redeem
shares of Carolina Group stock.

We expect that the boards of
directors of each of Lorillard, Inc. and Lorillard Tobacco Company will continue
to function independently of us and will direct the operations and management of
the assets and businesses of those corporations, respectively. None of the
individuals currently serving as directors of Lorillard, Inc. or Lorillard
Tobacco Company are officers, directors or employees of Loews
Corporation.

We
have allocated to the Carolina Group any liabilities or expenses that we incur
as a result of tobacco-related litigation.

The Carolina Group has been allocated
any and all liabilities, costs and expenses of us and Lorillard, Inc. and the
subsidiaries and predecessors of Lorillard, Inc., arising out of or related to
tobacco or otherwise arising out of the past, present or future business of
Lorillard, Inc. or its subsidiaries or predecessors, or claims arising out of or
related to the sale of any businesses previously sold by Lorillard, Inc. or its
subsidiaries or predecessors, in each case, whether grounded in tort, contract,
statute or otherwise, whether pending or asserted in the future.

Accordingly, we and/or Lorillard may
make decisions with respect to litigation and settlement strategies designed to
obtain our dismissal or release from tobacco-related litigation or liabilities.
Such decisions and strategies could result, for example, in limitations on
payment of dividends by Lorillard to us or an increase in Lorillard’s exposure
in such litigation.

Holders
of our common stock and Carolina Group stock are shareholders of one company
and, therefore, financial impacts on one group could affect the other
group.

Holders of our common stock and
holders of Carolina Group stock are all common shareholders of Loews Corporation
and are subject to risks associated with an investment in a single company.
Financial effects arising from one group that affect our consolidated results of
operations or financial condition could, if significant, affect the market price
of the class of common shares relating to the other group. In addition, if we or
any of our subsidiaries were to incur significant indebtedness on behalf of one
group, including indebtedness incurred or assumed in connection with an
acquisition or investment, it could affect the credit rating of us and our
subsidiaries taken as a whole. This, in turn, could increase our borrowing
costs. Net losses of either group and dividends or distributions on shares of
any class of common or preferred stock will reduce the funds legally available
for payment of future dividends on Carolina Group stock.

The
complex nature of the terms of our Carolina Group stock, or confusion in the
marketplace about what a tracking stock is, could materially adversely affect
the market price of Carolina Group stock.

Tracking stocks like Carolina Group
stock are more complex than traditional common stock and are not directly or
entirely comparable to common stock of stand-alone companies or companies that
have been spun off by their parent companies. The complex nature of the terms of
Carolina Group stock, and the potential difficulties investors may have in
understanding these terms, may materially adversely affect the market price of
Carolina Group stock. Examples of these terms include:

·

the
      discretion of our board of directors to make determinations that may
      affect Carolina Group stock and our common stock
    differently;

·

our
      redemption and/or exchange rights under particular circumstances;
      and

·

the
      disparate voting rights of Carolina Group stock and our common
      stock.

Confusion in the marketplace about
what a tracking stock is and what it is intended to represent, and/or investors’
reluctance to invest in tracking stocks, could materially adversely affect the
market price of Carolina Group stock.


Item
1A.  Risk Factors

Holders
of our common stock and Carolina Group stock generally vote together as a single
class.

Holders of Carolina Group stock
generally do not have the right to vote separately as a class. Holders of
Carolina Group stock have the right to vote as a separate class only to the
extent required by Delaware law. We have not held, and do not plan to hold,
separate meetings for holders of Carolina Group stock.

Holders
of our common stock have significantly greater voting power than holders of our
Carolina Group stock with respect to any matter as to which all of our common
shares vote together as one class.

Each share of our common stock has
one vote. Each share of Carolina Group stock is entitled to 3/10 of a vote,
which is disproportionately less than the economic interest represented by each
share of Carolina Group stock. When a vote is taken on any matter as to which
all of our common shares are voting together as one class, holders of our common
stock will have significantly greater voting power than holders of Carolina
Group stock. As of February 15, 2008, holders of our common stock controlled
approximately 94.2% of our combined voting power and holders of Carolina Group
stock controlled approximately 5.8% of our combined voting power. The voting
power of Carolina Group stock is subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock
dividends and combinations with respect to either class of stock.

Holders
of our Carolina Group stock may have interests different from holders of our
common stock.

The existence of separate classes of
our common stock could give rise to occasions when the interests of the holders
of our common stock and Carolina Group stock diverge or conflict or appear to
diverge or conflict. Subject to its fiduciary duties, our board of directors
could, in its sole discretion, from time to time, make determinations or
implement policies that disproportionately affect the groups or the different
classes of stock. Our board of directors is not required to select the option
that would result in the highest value for the holders of Carolina Group stock.
Examples include determinations by our board of directors to:

·

pay
      or omit the payment of dividends on our common stock or Carolina Group
      stock;

·

redeem
      shares of Carolina Group stock;

·

approve
      dispositions of our assets attributed to either
  group;

·

reallocate
      funds or assets between groups and determine the amount and type of
      consideration paid therefore;

·

allocate
      business opportunities, resources and
personnel;

·

allocate
      the proceeds of issuances of Carolina Group stock either to the Loews
      Group, with a corresponding reduction in the intergroup interest, if and
      to the extent there is an intergroup interest, or to the combined
      attributed net assets of the Carolina
Group;

·

formulate
      public policy positions for us;

·

establish
      relationships between the groups;

·

make
      financial decisions with respect to one group that could be considered to
      be detrimental to the other group;
and

·

settle
      or otherwise seek to resolve actual or potential litigation against us in
      ways that might adversely affect
Lorillard.

Any such decisions by our board of
directors could have or be perceived to have a negative effect on the Carolina
Group and could have a negative effect on the market price of Carolina Group
stock.


Item
1A.  Risk Factors

If
our Carolina Group stock is not treated as a class of our common stock, several
adverse federal income tax consequences will result.

It is possible that the issuance of
Carolina Group stock could be characterized as property other than our stock for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such characterization could require us to
recognize taxable gain with respect to the issuance of Carolina Group stock and
the Carolina Group would be responsible for any tax liability attributable
thereto. In addition, we would likely no longer be able to file a consolidated
U.S. federal income tax return with the Carolina Group. These tax liabilities,
if they arise, would likely have a material adverse effect on us and the
Carolina Group.

Changes
in the tax law or in the interpretation of current tax law may result in
redemption of the Carolina Group stock or cessation of the issuance of shares of
Carolina Group stock.

If there are adverse tax consequences
to us or the Carolina Group resulting from the issuance of Carolina Group stock,
it is possible that we would not issue shares of Carolina Group stock even if we
would otherwise choose to do so. This possibility could affect the value of
Carolina Group stock then outstanding. Furthermore, we are entitled to redeem
Carolina Group stock for either (1) cash in an amount equal to 105% of the
average market price per share of Carolina Group stock or (2) our common stock
having a value equal to 100% of the ratio of the average market price per share
of Carolina Group stock to the average market price per share of our common
stock, if, based upon the opinion of tax counsel, there are adverse federal
income tax law developments related to Carolina Group stock. In each case, the
average market price would be determined over a specified 20 trading day
period.

Our
board of directors may, at any time until the 90th day after the disposition of
80% of the assets attributed to the Carolina Group, redeem shares of our
Carolina Group stock.

Our board of directors may, at any
time until the 90th day after the disposition of 80% of the assets attributed to
the Carolina Group, redeem all outstanding shares of Carolina Group stock for
either (1) cash in an amount equal to 120% of the average market price per share
of Carolina Group stock or (2) our common stock having a value equal to 115% of
the ratio of the average market price per share of Carolina Group stock to the
average market price per share of our common stock. In each case, the average
market price would be determined over a specific 20 trading day period. A
decision to redeem the Carolina Group stock could be made at a time when either
or both of our common stock and Carolina Group stock may be considered to be
overvalued or undervalued. In addition, a redemption would preclude holders of
Carolina Group stock from retaining their investment in a security intended to
reflect separately the economic performance of the Carolina Group. It would also
give holders of shares of converted Carolina Group stock an amount of
consideration that may be less than the amount of consideration a third party
buyer pays or would pay for all or substantially all of the net assets
attributed to the Carolina Group.

If
we choose to redeem our Carolina Group stock for cash, holders of Carolina Group
stock may have taxable gain or taxable income.

We may, under certain circumstances,
redeem Carolina Group stock for cash. If we choose to do so, holders of Carolina
Group stock would generally be subject to tax on the excess, if any, of the
total consideration they receive for their Carolina Group stock over their
adjusted basis in their Carolina Group stock.

Our
board of directors does not owe a separate duty to holders of Carolina Group
stock.

Principles of Delaware law
established in cases involving differing treatment of two classes of capital
stock or two groups of holders of the same class of capital stock provide that a
board of directors owes an equal duty to all shareholders regardless of class or
series, and does not have separate or additional duties to either group of
shareholders. Thus, holders of Carolina Group stock who believe that a
determination by our board of directors has a disparate impact on their class of
stock may not be able to obtain a remedy for such a claim.

Our
board of directors may change the Carolina Group policy statement without
shareholder approval.

In connection with the initial
issuance of Carolina Group stock, our board of directors adopted the Carolina
Group policy statement to govern the relationship between the Loews Group and
the Carolina Group. Our board of directors may modify, suspend or rescind the
policies set forth in the Carolina Group policy statement or make additions
or


Item
1A.  Risk Factors

exceptions
to them, in the sole discretion of our board of directors, without approval of
our shareholders. Our board of directors may also adopt additional policies,
depending upon the circumstances. Any changes to our policies could have a
negative effect on the holders of Carolina Group stock.

Our
directors’ and officers’ disproportionate ownership of our common stock compared
to our Carolina Group stock may give rise to conflicts of interest.

Our directors and officers own shares
of our common stock and have been awarded stock options with respect to shares
of our common stock. As of February 15, 2008 our directors and executive
officers beneficially owned approximately 30.5 million shares of our common
stock and no shares of Carolina Group stock, which represents approximately 5.4%
of our combined voting power. Accordingly, our directors and officers could have
an economic incentive to favor the Loews Group over the Carolina
Group.

Because
it is possible for an acquiror to obtain control of us by purchasing shares of
our common stock without purchasing any shares of our Carolina Group stock,
holders of Carolina Group stock may not share in any takeover
premium.

Because holders of our common stock
have significantly greater voting power than holders of Carolina Group stock, a
potential acquiror could acquire control of us by acquiring shares of our common
stock without purchasing any shares of Carolina Group stock. As a result,
holders of Carolina Group stock might not share in any takeover premium and
Carolina Group stock may have a lower market price than it would have if there
were a greater likelihood that holders of Carolina Group stock would share in
any takeover premium.

Holders
of our Carolina Group stock may receive less consideration upon a sale of the
assets attributed to the Carolina Group than if the Carolina Group were a
separate company.

Assuming the assets attributed to the
Carolina Group represent less than substantially all of our assets as a whole,
our board of directors could, in its sole discretion and without shareholder
approval, approve sales and other dispositions of any amount of our assets
attributed to the Carolina Group because the Delaware General Corporation Law
requires shareholder approval only for a sale or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the assets of the entire company. Similarly, the boards of
directors of Lorillard, Inc. or its subsidiaries could decide to sell or
otherwise dispose of the operating and other assets reflected in the financial
statements of the Carolina Group without the approval of holders of Carolina
Group stock.

If 80% or more of the assets
attributed to the Carolina Group are sold, we may take one of the following
actions, and if we receive any net proceeds from the sale and determine not to
retain all of such proceeds as tobacco contingency reserves, we must take one of
the following actions:

·

pay
      a special dividend to holders of Carolina Group stock in an amount equal
      to their pro rata share of the net proceeds (subject to reduction for
      repayment of notional intergroup debt, amounts not distributed from
      Lorillard to us and the creation by us of reserves for tobacco-related
      contingent liabilities and future costs) from the disposition in the form
      of cash and/or securities (other than our common
  stock);

·

redeem
      shares of Carolina Group stock for cash and/or securities (other than our
      common stock) in an amount equal to the pro rata share of the net proceeds
      (subject to reduction for repayment of notional intergroup debt) from the
      disposition of all of the assets attributable to the Carolina
      Group;

·

redeem
      shares of Carolina Group stock for shares of our common stock at a 15%
      premium based on the respective market values of Carolina Group stock and
      our common stock during the 20 consecutive trading days ending on the 5th
      trading day prior to announcement of the sale;
  or

·

take
      some combination of the actions described
above.

Our board of directors has the
discretion to choose from the foregoing options. The value of the consideration
paid to holders of Carolina Group stock in the different scenarios described
above could be significantly different. Our board of


Item
1A.  Risk Factors

directors
would not be required to select the option that would result in the distribution
with the highest value to the holders of Carolina Group stock.

If, on the 91st day following the
sale of 80% or more of the assets attributed to the Carolina Group, we have not
redeemed all of the outstanding shares of Carolina Group stock and Lorillard
subsequently distributes to us any previously undistributed portion of the net
proceeds and/or we subsequently release any amount of net proceeds previously
retained by us as a reserve for tobacco-related contingent liabilities or future
costs, we will distribute the pro rata share of such amounts to holders of
Carolina Group stock. At any time after:

·

Lorillard
      has distributed to us all previously undistributed portions of the net
      proceeds;

·

no
      amounts remain in reserve in respect of tobacco-related contingent
      liabilities and future costs; and

·

the
      only asset remaining in the Carolina Group is cash and/or cash
      equivalents,

then we
may redeem all of the outstanding shares of Carolina Group stock for cash in an
amount equal to the greater of (1) the pro rata share of the remaining assets of
the Carolina Group and (2) $0.001 per share of Carolina Group
stock.

If the Carolina Group were a
separate, independent company and its shares were acquired by another person,
some of the costs of that sale, including corporate level taxes, might not be
payable in connection with that acquisition. As a result, shareholders of a
separate, independent company might receive an amount greater than the net
proceeds that would be received by the holders of Carolina Group stock. In
addition, we cannot assure that the net proceeds per share of Carolina Group
stock received by its holder in connection with any redemption following a sale
of Carolina Group assets will be equal to or greater than the market value per
share of Carolina Group stock prior to or after announcement of a sale of assets
reflected in the Carolina Group. Nor can we assure that, where consideration is
based on the market value of Carolina Group stock, the market value will be
equal to or greater than the net proceeds per share of Carolina Group
stock.

We
may cause a mandatory exchange of our Carolina Group stock.

We may exchange all outstanding
shares of Carolina Group stock for shares of one or more of our qualifying
subsidiaries. Such an exchange would result in the qualifying subsidiary or
subsidiaries becoming a separate public company and the holders of Carolina
Group stock owning shares directly in that subsidiary or those subsidiaries. If
we choose to exchange shares of Carolina Group stock in this manner, the market
value of the common stock received in that exchange could be less than the
market value of Carolina Group stock exchanged.

If
we are liquidated, amounts distributed to holders of our Carolina Group stock
may not reflect the value of the assets attributed to the Carolina
Group.

In the event we are liquidated, we
would determine the liquidation rights of the holders of Carolina Group stock in
accordance with the market capitalization of the outstanding shares of the Loews
Group and the Carolina Group at a specified time prior to the time of
liquidation. However, the relative market capitalization of the outstanding
shares of each group may not correctly reflect the value of the net assets
remaining and attributed to the groups after satisfaction of outstanding
liabilities. Accordingly, the holders of Carolina Group stock could receive less
consideration upon liquidation than they would if the groups were separate
entities.

Risks
Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, CNA Financial Corporation

If
CNA determines that loss reserves are insufficient to cover its estimated
ultimate unpaid liability for claims, CNA may need to increase its loss
reserves.

CNA maintains loss reserves to cover
its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses
for reported and unreported claims and for future policy benefits. Reserves
represent CNA management’s best estimate at a given point in time. Insurance
reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex
estimates derived by CNA, generally utilizing a variety of reserve estimation
techniques, from numerous assumptions and expectations about future events, many
of which are highly uncertain, such as estimates of claims severity, frequency
of


Item
1A.  Risk Factors

claims,
mortality, morbidity, expected interest rates, inflation, claims handling and
case reserving policies and procedures, underwriting and pricing policies,
changes in the legal and regulatory environment and the lag time between the
occurrence of an insured event and the time of its ultimate settlement. Many of
these uncertainties are not precisely quantifiable and require significant
management judgment. As trends in underlying claims develop, particularly in
so-called “long tail” or long duration coverages, CNA is sometimes required to
add to its reserves. This is called unfavorable development and results in a
charge to our earnings in the amount of the added reserves, recorded in the
period the change in estimate is made. These charges can be substantial and can
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and equity. Please
read additional information on CNA’s reserves included in MD&A under Item 7
and Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item
8.

CNA is subject to uncertain effects of
emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as industry
practices and legal, judicial, social, and other environmental conditions
change. These issues have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on
CNA’s business by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting
intent or by increasing the number or size of claims, resulting in further
increases in CNA’s reserves which can have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and equity. The effects of these and other unforeseen
emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict. Examples of
emerging or potential claims and coverage issues include:

·

increases
      in the number and size of claims relating to injuries from medical
      products;

·

the
      effects of accounting and financial reporting scandals and other major
      corporate governance failures, which have resulted in an increase in the
      number and size of claims, including director and officer and errors and
      omissions insurance claims;

·

class
      action litigation relating to claims handling and other
      practices;

·

construction
      defect claims, including claims for a broad range of additional insured
      endorsements on policies;

·

clergy
      abuse claims, including passage of legislation to reopen or extend various
      statutes of limitations; and

·

mass
      tort claims, including bodily injury claims related to silica, welding
      rods, benzene, lead and various other chemical exposure
      claims.

In light of the many uncertainties
associated with establishing the estimates and making the assumptions necessary
to establish reserve levels, CNA reviews and changes its reserve estimates in a
regular and ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are
reported and settled. In addition, CNA periodically undergoes state regulatory
financial examinations, including review and analysis of its reserves. If
estimated reserves are insufficient for any reason, the required increase in
reserves would be recorded as a charge against CNA’s earnings for the period in
which reserves are determined to be insufficient.

Loss
reserves for asbestos and environmental pollution are especially difficult to
estimate and may result in more frequent and larger additions to these
reserves.

CNA’s experience has been that
establishing reserves for casualty coverages relating to A&E claim and claim
adjustment expenses are subject to uncertainties that are greater than those
presented by other claims. Estimating the ultimate cost of both reported and
unreported claims are subject to a higher degree of variability due to a number
of additional factors, including among others:

·

coverage
      issues, including whether certain costs are covered under the policies and
      whether policy limits apply;

·

inconsistent
      court decisions and developing legal
theories;

·

continuing
      aggressive tactics of plaintiffs’
lawyers;

·

the
      risks and lack of predictability inherent in major
    litigation;

·

changes
      in the volume of asbestos and environmental pollution
    claims;


Item
1A.  Risk Factors

·

the
      impact of the exhaustion of primary limits and the resulting increase in
      claims on any umbrella or excess policies CNA has
  issued;

·

the
      number and outcome of direct actions against
  CNA;

·

CNA’s
      ability to recover reinsurance for these claims;
  and

·

changes
      in the legal and legislative environment in which CNA
      operates.

As a result of this higher degree of
variability, CNA has necessarily supplemented traditional actuarial methods and
techniques with additional estimating techniques and methodologies, many of
which involve significant judgment on the part of management. Consequently, CNA
may periodically need to record changes in its claim and claim adjustment
expense reserves in the future in these areas in amounts that could materially
adversely affect our results of operations, equity, business and insurer
financial strength and debt ratings. The sections below provide more details
involving the specific factors affecting CNA’s estimation of reserves for
casualty coverages relating to A&E. Additional information on A&E claims
is included in MD&A under Item 7 and Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included under Item 8.

Environmental pollution
claims.

The estimation of reserves for environmental pollution
claims is complicated by the assertion by many policyholders of claims for
defense costs and indemnification. CNA and others in the insurance industry are
disputing coverage for many such claims. Key coverage issues in these claims
include:

·

whether
      cleanup costs are considered damages under the policies (and accordingly
      whether CNA would be liable for these
costs);

·

the
      trigger of coverage, and the allocation of liability among triggered
      policies;

·

the
      applicability of pollution exclusions and owned property
      exclusions;

·

the
      potential for joint and several liability;
and

·

the
      definition of an occurrence.

To date, courts have been
inconsistent in their rulings on these issues, thus adding to the uncertainty of
the outcome of many of these claims.

Further, the scope of federal and
state statutes and regulations determining liability and insurance coverage for
environmental pollution liabilities have been the subject of extensive
litigation. In many cases, courts have expanded the scope of coverage and
liability for cleanup costs beyond the original intent of CNA’s insurance
policies. In addition, the standards for cleanup in environmental pollution
matters are unclear, the number of sites potentially subject to cleanup under
applicable laws is unknown and the impact of various proposals to reform
existing statutes and regulations is difficult to predict.

Asbestos claims.

The
estimation of reserves for asbestos claims is particularly difficult for many of
the same reasons discussed above for environmental pollution claims, as well
as:

·

inconsistency
      of court decisions and jury attitudes, as well as future court
      decisions;

·

specific
      policy provisions;

·

allocation
      of liability among insurers and
insureds;

·

missing
      policies and proof of coverage;

·

the
      proliferation of bankruptcy proceedings and attendant
      uncertainties;


Item
1A.  Risk Factors

·

novel
      theories asserted by policyholders and their legal
  counsel;

·

the
      targeting of a broader range of businesses and entities as
      defendants;

·

uncertainties
      in predicting the number of future claims and which other insureds may be
      targeted in the future;

·

volatility
      in claim numbers and settlement
demands;

·

increases
      in the number of non-impaired claimants and the extent to which they can
      be precluded from making claims;

·

the
      efforts by insureds to obtain coverage that is not subject to aggregate
      limits;

·

the
      long latency period between asbestos exposure and disease manifestation,
      as well as the resulting potential for involvement of multiple policy
      periods for individual claims;

·

medical
      inflation trends;

·

the
      mix of asbestos-related diseases presented;
and

·

the
      ability to recover reinsurance.

In addition, a number of CNA’s insureds
have asserted that their claims against CNA for insurance are not subject to
aggregate limits on coverage. If these insureds are successful in this regard,
CNA’s potential liability for their claims would be unlimited. Some of these
insureds contend that their asbestos claims fall within the so-called
“non-products” liability coverage within their policies, rather than the
products liability coverage, and that this “non-products” liability coverage is
not subject to any aggregate limit. It is difficult to predict the extent to
which these claims will succeed and, as a result, the ultimate size of these
claims.

Catastrophe
losses are unpredictable.

Catastrophe losses are an inevitable
part of CNA’s business. Various events can cause catastrophe losses, including
hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, explosions, severe winter weather,
and fires, and their frequency and severity are inherently unpredictable. In
addition, longer-term natural catastrophe trends may be changing and new types
of catastrophe losses may be developing due to climate change, a phenomenon
that has been associated with extreme weather events linked to rising
temperatures, and includes effects on global weather patterns, greenhouse gases,
sea, land and air temperatures, sea levels, rain, and snow. For example, in
2005, CNA experienced substantial losses from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and
Wilma. The extent of CNA’s losses from catastrophes is a function of both the
total amount of its insured exposures in the affected areas and the severity of
the events themselves. In addition, as in the case of catastrophe losses
generally, it can take a long time for the ultimate cost to CNA to be finally
determined. As its claim experience develops on a particular catastrophe, CNA
may be required to adjust reserves, or take unfavorable development, to reflect
its revised estimates of the total cost of claims. CNA believes that it could
incur significant catastrophe losses in the future. Please read information on
catastrophe losses included in the MD&A under Item 7 and Note 9 of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

key assumptions used to determine reserves and deferred acquisition costs for
its long term care product offerings could vary significantly from actual
experience.

CNA’s reserves and deferred acquisition
costs for its long term care product offerings are based on certain key
assumptions including morbidity, which is the frequency and severity of illness,
sickness and diseases contracted, policy persistency, which is the percentage of
policies remaining in force, interest rates, and future health care cost trends.
If actual experience differs from these assumptions, the deferred acquisition
asset may not be fully realized and the reserves may not be adequate, requiring
CNA to add to reserves, or take unfavorable development.


Item
1A.  Risk Factors

High
levels of retained overhead expenses associated with business lines in run-off
negatively impact CNA’s operating results.

During the past several years, CNA
ceased offering certain insurance products relating principally to its life,
group and reinsurance segments. Many of these business lines were sold, others
have been placed in run-off and, as a result, revenue has decreased. CNA’s
results of operations have been materially, adversely affected by the high
levels of retained overhead expenses associated with these run-off operations,
and will continue to be so affected if CNA is not successful in eliminating or
reducing these costs.

CNA’s
premium writings and profitability are affected by the availability and cost of
reinsurance.

CNA purchases reinsurance to help
manage its exposure to risk. Under CNA’s reinsurance arrangements, another
insurer assumes a specified portion of CNA’s claim and claim adjustment expenses
in exchange for a specified portion of policy premiums. Market conditions
determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection CNA purchases,
which affects the level of CNA’s business and profitability, as well as the
level and types of risk CNA retains. If CNA is unable to obtain sufficient
reinsurance at a cost CNA deems acceptable, CNA may be unwilling to bear the
increased risk and would reduce the level of CNA’s underwriting commitments.
Please read information on reinsurance included in MD&A under Item 7 and
Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item
8.

CNA
may not be able to collect amounts owed to it by reinsurers.

CNA has significant amounts
recoverable from reinsurers which are reported as receivables in the balance
sheets and estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment
expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves. The ceding of insurance
does not, however, discharge CNA’s primary liability for claims. As a result,
CNA is subject to credit risk relating to its ability to recover amounts due
from reinsurers. Certain of CNA’s reinsurance carriers have experienced
deteriorating financial conditions or have been downgraded by rating agencies.
In addition, reinsurers could dispute amounts which CNA believes are due to it.
If CNA is not able to collect the amounts due to it from reinsurers, its claims
expenses will be higher. Please read information on reinsurance included in the
MD&A under Item 7 and Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included under Item 8.

Rating
agencies may downgrade their ratings for CNA in the future, and thereby
adversely affect CNA’s ability to write insurance at competitive rates or at
all.

Ratings are an important factor in
establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. CNA’s insurance
company subsidiaries, as well as its public debt, are rated by rating agencies,
namely, A.M. Best Company, Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service and Standard
and Poor’s. Ratings reflect the rating agency’s opinions of an insurance
company’s financial strength, capital adequacy, operating performance, strategic
position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and
debtholders.

Due to the intense competitive
environment in which CNA operates, the uncertainty in determining reserves and
the potential for CNA to take material unfavorable development in the future,
and possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating
agencies, the rating agencies may take action to further lower CNA’s ratings in
the future. If CNA’s property and casualty insurance financial strength ratings
were downgraded below current levels, its business and results of operations
could be materially adversely affected. The severity of the impact on our
business is dependent on the level of downgrade and, for certain products, which
rating agency takes the rating action. Among the adverse effects in the event of
such downgrades would be the inability to obtain a material volume of business
from certain major insurance brokers, the inability to sell a material volume of
our insurance products to certain markets, and the required collateralization of
certain future payment obligations or reserves.

In addition, CNA believes that a
lowering of our debt ratings by certain of the rating agencies could result in
an adverse impact on CNA’s ratings, independent of any change in CNA’s
circumstances. CNA has entered into several settlement agreements and assumed
reinsurance contracts that require collateralization of future payment
obligations and assumed reserves if its ratings or other specific criteria fall
below certain thresholds. The ratings triggers are generally more than one level
below CNA’s current ratings. Please read information on our ratings included in
the MD&A under Item 7.


Item
1A.  Risk Factors

CNA
is subject to capital adequacy requirements and, if it does not meet these
requirements, regulatory agencies may restrict or prohibit CNA from operating
its business.

Insurance
companies such as CNA are subject to risk-based capital standards set by state
regulators to help identify companies that merit further regulatory attention.
These standards apply specified risk factors to various asset, premium and
reserve components of CNA’s statutory capital and surplus reported in CNA’s
statutory basis of accounting financial statements. Current rules require
companies to maintain statutory capital and surplus at a specified minimum level
determined using the risk-based capital formula. If CNA does not meet these
minimum requirements, state regulators may restrict or prohibit CNA from
operating its business. If CNA is required to record a material charge against
earnings in connection with a change in estimates or circumstances, CNA may
violate these minimum capital adequacy requirements unless it is able to raise
sufficient additional capital. Examples of events leading CNA to record a
material charge against earnings include impairment of its investments or
unexpectedly poor claims experience.

CNA’s
insurance subsidiaries, upon whom CNA depends for dividends in order to fund its
working capital needs, are limited by state regulators in their ability to pay
dividends.

CNA Financial Corporation is a
holding company and is dependent upon dividends, loans and other sources of cash
from its subsidiaries in order to meet its obligations. Dividend payments,
however, must be approved by the subsidiaries’ domiciliary state departments of
insurance and are generally limited to amounts determined by formula, which
varies by state. The formula for the majority of the states is the greater of
10% of the prior year statutory surplus or the prior year statutory net income,
less the aggregate of all dividends paid during the twelve months prior to the
date of payment. Some states, however, have an additional stipulation that
dividends cannot exceed the prior year’s earned surplus. If CNA is restricted,
by regulatory rule or otherwise, from paying or receiving inter-company
dividends, CNA may not be able to fund its working capital needs and debt
service requirements from available cash. As a result, CNA would need to look to
other sources of capital, which may be more expensive or may not be available at
all.

CNA
received subpoenas, interrogatories and inquiries relating to insurance brokers
and agents, contingent commissions and bidding practices, and certain
finite-risk insurance products.

Along with other companies in the
industry, CNA has received subpoenas, interrogatories and inquiries from and
have produced documents and/or provided information to: (i) California,
Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, New
Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, West
Virginia and the Canadian Council of Insurance Regulators concerning
investigations into practices including contingent compensation arrangements,
fictitious quotes, and tying arrangements; (ii) the SEC, the New York State
Attorney General, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New
York, the Connecticut Attorney General, the Connecticut Department of Insurance,
the Delaware Department of Insurance, the Georgia Office of Insurance and Safety
Fire Commissioner and the California Department of Insurance concerning
reinsurance products and finite insurance products purchased and sold by CNA;
(iii) the Massachusetts Attorney General and the Connecticut Attorney General
concerning investigations into anti-competitive practices; and (iv) the New York
State Attorney General concerning declinations of attorney malpractice
insurance.

The SEC and representatives of the
United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York conducted
interviews with several of CNA’s current and former executives relating to the
restatement of its financial results for 2004, including CNA’s relationship with
and accounting for transactions with an affiliate that were the basis for the
restatement. CNA has also provided the SEC with information relating to our
restatement in 2006 of prior period results. It is possible that CNA’s analyses
of, or accounting treatment for, finite reinsurance contracts or discontinued
operations could be questioned or disputed by regulatory
authorities.

CNA’s
investment portfolio, which is a key component of its overall profitability, may
suffer reduced returns or losses, in the event of changing interest rates or
adverse credit conditions in the capital markets.

Investment returns are an important
part of CNA’s overall profitability. General economic conditions, changes in
financial markets such as fluctuations in interest rates, long term periods of
low interest rates, credit conditions and currency, commodity and stock prices,
including the short and long term effects of losses produced or threatened in
relation to sub-prime residential mortgage backed securities, and many other
factors beyond CNA’s control can adversely affect the returns and the overall
value of its investments and the realization of investment income. In
addition,


Item
1A.  Risk Factors

any
defaults in the payments due to CNA for its investments, especially with respect
to fixed maturity securities, could reduce CNA’s investment income and could
cause CNA to incur investment losses. Further, CNA invests a portion of its
assets in equity securities and limited partnerships, which may be subject to
greater volatility than its fixed income investments. In some cases, these
limited partnerships use leverage and are thereby subject to even greater
volatility. Although limited partnership investments generally provide higher
expected return, they present greater risk and are more illiquid than CNA’s
fixed income investments. As a result of all of these factors, CNA may not
realize an adequate return on its investments, may incur losses on sales of its
investments, and may be required to write down the value of its
investments.

CNA
has incurred and may incur further investment losses and may incur underwriting
losses, relating to the sub-prime crisis and the related credit
crisis.

CNA faces sub-prime valuation and
credit exposure risks within its investment portfolio through its holdings in
corporate asset-backed structured securities and collateralized mortgage
obligations (“CMOs”) which are typically collateralized with residential
mortgages. During the course of 2007, the market value of some of these
securities decreased as a result of the increase in delinquency rates on the
underlying mortgages and a decrease in the value of the homes held as collateral
for the investment. This deterioration of the collateral underlying the
securities caused downgrades by rating agencies, decreased liquidity, and led to
some securities going into default and has led to a material adverse impact on
financial markets generally. The potential for higher delinquency and default
rates may continue to adversely impact CNA’s sub-prime market valuations. In
addition, the process of validating fair values provided by third parties for
securities that are not regularly traded requires significant judgment on CNA’s
part. Accordingly, CNA may conclude that other-than-temporary write downs of
these securities are required or may experience unanticipated losses in other
sectors of its overall investment portfolio.

CNA provides management and
professional liability insurance and surety bonds to businesses engaged in
finance, professional services and real estate. Many of these businesses have
exposure directly or indirectly relating to the sub-prime crisis and the related
credit crisis. As a result, CNA may experience unanticipated underwriting losses
with respect to these lines of business.

CNA
may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty
business.

The property and casualty market is
cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of
price competition, less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low
premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition,
more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium
rates.

Risks
Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, Lorillard, Inc.

Lorillard
is a defendant in approximately 3,775 tobacco-related lawsuits, which are
extremely costly to defend, and which could result in substantial judgments
against Lorillard.

Numerous legal actions, proceedings and
claims arising out of the sale, distribution, manufacture, development,
advertising, marketing and claimed health effects of cigarettes are pending
against Lorillard, and it is likely that similar claims will continue to be
filed for the foreseeable future. In addition, several cases have been filed
against Lorillard and other tobacco companies challenging certain provisions of
the MSA and state statutes promulgated to carry out and enforce the
MSA.

Approximately 3,775 tobacco-related
cases are pending against Lorillard in the United States. Punitive damages,
often in amounts ranging into the billions of dollars, are specifically pleaded
in a number of cases in addition to compensatory and other damages. It is
possible that the outcome of these cases, individually or in the aggregate,
could result in bankruptcy. It is also possible that Lorillard may be unable to
post a surety bond in an amount sufficient to stay execution of a judgment in
jurisdictions that require such bond pending an appeal on the merits of the
case. Even if Lorillard is successful in defending some or all of these actions,
these types of cases are very expensive to defend. A material increase in the
number of pending claims could significantly increase defense
costs.

Further, adverse decisions in actions
against tobacco companies other than Lorillard could have an adverse impact on
the industry, including Lorillard. In several cases in recent years, for
example, various courts, including the U.S.


Item
1A.  Risk Factors

Supreme
Court, have considered the ratio of awards of actual damages to those of
punitive damages. In 2006, the Oregon Supreme Court affirmed the verdict in

Williams v. Philip Morris USA,
Inc

., in which plaintiff was awarded approximately $525,000 in
compensatory damages and $80 million in punitive damages, a ratio of more than
150:1. In February of 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court vacated that decision on
other grounds and returned

Williams

to the Oregon
Supreme Court for further consideration. During January of 2008, the Oregon
Supreme Court reaffirmed its 2006 ruling that upheld the jury’s damages awards.
Lorillard is not a party to

Williams

. Should appellate
courts establish binding precedents regarding these or other issues, the conduct
of future trials including Lorillard would be affected. Please read information
included in MD&A under Item 7 and Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated

A
judgment has been rendered against Lorillard in the Scott
litigation.

In June of 2004, the court entered a
final judgment in favor of the plaintiffs in

Scott v. The American Tobacco
Company, et al.

(District Court, Orleans Parish, Louisiana, filed May 24,
1996), a class action on behalf of certain cigarette smokers resident in the
State of Louisiana. The jury awarded plaintiffs approximately $591 million to
fund cessation programs for Louisiana smokers. The court’s final judgment also
reflected its award of prejudgment interest. During February of 2007, the
Louisiana Court of Appeal issued a ruling that, among other things, reduced the
amount of the award by approximately $328 million; struck the award of
prejudgment interest, which totaled approximately $440 million as of December
31, 2006; and ruled that the only class members who are eligible to participate
in the smoking cessation program are those who began smoking by September 1,
1988, and whose claims accrued by September 1, 1988. The Louisiana Court of
Appeal has returned the case to the trial court for further proceedings. During
January of 2008, the Louisiana Supreme Court denied plaintiffs’ and defendants’
separate petitions for review. Lorillard’s share of any judgment has not been
determined. It is possible that post-judgment interest could be assessed on any
award to the class that survives appeal. In the fourth quarter of 2007,
Lorillard recorded a pretax provision of approximately $66 million for this
matter. It is possible that the parties will seek further review of this
decision. For additional information on the

Scott

case, please read Note
21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this
report.

The
verdict returned in the federal government’s reimbursement case, while not
final, could impose significant financial burdens on Lorillard and adversely
affect future sales and profits.

During August of 2006, a final
judgment and remedial order was entered in

United States of America v. Philip
Morris USA, Inc., et al.

(U.S. District Court, District of Columbia,
filed September 22, 1999). The court based its final judgment and remedial order
on the government’s only remaining claims, which were based on the defendants’
alleged violations of the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act
(“RICO”). Lorillard is one of the defendants in the case. Although the verdict
did not award monetary damages to the plaintiff, the final judgment and remedial
order granted equitable relief and imposes a number of requirements on the
defendants. Such requirements include, but are not limited to, corrective
statements by defendants related to the health effects of smoking. The remedial
order also would place certain prohibitions on the manner in which defendants
market their cigarette products and would eliminate any use of “lights” or
similar product descriptors. It is likely that the remedial order, including the
prohibitions on the use of the descriptors relating to low tar cigarettes, will
negatively affect Lorillard’s future sales and profits. Defendants, including
Lorillard, have noticed appeals from the final judgment and the remedial order.
Plaintiff also has noticed an appeal from the final judgment. Defendants have
received a stay of the judgment and remedial order from the District of Columbia
Court of Appeal that will remain in effect while the appeal is proceeding. As a
result of the government’s appeal, it is possible that certain of the
government’s claims or damages could be reinstated. While trial was underway,
the District of Columbia Court of Appeals ruled that plaintiff may not seek
disgorgement of profits, but this appeal was interlocutory in nature and could
be reconsidered in the present appeal. Prior to trial, the government had
estimated that it was entitled to approximately $280.0 billion from the
defendants for its disgorgement of profits claim. In addition, the government
sought during trial more than $10.0 billion for the creation of nationwide
smoking cessation, public education and counter-marketing programs. In its 2006
verdict, the trial court declined to award such relief. It is possible that
these claims could be reinstated on appeal. Please read Note 21 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for detailed
information regarding tobacco litigation.

Lorillard
is a defendant in a case that has been certified as a nationwide class action
involving “lights” cigarettes and that could result in a substantial
verdict.

Schwab v. Philip Morris USA, Inc.,
et al.

(U.S. District Court, Eastern District, New York, filed May 11,
2004), has been certified by a federal judge as a nationwide class action on
behalf of individuals who purchased “lights” cigarettes. Plaintiffs’ claims in

Schwab

are based on
defendants’ alleged RICO violations in the manufacture, marketing and sale of
“lights” cigarettes. Plaintiffs have estimated damages to the class to be in the
hundreds of billions of dollars. Any damages awarded to the plaintiffs based on
defendants’ violation of the RICO statute would be trebled. The federal court of
appeals has agreed to review the class certification order, and it has stayed
all activity before the trial court until the appeal is concluded. Please read
Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of
this Report for detailed information regarding tobacco litigation.

The
Florida Supreme Court’s ruling in Engle has resulted in additional litigation
against cigarette manufacturers, including Lorillard.

The case of

Engle v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,
et al.

(Circuit Court, Dade County, Florida, filed May 5, 1994) was
certified as a class action on behalf of Florida residents, and survivors of
Florida residents, who were injured or died from medical conditions allegedly
caused by addiction to smoking. The case was tried between 1998-2000 in a
multi-phase trial that resulted in verdicts in favor of the class. During 2006,
the Florida Supreme Court issued a ruling that, among other things determined
that the case could not proceed further as a class action. During February 2008,
the trial court entered an order on remand from the Florida Supreme Court that
formally decertified the class.

The 2006 ruling by the Florida
Supreme Court in

Engle

also permits members of the

Engle

class to file
individual claims, including claims for punitive damages. Lorillard refers to
these cases as the

Engle

Progeny Cases. The
Florida Supreme Court held that these individual plaintiffs are entitled to rely
on a number of the jury’s findings in favor of the plaintiffs in the first phase
of the

Engle

trial.
These findings included that smoking cigarettes causes a number of diseases;
that cigarettes are addictive or dependence-producing; and that the defendants,
including Lorillard, were negligent, breached express and implied warranties,
placed cigarettes on the market that were defective and unreasonably dangerous,
and concealed or conspired to conceal the risks of smoking. Lorillard is a
defendant in approximately 1,050 cases filed by members of the

Engle

class. These 1,050
cases are on behalf of approximately 3,000 individual plaintiffs. These cases
are pending in various Florida courts. The period for filing the

Engle

Progeny Cases expired
during January 2008, but Florida law permits plaintiffs 120 days after a suit
has been initiated to effect service. As a result, the final number of

The
U.S. Surgeon General has issued a report regarding the risks of cigarette
smoking to non-smokers that could result in additional litigation against
cigarette manufacturers, additional restrictions placed on the use of
cigarettes, and additional regulations placed on the manufacture or sale of
cigarettes.

In a report entitled “The Health
Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke: A Report of the Surgeon
General, 2006,” the U.S. Surgeon General summarized conclusions from previous
Surgeon General’s reports concerning the health effects of exposure to
second-hand smoke by non-smokers. According to this report, scientific evidence
now supports six major conclusions:

·

Second-hand
      smoke causes premature death and disease in children and in adults who do
      not smoke.

·

Children
      exposed to second-hand smoke are at an increased risk for sudden infant
      death syndrome, acute respiratory infections and ear
    problems.

·

Exposure
      of adults to second-hand smoke has immediate adverse effects on the
      cardiovascular system and causes heart disease and lung
      cancer.

·

The
      scientific evidence indicates that there is no risk-free level of exposure
      to second-hand smoke.

·

Many
      millions of Americans, both children and adults, are exposed to
      second-hand smoke in their homes and
workplaces.


Item
1A.  Risk Factors

·

Eliminating
      smoking in indoor spaces fully protects non-smokers from exposure to
      second-hand smoke. Separating smokers from non-smokers, cleaning the air,
      and ventilating buildings cannot eliminate exposures of non-smokers to
      second-hand smoke.

This report could form the basis of
additional litigation against cigarette manufacturers, including Lorillard. The
report could be used to support existing litigation against Lorillard or other
cigarette manufacturers. It also is possible that the Surgeon General’s report
could result in additional restrictions placed on cigarette smoking or in
additional regulations placed on the manufacture or sale of cigarettes. It is
possible that such additional restrictions or regulations could result in a
decrease in cigarette sales in the United States, including sales of Lorillard
brands. These developments may have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

Lorillard
has substantial payment obligations under litigation settlement agreements which
will materially adversely affect its cash flows and operating income in future
periods.

In 1998, Lorillard, Philip Morris
Incorporated, Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation and R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Company (the “Original Participating Manufacturers”) entered into the
Master Settlement Agreement (the “MSA”) with 46 states and various other
governments and jurisdictions to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost
recovery and other claims.

Under the State Settlement
Agreements, Lorillard paid $945 million in 2007 and is obligated to pay
approximately $1,050 million to $1,100 million in 2008, primarily based on 2007
estimated industry volume. Annual payments under the State Settlement Agreements
are required to be paid in perpetuity and are based, among other things, on
Lorillard’s domestic market share and unit volume of domestic shipments in the
year preceding the year in which payment is due. Please read Note 21 to the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 for additional
information regarding the State Settlement Agreements.

Concerns
that mentholated cigarettes may pose greater health risks could adversely affect
Lorillard.

Some plaintiffs and other sources,
including among others, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, have
claimed that mentholated cigarettes may pose greater health risks than
non-mentholated cigarettes. If such claims were to be substantiated, Lorillard,
as the leading manufacturer of mentholated cigarettes in the United States,
could face increased exposure to tobacco-related litigation. Even if those
claims are not substantiated, increased concerns about the health impact of
mentholated cigarettes could adversely affect Lorillard’s sales, including sales
of Newport. Some critics of mentholated cigarettes have called for a ban on the
use of menthol in cigarettes. Any ban or limitation on the use of menthol in
cigarettes would adversely effect our results of operation and financial
condition.

Lorillard
is subject to important limitations on advertising and marketing cigarettes that
could harm its competitive position.

Television and radio advertisements
of tobacco products have been prohibited since 1971. Under the State Settlement
Agreements, Lorillard generally cannot use billboard advertising, cartoon
characters, sponsorship of concerts, non-tobacco merchandise bearing its brand
names and various other advertising and marketing techniques. In addition, the
MSA prohibits the targeting of youth in advertising, promotion or marketing of
tobacco products. Accordingly, Lorillard has determined not to advertise its
cigarettes in magazines with large readership among people under the age of 18.
Additional restrictions may be imposed or agreed to in the future. These
limitations may make it difficult to maintain the value of an existing brand if
sales or market share decline for any reason. Moreover, these limitations
significantly impair the ability of cigarette manufacturers, including
Lorillard, to launch new premium brands.

Sales
of cigarettes are subject to substantial federal, state and local excise
taxes.

Federal excise taxes were last increased
in 2002 from $0.34 per pack to $0.39 per pack. A provision in a bill passed by
Congress in 2007 to expand the Children’s Health Insurance Program would have
raised the federal excise tax by $0.61 per pack, but that bill was vetoed by
President Bush in December of 2007 and was not enacted into law. It is expected
that an increase in Federal excise taxes will be introduced by Congress again in
2008. State and local excise taxes ranged from $0.07 to $3.66 per pack in 2007.
Various states and localities have raised the excise tax on cigarettes
substantially


Item
1A.  Risk Factors

in recent
years. It is Lorillard’s expectation that several states will propose further
increases in 2008 and in subsequent years. Lorillard believes that increases in
excise and similar taxes have had an adverse impact on sales of cigarettes and
that future increases, the extent of which cannot be predicted, could result in
further volume declines for the cigarette industry, including Lorillard, and an
increased sales shift toward lower priced discount cigarettes rather than
premium brands.

Lorillard
is dependent on the domestic cigarette business, which it expects to continue to
contract.

Lorillard’s domestic cigarette
business is currently its only significant business. The domestic cigarette
market has generally been contracting and Lorillard expects it to continue to
contract. Lorillard does not have foreign cigarette sales that could offset
these effects, as Lorillard sold the international rights to substantially all
of its brands, including Newport, in 1977. As a result of price increases,
restrictions on advertising and promotions, increases in regulation and excise
taxes, health concerns, a decline in the social acceptability of smoking,
increased pressure from anti-tobacco groups and other factors, domestic
cigarette shipments have decreased at a compound annual rate of approximately
2.5% during the period 1998 through 2007, as measured by Management Science
Associates, Inc. (“MSAI”). Domestic U.S. cigarette industry shipments decreased
by 5.0% during 2007, as compared to 2006, and 1.5% for 2006, as compared to
2005, according to information provided by MSAI.

Lorillard
derives most of its revenue from one brand.

Lorillard’s largest selling brand,
Newport, accounted for approximately 93.9% of Lorillard’s sales revenue in 2007.
Lorillard’s principal strategic plan revolves around the marketing and sales
promotion in support of its Newport brand. Lorillard cannot ensure that it will
continue to successfully implement its strategic plan with respect to Newport or
that implementation of its strategic plan will result in the maintenance or
growth of the Newport brand.

The
use of significant amounts of promotion expenses and sales incentives in
response to competitive actions and market price sensitivity may have a material
adverse impact on Lorillard.

Since 1998, the cigarette market has
been very price competitive due to the impact of, among other things, higher
state and local excise taxes and the market share of deep discount brands. In
response to these and other competitor actions and pricing pressures, Lorillard
has engaged in significant use of promotional expenses and sales incentives. The
cost of these measures could have a material adverse impact on Lorillard.
Lorillard regularly reviews the results of its promotional spending activities
and adjusts its promotional spending programs in an effort to maintain its
competitive position. Accordingly, unit sales volume and sales promotion costs
in any period are not necessarily indicative of sales and costs that may be
realized in subsequent periods.

Several
of Lorillard’s competitors have developed alternative cigarette
products.

Certain of the major cigarette makers
are marketing alternative cigarette products. For example, Philip Morris has
developed an alternative cigarette called Accord in which the tobacco is heated
rather than burned. RAI has developed an alternative cigarette called Eclipse in
which the tobacco is primarily heated, with only a small amount of tobacco
burned. Vector Tobacco Inc. is marketing a cigarette offered in several packings
with declining levels of nicotine, called Quest. Philip Morris and RAI have
indicated that these products may deliver fewer smoke components as compared to
conventional cigarettes. Lorillard has not marketed similar alternative
cigarettes. Should such alternative cigarette products gain a significant share
of the domestic cigarette market, Lorillard may be at a competitive
disadvantage.

Lorillard
may not be able to develop, produce or commercialize competitive new products
and technologies required by regulatory changes or changes in consumer
preferences.

Consumer health concerns and changes
in regulations are likely to require Lorillard to introduce new products or make
substantial changes to existing products. For example, 22 states have enacted
legislation requiring cigarette manufacturers to reduce the ignition propensity
of their products. Lorillard believes that there may be increasing pressure from
public health authorities to develop a conventional cigarette or an alternative
cigarette that provides a demonstrable reduced risk of adverse health effects.
Lorillard may not be able to develop a reduced risk product that is acceptable
to consumers. In addition, the costs associated with developing any such new
products and technologies could be substantial.


Item
1A.  Risk Factors

The
availability of counterfeit cigarettes could adversely affect Lorillard’s
sales.

Sales of counterfeit cigarettes in
the United States, including counterfeits of Lorillard’s Newport brand, could
adversely impact sales by the manufacturers of the brands that are counterfeited
and potentially damage the value and reputation of those brands. The
availability of counterfeit Newport cigarettes could have a material adverse
effect on Lorillard’s sales volumes, revenue and profits.

Lorillard
relies on a single manufacturing facility for the production of its
cigarettes.

Lorillard produces all of its
cigarettes at its Greensboro, North Carolina manufacturing facility. If
Lorillard’s manufacturing plant is damaged, destroyed or incapacitated or
Lorillard is otherwise unable to operate its manufacturing facility, Lorillard
may be unable to produce cigarettes and may be unable to meet customer
demand.

Lorillard
relies on a small number of suppliers for certain of its tobacco
leaf.

Lorillard purchases more than 90% of
its domestic leaf tobacco from one supplier, Alliance One International, Inc. In
addition, Lorillard purchases all of its reconstituted tobacco from one
supplier, which is an affiliate of RAI, a major competitor of Lorillard. If
either of these suppliers becomes unwilling or unable to supply Lorillard and
Lorillard is unable to find an alternative supplier on a timely basis,
Lorillard’s operations could be disrupted resulting in lower production levels
and reduced sales.

Diamond
Offshore’s business depends on the level of activity in the oil and gas
industry, which is significantly affected by volatile oil and gas
prices.

Diamond Offshore’s business depends
on the level of activity in offshore oil and gas exploration, development and
production in markets worldwide. Worldwide demand for oil and gas, oil and gas
prices, market expectations of potential changes in these prices and a variety
of political and economic factors significantly affect this level of activity.
However, higher commodity demand and prices do not necessarily translate into
increased drilling activity since Diamond Offshore’s customers’ expectations of
future commodity demand and prices typically drive demand for Diamond Offshore’s
rigs. Oil and gas prices are extremely volatile and are affected by numerous
factors beyond Diamond Offshore’s control, including:

·

worldwide
      demand for oil and gas;

·

the
      ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, commonly
      called OPEC, to set and maintain production levels and
      pricing;

·

the
      level of production in non-OPEC
countries;

·

the
      worldwide political and military environment, including uncertainty or
      instability resulting from an escalation or additional outbreak of armed
      hostilities in the Middle East, other oil-producing regions or other
      geographic areas, further acts of terrorism in the United States or
      elsewhere;

·

the
      worldwide economic environment or economic trends, such as
      recessions;

·

the
      cost of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and
    gas;

·

the
      discovery rate of new oil and gas
reserves;

Diamond
Offshore’s industry is cyclical.

Diamond Offshore’s industry has
historically been cyclical. There have been periods of high demand, short rig
supply and high dayrates (such as Diamond Offshore is currently experiencing in
virtually all of the markets in which it operates), followed by periods of lower
demand, excess rig supply and low dayrates. Periods of excess rig supply
intensify the competition in the industry and often result in rigs being idle
for long periods of time.

Growing worldwide demand for crude
oil and natural gas has caused current oil and natural gas prices to rise
significantly above historical averages, which has generally resulted in higher
utilization and dayrates earned by Diamond Offshore’s drilling units, generally
since the third quarter of 2004. However, Diamond Offshore can provide no
assurance that the current industry cycle of high demand, short rig supply and
higher dayrates will continue. Diamond Offshore may be required to idle rigs or
to enter into lower rate contracts in response to market conditions in the
future.

Prolonged periods of low utilization
and dayrates could also result in the recognition of impairment charges on
certain of Diamond Offshore’s drilling rigs if future cash flow estimates, based
upon information available to management at the time, indicate that the carrying
value of these rigs may not be recoverable.

Failure
to obtain and retain highly skilled personnel could hurt Diamond Offshore’s
operations.

Diamond Offshore requires highly skilled
personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for Diamond
Offshore’s business. To the extent that demand for drilling services and the
size of the worldwide industry fleet increase (including the impact of newly
constructed rigs), shortages of qualified personnel could arise, creating upward
pressure on wages and difficulty in staffing and servicing its rigs, which could
adversely affect Diamond Offshore’s results of operations. In addition, the
entrance of new participants into the offshore drilling market would cause
further competition for qualified and experienced personnel as these entities
seek to hire personnel with expertise in the offshore drilling
industry.

Diamond Offshore has experienced and
continues to experience upward pressure on salaries and wages and increased
competition for skilled workers as a result of the strengthening offshore
drilling market. Diamond Offshore has also sustained the loss of experienced
personnel to its competitors and its customers. In response to these market
conditions Diamond Offshore has implemented retention programs, including
increases in compensation. The heightened competition for skilled personnel
could adversely impact Diamond Offshore’s financial position, results of
operations and cash flows by limiting operations or further increasing
costs.

The
terms of some of Diamond Offshore’s dayrate drilling contracts may limit its
ability to benefit from increasing dayrates in an improving market.

The duration of offshore drilling
contracts is generally determined by customer requirements and, to a lesser
extent, the respective management strategies of the offshore drilling
contractors. In periods of rising demand for offshore rigs, contractors
typically prefer shorter contracts that allow them to more quickly profit from
increasing dayrates. In contrast, during these periods customers with reasonably
definite drilling programs typically prefer longer term contracts to maintain
dayrate prices at a consistent level. Conversely, in periods of decreasing
demand for offshore rigs, contractors generally prefer longer term contracts to
preserve dayrates at existing levels and ensure utilization, while customers
prefer shorter contracts that allow them to more quickly obtain the benefit of
lower dayrates.


Item
1A.  Risk Factors

Typically, as a period of high dayrates
and utilization lengthens, customers who perceive a continuing long term need
for equipment begin to seek increasingly long-term contracts, but often at flat
or slightly lower dayrates in exchange for the term length. To the extent
possible within the scope of Diamond Offshore’s customer’s requirements, Diamond
Offshore seeks to have a foundation of these long-term contracts with a
reasonable balance of shorter-term exposure to the spot market in an attempt to
maintain upside potential while endeavoring to limit the downside impact of a
potential decline in the market. However, Diamond Offshore can provide no
assurance that it will be able to achieve or maintain such a balance from time
to time. Diamond Offshore’s inability to fully benefit from increasing dayrates
in an improving market, due to the long-term nature of some of its contracts,
may adversely affect profitability.

The
majority of Diamond Offshore’s contracts for its drilling units are generally
fixed dayrate contracts, and increases in Diamond Offshore’s operating costs
could adversely affect the profitability of those contracts.

Diamond Offshore’s contracts for its
drilling units provide for the payment of a fixed dayrate per rig operating day,
although some contracts do provide for a limited escalation in dayrate due to
increased operating costs incurred. Many of Diamond Offshore’s operating costs,
such as labor costs, are unpredictable and fluctuate based on events beyond
Diamond Offshore’s control. The gross margin that Diamond Offshore realizes on
these fixed dayrate contracts will fluctuate based on variations in Diamond
Offshore’s operating costs over the terms of the contracts. In addition, for
contracts with dayrate escalation clauses, Diamond Offshore may be unable to
recover increased or unforeseen costs from its customers.

Diamond
Offshore’s drilling contracts may be terminated due to events beyond Diamond
Offshore’s control.

Diamond Offshore’s customers may
terminate some of their drilling contracts if the drilling unit is destroyed or
lost or if drilling operations are suspended for a specified period of time as a
result of a breakdown of major equipment or, in some cases, due to other events
beyond the control of either party. In addition, some of Diamond Offshore’s
drilling contracts permit the customer to terminate the contract after specified
notice periods by tendering contractually specified termination amounts. These
termination payments may not fully compensate Diamond Offshore for the loss of a
contract. In addition, the early termination of a contract may result in a rig
being idle for an extended period of time. During depressed market conditions,
Diamond Offshore’s customers may also seek renegotiation of firm drilling
contracts to reduce their obligations.

Diamond
Offshore can provide no assurance that Diamond Offshore’s current backlog of
contract drilling revenue will be ultimately realized.

As of the date of this report,
Diamond Offshore’s contract drilling backlog was approximately $11 billion for
expected future work extending, in some cases, until 2015, which includes future
earnings under both firm commitments and, in a few instances, anticipated
commitments for which definitive agreements have not yet been executed. Diamond
Offshore can provide no assurance that Diamond Offshore will be able to perform
under these contracts due to events beyond Diamond Offshore’s control or that
Diamond Offshore will be able to ultimately execute a definitive agreement where
one does not currently exist. Diamond Offshore’s inability to perform under our
contractual obligations or to execute definitive agreements may have a material
adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations- Diamond Offshore” included in Item 7 of this report.

Rig
conversions, upgrades or new builds may be subject to delays and cost
overruns.

From time to time, Diamond Offshore
may undertake to add new capacity through conversions or upgrades to rigs or
through new construction. Diamond Offshore is currently upgrading one of its
drilling units, the

Ocean
Monarch

, to ultra-deepwater capability at an estimated aggregate cost of
$305 million. Diamond Offshore expects delivery of the upgraded

Ocean Monarch

during the
fourth quarter of 2008. Diamond Offshore also has entered into agreements to
construct two new jack-up drilling units with delivery expected in the second
quarter of 2008 at an aggregate cost of approximately $320 million, including
drillpipe and capitalized interest. These projects and other projects of this
type are subject to risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large
construction project resulting from numerous factors, including the
following:


Item
1A.  Risk Factors

·

shortages
      of equipment, materials or skilled
labor;

·

work
      stoppages;

·

unscheduled
      delays in the delivery of ordered materials and
  equipment;

·

unanticipated
      cost increases;

·

weather
      interferences;

·

difficulties
      in obtaining necessary permits or in meeting permit
      conditions;

·

design
      and engineering problems;

·

customer
      acceptance delays;

·

shipyard
      failures or unavailablity; and

·

failure
      or delay of third party service providers and labor
    disputes.

Failure to complete a rig upgrade or
new construction on time, or failure to complete a rig conversion or new
construction in accordance with its design specifications may, in some
circumstances, result in the delay, renegotiation or cancellation of a drilling
contract, resulting in a loss of revenue to Diamond Offshore. If a drilling
contract is terminated under these circumstances, Diamond Offshore may not be
able to secure replacement contract on as favorable terms.

Diamond
Offshore’s business involves numerous operating hazards and Diamond Offshore is
not fully insured against all of them.

Diamond Offshore’s operations are
subject to the usual hazards inherent in drilling for oil and gas offshore, such
as blowouts, reservoir damage, loss of production, loss of well control,
punchthroughs, craterings and natural disasters such as hurricanes or fires. The
occurrence of these events could result in the suspension of drilling
operations, damage to or destruction of the equipment involved and injury or
death to rig personnel, damage to producing or potentially productive oil and
gas formations and environmental damage. Operations also may be suspended
because of machinery breakdowns, abnormal drilling conditions, failure of
subcontractors to perform or supply goods or services or personnel shortages. In
addition, offshore drilling operators are subject to perils peculiar to marine
operations, including capsizing, grounding, collision and loss or damage from
severe weather. Damage to the environment could also result from our operations,
particularly through oil spillage or extensive uncontrolled fires. Diamond
Offshore may also be subject to damage claims by oil and gas companies or other
parties.

Pollution and environmental risks
generally are not fully insurable, and Diamond Offshore does not typically
retain loss-of-hire insurance policies to cover its rigs. Diamond Offshore’s
insurance policies and contractual rights to indemnity may not adequately cover
its losses, or may have exclusions of coverage for some losses. Diamond Offshore
does not have insurance coverage or rights to indemnity for all risks,
including, among other things, liability risk for certain amounts of excess
coverage

and
certain physical damage risk. If a significant accident or other event occurs
and is not fully covered by insurance or contractual indemnity, it could
adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
There can be no assurance that Diamond Offshore will continue to carry the
insurance it currently maintains or that those parties with contractual
obligations to indemnify Diamond Offshore will necessarily be financially able
to indemnify it against all these risks. In addition, no assurance can be made
that Diamond Offshore will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future
at rates it considers to be reasonable or that it will be able to obtain
insurance against some risks.

Diamond
Offshore is self-insured for a portion of physical damage to rigs and equipment
caused by named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.

For physical damage due to named
windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, as of the date of this report Diamond
Offshore’s deductible is $75 million per occurrence (or lower for some rigs if
they are declared a constructive total loss)


Item
1A.  Risk Factors

with an
annual aggregate limit of $125 million. Accordingly, Diamond Offshore’s
insurance coverage for all physical damage to its rigs and equipment caused by
named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for the policy period ending April
30, 2008 is limited to $125 million. If named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of
Mexico cause significant damage to Diamond Offshore’s rigs or equipment, it
could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of
operations and cash flows.

Diamond
Offshore’s international operations involve additional risks not associated with
domestic operations.

Diamond Offshore operates in various
regions throughout the world that may expose it to political and other
uncertainties, including risks of:

·

terrorist
      acts, war and civil disturbances;

·

piracy
      or assaults on property or
personnel;

·

kidnapping
      of personnel;

·

expropriation
      of property or equipment;

·

renegotiation
      or nullification of existing
contracts;

·

changing
      political conditions;

·

foreign
      and domestic monetary policies;

·

the
      inability to repatriate income or
capital;

·

regulatory
      or financial requirements to comply with foreign bureaucratic
      actions;

·

travel
      limitations or operational problems caused by public health threats;
      and

·

changing
      taxation policies.

In addition, international contract
drilling operations are subject to various laws and regulations in countries in
which Diamond Offshore operates, including laws and regulations relating
to:

·

the
      equipping and operation of drilling
units;

·

repatriation
      of foreign earnings;

·

oil
      and gas exploration and
development;

·

taxation
      of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel;
    and

·

use
      and compensation of local employees and suppliers by foreign
      contractors.

Some foreign governments favor or
effectively require the awarding of drilling contracts to local contractors,
require use of a local agent or require foreign contractors to employ citizens
of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. These practices may
adversely affect Diamond Offshore’s ability to compete in those regions. It is
difficult to predict what governmental regulations may be enacted in the future
that could adversely affect the international drilling industry. The actions of
foreign governments, including initiatives by OPEC, may adversely affect Diamond
Offshore’s ability to compete.


Item
1A.  Risk Factors

Diamond
Offshore’s drilling contracts offshore Mexico expose it to greater risks than
they normally assume.

As of the date of this report,
Diamond Offshore has three intermediate semisubmersible rigs and two jack-up
rigs drilling offshore Mexico for PEMEX - Exploracion Y Produccion (“PEMEX”),
the national oil company of Mexico. The terms of these contracts expose Diamond
Offshore to greater risks than they normally assume, such as exposure to greater
environmental liability, and can be terminated by PEMEX on short term notice,
contractually or by statute, subject to certain conditions. While Diamond
Offshore believes that the financial terms of these contracts and its operating
safeguards in place mitigate these risks, Diamond Offshore can provide no
assurance that the increased risk exposure will not have a negative impact on
our future operations or financial results.

Fluctuations
in exchange rates and nonconvertibility of currencies could result in
losses.

Due to Diamond Offshore’s
international operations, Diamond Offshore may experience currency exchange
losses where revenues are received and expenses are paid in nonconvertible
currencies or where it does not hedge an exposure to a foreign currency. Diamond
Offshore may also incur losses as a result of an inability to collect revenues
because of a shortage of convertible currency available to the country of
operation, controls over currency exchange or controls over the repatriation of
income or capital. Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance that financial
hedging arrangements will effectively hedge any foreign currency fluctuation
losses that may arise.

Diamond
Offshore may be required to accrue additional tax liability on certain of its
foreign earnings.

Certain of Diamond Offshore’s
international rigs are owned and operated, directly or indirectly, by Diamond
Offshore International Limited, a wholly-owned Cayman Islands subsidiary. Since
forming this subsidiary it has been Diamond Offshore’s intention to indefinitely
reinvest the earnings of this subsidiary to finance foreign operations. During
2007, this subsidiary made a non-recurring distribution to its U.S. parent
company, and Diamond Offshore recognized U.S. federal income tax expense on the
portion of the distribution that consisted of earnings of the subsidiary that
had not previously been subjected to U.S. federal income tax. As of December 31,
2007, the amount of previously untaxed earnings of this subsidiary was zero.
Notwithstanding the non-recurring distribution made in December 2007, it remains
Diamond Offshore’s intention to indefinitely reinvest the future earnings of the
subsidiary to finance foreign activities. Diamond Offshore does not expect to
provide for U.S. taxes on any future earnings generated by the subsidiary,
except to the extent that these earnings are immediately subjected to U.S.
federal income tax. Should a future distribution be made from any unremitted
earnings of Diamond Offshore’s subsidiary, it may be required to record
additional U.S. income taxes that, if material, could have an adverse effect on
Diamond Offshore’s financial position, results of operations and cash
flows.

Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, HighMount Exploration & Production
LLC

HighMount
may not be able to replace reserves and sustain production at current levels.
Replacing reserves is risky and uncertain and requires significant capital
expenditures.

HighMount’s future success depends
largely upon its ability to find, develop or acquire additional reserves that
are economically recoverable. Unless HighMount replaces the reserves
produce

d

through successful development, exploration or acquisition, its proved
reserves will decline over time. HighMount may not be able to successfully find
and produce reserves economically in the future or to acquire proved reserves at
acceptable costs.

By their nature, undeveloped reserves
are less certain. Thus, HighMount must make a substantial amount of capital
expenditures for the acquisition, exploration and development of reserves.
HighMount expects to fund its capital expenditures with cash from its operating
activities. If HighMount’s cash flow from operations is not sufficient to fund
its capital expenditure budget, there can be no assurance that additional debt
or equity financing will be available or available at favorable terms to meet
those requirements.

Estimates
of natural gas and NGL reserves are uncertain and inherently
imprecise.

Estimating the volume of proved
natural gas and NGL reserves is a complex process and is not an exact science
because of numerous uncertainties inherent in the process. The process relies on
interpretations of available geological, geophysical, engineering and production
data. The extent, quality and reliability of this technical data can vary.
The


Item
1A.  Risk Factors

process
also requires certain economic assumptions, some of which are mandated by the
SEC, such as oil and gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital
expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. Therefore, these estimates are
inherently imprecise. The accuracy of reserve estimates is a function
of:

·

the
      quality and quantity of available
data;

·

the
      interpretation of that data;

·

the
      accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions;
  and

·

the
      judgment of the persons preparing the
estimate.

Actual future production, commodity
prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and
quantities of recoverable reserves most likely will vary from HighMount’s
estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the quantities and
present value of HighMount’s reserves. In addition, HighMount may adjust
estimates of proved reserves upward or downward to reflect production history,
results of exploration and development drilling and prevailing commodity
prices.

The timing of both the production and
the expenses from the development and production of natural gas and NGL
properties will affect both the timing of actual future net cash flows from
proved reserves and their present value. In addition, the 10.0% discount factor,
which is required by the SEC to be used in calculating discounted future net
cash flows for reporting purposes, is not necessarily the most accurate discount
factor. The effective interest rate at various times, and the risks associated
with our business, or the oil and gas industry in general, will affect the
accuracy of the 10.0% discount factor.

If
commodity prices decrease, HighMount may be required to take write-downs of the
carrying values of its properties.

HighMount may be required, under full
cost accounting rules, to write down the carrying value of its natural gas and
NGL properties if commodity prices decline significantly, or if it makes
substantial downward adjustments to its estimated proved reserves, or increases
its estimates of development costs or experiences deterioration in its
exploration results. HighMount utilizes the full cost method of accounting for
its exploration and development activities. Under full cost accounting,
HighMount is required to perform a ceiling test each quarter. The ceiling test
is an impairment test and generally establishes a maximum, or “ceiling,” of the
book value of HighMount’s natural gas properties that is equal to the expected
after tax present value (discounted at the required rate of 10.0%) of the future
net cash flows from proved reserves, including the effect of cash flow hedges,
calculated using prevailing prices on the last day of the period.

If the net book value of HighMount’s
exploration and production (“E&P”) properties (reduced by any related net
deferred income tax liability) exceeds its ceiling limitation, SEC regulations
require HighMount to impair or “write down” the book value of its E&P
properties. A write down may not be reversed in future periods, even though
higher natural gas and NGL prices may subsequently increase the ceiling.
Depending on the magnitude of any future impairment, a ceiling test write down
could significantly reduce HighMount’s income, or produce a loss. As ceiling
test computations involve the prevailing price on the last day of the quarter,
it is impossible to predict the timing and magnitude of any future
impairment.

Drilling
for and producing natural gas and NGLs is a high risk activity with many
uncertainties.

HighMount’s future success will
depend in part on the success of its exploitation, exploration, development and
production activities. HighMount’s E&P activities are subject to numerous
risks beyond its control, including the risk that drilling will not result in
oil and natural gas production volumes that are commercially viable. HighMount’s
decisions to purchase, explore, develop or otherwise exploit prospects or
properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through
geophysical and geological analyses, production data and engineering studies,
the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying
interpretations. HighMount’s cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is
often uncertain before drilling commences. Overruns in budgeted expenditures are
common risks that can make a particular project uneconomical. Further, many
factors may curtail, delay or cancel drilling, including the
following:


Item
1A.  Risk Factors

·

lack
      of acceptable prospective acreage;

·

inadequate
      capital resources;

·

unexpected
      drilling conditions; pressure or irregularities in formations; equipment
      failures or accidents;

·

adverse
      weather conditions;

·

unavailability
      or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, labor or
    services;

·

reductions
      in commodity prices;

·

limitations
      in the market for natural gas and
NGLs;

·

title
      problems;

·

compliance
      with governmental regulations; and

·

mechanical
      difficulties.

HighMount’s
business involves many hazards and operational risks, some of which may not be
fully covered by insurance.

HighMount is not insured against all
risks. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events
could materially and adversely affect HighMount’s business, financial condition
or results of operations. HighMount’s E&P activities are subject to all of
the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing natural gas

and NGLs

,
including the possibility of:

·

environmental
      hazards, such as uncontrollable flows of natural gas, brine, well fluids,
      toxic gas or other pollution into the environment, including groundwater
      contamination;

·

abnormally
      pressured formations;

·

mechanical
      difficulties, such as stuck drilling and service tools and casing
      collapse;

·

fires
      and explosions;

·

personal
      injuries and death; and

·

natural
      disasters.

If any of these events occur,
HighMount could incur substantial losses as a result of injury or loss of life,
damage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment,
pollution and other environmental damage, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory
investigation and penalties, suspension of HighMount’s operations and repairs to
resume operations, any of which could adversely affect its ability to conduct
operations or result in substantial losses. HighMount may elect not to obtain
insurance, if the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks
presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not
fully insurable.

HighMount
engages in commodity price hedging activities.

HighMount is exposed to risks
associated with fluctuations in commodity prices. The extent of HighMount’s
commodity price risk is related to the effectiveness and scope of HighMount’s
hedging activities. To the extent HighMount hedges its commodity price risk,
HighMount will forego the benefits it would otherwise experience if commodity
prices or interest rates were to change in its favor. Furthermore, because
HighMount has entered into


Item
1A.  Risk Factors

derivative
transactions related to only a portion of the volume of its expected natural gas
supply and production of NGLs, HighMount will continue to have direct commodity
price risk on the unhedged portion. HighMount’s actual future supply and
production may be significantly higher or lower than HighMount estimates at the
time it enters into derivative transactions for that period.

As a result, HighMount’s hedging
activities may not be as effective as HighMount intends in reducing the
volatility of its cash flows, and in certain circumstances may actually increase
the volatility of cash flows. In addition, even though HighMount’s management
monitors its hedging activities, these activities can result in substantial
losses. Such losses could occur under various circumstances, including if a
counterparty does not perform its obligations under the applicable hedging
arrangement, the hedging arrangement is imperfect or ineffective, or HighMount’s
hedging policies and procedures are not properly followed or do not work as
planned.

Natural
gas, NGL and other commodity prices are volatile.

The commodity price HighMount
receives for its production heavily influences its revenue, profitability,
access to capital and future rate of growth. HighMount is subject to risks due
to frequent and often substantial fluctuations in commodity prices. NGL prices
generally fluctuate on a basis that correlates to fluctuations in crude oil
prices. In the past, the prices of natural gas and crude oil have been extremely
volatile, and HighMount expects this volatility to continue. The markets and
prices for natural gas and NGLs depend upon factors beyond HighMount’s control.
These factors include demand, which fluctuates with changes in market and
economic conditions and other factors, including:

·

the
      impact of market and basis differentials - market price spreads between
      two points across Highmount’s natural gas
  system;

·

the
      impact of weather on the demand for these
  commodities;

·

the
      level of domestic production and imports of these
    commodities;

·

natural
      gas storage levels;

·

actions
      taken by foreign producing nations;

·

the
      availability of local, intrastate and interstate transportation
      systems;

·

the
      availability and marketing of competitive
fuels;

·

the
      impact of energy conservation efforts;
and

·

the
      extent of governmental regulation and
taxation.

Lower commodity prices may decrease
HighMount’s revenues and may reduce the amount of natural gas and NGLs that
HighMount can produce economically.

Boardwalk
Pipeline is undertaking large, complex expansion projects which involve
significant risks that may adversely affect its business.

Boardwalk Pipeline is currently
undertaking several large, complex pipeline expansion projects and it may
consider additional expansion projects in the future. In pursuing these
projects, Boardwalk Pipeline has experienced significant cost overruns,
including penalties to contractors, and may experience additional cost increases
in the future. Boardwalk Pipeline has also experienced construction delays and
may experience additional delays in the future. Delays in construction have
resulted in reduced transportation rates and liquidated damage payments to
customers, as well as lost revenue opportunities and could, in the future result
in similar losses or, in some cases, provide customers the right to terminate
their transportation agreements relating to the delayed
project.


Item
1A.  Risk Factors

These cost overruns and construction
delays have resulted from a variety of factors, including the
following:

·

delays
      in obtaining regulatory approvals;

·

adverse
      weather conditions;

·

delays
      in obtaining key materials; and

·

shortages of
      qualified labor and escalating costs of labor and materials resulting from
      the high level of construction activity in the pipeline
      industry.

In pursuing current or future expansion
projects, Boardwalk Pipeline could experience additional delays or cost
increases for the reasons described above or as a result of other factors beyond
its control. It may not be able to complete its current or future expansion
projects on the terms, at the cost, or under the schedule that they anticipate,
or at all. In addition, Boardwalk Pipeline cannot be certain that, if completed,
these projects will perform in accordance with their expectations and other
areas of their business may suffer as a result of the diversion of management’s
attention and other resources from other business concerns. Any of these
factors could materially adversely affect Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to
realize the anticipated benefits from expansion projects. Please read Item 1,
“Business – Boardwalk Pipeline Partners – Expansion Projects.”

Completion
of Boardwalk Pipeline’s expansion projects will require significant amounts of
debt and equity financing which may not be available to it on acceptable terms,
or at all.

Boardwalk Pipeline plans to fund its
expansion capital expenditures with proceeds from sales of its debt and equity
securities and borrowings under its revolving credit facility. However,
Boardwalk Pipeline cannot be certain that it will be able to issue debt and
equity securities on terms or in the proportions that it expects, or at all,
particularly in light of the cost increases and construction delays experienced
to date on its expansion projects, current credit market disruptions surrounding
sub-prime residential mortgage concerns and the impact that those factors and
other events are having and may have on the public securities markets generally
and on the market for Boardwalk Pipeline’s securities in particular. A
significant increase in indebtedness, or an increase in indebtedness that is
proportionately greater than its issuances of equity, as well as the project
cost increases and credit market conditions discussed above could negatively
impact Boardwalk Pipeline’s credit ratings or its ability to remain in
compliance with the financial covenants under its revolving credit agreement. If
Boardwalk Pipeline is unable to finance its expansion projects as expected, it
could be required to seek alternative financing, the terms of which may not be
attractive to it, or to revise or cancel its expansion plans.

Boardwalk
Pipeline’s natural gas transportation and storage operations are subject to FERC
rate-making policies.

Action by the FERC on currently pending
matters as well as matters arising in the future could adversely affect
Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to establish reasonable rates, or to charge rates
that would cover future increases in Boardwalk Pipeline’s costs, or even to
continue to collect rates to maintain Boardwalk Pipeline’s current revenue
levels that cover current costs, including a reasonable return. Boardwalk
Pipeline cannot make assurances that it will be able to recover all of its costs
through existing or future rates.

In 2005, FERC established a policy
regarding the ability of a regulated entity to collect an allowance for income
taxes in its cost of service. Generally, FERC has stated it will permit a
pipeline that is a partnership (or other pass-through entity) to include in its
cost-of-service an income tax allowance to the extent that its partners have an
actual or potential income tax liability on the jurisdictional income generated
by the partnership (or other pass-through entity). FERC will review pipelines’
ability to include such an income tax allowance in their costs of service on a
case-by-case basis, and the burden is on the pipelines to show that it had such
actual or potential income tax liability. That policy has been further refined
in 2006 and 2007 through a series of FERC orders and decisions issued by the
United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Most
recently, FERC’s income tax allowance policy was upheld on all issues
subject to appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit in a decision issued in May 2007. In December 2007, FERC
issued an order that again affirmed its income tax allowance policy and further
clarified the implementation of that policy. If the FERC were to change its
income tax allowance policy in the future, such changes could materially and
adversely impact the rates Boardwalk Pipeline is permitted to charge as future
rates are approved for its interstate transportation services.


Item
1A.  Risk Factors

In a related interstate oil pipeline
proceeding, FERC noted that the tax deferral features of a publicly traded
partnership may cause some investors to receive, for some indeterminate
duration, cash distributions in excess of their taxable income, which FERC
characterized as a “tax savings.” FERC stated a concern that this creates an
opportunity for those investors to earn an additional equity return funded by
ratepayers. Responding to this concern, FERC adjusted the pipeline’s equity rate
of return downward based on the percentage by which the publicly traded
partnership’s cash flow exceeded taxable income assumed in the methodology for
calculating the rate of return. A rehearing request is pending before FERC on
this issue. If FERC establishes a policy of lowering a regulated entities’
equity rate of return to compensate for what it considers to be a “tax savings,”
it is also likely that the level of maximum lawful rates would decrease from
current levels.

If a subsidiary of Boardwalk
Pipeline were to file a rate case or if Boardwalk Pipeline was to be
required to defend its rates, Boardwalk Pipeline would be required to establish
pursuant to the income tax policy statement that the inclusion of an income tax
allowance in its cost of service was just and reasonable. To establish that its
tax allowance is just and reasonable, Boardwalk Pipeline’s general partner may
elect to require owners of Boardwalk Pipeline’s units to recertify their status
as being subject to United States federal income taxation on the income
generated by Texas Gas or Gulf South. Boardwalk Pipeline can provide no
assurance that the certification and re-certification procedures provided in
Boardwalk Pipeline’s partnership agreement will be sufficient to establish that
its unitholders, or its unitholders’ owners, are subject to United States
federal income taxation on the income generated by Boardwalk Pipeline. If
Boardwalk Pipeline is unable to establish that the master partnership’s
unitholders, or its unitholders’ owners, are subject to United States federal
income tax liability on the income generated by the jurisdictional pipelines,
the FERC could disallow a substantial portion of Texas Gas’ or Gulf South’s
income tax allowance. If the FERC were to disallow a substantial portion of
Texas Gas’ or Gulf South’s income tax allowance, it is likely that the level of
maximum lawful rates could decrease from current levels.

The
outcome of certain FERC proceedings involving FERC policy statements is
uncertain and could affect the level of return on equity that Boardwalk Pipeline
may be able to achieve in any future rate proceeding.

In an effort to provide some guidance
and to obtain further public comment on FERC’s policies concerning return on
equity determinations, on July 19, 2007, FERC issued its Proposed Proxy Policy
Statement, Composition of Proxy Groups for Determining Gas and Oil Pipeline
Return on Equity. In the Proposed Proxy Policy Statement, FERC proposes to
permit inclusion of publicly traded partnerships in the proxy group analysis
relating to return on equity determinations in rate proceedings, provided that
the analysis be limited to actual publicly traded partnership distributions
capped at the level of the pipeline’s earnings and that evidence be provided in
the form of multiyear analysis of past earnings demonstrating a publicly traded
partnership’s ability to provide stable earnings over time.

In a decision issued shortly after FERC
issued its Proposed Proxy Policy Statement, the D.C. Circuit vacated FERC’s
orders in proceeding involving High Island Offshore System and Petal Gas
Storage. The Court determined that FERC had failed to adequately reflect risks
of interstate pipeline operations both in populating the proxy group (from which
a range of equity returns was determined) with entities the record indicated had
lower risk, while excluding publicly traded partnerships primarily engaged in
interstate pipeline operations, and in the placement of the pipeline under
review in each proceeding within that range of equity returns. Although the
Court accepted for the sake of argument FERC’s rationale for excluding publicly
traded partnerships from the proxy group (i.e., publicly traded partnership
distributions may exceed earnings) it observed this proposition was “not
self-evident.”

The ultimate outcome of these
proceedings is not certain and may result in new policies being established at
FERC that would not allow the full use of publicly traded partnership
distributions to unitholders in any proxy group comparisons or other negative
adjustments used to determine return on equity in future rate proceedings.
In addition, the FERC may adopt other policies or institute other proceedings
that could adversely affect Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to achieve a reasonable
level of return on equity in any future rate proceeding.

Boardwalk
Pipeline’s operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen
interruptions for which Boardwalk Pipeline may not be adequately
insured.

There are a variety of operating
risks inherent in Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas transportation and storage
operations, such as leaks, explosions and mechanical problems, all of which
could cause substantial financial losses. Any


Item
1A.  Risk Factors

of these
or other similar occurrences could result in the disruption of Boardwalk
Pipeline’s operations, substantial repair costs, personal injury or loss of
human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment
of Boardwalk Pipeline’s operations and substantial revenue losses. The location
of pipelines near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial
business centers and industrial sites, could significantly increase the level of
damages resulting from these risks.

Boardwalk Pipeline currently
possesses property, business interruption and general liability insurance, but
proceeds from such insurance coverage may not be adequate for all liabilities or
expenses incurred or revenues lost. Moreover, such insurance may not be
available in the future at commercially reasonable costs and
terms.

Because
of the natural decline in gas production from existing wells, Boardwalk
Pipeline’s success depends on its ability to obtain access to new sources of
natural gas.

For the years 2003 to 2006, gas
production from the Gulf Coast region, which supplies the majority of Boardwalk
Pipeline’s throughput, has declined an average of approximately 13.0% per year
according to the Energy Information Administration. A large part of this decline
was due to the effects of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. Boardwalk
Pipeline cannot give any assurance regarding the gas production industry’s
ability to find new sources of domestic supply. Production from existing wells
and gas supply basins connected to Boardwalk Pipeline’s systems will naturally
decline further over time. The amount of natural gas reserves underlying these
wells may also be less than Boardwalk Pipeline anticipates, or the rate at which
production from these reserves declines may be greater than Boardwalk Pipeline
anticipates. Accordingly, to maintain or increase throughput levels on its
pipelines, Boardwalk Pipeline must continually obtain access to new supplies of
natural gas. The primary factors affecting Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to
obtain new sources of natural gas to its pipelines include: (1) the level of
successful drilling activity near Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipelines; (2) Boardwalk
Pipeline’s ability to compete for these supplies; (3) the successful completion
of new liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) facilities near Boardwalk Pipeline’s
facilities; and (4) Boardwalk Pipeline’s gas quality requirements.

The level of drilling activity is
dependent on a number of factors beyond Boardwalk Pipeline’s control. The
primary factor that impacts drilling decisions is the price of oil and natural
gas. A sustained decline in natural gas prices could result in a decrease in
exploration and development activities in the fields served or to be served by
Boardwalk Pipeline, which would lead to reduced throughput levels on its
pipelines. Other factors that impact production decisions include producers’
capital budget limitations, the ability of producers to obtain necessary
drilling and other governmental permits, the availability and cost of drilling
rigs and other drilling equipment, and regulatory changes. Because of these
factors, even if new natural gas reserves were discovered in areas served by
Boardwalk Pipeline, producers may choose not to develop those reserves or may
connect them to different pipelines.

Imported LNG is expected to be a
significant component of future natural gas supply to the United States. Much of
this increase in LNG supply is expected to be imported through new LNG
facilities to be developed over the next decade. Boardwalk Pipeline cannot
predict which, if any, of these projects will be constructed. If a significant
number of these new projects fail to be developed with their announced capacity,
or there are significant delays in such development, or if they are built in
locations where they are not connected to Boardwalk Pipeline’s systems or they
do not influence sources of supply on its systems, Boardwalk Pipeline may not
realize expected increases in future natural gas supply available for
transportation through its systems.

If Boardwalk Pipeline is not able to
obtain new supplies of natural gas to replace the natural decline in volumes
from existing supply basins, or if the expected increase in natural gas supply
through imported LNG is not realized, throughput on its pipeline systems would
decline.

Successful
development of LNG import terminals in the eastern or northeastern United States
could reduce the demand for Boardwalk Pipeline’s services.

Development of new, or expansion of
existing, LNG facilities on the East Coast could reduce the need for customers
in the northeastern United States to transport natural gas from the Gulf Coast
and other supply basins connected to the Boardwalk Pipeline’s systems. This
could reduce the amount of gas transported by Boardwalk Pipeline for delivery
off-

system to
other interstate pipelines serving the northeast. If Boardwalk Pipeline is not
able to replace these volumes with volumes to other markets or other regions,
throughput on its pipeline systems will decline.


Item
1A.  Risk Factors

Boardwalk
Pipeline may not be able to maintain or replace expiring gas transportation and
storage contracts at favorable rates.

Boardwalk Pipeline’s primary exposure
to market risk occurs at the time existing transportation contracts expire and
are subject to renegotiation. As of December 31, 2007, approximately 25.0% of
the firm contract load on Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipeline systems, excluding
agreements related to the expansion projects, was due to expire on or before
December 31, 2008. Upon expiration, Boardwalk Pipeline may not be able to extend
contracts with existing customers or obtain replacement contracts at favorable
rates or on a long term basis. A key determinant of the value that customers can
realize from firm transportation on a pipeline is the basis differential, which
can be affected by, among other things, the availability of supply, available
capacity, storage inventories, weather and general market demand in the
respective areas.

The extension or replacement of
existing contracts depends on a number of factors beyond Boardwalk Pipeline’s
control, including:

·

existing
      and new competition to deliver natural gas to Boardwalk Pipeline’s
      markets;

·

the
      growth in demand for natural gas in Boardwalk Pipeline’s
      markets;

·

whether
      the market will continue to support long term
  contracts;

·

the
      current basis differentials or market price spreads between two points
      across the Boardwalk Pipeline
systems;

·

whether
      Boardwalk Pipeline’s business strategy continues to be successful;
      and

·

the
      effects of state regulation on customer contracting
    practices.

Boardwalk
Pipeline depends on certain key customers for a significant portion of its
revenues.

Boardwalk
Pipeline relies on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of
its revenues. For the years ended December 31, 2007, Atmos Energy accounted for
approximately 10.0% of Boardwalk Pipeline’s total operating revenues. Boardwalk
Pipeline may be unable to negotiate extensions or replacements of these
contracts and those with other key customers on favorable terms as a result of
competition, creditworthiness or for other reasons.

Boardwalk
Pipeline is exposed to credit risk relating to nonperformance by its
customers.

Boardwalk Pipeline is exposed to
credit risk from the nonperformance by its customers of their contractual
obligations, in large part relating to volumes owed by customers for imbalances
or gas loaned to them, generally under parking and lending services and
no-notice services. If any significant customer of Boardwalk Pipeline should
have credit or financial problems resulting in a delay or failure to repay the
gas they owe Boardwalk Pipeline, it could have a material adverse effect on
Boardwalk Pipeline’s financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.
Please read information on credit risk included in Credit Risk under Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

Boardwalk
Pipeline depends on third party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to
its pipelines

Boardwalk Pipeline depends upon third
party pipelines and other facilities that provide delivery options to and from
its pipelines. For example, Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipeline system can deliver
approximately 500 MMcf per day to a major pipeline connection with Texas Eastern
at Kosciusko, Mississippi. If this or any other pipeline connection were to
become unavailable for current or future volumes of natural gas due to repairs,
damage to the facility, lack of capacity or any other reason, Boardwalk
Pipeline’s ability to continue shipping natural gas to end markets could be
restricted. Any temporary or permanent interruption at any key pipeline
interconnect could cause a material reduction in volumes transported on or
stored at facilities of Boardwalk Pipeline.


Item
1A.  Risk Factors

Significant
changes in natural gas prices could affect supply and demand, and reduce system
throughput.

Higher natural gas prices could
result in a decline in the demand for natural gas and, therefore, in the
throughput on the Boardwalk Pipeline systems. In addition, reduced price
volatility could reduce the revenues generated by Boardwalk Pipeline’s parking
and lending and interruptible storage services. In general terms, the price of
natural gas fluctuates in response to changes in supply, changes in demand,
market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond Boardwalk
Pipeline’s control. These factors include:

·

worldwide
      economic conditions;

·

weather
      conditions and seasonal trends;

·

levels
      of domestic production and consumer
demand;

·

the
      availability of LNG;

·

a
      material decrease in the price of natural gas could have an adverse effect
      on the shippers who have contracted for capacity on Boardwalk Pipeline’s
      planned expansion projects;

·

the
      availability of adequate transportation
  capacity;

·

the
      price and availability of alternative
fuels;

·

the
      effect of energy conservation
measures;

·

the
      nature and extent of governmental regulation and taxation;
    and

·

the
      anticipated future prices of natural gas, LNG and other
      commodities.

Risks
Related to Us and Our Subsidiaries Generally

In addition to the specific risks and
uncertainties faced by our subsidiaries, as discussed above, we and all of our
subsidiaries face risks and uncertainties related to, among other things,
terrorism, hurricanes and other natural disasters, competition, government
regulation, dependence on key executives and employees, litigation, dependence
on information technology and compliance with environmental laws.

Future
acts of terrorism could harm us and our subsidiaries.

Future terrorist attacks and the
continued threat of terrorism in this country or abroad, as well as possible
retaliatory military and other action by the United States and its allies, could
have a significant impact on the businesses of certain of our subsidiaries,
including the following:

CNA.

CNA continues
to face exposure to losses arising from terrorist acts, despite the passage of
the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007. The Terrorism
Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 extended, until December 31,
2014, the program established within the U.S. Department of Treasury by the
Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002. This program requires insurers to offer
terrorism coverage and the federal government to share in insured losses arising
from acts of terrorism. Given the unpredictability of the nature, targets,
severity and frequency of potential terrorist acts, this program does not
provide complete protection for future losses derived from acts of terrorism.
Further, the laws of certain states restrict our ability to mitigate this
residual exposure. For example, some states mandate property insurance coverage
of damage from fire following a loss, thereby prohibiting CNA from excluding
terrorism exposure. In addition, some states generally prohibit CNA from
excluding terrorism exposure from its primary workers’ compensation policies.
Consequently, there is substantial uncertainty as to CNA’s ability to contain
its terrorism exposure effectively since CNA continues to issue forms of
coverage, in particular, workers’ compensation, that are exposed to risk of loss
from a terrorism act.


Item
1A.  Risk Factors

Diamond Offshore, Boardwalk Pipeline
and HighMount.

The continued threat of terrorism and the
impact of retaliatory military and other action by the United States and its
allies might lead to increased political, economic and financial market
instability and volatility in prices for oil and gas, which could affect the
market for Diamond Offshore’s oil and gas offshore drilling services, Boardwalk
Pipeline’s natural gas transportation, gathering and storage services and
HighMount’s natural gas exploration and production activities. In addition, it
has been reported that terrorists might target domestic energy facilities. While
our subsidiaries take steps that they believe are appropriate to increase the
security of their energy assets, there is no assurance that they can completely
secure their assets, completely protect them against a terrorist attack or
obtain adequate insurance coverage for terrorist acts at reasonable
rates.

Loews Hotels.

The
travel and tourism industry went into a steep decline in the periods following
the 2001 World Trade Center event which had a negative impact on the occupancy
levels and average room rates at Loews Hotels. Future terrorist attacks could
similarly lead to reductions in business travel and tourism which could harm
Loews Hotels.

Certain
of our subsidiaries face significant risks related to the impact of hurricanes
and other natural disasters.

In addition to CNA’s exposure to
catastrophe losses discussed above, the businesses operated by several of our
other subsidiaries are exposed to significant harm from the effects of natural
disasters, particularly hurricanes and related flooding and other damage. While
much of the damage caused by natural disasters is covered by insurance, we
cannot be sure that such coverage will be available or be adequate in all cases.
These risks include the following:

Diamond
Offshore.

Diamond Offshore operates its offshore rig fleet in
waters that can be severely impacted by hurricanes and other natural disasters,
including the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. In late August 2005, one of Diamond
Offshore’s jack-up drilling rigs, the

Ocean Warwick

, was seriously
damaged during Hurricane Katrina and other rigs in Diamond’s fleet and its
warehouse in New Iberia, Louisiana sustained lesser damage in Hurricanes Katrina
or Rita, or in some cases both storms. In addition to damaging or destroying rig
equipment, some or all of which may be covered by insurance, catastrophes of
this kind result in additional operating expenses for Diamond Offshore,
including the cost of reconnaissance aircraft, rig crew over-time and employee
assistance, hurricane relief supplies, temporary housing and office space and
the rental of mooring equipment and others which may not be covered by
insurance.

Boardwalk
Pipeline.

The
nature and location of Boardwalk Pipeline’s business, particularly with regard
to its assets in the Gulf Coast region, may make Boardwalk Pipeline susceptible
to catastrophic losses especially from hurricanes or named storms. Various other
events can cause catastrophic losses, including windstorms, earthquakes, hail,
explosions, and severe winter weather and fires.  The frequency and
severity of these events are inherently unpredictable.  The extent of
losses from catastrophes is a function of both the total amount of insured
exposures in the affected areas and the severity of the events
themselves.  Although Boardwalk Pipeline carries insurance, in the
event of a loss the coverage could be insufficient or there could be a material
delay in the receipt of the insurance proceeds.

Loews
Hotels.

Hotels operated by Loews Hotels are exposed to damage,
business interruption and reductions in travel and tourism in markets affected
by significant natural disasters such as hurricanes. For example, Loews Hotels’
properties located in Florida and

New Orleans suffered
significant damage from hurricanes and related flooding during the past three
years.

Certain
of our subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal, state and local
governmental regulations.

The businesses operated by certain of
our subsidiaries are impacted by current and potential federal, state and local
governmental regulations which imposes or might impose a variety of restrictions
and compliance obligations on those companies. Governmental regulations can also
change materially in ways that could adversely affect those companies. Risks
faced by our subsidiaries related to governmental regulation include the
following:

CNA.

The insurance
industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision
throughout the United States. Most insurance regulations are designed to protect
the interests of CNA’s policyholders rather than its investors. Each state in
which CNA does business has established supervisory agencies that regulate the
manner in which CNA does business. Their regulations relate to, among other
things:

·

standards
      of solvency, including risk-based capital
  measurements;


Item
1A.  Risk Factors

·

restrictions
      on the nature, quality and concentration of
  investments;

·

restrictions
      on CNA’s ability to withdraw from unprofitable lines of insurance or
      unprofitable market areas;

·

the
      required use of certain methods of accounting and
    reporting;

·

the
      establishment of reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other
      purposes;

·

potential
      assessments for funds necessary to settle covered claims against impaired,
      insolvent or failed private or quasi-governmental
  insurers;

·

licensing
      of insurers and agents;

·

approval
      of policy forms;

·

limitations
      on the ability of CNA’s insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us;
      and

·

limitations
      on the ability to non-renew, cancel or change terms and conditions in
      policies.

Regulatory powers also extend to
premium rate regulations which require that rates not be excessive, inadequate
or unfairly discriminatory. CNA also is required by the states to provide
coverage to persons who would not otherwise be considered eligible by the
insurers. Each state dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage
that must be provided to such involuntary risks. CNA’s share of these
involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of its respective share
of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each state.

Lorillard

.  A bill
that would grant the FDA authority to regulate tobacco products was introduced
in Congress in February 2007. The bill is being supported by Philip Morris and
opposed by Lorillard, RAI and most other tobacco manufacturers. It has been
considered in hearings by Congressional committees in both houses of Congress
during 2007, and one Senate committee has approved the bill with certain
modifications. Lorillard is aware of reports that a subcommittee of the House of
Representatives will likely schedule a hearing on this bill in early March of
2008. The proposed bill would:

·

require
      larger and more severe health warnings on packs and
    cartons;

·

ban
      the use of descriptors on tobacco products, such as “low-tar” and
      “light”;

·

require
      the disclosure of ingredients and additives to
  consumers;

·

require
      pre-market approval by the FDA for claims made with respect to reduced
      risk or reduced exposure products;

·

require
      the reduction or elimination of nicotine or any other compound in
      cigarettes;

·

allow
      the FDA to mandate the use of reduced risk technologies in conventional
      cigarettes;

·

allow
      the FDA to place more severe restrictions on the advertising, marketing
      and sales of cigarettes;

·

permit
      inconsistent state regulation of labeling and advertising and eliminate
      the existing federal preemption of such regulation;
  and

·

grant
      the FDA the regulatory authority to impose broad additional
      restrictions.

In addition, some states have enacted or
proposed regulations, including with respect to mandatory disclosure of
ingredients, including flavorings, some of which are trade secrets. State and
local laws or rules that prohibit or restrict smoking in public places and
workplaces continue to be enacted and proposed. Lorillard cannot predict the
ultimate


Item
1A.  Risk Factors

impact of
these laws or regulatory proposals, but believes they will continue to reduce
sales and increase costs. Extensive and inconsistent regulation by multiple
states could prove to be particularly disruptive to Lorillard’s
business.

It is possible that such additional
regulation could result in a decrease in cigarette sales in the United States
(including sales of Lorillard brands) and an increase in costs, to Lorillard,
which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
operations, and cash flows. We believe that such regulation may adversely affect
Lorillard’s ability to compete against its larger competitors, including Philip
Morris, who may be able to more quickly and cost-effectively comply with these
new rules and regulations.

Diamond
Offshore.

Diamond Offshore’s operations are affected from time
to time in varying degrees by governmental laws and regulations. The drilling
industry is dependent on demand for services from the oil and gas exploration
industry and, accordingly, is affected by changing tax and other laws relating
to the energy business generally. Diamond Offshore may be required to make
significant capital expenditures to comply with governmental laws and
regulations. It is also possible that these laws and regulations may in the
future add significantly to Diamond Offshore’s operating costs or may
significantly limit drilling activity.

Governments in some foreign countries
are increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of
concessions, the exploration for oil and gas and other aspects of the oil and
gas industries. The modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption
of new laws or regulations curtailing exploratory or developmental drilling for
oil and gas for economic, environmental or other reasons could materially and
adversely affect Diamond Offshore’s operations by limiting drilling
opportunities.

The Minerals Management Service of
the U.S. Department of the Interior, or MMS, has established guidelines for
drilling operations in the GOM. Diamond Offshore believes that it is currently
in compliance with the existing regulations set forth by the MMS with respect to
its operations in the GOM; however, these regulations are continually under
review. Implementation of additional MMS regulations may subject Diamond
Offshore to increased costs of operating, or a reduction in the area and/or
periods of operation, in the GOM.

HighMount.

All of
HighMount’s operations are conducted onshore in the United States. The U.S. oil
and gas industry, and HighMount’s operations, are subject to regulation at the
federal, state and local level. Such regulation includes requirements with
respect to, among other things: permits to drill and to conduct other
operations; provision of financial assurances (such as bonds) covering drilling
and well operations; the location of wells; the method of drilling and
completing wells; the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells
are drilled; the plugging and abandoning of wells; the marketing, transportation
and reporting of production; and the valuation and payment of royalties; the
size of drilling and spacing units (regarding the density of wells which may be
drilled in a particular area); the unitization or pooling of natural gas and oil
properties; maximum rates of production from natural gas and oil wells; venting
or flaring of natural gas and the ratability of production.

HighMount’s operations are also subject
to federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of
contaminants into the environment, the generation, storage, transportation and
disposal of contaminants, and the protection of public health, natural
resources, wildlife and the environment. In most instances, the regulatory
requirements relate to the handling and disposal of drilling and production
waste products, water and air pollution control procedures, and the remediation
of petroleum-product contamination. In addition, HighMount’s operations may
require it to obtain permits for, among other things, air emissions, discharges
into surface waters, and the construction and operation of underground injection
wells or surface pits to dispose of produced saltwater and other non-hazardous
oilfield wastes.

Boardwalk Pipeline

.

Boardwalk
Pipeline’s natural gas transportation, gathering and storage operations are
subject to extensive regulation by the FERC and the United States Department of
Transportation, among other federal and state authorities. In addition to the
FERC rules and regulations related to the rates Boardwalk Pipeline can charge
for its services, the FERC’s regulatory authority also extends to:

·

operating
      terms and conditions of service;

·

the
      types of services Boardwalk Pipeline may offer to its
      customers;


Item
1A.  Risk Factors

·

construction
      of new facilities;

·

acquisition,
      extension or abandonment of services or
  facilities;

·

accounts
      and records; and

·

relationships
      with affiliated companies involved in all aspects of the natural gas and
      electricity businesses.

The FERC action in any of these areas
or modifications of its current regulations can adversely impact Boardwalk
Pipeline’s ability to compete for business, the costs incurred in its
operations, the construction of new facilities or Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability
to recover the full cost of operating its pipelines. Another example is the time
the FERC takes to approve the construction of new facilities, which could give
Boardwalk Pipeline’s non-regulated competitors time to offer alternative
projects or raise the costs of Boardwalk Pipeline’s projects to the point where
they are no longer economical.

The United States Department of
Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety
Administration has issued a final rule requiring pipeline operators to
develop integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain areas
along their pipelines and take additional measures to protect pipeline segments
located in what the rule refers to as high consequence areas (“HCAs”) where a
leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm.

The
businesses operated by our subsidiaries face intense competition.

Each of the businesses operated by
our subsidiaries faces intense competition in its industry and will be harmed
materially if it is unable to compete effectively. Certain of the competitive
risks faced by those companies include:

CNA

.  All aspects
of the insurance industry are highly competitive and CNA must continuously
allocate resources to refine and improve its insurance products and services.
CNA competes with a large number of stock and mutual insurance companies and
other entities for both distributors and customers. Insurers compete on the
basis of factors including products, price, services, ratings and financial
strength. CNA may lose business to competitors offering competitive insurance
products at lower prices.

Lorillard.

Lorillard
competes primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand
loyalty, service, marketing, advertising and price. Lorillard is subject to
highly competitive conditions in all aspects of its business. The competitive
environment and Lorillard’s competitive position can be significantly influenced
by weak economic conditions, erosion of consumer confidence, competitors’
introduction of low-priced products or innovative products, higher cigarette
taxes, higher absolute prices and larger gaps between price categories, and
product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco
products.

Lorillard’s principal competitors are
the two other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers, Philip Morris and RAI. RAI was
formed in 2004 as a result of the merger of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (now a
wholly owned subsidiary of RAI) and the U.S. operations of Brown &
Williamson Holdings, Inc. (formerly known as Brown & Williamson Tobacco
Corporation and an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of British American Tobacco
p.l.c.). Lorillard also competes against numerous other smaller manufacturers or
importers of cigarettes. If Lorillard’s major competitors were to significantly
increase the level of price discounts offered to consumers, Lorillard could
respond by increasing price discounts, which could have a materially adverse
effect on its profitability and results of operations.

Diamond
Offshore.

The offshore contract drilling industry is highly
competitive with numerous industry participants, none of which at the present
time has a dominant market share. Some of Diamond Offshore’s competitors may
have greater financial or other resources than Diamond Offshore. Drilling
contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis. Intense price
competition is often the primary factor in determining which qualified
contractor is awarded a job, although rig availability and location, a drilling
contractor’s safety record and the quality and technical capability of service
and equipment may also be considered. Mergers among oil and gas exploration and
production companies have reduced the number of available customers. The
drilling industry has experienced consolidation in recent years and may
experience additional consolidation, which could create additional large
competitors.


Item
1A.  Risk Factors

HighMount.

HighMount
competes with other oil and gas companies in all aspects of its business,
including acquisition of producing properties and leases and obtaining
goods, services and labor, including drilling rigs and well completion services.
HighMount also competes in the marketing of produced natural gas and NGLs. Some
of HighMount’s competitors have substantially larger financial and other
resources than HighMount. Factors that affect HighMount’s ability to acquire
producing properties include available funds, available information about the
property and standards established by HighMount for minimum projected return on
investment. Competition for sales of natural gas and NGLs is also presented by
alternative fuel sources, including heating oil, imported liquefied natural gas
and other fossil fuels.

Boardwalk
Pipeline.

Boardwalk Pipeline competes primarily with other
interstate and intrastate pipelines in the transportation and storage of natural
gas. Natural gas also competes with other forms of energy available to Boardwalk
Pipeline’s customers, including electricity, coal and fuel oils. The principal
elements of competition among pipelines are rates, terms of service, access to
gas supplies, flexibility and reliability. The FERC’s policies promoting
competition in gas markets are having the effect of increasing the gas
transportation options for Boardwalk Pipeline’s traditional customer base.
Increased competition could reduce the volumes of gas transported by Boardwalk
Pipeline’s systems or, in cases where Boardwalk Pipeline does not have long term
fixed rate contracts, could force Boardwalk Pipeline to lower its transportation
or storage rates. Competition could intensify the negative impact of factors
that significantly decrease demand for natural gas in the markets served by
Boardwalk Pipeline’s systems, such as competing or alternative forms of energy,
a recession or other adverse economic conditions, weather, higher fuel costs and
taxes or other governmental or regulatory actions that directly or indirectly
increase the cost or limit the use of natural gas. Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability
to renew or replace existing contracts at rates sufficient to maintain current
revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected by the activities of its
competitors. Boardwalk Pipeline also competes against a number of intrastate
pipelines which have significant regulatory advantages over its and other
interstate pipelines because of the absence of FERC regulation. In view of
potential rate increases, construction and service flexibility available to
intrastate pipelines, Boardwalk Pipeline may lose customers and throughput to
intrastate competitors.

We
and our subsidiaries are subject to litigation.

We and our subsidiaries are subject
to litigation in the normal course of business. Litigation is costly and time
consuming to defend and could result in a material expense. Please read
information on litigation included in the MD&A under Item 7 and Note 21 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. Certain of
the litigation risks faced by us and our subsidiaries are as
follows:

CNA.

CNA faces
substantial risks of litigation and arbitration beyond ordinary course claims
and A&E matters, which may contain assertions in excess of amounts covered
by reserves that CNA has established. These matters may be difficult to assess
or quantify and may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts that
include punitive or treble damages.

Lorillard.

As
discussed in more detail above, Lorillard is a defendant in a large number of
tobacco-related cases and other litigation, in some instances seeking damages
from Lorillard ranging into the billions of dollars. We are a defendant in
certain of these cases as well.

We
and our subsidiaries are each dependent on a small number of key executives and
other key personnel to operate our businesses successfully.

Our success and the success of our
operating subsidiaries substantially depends upon each company’s ability to
attract and retain high quality executives and other qualified employees. In
many instances, there may be only a limited number of available qualified
executives in the business lines in which we and our subsidiaries compete and
the loss of one or more key employees or the inability to attract and retain
other talented personnel could impede the successful implementation of our and
our subsidiaries’ business strategies. For example, Lorillard is currently
experiencing difficulty in identifying and hiring qualified personnel in some
areas of its business, due primarily to the health and social issues associated
with the tobacco industry. In addition, Diamond Offshore and HighMount have
experienced and continue to experience upward pressure on salaries and wages and
increased competition for skilled workers as a result of the strengthening
offshore drilling and oil and gas markets. Diamond Offshore has also sustained
the loss of experienced personnel to competitors and customers. In response to
these market conditions, Diamond Offshore and HighMount have implemented
retention programs, including increases in compensation.


Item
1A.  Risk Factors

Certain
of our subsidiaries face significant risks related to compliance with
environmental laws.

Certain of our subsidiaries have
extensive obligations and/or financial exposure related to compliance with
federal, state and local environmental laws or. Laws and regulations protecting
the environment have become increasingly stringent in recent years, and may in
some cases impose “strict liability,” rendering a person liable for
environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of that
person. These laws and regulations may expose us and our subsidiaries to
liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others or for acts that
were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed. For
example:

·

as
      discussed in more detail above, many of CNA’s policyholders have made
      claims for defense costs and indemnification in connection with
      environmental pollution matters;

·

as
      an operator of mobile offshore drilling units in navigable U.S. waters and
      some offshore areas, Diamond Offshore may be liable for, among other
      things, damages and costs incurred in connection with oil spills related
      to those operations, including for conduct of or conditions caused by
      others or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the
      time they were performed;

·

the
      risk of substantial environmental costs and liabilities is inherent in
      natural gas transportation, gathering and storage, including with respect
      to, among other things, the handling and discharge of solid and hazardous
      waste from Boardwalk Pipeline’s facilities, compliance with clean air
      standards and the abandonment and reclamation of Boardwalk Pipeline’s
      facilities, sites and other properties;
and

·

development,
      production and sale of natural gas and NGLs in the United States are
      subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations, including those
      related to discharge of materials into the environment and environmental
      protection, permits for drilling operations, bonds for ownership,
      development and production of oil and gas properties and reports
      concerning operations, which could result in liabilities for personal
      injuries, property damage, spills, discharge of hazardous materials,
      remediation and clean-up costs and other environmental damages, suspension
      or termination of HighMount’s operations and administrative, civil and
      criminal penalties.

Tobacco Related – Approximately 4,775
product liability cases are pending against cigarette manufacturers in the
United States. Lorillard is a defendant in approximately 3,775 of these cases.
Approximately 1,050 of these lawsuits against Lorillard are

Engle

Progeny Cases,
described below, in which the claims of approximately 3,000 individual
plaintiffs are asserted. Loews Corporation is a defendant in three of the cases
pending in the U.S. and in a fourth suit pending in Israel. Information with
respect to tobacco related legal proceedings is incorporated by reference to
Note 21, Legal Proceedings – Tobacco Related of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Item 8. Additional information regarding
tobacco related legal proceedings is contained below and in Exhibit
99.01.

The pending product liability cases
are composed of the following types of cases:

Conventional product liability cases
are brought by individuals who allege cancer or other health effects caused by
smoking cigarettes, by using smokeless tobacco products, by addiction to
tobacco, or by exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Approximately 215 cases
are pending, including approximately 55 cases against Lorillard. Loews
Corporation is a defendant in one of the conventional product liability
cases.

West Virginia individual personal
injury cases are brought by individuals who allege cancer or other health
effects caused by smoking cigarettes, by using smokeless tobacco products, or by
addiction to cigarette smoking. The cases are pending in a single West Virginia
court and have been consolidated for trial. Defendants have petitioned the U.S.
Supreme Court to review the order that will govern the trial. Lorillard is a
defendant in approximately 55 of the 730 pending cases that are part of this
proceeding. Loews Corporation is not a defendant in any of these cases. The
court has stayed activity in the proceeding, including the start of trial, until
a petition pending before the U.S. Supreme Court in a case in which Lorillard is
not a defendant is resolved.

Class action cases are purported to
be brought on behalf of large numbers of individuals for damages allegedly
caused by smoking. Ten of these cases are pending against Lorillard. One of
these cases,

Schwab v. Philip
Morris USA, Inc., et al.

, is on behalf of a purported nationwide class
composed of purchasers of light cigarettes. Loews Corporation is a defendant in
two of the class action cases. Lorillard is not a defendant in approximately 25
additional lights class action cases that are pending against other cigarette
manufacturers. Reference is made to Exhibit 99.01 to this Report for a list of
pending Class Action Cases in which Lorillard is a party.

One of the cases pending against
Lorillard,

Engle

, was
certified as a class action prior to trial. Following trial, the class was
ordered decertified by the Florida Supreme Court, which allowed the class
members to proceed with individual cases. Lorillard is a defendant in
approximately 1,050 of these cases. Approximately 3,000 individual plaintiffs
assert claims in these cases. Loews Corporation is not a defendant in any of
these cases.

Reimbursement cases are brought by or
on behalf of entities who seek reimbursement of expenses incurred in providing
health care to individuals who allegedly were injured by smoking. Plaintiffs in
these cases have included the U.S. federal government, U.S. state and local
governments, foreign governmental entities, hospitals or hospital districts,
American Indian tribes, labor unions, private companies, and private citizens.
Lorillard is a defendant in three Reimbursement cases pending against cigarette
manufacturers in the United States. Loews Corporation is not a defendant in any
of the Reimbursement cases pending in the U.S. Lorillard and Loews Corporation
are defendants in an additional case pending in Israel. Reference is made to
Exhibit 99.01 to this Report for a list of pending Reimbursement Cases in which
Lorillard is a party.

Included in this category is the suit
filed by the federal government,

United States of America v. Philip
Morris USA, Inc., et al.

, that sought disgorgement and injunctive relief.
During August of 2006, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia entered a final
judgment and remedial order following trial of this matter. Although the verdict
did not award monetary damages to the plaintiff, the final judgment and remedial
order granted equitable relief and imposes a number of requirements on the
defendants. Such requirements include, but are not limited to, corrective
statements by defendants related to the health effects of smoking. The remedial
order also would place certain prohibitions on the manner in which defendants
market their cigarette products and would eliminate any use of “lights” or
similar product descriptors. It is

Related – (Continued)

likely
that the remedial order, including the prohibitions on the use of the
descriptors relating to low tar cigarettes, will negatively affect Lorillard’s
future sales and profits. The parties have noticed appeals from this judgment.
It is possible that the appellate court could reconsider its order from February
of 2005 that barred the government from seeking disgorgement of profits.
Lorillard is one of the defendants in the case. Loews Corporation is not a party
to this action.

Flight Attendant cases are brought by
non-smoking flight attendants alleging injury from exposure to environmental
smoke in the cabins of aircraft. Plaintiffs in these cases may not seek punitive
damages for injuries that arose prior to January 15, 1997. Lorillard is a
defendant in each of the approximately 2,625 pending Flight Attendant
cases.

Other tobacco-related litigation
includes Tobacco Related Anti-Trust Cases. Reference is made to Exhibit 99.01 to

MANAGEMENT’S
REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
(as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for us. Our internal
control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management
and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of
published financial statements.

There are inherent limitations to the
effectiveness of any control system, however well designed, including the
possibility of human error and the possible circumvention or overriding of
controls. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that
there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered
relative to their costs. Management must make judgments with respect to the
relative cost and expected benefits of any specific control measure. The design
of a control system also is based in part upon assumptions and judgments made by
management about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance
that a control will be effective under all potential future conditions. As a
result, even an effective system of internal control over financial reporting
can provide no more than reasonable assurance with respect to the fair
presentation of financial statements and the processes under which they were
prepared.

Our management assessed the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2007. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in

Internal Control – Integrated
Framework

. Based on this assessment, our management believes that, as of
December 31, 2007, our internal control over financial reporting was
effective.

Our independent registered public
accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued an audit report on the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The report of Deloitte
& Touche LLP follows this report.


REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the
Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Loews
Corporation

New York,
NY

We have audited the internal control
over financial reporting of Loews Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”)
as of December 31, 2007, based on

criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying management

’

s report on
internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an

opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the
risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

A company’s internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors,
management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of
internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of
collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements
due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the
internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the
risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

In our

opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the criteria established
in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
the Company’s consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007 and our report dated
February 26, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion

on those consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedules and included an explanatory paragraph regarding
the change in method of accounting for defined benefit pension and other
postretirement plans in 2006.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the
Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Loews
Corporation

New York,
NY

We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of Loews Corporation and subsidiaries (the
“Company”) as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated
statements of income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2007, listed in the Index at Item 8. Our
audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at
Item 15. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedules are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Loews Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our
opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the
basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the
consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting
for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in 2006.

We have also audited, in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007,
based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission and our report dated February 26, 2008 expressed an
unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting.

Consolidated net income (including
both the Loews Group and Carolina Group) for the year ended December 31, 2007
was $2,489 million, compared to $2,491 million in the prior year.

Net income attributable to Loews common
stock in 2007 amounted to $1,956 million, or $3.65 per share, compared to $2,075
million, or $3.75 per share, in the prior year. The decrease in net income
reflects reduced investment income, reduced results at CNA and a decrease in the
share of Carolina Group earnings attributable to Loews common stock, due to the
sale of Carolina Group stock in August and May of 2006, partially offset by
higher results from Lorillard, Inc.

Net income attributable to Loews common
stock includes net investment losses of $67 million (after tax and minority
interest) in 2007 compared to net investment gains of $69 million (after tax and
minority interest) in the prior year. The net investment losses in 2007 were
primarily driven by $428 million (after tax and minority interest) of
other-than-temporary impairment losses at CNA which were partially offset by a
gain of $93 million (after tax) related to a reduction in the Company’s
ownership interest in Diamond Offshore from the conversion of Diamond Offshore’s
1.5% convertible debt into Diamond Offshore common stock.

Net income per share of Carolina Group
stock for 2007 was $4.91 per share, compared to $4.46 per share in the prior
year. The increase in net income is primarily due to higher effective unit
prices resulting from price increases in December 2006 and September 2007, lower
sales promotion expenses and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by an
increase in expenses for the State Settlement Agreements and a charge related to
litigation.


Item
7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

Proposed
Separation of Lorillard

On December 17, 2007, we announced that
our Board of Directors has approved a plan to dispose of our entire ownership
interest in Lorillard in a tax-free manner, resulting in the elimination of the
Carolina Group, and all of the Carolina Group stock, and establishing Lorillard
as an independent public company. The disposition, which we refer to as the
“Separation,” would be accomplished through our (i) redemption of all
outstanding Carolina Group stock in exchange for shares of Lorillard common
stock, with holders of Carolina Group stock receiving one share of Lorillard
common stock in exchange for each share of Carolina Group stock they currently
own, and (ii) disposition of our remaining Lorillard common stock in an exchange
offer for shares of outstanding Loews common stock or, if we determine not to
effect the exchange offer, or if the exchange offer is not fully subscribed, as
a pro rata dividend to holders of Loews common stock.

Classes
of Common Stock

Pending consummation of the Separation,
we have a two class common stock structure. Carolina Group stock, commonly
called a tracking stock, is intended to reflect the economic performance of a
defined group of our assets and liabilities referred to as the Carolina Group.
The principal assets and liabilities attributed to the Carolina Group
are:

·

our
      100% stock ownership interest in
Lorillard;

·

notional
      intergroup debt owed by the Carolina Group to the Loews Group ($218
      million outstanding at February 12, 2008), bearing interest at the annual
      rate of 8.0% and, subject to optional prepayment, due December 31, 2021;
      and

·

any
      and all liabilities, costs and expenses arising out of or related to
      tobacco or tobacco-related
businesses.

The outstanding Carolina Group stock
represents a 62.4% economic interest in the performance of the Carolina Group.
The Loews Group consists of all of our assets and liabilities other than the
62.4% economic interest represented by the outstanding Carolina Group stock, and
includes as an asset the notional intergroup debt of the Carolina
Group.

The existence of separate classes of
common stock could give rise to occasions where the interests of the holders of
Loews common stock and Carolina Group stock diverge or conflict or appear to
diverge or conflict. Subject to its fiduciary duties, our board of directors
could, in its sole discretion, occasionally make determinations or implement
policies that disproportionately affect the groups or the different classes of
stock. For example, our board of directors may decide to reallocate assets,
liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash flows between groups, without the
consent of shareholders. The board of directors would not be required to select
the option that would result in the highest value for holders of Carolina Group
stock.

As a result of the flexibility provided
to our board of directors, it might be difficult for investors to assess the
future prospects of the Carolina Group based on the Carolina Group’s past
performance.

The creation of the Carolina Group and
the issuance of Carolina Group stock does not change our ownership of Lorillard,
Inc. or Lorillard, Inc.’s status as a separate legal entity. The Carolina Group
and the Loews Group are notional groups that are intended to reflect the
performance of the defined sets of assets and liabilities of each such group as
described above. The Carolina Group and the Loews Group are not separate legal
entities and the attribution of our assets and liabilities to the Loews Group or
the Carolina Group does not affect title to the assets or responsibility for the
liabilities.

Holders of our common stock and of
Carolina Group stock are shareholders of Loews Corporation and are subject to
the risks related to an equity investment in us.

Upon consummation of the Separation, the
Carolina Group will cease to exist. At that time we intend to restate our
Certificate of Incorporation to reflect the elimination of the Carolina Group
and the Carolina Group Stock.

Parent
Company Structure

We are a holding company and derive
substantially all of our cash flow from our subsidiaries, principally Lorillard,
Diamond Offshore, Boardwalk Pipeline and CNA. Following the Separation, we
will no longer receive dividends or other cash payments from Lorillard. We rely
upon our invested cash balances and distributions from our subsidiaries to
generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations and to declare and pay any
dividends to our stockholders. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends
is subject to, among other things, the availability of sufficient funds in such
subsidiaries, applicable state laws, including in the case of the insurance
subsidiaries of CNA, laws and rules governing the payment of dividends by
regulated insurance companies (see Liquidity and Capital Resources – CNA
Financial, below). Claims of creditors of our subsidiaries will generally have
priority as to the assets of such subsidiaries over our claims and those of our
creditors and shareholders.

At December 31, 2007, the book value per
share of Loews common stock was $32.40, compared to $30.14 at December 31,
2006.

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of the consolidated
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements and the related notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

The consolidated financial statements
and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied on a
consistent basis. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates
used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. In general, our estimates
are based on historical experience, evaluation of current trends, information
from third party professionals and various other assumptions that we believe are
reasonable under the known facts and circumstances.

We consider the accounting policies
discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial
statements as their application places the most significant demands on our
judgment. Due to the inherent uncertainties involved with this type of judgment,
actual results could differ significantly from estimates and may have a material
adverse impact on our results of operations and/or equity.

Insurance
Reserves

Insurance reserves are established for
both short and long-duration insurance contracts. Short-duration contracts are
primarily related to property and casualty insurance policies where the
reserving process is based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss,
including amounts for known and unknown claims. Long-duration contracts
typically include traditional life insurance, payout annuities and long term
care products and are estimated using actuarial estimates about mortality,
morbidity and persistency as well as assumptions about expected investment
returns. The reserve for unearned premiums on property and casualty and accident
and health contracts represents the portion of premiums written related to the
unexpired terms of coverage. The inherent risks associated with the reserving
process are discussed in the Reserves – Estimates and Uncertainties section
below.

Reinsurance

Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are
estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense
reserves or future policy benefits reserves and are reported as receivables in
the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The ceding of insurance does not discharge CNA
of its primary liability under insurance contracts written by CNA. An exposure
exists with respect to property and casualty and life reinsurance ceded to the
extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations or disputes the
liabilities assumed under reinsurance agreements. An estimated allowance for
doubtful accounts is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances
due from reinsurers, reinsurer solvency, CNA’s past experience and current
economic conditions. Further information on CNA’s reinsurance program is
included in Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included
under Item 8.

Results of Operations

Accounting Estimates – (Continued)

Tobacco
and Other Litigation

Lorillard and other cigarette
manufacturers continue to be confronted with substantial litigation. Plaintiffs
in most of the cases seek unspecified amounts of compensatory damages and
punitive damages, although some seek damages ranging into the billions of
dollars. Plaintiffs in some of the cases seek treble damages, statutory damages,
disgorgement of profits, equitable and injunctive relief, and medical
monitoring, among other damages.

Lorillard believes that it has valid
defenses to the cases pending against it. Lorillard also believes it has valid
bases for appeal of the adverse verdicts against it. To the extent we are a
defendant in any of the lawsuits, we believe that we are not a proper defendant
in these matters and have moved or plan to move for dismissal of all such claims
against us. While Lorillard intends to defend vigorously all tobacco products
liability litigation, it is not possible to predict the outcome of any of this
litigation. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and it is possible that
some of these actions could be decided unfavorably. Lorillard may enter into
discussions in an attempt to settle particular cases if it believes it is
appropriate to do so.

Except for the impact of the State
Settlement Agreements and the Scott case described in Note 21 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report, management
is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that
could result from an unfavorable outcome of material pending litigation and,
therefore, no material provision has been made in the Consolidated Financial
Statements for any unfavorable outcome. It is possible that our results of
operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely
affected by an unfavorable outcome of certain pending or future
litigation.

CNA is also involved in various legal
proceedings that have arisen during the ordinary course of business. CNA
evaluates the facts and circumstances of each situation, and when CNA determines
it necessary, a liability is estimated and recorded. Please read Item 3 - Legal
Proceedings and Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Item 8.

Valuation
of Investments and Impairment of Securities

Invested assets are exposed to various
risks, such as interest rate, market and credit risks. Due to the level of risk
associated with certain invested assets and the level of uncertainty related to
changes in the value of these assets, it is possible that changes in risks in
the near term could have an adverse material impact on our results of operations
or equity.

CNA’s investment portfolio is subject to
market declines below amortized cost that may be other-than-temporary. CNA has
an Impairment Committee, which reviews the investment portfolio on a quarterly
basis, with ongoing analysis as new information becomes available. Any decline
that is determined to be other-than-temporary is recorded as an
other-than-temporary impairment loss in the results of operations in the period
in which the determination occurred. Further information on CNA’s process for
evaluating impairments is included in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included under Item 8.

Securities in the parent company’s
investment portfolio that are not part of its cash management activities are
classified as trading securities in order to reflect our investment philosophy.
These investments are carried at fair value with the net unrealized gain or loss
included in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Long
Term Care Products

Reserves and deferred acquisition costs
for CNA’s long term care products are based on certain assumptions including
morbidity, policy persistency and interest rates. The recoverability of deferred
acquisition costs and the adequacy of the reserves are contingent on actual
experience related to these key assumptions and other factors such as future
health care cost trends. If actual experience differs from these assumptions,
the deferred acquisition costs may not be fully realized and the reserves may
not be adequate, requiring CNA to add to reserves, or take unfavorable
development. Therefore, our financial results could be adversely
impacted.


Item
7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

Critical
Accounting Estimates – (Continued)

Pension
and Postretirement Benefit Obligations

We are required to make a significant
number of assumptions in order to estimate the liabilities and costs related to
our pension and postretirement benefit obligations to employees under our
benefit plans. The assumptions that have the most impact on pension costs are
the discount rate, the expected return on plan assets and the rate of
compensation increases. These assumptions are evaluated relative to current
market factors such as inflation, interest rates and fiscal and monetary
policies. Changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on pension
obligations and pension expense.

In determining the discount rate
assumption, we utilized current market information and liability information,
including a discounted cash flow analysis of our pension and postretirement
obligations. In particular, the basis for our discount rate selection was the
yield on indices of highly rated fixed income debt securities with durations
comparable to that of our plan liabilities. The Moody’s Aa Corporate Bond Index
is consistently used as the basis for the change in discount rate from the last
measurement date with this measure confirmed by the yield on other broad bond
indices. In addition in 2005, we supplemented our discount rate decision with a
yield curve analysis. The yield curve was applied to expected future retirement
plan payments to adjust the discount rate to reflect the cash flow
characteristics of the plans. The yield curve is a hypothetical double A yield
curve represented by a series of annualized discount rates reflecting bond
issues having a rating of Aa or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or a
rating of AA or better by Standard & Poor’s.

Further information on our pension and
postretirement benefit obligations is included in Note 18 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

Valuation
of HighMount’s Proved Reserves

HighMount follows the full cost method
of accounting for natural gas and natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) exploration and
production (“E&P”) activities prescribed by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”). Under the full cost method, all direct costs of property
acquisition, exploration and development activities are capitalized and
subsequently depleted using the units-of-production method. The depletable base
of costs includes estimated future costs to be incurred in developing proved
natural gas and NGL reserves, as well as capitalized asset retirement costs, net
of projected salvage values. Capitalized costs in the depletable base are
subject to a ceiling test prescribed by the SEC. The test limits capitalized
amounts to a ceiling

-

the present value of estimated future net revenues to be derived from the
production of proved natural gas and NGL reserves, assuming period-end pricing
adjusted for any cash flow hedges in place. If net capitalized costs exceed the
ceiling test at the end of any quarterly period, then a permanent write-down of
the assets must be recognized in that period. A write-down may not be reversed
in future periods, even though higher natural gas and NGL prices may
subsequently increase the ceiling. HighMount performs the ceiling test quarterly
and would recognize asset impairments to the extent that total capitalized costs
exceed the ceiling. In addition, gains or losses on the sale or other
disposition of natural gas and NGL properties are not recognized unless the gain
or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and
proved reserves.

HighMount’s estimate of proved reserves
requires a high degree of judgment and is dependent on factors such as
historical data, engineering estimates of proved reserve quantities, estimates
of the amount and timing of future expenditures to develop the proved reserves,
and estimates of future production from the proved reserves. HighMount’s
estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2007, are based upon studies for
each of HighMount’s properties prepared by HighMount’s staff engineers and
reviewed by Ryder Scott Company, L.P., independent consulting petroleum
engineers. Calculations were prepared using standard geological and engineering
methods generally accepted by the petroleum industry and in accordance with SEC
guidelines. Given the volatility of natural gas and NGL prices, it is possible
that HighMount’s estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved
natural gas and NGL reserves that is used to calculate the ceiling could
materially change in the near-term.

The process to estimate reserves is
imprecise, and estimates are subject to revision. If there is a significant
variance in any of HighMount’s estimates or assumptions in the future and
revisions to the value of HighMount’s proved reserves are necessary, related
depletion expense and the calculation of the ceiling test would be affected and
recognition of natural gas and NGL property impairments could occur. See Note 1
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Results of Operations

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT

CNA
Financial

Insurance operations are conducted by
subsidiaries of CNA Financial Corporation (“CNA”). CNA is an 89% owned
subsidiary.

CNA’s core property and casualty
commercial insurance operations are reported in two business segments: Standard
Lines and Specialty Lines. As a result of CNA’s realignment of management
responsibilities in the fourth quarter of 2007, CNA has revised its property and
casualty segments. Standard Lines includes standard property and casualty
coverages sold to small businesses and middle market entities and organizations
in the U.S. primarily through an independent agency distribution system.
Standard Lines also includes commercial insurance and risk management products
sold to large corporations in the U.S. primarily through insurance brokers.
Specialty Lines provides a broad array of professional, financial and specialty
property and casualty products and services, including excess and surplus lines,
primarily through insurance brokers and managing general underwriters. Specialty
Lines also includes insurance coverages sold globally through CNA’s foreign
operations (“CNA Global”). Previously, excess and surplus lines and CNA Global
were included in Standard Lines.

The new segment structure reflects
the way CNA management currently reviews results and makes business decisions.
Prior period segment disclosures have been conformed to the current year
presentation.

The non-core operations are managed in
Life & Group Non-Core segment and Other Insurance segment. Life & Group
Non-Core primarily includes the results of the life and group lines of business
sold or placed in run-off. Other Insurance primarily includes the results of
certain property and casualty lines of business placed in run-off, including CNA
Re. This segment also includes the results related to the centralized adjusting
and settlements of A&E.

Reserves
– Estimates and Uncertainties

CNA maintains reserves to cover its
estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses,
including the estimated cost of the claims adjudication process, for claims that
have been reported but not yet settled (“case reserves”) and claims that have
been incurred but not reported (“IBNR”). Claim and claim adjustment expense
reserves are reflected as liabilities and are included on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets under the heading “Insurance Reserves.” Adjustments to prior year
reserve estimates, if necessary, are reflected in the results of operations in
the period that the need for such adjustments is determined. The carried case
and IBNR reserves are provided in the Segment Results section of this MD&A
and in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under
Item 8.

The level of reserves CNA maintains
represents its best estimate, as of a particular point in time, of what the
ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on its
assessment of facts and circumstances known at that time. Reserves are not an
exact calculation of liability but instead are complex estimates that CNA
derives, generally utilizing a variety of actuarial reserve estimation
techniques, from numerous assumptions and expectations about future events, both
internal and external, many of which are highly uncertain.

CNA is subject to the uncertain effects
of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as industry
practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change.
These issues have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on CNA’s
business by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or
by increasing the number or size of claims. Examples of emerging or potential
claims and coverage issues include:

·

increases
      in the number and size of claims relating to injuries from medical
      products;

·

the
      effects of accounting and financial reporting scandals and other major
      corporate governance failures, which have resulted in an increase in the
      number and size of claims, including directors and officers (“D&O”)
      and errors and omissions (“E&O”) insurance
  claims;

·

class
      action litigation relating to claims handling and other
      practices;

·

construction
      defect claims, including claims for a broad range of additional insured
      endorsements on policies;


Item
7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

Results
of Operations – CNA Financial – (Continued)

·

clergy
      abuse claims, including passage of legislation to reopen or extend various
      statutes of limitations; and

·

mass
      tort claims, including bodily injury claims related to silica, welding
      rods, benzene, lead and various other chemical exposure
      claims.

CNA’s experience has been that
establishing reserves for casualty coverages relating to A&E claim and claim
adjustment expenses are subject to uncertainties that are greater than those
presented by other claims. Estimating the ultimate cost of both reported and
unreported A&E claims are subject to a higher degree of variability due to a
number of additional factors, including among others:

·

coverage
      issues, including whether certain costs are covered under the policies and
      whether policy limits apply;

·

inconsistent
      court decisions and developing legal
theories;

·

continuing
      aggressive tactics of plaintiffs’
lawyers;

·

the
      risks and lack of predictability inherent in major
    litigation;

·

changes
      in the volume of A&E claims;

·

the
      impact of the exhaustion of primary limits and the resulting increase in
      claims on any umbrella or excess policies CNA has
  issued;

·

the
      number and outcome of direct actions against CNA;
  and

·

CNA’s
      ability to recover reinsurance for A&E
  claims.

It is also not possible to predict
changes in the legal and legislative environment and the impact on the future
development of A&E claims. This development will be affected by future court
decisions and interpretations, as well as changes in applicable legislation. It
is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of large coverage disputes until
settlement negotiations near completion and significant legal questions are
resolved or, failing settlement, until the dispute is adjudicated. This is
particularly the case with policyholders in bankruptcy where negotiations often
involve a large number of claimants and other parties and require court approval
to be effective. A further uncertainty exists as to whether a national privately
financed trust to replace litigation of asbestos claims with payments to
claimants from the trust will be established and approved through federal
legislation, and, if established and approved, whether it will contain funding
requirements in excess of CNA’s carried loss reserves.

Traditional actuarial methods and
techniques employed to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional
property and casualty exposures are less precise in estimating claim and claim
adjustment reserves for A&E, particularly in an environment of emerging or
potential claims and coverage issues that arise from industry practices and
legal, judicial and social conditions. Therefore, these traditional actuarial
methods and techniques are necessarily supplemented with additional estimation
techniques and methodologies, many of which involve significant judgments that
are required of CNA management. For A&E, CNA regularly monitors its
exposures, including reviews of loss activity, regulatory developments and court
rulings. In addition, CNA performs a comprehensive ground-up analysis on its
exposures annually. CNA’s actuaries, in conjunction with its specialized claim
unit, use various modeling techniques to estimate its overall exposure to known
accounts. CNA uses this information and additional modeling techniques to
develop loss distributions and claim reporting patterns to determine reserves
for accounts that will report A&E exposure in the future. Estimating the
average claim size requires analysis of the impact of large losses and claim
cost trend based on changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property,
changes in the cost of legal fees, judicial decisions, legislative changes, and
other factors. Due to the inherent uncertainties in estimating reserves for
A&E claim and claim adjustment expenses and the degree of variability due
to, among other things, the factors described above, CNA may be required to
record material changes in our claim and claim adjustment expense reserves in
the future, should new information become available or other developments
emerge. See the A&E Reserves section of this MD&A and Note 9 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 for additional
information relating to A&E claims and reserves.

The impact of these and other unforeseen
emerging or potential claims and coverage issues is difficult to predict and
could materially adversely affect the adequacy of CNA’s claim and claim
adjustment expense reserves and could lead to future reserve additions. See the
Segment Results sections of this MD&A and Note 9 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 for a discussion of
changes in reserve estimates and the impact on our results of
operations.

Establishing
Reserve Estimates

In developing claim and claim adjustment
expense (“loss” or “losses”) reserve estimates, CNA’s actuaries perform detailed
reserve analyses that are staggered throughout the year. The data is organized
at a “product” level. A product can be a line of business covering a subset of
insureds such as commercial automobile liability for small and middle market
customers, it can encompass several lines of business provided to a specific set
of customers such as dentists, or it can be a particular type of claim such as
construction defect. Every product is analyzed at least once during the year,
and many products are analyzed multiple times. The analyses generally review
losses gross of ceded reinsurance and apply the ceded reinsurance terms to the
gross estimates to establish estimates net of reinsurance. In addition to the
detailed analyses, CNA reviews actual loss emergence for all products each
quarter.

The detailed analyses use a variety of
generally accepted actuarial methods and techniques to produce a number of
estimates of ultimate loss. CNA determines a point estimate of ultimate loss by
reviewing the various estimates and assigning weight to each estimate given the
characteristics of the product being reviewed. The reserve estimate is the
difference between the estimated ultimate loss and the losses paid to date. The
difference between the estimated ultimate loss and the case incurred loss (paid
loss plus case reserve) is IBNR. IBNR calculated as such includes a provision
for development on known cases (supplemental development) as well as a provision
for claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported (pure
IBNR).

Most of CNA’s business can be
characterized as long-tail. For long-tail business, it will generally be several
years between the time the business is written and the time when all claims are
settled. CNA’s long-tail exposures include commercial automobile liability,
workers’ compensation, general liability, medical malpractice, other
professional liability coverages, assumed reinsurance run-off and products
liability. Short-tail exposures include property, commercial automobile physical
damage, marine and warranty. Each of CNA’s property/casualty segments, Standard
Lines, Specialty Lines and Other Insurance, contain both long-tail and
short-tail exposures.

The methods used to project ultimate
loss for both long-tail and short-tail exposures include, but are not limited
to, the following:

·

Paid
      Development,

·

Incurred
      Development,

·

Loss
      Ratio,

·

Bornhuetter-Ferguson
      Using Premiums and Paid Loss,

·

Bornhuetter-Ferguson
      Using Premiums and Incurred Loss,
and

·

Average
      Loss.

The paid development method estimates
ultimate losses by reviewing paid loss patterns and applying them to accident
years with further expected changes in paid loss. Selection of the paid loss
pattern requires analysis of several factors including the impact of inflation
on claims costs, the rate at which claims professionals make claim payments and
close claims, the impact of judicial decisions, the impact of underwriting
changes, the impact of large claim payments and other factors. Claim cost
inflation itself requires evaluation of changes in the cost of repairing or
replacing property, changes in the cost of medical care, changes in the cost of
wage replacement, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors.
Because this method assumes that losses are paid at a consistent rate, changes
in any of these factors can impact the results. Since the method does not rely
on case reserves, it is not directly influenced by changes in the adequacy of
case reserves.

7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

of Operations – CNA Financial – (Continued)

For many products, paid loss data for
recent periods may be too immature or erratic for accurate predictions. This
situation often exists for long-tail exposures. In addition, changes in the
factors described above may result in inconsistent payment patterns. Finally,
estimating the paid loss pattern subsequent to the most mature point available
in the data analyzed often involves considerable uncertainty for long-tail
products such as workers’ compensation.

The incurred development method is
similar to the paid development method, but it uses case incurred losses instead
of paid losses. Since the method uses more data (case reserves in addition to
paid losses) than the paid development method, the incurred development patterns
may be less variable than paid patterns. However, selection of the incurred loss
pattern requires analysis of all of the factors above. In addition, the
inclusion of case reserves can lead to distortions if changes in case reserving
practices have taken place, and the use of case incurred losses may not
eliminate the issues associated with estimating the incurred loss pattern
subsequent to the most mature point available.

The loss ratio method multiplies
premiums by an expected loss ratio to produce ultimate loss estimates for each
accident year. This method may be useful if loss development patterns are
inconsistent, losses emerge very slowly, or there is relatively little loss
history from which to estimate future losses. The selection of the expected loss
ratio requires analysis of loss ratios from earlier accident years or pricing
studies and analysis of inflationary trends, frequency trends, rate changes,
underwriting changes, and other applicable factors.

The Bornhuetter-Ferguson using premiums
and paid loss method is a combination of the paid development approach and the
loss ratio approach. The method normally determines expected loss ratios similar
to the approach used to estimate the expected loss ratio for the loss ratio
method and requires analysis of the same factors described above. The method
assumes that only future losses will develop at the expected loss ratio level.
The percent of paid loss to ultimate loss implied from the paid development
method is used to determine what percentage of ultimate loss is yet to be paid.
The use of the pattern from the paid development method requires consideration
of all factors listed in the description of the paid development method. The
estimate of losses yet to be paid is added to current paid losses to estimate
the ultimate loss for each year. This method will react very slowly if actual
ultimate loss ratios are different from expectations due to changes not
accounted for by the expected loss ratio calculation.

The Bornhuetter-Ferguson using premiums
and incurred loss method is similar to the Bornhuetter-Ferguson using premiums
and paid loss method except that it uses case incurred losses. The use of case
incurred losses instead of paid losses can result in development patterns that
are less variable than paid patterns. However, the inclusion of case reserves
can lead to distortions if changes in case reserving have taken place, and the
method requires analysis of all the factors that need to be reviewed for the
loss ratio and incurred development methods.

The average loss method multiplies a
projected number of ultimate claims by an estimated ultimate average loss for
each accident year to produce ultimate loss estimates. Since projections of the
ultimate number of claims are often less variable than projections of ultimate
loss, this method can provide more reliable results for products where loss
development patterns are inconsistent or too variable to be relied on
exclusively. In addition, this method can more directly account for changes in
coverage that impact the number and size of claims. However, this method can be
difficult to apply to situations where very large claims or a substantial number
of unusual claims result in volatile average claim sizes. Projecting the
ultimate number of claims requires analysis of several factors including the
rate at which policyholders report claims to us, the impact of judicial
decisions, the impact of underwriting changes and other factors. Estimating the
ultimate average loss requires analysis of the impact of large losses and claim
cost trend based on changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property,
changes in the cost of medical care, changes in the cost of wage replacement,
judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors.

For other more complex products where
the above methods may not produce reliable indications, CNA uses additional
methods tailored to the characteristics of the specific situation. Such products
include construction defect losses and A&E.

For construction defect losses, CNA’s
actuaries organize losses by report year. Report year groups claims by the year
in which they were reported. To estimate losses from claims that have not been
reported, various extrapolation techniques are applied to the pattern of claims
that have been reported to estimate the number of claims yet to be reported.
This process requires analysis of several factors including the rate at which
policyholders report claims to


Item

Results of Operations

of Operations – CNA Financial – (Continued)

CNA, the
impact of judicial decisions, the impact of underwriting changes and other
factors. An average claim size is determined from past experience and applied to
the number of unreported claims to estimate reserves for these
claims.

For many exposures, especially those
that can be considered long-tail, a particular accident year may not have a
sufficient volume of paid losses to produce a statistically reliable estimate of
ultimate losses. In such a case, CNA’s actuaries typically assign more weight to
the incurred development method than to the paid development method. As claims
continue to settle and the volume of paid loss increases, the actuaries may
assign additional weight to the paid development method. For most of CNA’s
products, even the incurred losses for accident years that are early in the
claim settlement process will not be of sufficient volume to produce a reliable
estimate of ultimate losses. In these cases, CNA will not assign any weight to
the paid and incurred development methods. CNA will use loss ratio,
Bornhuetter-Ferguson and average loss methods. For short-tail exposures, the
paid and incurred development methods can often be relied on sooner primarily
because our history includes a sufficient number of years to cover the entire
period over which paid and incurred losses are expected to change. However, CNA
may also use loss ratio, Bornhuetter-Ferguson and average loss methods for
short-tail exposures.

Periodic
Reserve Reviews

The reserve analyses performed by CNA’s
actuaries result in point estimates. Each quarter, the results of the detailed
reserve reviews are summarized and discussed with CNA senior management to
determine the best estimate of reserves. This group considers many factors in
making this decision. The factors include, but are not limited to, the
historical pattern and volatility of the actuarial indications, the sensitivity
of the actuarial indications to changes in paid and incurred loss patterns, the
consistency of claims handling processes, the consistency of case reserving
practices, changes in our pricing and underwriting, and overall pricing and
underwriting trends in the insurance market.

CNA’s recorded reserves reflect its best
estimate as of a particular point in time based upon known facts, current law
and our judgment. The carried reserve may differ from the actuarial point
estimate as the result of CNA’s consideration of the factors noted above as well
as the potential volatility of the projections associated with the specific
product being analyzed and other factors impacting claims costs that may not be
quantifiable through traditional actuarial analysis. This process results in CNA
management’s best estimate which is then recorded as the loss
reserve.

Currently, CNA’s reserves are slightly
higher than the actuarial point estimate. CNA does not establish a specific
provision for uncertainty. For Standard and Specialty Lines, the difference
between CNA’s reserves and the actuarial point estimate is primarily due to the
three most recent accident years. The claim data from these accident years is
very immature. CNA believes it is prudent to wait until actual experience
confirms that the loss reserves should be adjusted. For Other Insurance, the
carried reserve is slightly higher than the actuarial point estimate. For
A&E exposures, CNA feels it is prudent, based on the history of developments
in this area and the volatility associated with the reserves, to be above the
point estimate until the ultimate outcome of the issues associated with these
exposures is clearer.

The key assumptions fundamental to the
reserving process are often different for various products and accident years.
Some of these assumptions are explicit assumptions that are required of a
particular method, but most of the assumptions are implicit and cannot be
precisely quantified. An example of an explicit assumption is the pattern
employed in the paid development method. However, the assumed pattern is itself
based on several implicit assumptions such as the impact of inflation on medical
costs and the rate at which claim professionals close claims. As a result, the
effect on reserve estimates of a particular change in assumptions usually cannot
be specifically quantified, and changes in these assumptions cannot be tracked
over time.

CNA’s recorded reserves are CNA
management’s best estimate. In order to provide an indication of the variability
associated with CNA’s net reserves, the following discussion provides a
sensitivity analysis that shows the approximate estimated impact of variations
in the most significant factor affecting CNA’s reserve estimates for particular
types of business. These significant factors are the ones that could most likely
materially impact the reserves. This discussion covers the major types of
business for which CNA believes a material deviation to CNA’s reserves is
reasonably possible. There can be no assurance that actual experience will be
consistent with the current assumptions or with the variation indicated by the
discussion. In addition, there can be no assurance that other factors and
assumptions will not have a material impact on CNA’s reserves.

Within Standard Lines, the two types of
business for which CNA believes a material deviation to its net reserves is
reasonably possible are workers’ compensation and general
liability.

For Standard Lines workers’
compensation, since many years will pass from the time the business is written
until all claim payments have been made, claim cost inflation on claim payments
is the most significant factor affecting workers’ compensation reserve
estimates. Workers’ compensation claim cost inflation is driven by the cost of
medical care, the cost of wage replacement, expected claimant lifetimes,
judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors. If estimated workers’
compensation claim cost inflation increases by one point for the entire period
over which claim payments will be made, CNA estimates that its net reserves
would increase by approximately $450 million. If estimated workers’ compensation
claim cost inflation decreases by one point for the entire period over which
claim payments will be made, CNA estimates that its net reserves would decrease
by approximately $400 million. CNA’s net reserves for Standard Lines workers’
compensation were approximately $4.5 billion at December 31, 2007.

For Standard Lines general liability,
the predominant method used for estimating reserves is the incurred development
method. Changes in the cost to repair or replace property, the cost of medical
care, the cost of wage replacement, judicial decisions, legislation and other
factors all impact the pattern selected in this method. The pattern selected
results in the incurred development factor that estimates future changes in case
incurred loss. If the estimated incurred development factor for general
liability increases by 13.0%, CNA estimates that its net reserves would increase
by approximately $300 million. If the estimated incurred development factor for
general liability decreases by 9.0%, CNA estimates that its net reserves would
decrease by approximately $200 million. CNA’s net reserves for Standard Lines
general liability were approximately $3.5 billion at December 31,
2007.

Within Specialty Lines, CNA believes a
material deviation to its net reserves is reasonably possible for professional
liability and related business in the U.S. Specialty Lines group. This business
includes professional liability coverages provided to various professional
firms, including architects, realtors, small and mid-sized accounting firms, law
firms and technology firms. This business also includes D&O, employment
practices, fiduciary and fidelity coverages as well as insurance products
serving the healthcare delivery system. The most significant factor affecting
reserve estimates for this business is claim severity. Claim severity is driven
by the cost of medical care, the cost of wage replacement, legal fees, judicial
decisions, legislation and other factors. Underwriting and claim handling
decisions such as the classes of business written and individual claim
settlement decisions can also impact claim severity. If the estimated claim
severity increases by 7.0%, CNA estimates that the net reserves would increase
by approximately $300 million. If the estimated claim severity decreases by
2.0%, CNA estimates that net reserves would decrease by approximately $100
million. CNA’s net reserves for this business were approximately $4.4 billion at
December 31, 2007.

Within Other Insurance, the two types of
business for which CNA believes a material deviation to its net reserves is
reasonably possible are CNA Re and A&E.

For CNA Re, the predominant method used
for estimating reserves is the incurred development method. Changes in the cost
to repair or replace property, the cost of medical care, the cost of wage
replacement, the rate at which ceding companies report claims, judicial
decisions, legislation and other factors all impact the incurred development
pattern for CNA Re. The pattern selected results in the incurred development
factor that estimates future changes in case incurred loss. If the estimated
incurred development factor for CNA Re increases by 22.0%, CNA estimates that
its net reserves for CNA Re would increase by approximately $150 million. If the
estimated incurred development factor for CNA Re decreases by 22.0%, CNA
estimates that its net reserves would decrease by approximately $150 million.
CNA’s net reserves for CNA Re were approximately $1.0 billion at December 31,
2007.

For A&E, the most significant factor
affecting reserve estimates is overall account size trend. Overall account size
trend for A&E reflects the combined impact of economic trends (inflation),
changes in the types of defendants involved, the expected mix of asbestos
disease types, judicial decisions, legislation and other factors. If the
estimated overall account size trend for A&E increases by 4 points, CNA
estimates that its A&E net reserves would increase by approximately $350
million. If the estimated overall account size trend for A&E decreases by 4
points, CNA estimates that its A&E net reserves would decrease by
approximately $250 million. CNA’s net reserves for A&E were approximately
$1.6 billion at December 31, 2007.

Given the factors described above, it is
not possible to quantify precisely the ultimate exposure represented by claims
and related litigation. As a result, CNA regularly reviews the adequacy of its
reserves and reassesses its reserve estimates

as
historical loss experience develops, additional claims are reported and settled
and additional information becomes available in subsequent periods.

In light of the many uncertainties
associated with establishing the estimates and making the assumptions necessary
to establish reserve levels, CNA reviews its reserve estimates on a regular
basis and make adjustments in the period that the need for such adjustments is
determined. These reviews have resulted in CNA’s identification of information
and trends that have caused CNA to increase its reserves in prior periods and
could lead to the identification of a need for additional material increases in
claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, which could materially adversely
affect CNA’s business and insurer financial strength and debt ratings and our
results of operations and equity. See the Ratings section of this MD&A for
further information regarding our financial strength and debt
ratings.

Reinsurance

Due to significant catastrophes
during 2005, the cost of CNA’s catastrophe reinsurance program has
increased.  CNA’s catastrophe reinsurance protection cost CNA $93
million and $79 million in 2007 and 2006, neither of which included
reinstatement premiums.  Currently, the 2008 catastrophe reinsurance
program will cost CNA $55 million before the impact of any reinstatement
premiums.

The terms of CNA’s 2008 catastrophe
programs are different than those of its 2007 programs.  The Corporate
Property Catastrophe treaty provides coverage for the accumulation of losses
between $300 million and $900 million arising out of a single catastrophe
occurrence in the United States, its territories and possessions, and
Canada.  CNA’s co-participation is 35.0% of the first $100 million
layer of the coverage provided and 5.0% of the remaining
layers.  Additional protection above $900 million may be purchased in
either the traditional reinsurance or financial markets prior to June 1, 2008
depending on market conditions.

Further information on CNA’s
reinsurance program is included in Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included under Item 8.

Restructuring

In 2001, CNA finalized and approved a
plan related to restructuring the property and casualty segments and Life &
Group Non-Core segment, discontinuation of its variable life and annuity
business and consolidation of real estate locations. During 2006, CNA
reevaluated the sufficiency of the remaining accrual, which related to lease
termination costs, and determined that the liability was no longer required as
CNA had completed its lease obligations. As a result, the excess remaining
accrual was released in 2006, resulting in income of $7 million after tax and
minority interest for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Segment
Results

The following discusses the results of
continuing operations for CNA’s operating segments.

CNA’s core property and casualty
commercial insurance operations are reported in two business segments: Standard
Lines and Specialty Lines. As a result of CNA’s realignment of management
responsibilities in the fourth quarter of 2007, CNA has revised its property and
casualty segments as if the current segment changes occurred as of the beginning
of the earliest period presented. Standard Lines includes standard property and
casualty coverages sold to small businesses and middle market entities and
organizations in the U.S. primarily through an independent agency distribution
system. Standard Lines also includes commercial insurance and risk management
products sold to large corporations in the U.S. primarily through insurance
brokers. Specialty Lines provides a broad array of professional, financial and
specialty property and casualty products and services, including excess and
surplus lines, primarily through insurance brokers and managing general
underwriters. Specialty Lines also includes insurance coverages sold globally
through CNA’s foreign operations (“CNA Global”). Previously, excess and surplus
lines and CNA Global were included in Standard Lines.

Standard Lines previously included other
revenues and expenses related to claim services provided by CNA ClaimPlus, Inc.
to other units within the Standard Lines segment because these revenues and
expenses were eliminated at the consolidated level. These amounts are now
eliminated within Standard Lines for all periods presented.

CNA’s property and casualty field
structure consists of 33 branch locations across the country organized into 2
territories. Each branch provides the marketing, underwriting and risk control
expertise on the entire portfolio of products. The Centralized Processing
Operation for small and middle-market customers, located in Maitland, Florida,
handles policy processing, billing and collection activities, and also acts as a
call center to optimize customer service. The claims structure consists of a
centralized claim center designed to efficiently handle property damage and
medical only claims and 14 claim office locations around the country handling
the more complex claims.

CNA utilizes the net operating income
financial measure to monitor its operations. Net operating income is calculated
by excluding from net income the after tax and minority interest effects of (1)
net realized investment gains or losses, (2) income or loss from discontinued
operations and (3) any cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles.
In evaluating the results of our Standard Lines and Specialty Lines segments,
CNA management utilizes the loss ratio, the expense ratio, the dividend ratio,
and the combined ratio. These ratios are calculated using GAAP financial
results. The loss ratio is the percentage of net incurred claim and claim
adjustment expenses to net earned premiums. The expense ratio is the percentage
of insurance underwriting and acquisition expenses, including the amortization
of deferred acquisition costs, to net earned premiums. The dividend ratio is the
ratio of policyholders’ dividends incurred to net earned premiums. The combined
ratio is the sum of the loss, expense and dividend ratios.

Net written premiums for Standard Lines
decreased $331 million in 2007 as compared with 2006, primarily due to decreased
production. The decreased production reflects CNA’s disciplined participation in
the current competitive market. The competitive market conditions are expected
to put ongoing pressure on premium and income levels, and the expense ratio. Net
earned premiums decreased $178 million in 2007 as compared with 2006, consistent
with the decreased premiums written.

Standard Lines averaged rate decreases
of 4% for 2007, as compared to flat rates for 2006 for the contracts that
renewed during those periods. Retention rates of 79% and 81% were achieved for
those contracts that were available for renewal in each period.

Net income increased $3 million in 2007
as compared with 2006. This increase was primarily attributable to improved net
operating income, offset by decreased net realized investment results. See the
Investments section of this MD&A for further discussion of net investment
income and net realized investment results.

Net operating income increased $131
million in 2007 as compared with 2006. This increase was primarily driven by
favorable net prior year development in 2007 as compared to unfavorable net
prior year development in 2006 and increased net investment income. These
favorable impacts were partially offset by decreased current accident year
underwriting results including increased catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses
were $43 million after tax and minority interest in 2007, as compared to $32
million after tax and minority interest in 2006.

The combined ratio improved 4.5 points
in 2007 as compared with 2006. The loss ratio improved 5.1 points primarily due
to favorable net prior year development in 2007 as compared to unfavorable net
prior year development in 2006. This favorable impact was partially offset by
higher current accident year loss ratios primarily related to the decline in
rates.

The dividend ratio improved 0.3 points
in 2007 as compared with 2006 due to favorable dividend development in the
workers’ compensation line of business.

The expense ratio increased 0.9 points
in 2007 as compared with 2006, primarily reflecting the impact of declining
earned premiums.

Favorable net prior year development of
$123 million was recorded in 2007, including $104 million of favorable claim and
allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development and $19 million of
favorable premium development. Unfavorable net prior year development of $150
million, including $208 million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim
adjustment expense reserve development and $58 million of favorable premium
development, was recorded in 2006. Further information on Standard Lines Net
Prior Year Development for 2007 and 2006 is included in Note 9 of the Notes to

primarily driven by favorable new business, rate and retention in the property
products. Net earned premiums increased $39 million in 2006 as compared with
2005, consistent with the increased premiums written.

Standard Lines averaged flat rates for
2006, as compared to decreases of 2.0% for 2005 for the contracts that renewed
during those periods. Retention rates of 81.0% and 76.0% were achieved for those
contracts that were up for renewal in each period.

Net results increased $508 million in

catastrophe impacts of $28 million after tax and minority interest. The 2005 net
operating results included catastrophe impacts of $290 million after tax and

Ophelia, net of reinsurance recoveries.

The combined ratio improved 19.0 points
in 2006 as compared with 2005. The loss ratio improved 17.8 points due to
decreased unfavorable net prior year development as discussed below and
decreased catastrophe losses in 2006. The 2006 and 2005 loss ratios included 1.5
and 13.9 points related to the impact of catastrophes.

The expense ratio improved 1.1 points in
2006 as compared with 2005. This improvement was primarily due to a decrease in
the provision for insurance bad debt. In addition, the 2005 ratio included
increased ceded commissions as a result of an unfavorable arbitration ruling
related to two reinsurance treaties. Changes in estimates for premium taxes
partially offset these favorable impacts.

Unfavorable net prior year development
of $150 million was recorded in 2006, including $208 million of unfavorable
claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development and $58 million
of favorable premium development. Unfavorable net prior year development of $403
million, including $433 million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim
adjustment expense reserve development and $30 million of favorable premium
development, was recorded in 2005. Further information on Standard Lines Net
Prior Year Development for 2006 and 2005 is included in Note 9 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

During 2006 and 2005, CNA commuted
several significant reinsurance contracts that resulted in unfavorable
development of $110 million and $255 million, which is included in the
development above, and which was partially offset by the release of previously
established allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. These commutations resulted
in an unfavorable after tax and minority interest impact of $28 million and $139
million in 2006 and 2005. Several of the commuted contracts contained interest
crediting provisions. The interest charges associated with the reinsurance
contracts commuted were $8 million after tax and minority interest and $37
million after tax and minority interest in 2006 and 2005. The 2005 amount
includes the interest charges associated with the contract commuted in 2006.
There will be no further interest crediting charges related to these commuted
contracts in future periods.

Net written premiums for Specialty Lines
increased $75 million in 2007 as compared with 2006. Premiums written were
unfavorably impacted by decreased production as compared with the same period in
2006. The decreased production reflects CNA’s disciplined participation in the
current competitive market. The competitive market conditions are expected to
put ongoing pressure on premium and income levels, and the expense ratio. This
unfavorable impact was

more than
offset by decreased ceded premiums. The U.S. Specialty Lines reinsurance
structure was primarily quota share reinsurance through April 2007. CNA elected
not to renew this coverage upon its expiration. With CNA’s current
diversification in the previously reinsured lines of business and its management
of the gross limits on the business written, CNA did not believe the cost of
renewing the program was commensurate with its projected benefit. Net earned
premiums increased $73 million as compared with the same period in 2006,
consistent with the increased net premiums written.

Specialty Lines averaged rate decreases
of 3.0% for 2007, as compared to decreases of 1% for 2006 for the contracts that
renewed during those periods. Retention rates of 83.0% and 85.0% were achieved
for those contracts that were up for renewal in each period.

Net income decreased $93 million in 2007
as compared with 2006. This decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in
net realized investment results. See the Investments section of this MD&A
for further discussion of net investment income and net realized investment
results.

Net operating income decreased $23
million in 2007 as compared with 2006. This decrease was primarily driven by
decreased current accident year underwriting results and less favorable net
prior year development. These decreases were partially offset by increased net
investment income and favorable experience in the warranty line of
business.

The combined ratio increased 1.8 points
in 2007 as compared with 2006. The loss ratio increased 2.4 points, primarily
due to higher current accident year losses related to the decline in rates and
less favorable net prior year development as discussed below.

The expense ratio improved 0.7 points in
2007 as compared with 2006. This improvement was primarily due to a favorable
change in estimate related to dealer profit commissions in the warranty line of
business.

Favorable net prior year development of
$36 million was recorded in 2007, including $25 million of favorable claim and
allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development and $11 million of
favorable premium development. Favorable net prior year development of $66
million, including $61 million of favorable claim and allocated claim adjustment
expense reserve development and $5 million of favorable premium development, was
recorded in 2006. Further information on Specialty Lines Net Prior Year
Development for 2007 and 2006 is included in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated

Net income increased $246 million in
2006 as compared with 2005. This increase was attributable to increases in net
operating income and net realized investment gains. See the Investments section
of this MD&A for further discussion of net investment income and net
realized investment results.

Net operating income increased $225
million in 2006 as compared with 2005. This improvement was primarily driven by
an increase in net investment income, a decrease in net prior year development
as discussed below and reduced catastrophe impacts in 2006. Catastrophe impacts
were $1 million after tax and minority interest for the year ended December 31,
2006, as compared to $15 million after tax and minority interest for the year
ended December 31, 2005. The 2005 results also included a $54 million loss,
after taxes and minority interest, in the surety line of business related to a
large national contractor. Further information related to the large national
contractor is included in Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included under Item 8.

The combined ratio improved 7.9 points
in 2006 as compared with 2005. The loss ratio improved 7.9 points, due to
decreased net prior year development as discussed below and improved current
accident year impacts. The 2005 loss ratio was unfavorably impacted by surety
losses of $110 million, before taxes and minority interest, related to a
national contractor as discussed above. Partially offsetting this favorable
impact was less favorable current accident year loss ratios across several other
lines of business in 2006.

Favorable net prior year development of
$66 million was recorded in 2006, including $61 million of favorable claim and
allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development and $5 million of
favorable premium development. Unfavorable net prior year development of $103
million, including $173 million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim
adjustment expense reserve development and $70 million of favorable premium
development, was recorded in 2005. Further information on Specialty Lines Net
Prior Year Development for 2006 and 2005 is included in Note 9 of the Notes to

Net earned premiums for Life & Group
Non-Core decreased $23 million in 2007 as compared with 2006. The 2007 and 2006
net earned premiums relate primarily to the group and individual long term care
businesses.

The net loss increased $131 million in
2007 as compared with 2006. The increase in net loss was primarily due to the
after tax and minority interest loss of $96 million related to the settlement of
the IGI contingency. The IGI contingency related to reinsurance arrangements
with respect to personal accident insurance coverages between 1997 and 1999
which were the subject of arbitration proceedings. CNA reached an agreement in
2007 to settle the arbitration matter for a one-time payment of $250 million,
which resulted in an incurred loss, net of reinsurance, of $167 million pretax.
The decreased net investment income included a decline of net investment income
in the trading portfolio of $82 million, a significant portion of which was
offset by a corresponding decrease in the policyholders’ funds reserves
supported by the trading portfolio. The trading portfolio supports our pension
deposit business, which experienced a decline in net results of $29 million in
2007 compared to 2006. See the Investments section of this MD&A for further
discussion of net investment income and net realized investment
results.

Net earned premiums for Life & Group
Non-Core decreased $63 million in 2006 as compared with 2005.

Net loss decreased $21 million in 2006
as compared with 2005, driven by increased net investment income. A significant
portion of the increase in net investment income was offset by a corresponding
increase in the policyholders’ funds reserves supported by the trading
portfolio. The portion not offset by the policyholders’ funds reserves increased
by $23 million. Also impacting net loss was $14 million of income related to the
resolution of contingencies and the absence of a $15 million provision recorded
in 2005 for estimated indemnification liabilities related to the sold individual
life business. Partially offsetting these favorable impacts were increased net
realized investment losses and the absence of income related to agreements with
buyers of sold businesses, which ended as of December 31, 2005. In addition, the
2005 net results included a change in estimate, which reduced a prior accrual of
state premium taxes. See the Investments section of this MD&A for further
discussion of net investment income and net realized investment
results.

Revenues decreased $65 million in 2007
as compared with 2006. Revenues were unfavorably impacted by decreased net
realized investment results. See the Investments section of this MD&A for
further discussion of net investment income and net realized investment
results.

Net results decreased $51 million in
2007 as compared with 2006. The decrease in net results was primarily due to
decreased revenues as discussed above, increased current accident year losses
related to certain mass torts and an increase in interest costs on corporate
debt. In addition, the 2006 results included a release of a restructuring
accrual. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by a change in estimate
related to federal taxes and lower expenses.

Unfavorable net prior year development
of $86 million was recorded during 2007, including $91 million of unfavorable
net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development
and $5 million of favorable premium development. Unfavorable net prior year
development of $88 million was recorded in 2006, including $86 million of
unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
development and $2 million of unfavorable premium development. Further

Revenues decreased $14 million in 2006
as compared with 2005. Revenues in 2006 and 2005 included interest income
related to federal income tax settlements of $4 million and $121 million as
further discussed in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included under Item 8. This decrease was substantially offset by increased net
investment income and improved net realized investment results. See the
Investments section of this MD&A for further discussion of net investment
income and net realized investment results.

Net results increased $27 million in
2006 as compared with 2005. The improvement was primarily driven by a decrease
in unfavorable net prior year development as discussed further below. Offsetting
this favorable impact was an increase in current accident year losses related to
certain mass torts, discontinuation of royalty income related to a sold business
and increased interest costs related to the issuance of $750 million of senior
notes in August 2006.

Unfavorable net prior year development
of $88 million was recorded during 2006, including $86 million of unfavorable
net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development
and $2 million of unfavorable premium development. Unfavorable net prior year
development of $306 million was recorded in 2005, including $291 million of
unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
development and $15 million of unfavorable premium development. Further
information on Corporate & Other Non-Core’s Net Prior Year Development for
2006 and 2005 is included in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included under Item 8.

During 2005, CNA commuted several
significant reinsurance contracts that resulted in unfavorable development of
$118 million, which is included in the development above. These commutations
resulted in unfavorable impacts of  $65 million after tax and minority
interest in 2005. These contracts contained interest crediting provisions and
maintenance charges. Interest charges associated with the reinsurance contracts
commuted were $12 million after tax and minority interest in 2005. There will be
no further interest crediting charges or other charges related to these commuted
contracts in future periods.

A&E
Reserves

CNA’s property and casualty insurance
subsidiaries have actual and potential exposures related to A&E claims.
Establishing reserves for A&E claim and claim adjustment expenses is subject
to uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims.
Traditional actuarial methods and techniques employed to estimate the ultimate
cost of claims for more traditional property and casualty exposures are less
precise in estimating claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for A&E,
particularly in an environment of emerging or potential claims and coverage
issues that arise from industry practices and legal, judicial, and social
conditions. Therefore, these traditional actuarial methods and techniques are
necessarily supplemented with additional estimating techniques and
methodologies, many of which involve significant judgments that are required on
CNA’s part. Accordingly, a high degree of uncertainty remains for CNA’s ultimate
liability for A&E claim and claim adjustment expenses.

In addition to the difficulties
described above, estimating the ultimate cost of both reported and unreported
A&E claims is subject to a higher degree of variability due to a number of
additional factors, including among others: the


Item

Results of Operations

number
and outcome of direct actions against CNA; coverage issues, including whether
certain costs are covered under the policies and whether policy limits apply;
allocation of liability among numerous parties, some of whom may be in
bankruptcy proceedings, and in particular the application of “joint and several”
liability to specific insurers on a risk; inconsistent court decisions and
developing legal theories; continuing aggressive tactics of plaintiffs’ lawyers;
the risks and lack of predictability inherent in major litigation; enactment of
state and federal legislation to address asbestos claims; the potential for
increases and decreases in A&E claims which cannot now be anticipated; the
potential for increases and decreases in costs to defend A&E claims; the
possibility of expanding theories of liability against CNA’s policyholders in
A&E matters; possible exhaustion of underlying umbrella and excess coverage;
and future developments pertaining to CNA’s ability to recover reinsurance for
A&E claims.

Due to the inherent uncertainties in
estimating claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for A&E and due to
the significant uncertainties described related to A&E claims, CNA’s
ultimate liability for these cases, both individually and in aggregate, may
exceed the recorded reserves. Any such potential additional liability, or any
range of potential additional amounts, cannot be reasonably estimated currently,
but could be material to CNA’s business, insurer financial strength and debt
ratings and our results of operations and equity. Due to, among other things,
the factors described above, it may be necessary for CNA to record material
changes in its A&E claim and claim adjustment expense reserves in the
future, should new information become available or other developments
emerge.

CNA has annually performed ground up
reviews of all open A&E claims to evaluate the adequacy of its A&E
reserves. In performing the comprehensive ground up analysis, CNA considers
input from its professionals with direct responsibility for the claims, inside
and outside counsel with responsibility for its representation and its actuarial
staff. These professionals consider, among many factors, the policyholder’s
present and predicted future exposures, including such factors as claims volume,
trial conditions, prior settlement history, settlement demands and defense
costs; the impact of asbestos defendant bankruptcies on the policyholder; facts
or allegations regarding the policies CNA issued or are alleged to have issued,
including such factors as aggregate or per occurrence limits, whether the policy
is primary, umbrella or excess, and the existence of policyholder retentions
and/or deductibles; the policyholders’ allegations;  the existence of
other insurance; and reinsurance arrangements.

Further information on A&E claim and
claim adjustment expense reserves and net prior year development is included in
Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item
8.

Asbestos

In the past several years, CNA
experienced, at certain points in time, significant increases in claim counts
for asbestos-related claims. The factors that led to these increases included,
among other things, intensive advertising campaigns by lawyers for asbestos
claimants, mass medical screening programs sponsored by plaintiff lawyers and
the addition of new defendants such as the distributors and installers of
products containing asbestos. In recent years, the rate of new filings has
decreased. Various challenges to mass screening claimants have been successful.
Historically, the majority of asbestos bodily injury claims have been filed by
persons exhibiting few, if any, disease symptoms. Studies have concluded that
the percentage of unimpaired claimants to total claimants ranges between 66.0%
and up to 90.0%. Some courts and some state statutes mandate that so-called
“unimpaired” claimants may not recover unless at some point the claimant’s
condition worsens to the point of impairment. Some plaintiffs classified as
“unimpaired” continue to challenge those orders and statutes. Therefore, the
ultimate impact of the orders and statutes on future asbestos claims remains
uncertain.


Item
7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

Results
of Operations – CNA Financial – (Continued)

Despite the decrease in new claim
filings in recent years, there are several factors, in CNA’s view, negatively
impacting asbestos claim trends. Plaintiff attorneys who previously sued
entities that are now bankrupt continue to seek other viable targets. As
plaintiff attorneys named additional defendants to new and existing asbestos
bodily injury lawsuits, we experienced an increase in the total number of
policyholders with current asbestos claims. Companies with few or no previous
asbestos claims are becoming targets in asbestos litigation and, although they
may have little or no liability, nevertheless must be defended. Additionally,
plaintiff attorneys and trustees for future claimants are demanding that policy
limits be paid lump-sum into the bankruptcy asbestos trusts prior to
presentation of valid claims and medical proof of these claims. Various
challenges to these practices have succeeded in litigation, and are continuing
to be litigated. Plaintiff attorneys and trustees for future claimants are also
attempting to devise claims payment procedures for bankruptcy trusts that would
allow asbestos claims to be paid under lax standards for injury, exposure and
causation. This also presents the potential for exhausting policy limits in an
accelerated fashion. Challenges to these practices are being mounted, though the
ultimate impact or success of these tactics remains uncertain.

CNA has resolved a number of its large
asbestos accounts by negotiating settlement agreements. Structured settlement
agreements provide for payments over multiple years as set forth in each
individual agreement.

In 1985, 47 asbestos producers and their
insurers, including The Continental Insurance Company (“CIC”), executed the
Wellington Agreement. The agreement was intended to resolve all issues and
litigation related to coverage for asbestos exposures. Under this agreement,
signatory insurers committed scheduled policy limits and made the limits
available to pay asbestos claims based upon coverage blocks designated by the
policyholders in 1985, subject to extension by policyholders. CIC was a
signatory insurer to the Wellington Agreement.

CNA has also used coverage in place
agreements to resolve large asbestos exposures. Coverage in place agreements are
typically agreements between CNA and its policyholders identifying the policies
and the terms for payment of asbestos related liabilities. Claim payments are
contingent on presentation of adequate documentation showing exposure during the
policy periods and other documentation supporting the demand for claim payment.
Coverage in place agreements may have annual payment caps. Coverage in place
agreements are evaluated based on claims filings trends and
severities.

CNA categorizes active asbestos accounts
as large or small accounts. CNA defines a large account as an active account
with more than $100,000 of cumulative paid losses. CNA has made resolving large
accounts a significant management priority. Small accounts are defined as active
accounts with $100,000 or less of cumulative paid losses. Approximately 81.2%
and 83.1% of CNA’s total active asbestos accounts are classified as small
accounts at December 31, 2007 and 2006.

CNA also evaluates its asbestos
liabilities arising from its assumed reinsurance business and its participation
in various pools, including Excess & Casualty Reinsurance Association
(“ECRA”).

IBNR reserves relate to potential
development on accounts that have not settled and potential future claims from
unidentified policyholders.

Some asbestos-related defendants have
asserted that their insurance policies are not subject to aggregate limits on
coverage. CNA has such claims from a number of insureds. Some of these claims
involve insureds facing exhaustion of products liability aggregate limits in
their policies, who have asserted that their asbestos-related claims fall within
so-called “non-products” liability coverage contained within their policies
rather than products liability coverage, and that the claimed “non-products”
coverage is not subject to any aggregate limit. It is difficult to predict the
ultimate size of any of the claims for coverage purportedly not subject to
aggregate limits or predict to what extent, if any, the attempts to assert
“non-products” claims outside the products liability aggregate will succeed.
CNA’s policies also contain other limits applicable to these claims and CNA has
additional coverage defenses to certain claims. CNA has attempted to manage its
asbestos exposure by aggressively seeking to settle claims on acceptable terms.
There can be no assurance that any of these settlement efforts will be
successful, or that any such claims can be settled on terms acceptable to CNA.
Where CNA cannot settle a claim on acceptable terms, CNA aggressively litigates
the claim. However, adverse developments with respect to such matters could have
a material adverse effect on our results of operations and/or
equity.

As a result of the uncertainties and
complexities involved, reserves for asbestos claims cannot be estimated with
traditional actuarial techniques that rely on historical accident year loss
development factors. In establishing asbestos reserves, CNA evaluates the
exposure presented by each insured. As part of this evaluation, CNA considers
the available insurance coverage; limits and deductibles; the potential role of
other insurance, particularly underlying coverage below any of its excess
liability policies; and applicable coverage defenses, including asbestos
exclusions. Estimation of asbestos-related claim and claim adjustment expense
reserves involves a high degree of judgment on CNA’s part and consideration of
many complex factors, including: inconsistency of court decisions, jury
attitudes and future court decisions; specific policy provisions; allocation of
liability among insurers and insureds; missing policies and proof of coverage;
the proliferation of bankruptcy proceedings and attendant uncertainties; novel
theories asserted by policyholders and their counsel; the targeting of a broader
range of businesses and entities as defendants; the uncertainty as to which
other insureds may be targeted in the future and the uncertainties inherent in
predicting the number of future claims; volatility in claim numbers and
settlement demands; increases in the number of non-impaired claimants and the
extent to which they can be precluded from making claims; the efforts by
insureds to obtain coverage not subject to aggregate limits; long latency period
between asbestos exposure and disease manifestation and the resulting potential
for involvement of multiple policy periods for individual claims; medical
inflation trends; the mix of asbestos-related diseases presented and the ability
to recover reinsurance.

CNA is involved in significant
asbestos-related claim litigation, which is described in Note 9 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

Environmental
Pollution

Environmental pollution cleanup is the
subject of both federal and state regulation. By some estimates, there are
thousands of potential waste sites subject to cleanup. The insurance industry
has been involved in extensive litigation regarding coverage issues. Judicial
interpretations in many cases have expanded the scope of coverage and liability
beyond the original intent of the policies. The Comprehensive Environmental
Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (“Superfund”) and comparable
state statutes (“mini-Superfunds”) govern the cleanup and restoration of toxic
waste sites and formalize the concept of legal liability for cleanup and
restoration by “Potentially Responsible Parties” (“PRPs”). Superfund and the
mini-Superfunds establish mechanisms to pay for cleanup of waste sites if PRPs
fail to do so and assign liability to PRPs. The extent of liability to be
allocated to a PRP is dependent upon a variety of factors. Further, the number
of waste sites subject to cleanup is unknown. To date, approximately 1,500
cleanup sites have been identified by the Environmental Protection Agency
(“EPA”) and included on its National Priorities List (“NPL”). State authorities
have designated many cleanup sites as well.

Many policyholders have made claims
against CNA for defense costs and indemnification in connection with
environmental pollution matters. The vast majority of these claims relate to
accident years 1989 and prior, which coincides with CNA’s adoption of the
Simplified Commercial General Liability coverage form, which includes what is
referred to in the industry as absolute pollution exclusion. CNA and the
insurance industry are disputing coverage for many such claims. Key coverage
issues include whether cleanup costs are considered damages under the policies,
trigger of coverage, allocation of liability among triggered policies,
applicability of pollution exclusions and owned property exclusions, the
potential for joint and several liability and the definition of an occurrence.
To date, courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these
issues.

CNA has made resolution of large
environmental pollution exposures a management priority. CNA has resolved a
number of its large environmental accounts by negotiating settlement agreements.
In its settlements, CNA sought to resolve those exposures and obtain the
broadest release language to avoid future claims from the same policyholders
seeking coverage for sites or claims that had not emerged at the time CNA
settled with its policyholder. While the terms of each settlement agreement
vary, CNA sought to obtain broad environmental releases that include known and
unknown sites, claims and policies. The broad scope of the release provisions
contained in those settlement agreements should, in many cases, prevent future
exposure from settled policyholders. It remains uncertain, however, whether a
court interpreting the language of the settlement agreements will adhere to the
intent of the parties and uphold the broad scope of language of the
agreements.

CNA classifies its environmental
pollution accounts into several categories, which include structured
settlements, coverage in place agreements and active accounts. Structured
settlement agreements provide for payments over multiple years as set forth in
each individual agreement.

CNA has also used coverage in place
agreements to resolve pollution exposures. Coverage in place agreements are
typically agreements between CNA and its policyholders identifying the policies
and the terms for payment of pollution related liabilities. Claim payments are
contingent on presentation of adequate documentation of damages during the
policy periods and other documentation supporting the demand for claim payment.
Coverage in place agreements may have annual payment caps.

CNA categorizes active accounts as large
or small accounts in the pollution area. CNA defines a large account as an
active account with more than $100,000 cumulative paid losses. CNA has made
closing large accounts a significant management priority. Small accounts are
defined as active accounts with $100,000 or less cumulative paid losses.
Approximately 72.6% and 75.1% of CNA’s total active pollution accounts are
classified as small accounts at December 31, 2007 and 2006.

CNA also evaluates its environmental
pollution exposures arising from its assumed reinsurance and our participation
in various pools, including ECRA.

CNA carries unassigned IBNR reserves for
environmental pollution. These reserves relate to potential development on
accounts that have not settled and potential future claims from unidentified
policyholders.

The tables below depict CNA’s overall
pending environmental pollution accounts and associated reserves at December 31,
2007 and 2006.

Compared with 2006

Revenues increased by $220 million, or
5.7%, and net income increased by $72 million, or 8.6%, in 2007, as compared to
2006.

The increase in revenues in 2007, as
compared to 2006, is due to higher net sales of $214 million and higher
investment income of $6 million. Net sales revenue increased $155 million due to
higher average unit prices resulting from December 2006 and September 2007 price
increases and $136 million due to higher effective unit prices
reflecting

lower
sales promotion expenses, partially offset by a decrease of $77 million due to a
reduction in unit sales volume, assuming prices were unchanged from the prior
year.

Net income increased in 2007, as
compared to 2006, due primarily to the higher revenues discussed above and lower
income tax expense, partially offset by a $26 million increase in promotional
product expenses included in cost of manufactured products sold, higher State
Settlement Agreement costs as described below, and higher other operating
expenses due to a charge of $66 million related to litigation. Other operating
expenses in 2006 included $20 million of costs related to a restructuring of the
sales organization. Income tax expense in 2007 was $33 million lower due
primarily to the statutory increase in the tax benefit related to the
manufacturer’s deduction and the favorable resolution of certain state tax
uncertainties.

Lorillard recorded pretax charges of
$1,048 million and $911 million ($680 million and $560 million after taxes) for
2007 and 2006, respectively, to record its obligations under settlement
agreements entered into between the major cigarette manufacturers, including
Lorillard, and each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth
of Puerto Rico and certain U.S. territories (together, the “State Settlement
Agreements”). Lorillard’s portion of ongoing adjusted settlement payments and
related legal fees is based on its share of domestic cigarette shipments in the
year preceding that in which the payment is due. Accordingly, Lorillard records
its portion of ongoing settlement payments as part of cost of manufactured
products sold as the related sales occur. The $137 million pretax increase in
tobacco settlement costs in 2007 is due to an increase in the payment base ($102
million) effective January 1, 2007, the impact of the inflation adjustment ($38
million), and other adjustments ($7 million), partially offset by lower gross
unit sales ($10 million) under the State Settlement Agreements.

Lorillard regularly reviews results
of its promotional spending activities and adjusts its promotional spending
programs in an effort to maintain its competitive position. Accordingly, unit
sales volume and sales promotion costs in any particular period are not
necessarily indicative of sales and costs that may be realized in subsequent
periods.

Overall, domestic industry unit sales
volume decreased 5.0% in 2007, as compared with 2006. Industry sales for premium
brands were 72.8% of the total market in 2007, as compared to 71.9% in
2006.

Lorillard’s total (domestic, Puerto Rico
and certain U.S. Territories) gross unit sales volume and Domestic Lorillard
unit sales volume decreased 0.8% in 2007, as compared to 2006. Total and
Domestic Newport unit sales volume decreased 0.8% in 2007 as compared with 2006.
On-going competitive promotions and the availability of deep discount brands
continue to affect these results.

Deep discount brands are produced by
manufacturers that are subject to lower payment obligations under State
Settlement Agreements. This cost advantage enables them to price their brands
more than 50% lower than the list prices of premium brand offerings from major
manufacturers. As a result of this price differential, deep discount brands have
grown from an estimated share in 1998 of less than 1.5% to an estimated 12.6%
for 2007, and continue to be a significant competitive factor in the domestic
U.S. market. Deep discount brands decreased by 0.5 share point in 2007 as
compared to 2006.

The costs of litigating and
administering product liability claims, as well as other legal expenses, are
included in other operating expenses. Lorillard’s outside legal fees and other
external product liability defense costs were $55 million, $57 million, and $83
million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Numerous factors affect product
liability defense costs. The principal factors are as follows:

·

the
      number and types of cases filed and
appealed;

·

the
      number of cases tried and appealed;

·

the
      development of the law;

·

the
      application of new or different theories of liability by plaintiffs and
      their counsel; and

·

litigation
      strategy and tactics.

Please read Note 21 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for detailed
information regarding tobacco litigation. The factors that have influenced past
product liability defense costs are expected to continue to influence future
costs. Although Lorillard does not expect that product liability defense costs
will increase significantly in the future, it is possible that adverse
developments in the factors discussed above, as well as other circumstances
beyond the control of Lorillard, could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Compared with 2005

Revenues increased by $223 million or
6.1% and net income increased by $120 million or 17.0% in 2006 as compared to
2005.

The increase in revenues in 2006, as
compared to 2005, is primarily due to higher net sales of $187 million and
higher investment income of $42 million, partially offset by a decrease in other
income of $6 million. Net sales revenue increased $144 million due to increased
unit sales volume, assuming prices were unchanged from the prior year and $43
million due to higher effective unit prices reflecting lower sales promotion
expenses. Other revenues in 2005 included interest of $6 million relating to a
refund of income taxes paid in prior years.

Net income increased in 2006, as
compared to the prior year, due primarily to the higher revenues discussed
above, and an $8 million reduction in promotional expenses included in cost of
manufactured products sold and lower pretax charges of $13 million due to a
federal assessment relating to the repeal of the federal supply management
program for tobacco growers, partially offset by higher State Settlement
Agreement costs and higher other operating expenses as described
above.

Lorillard recorded pretax charges of
$911 million and $876 million ($560 million and $538 million after taxes) for
2006 and 2005, to record its obligations under State Settlement Agreements. The
$35 million pretax increase in tobacco settlement costs in 2006, as compared to
2005, is due to the impact of the inflation adjustment ($24 million) and charges
for higher gross unit sales ($23 million), partially offset by other adjustments
($12 million) under the State Settlement Agreements.

In April of 2006, Lorillard commenced
a restructuring of its sales and market research organization and offered an
early retirement program to eligible employees. As a result, in 2006 Lorillard
recorded restructuring costs of $20 million in other operating expenses
primarily for early retirement and curtailment charges on pension and other
postretirement benefit plans.

Overall, domestic industry unit sales
volume decreased 1.5% in 2006, as compared with the prior year. Industry sales
for premium brands were 71.9% of the total market in 2006, as compared to 71.1%
for 2005.

Lorillard’s total (domestic, Puerto
Rico and certain U.S. Territories) gross unit sales volume increased 2.6% in
2006, as compared to 2005. Domestic wholesale volume increased 2.7% in 2006, as
compared to the prior year. Total and domestic Newport unit sales volume
increased 2.9% in 2006, as compared with 2005. These results continue to be
affected by on-going competitive promotions and the availability of deep
discount brands.

Deep discount brands are produced by
manufacturers that are subject to lower payment obligations under State
Settlement Agreements. Deep discount brands have grown from an estimated share
in 1998 of less than 1.5% to an estimated 13.1% for 2006.

manufacturers, including Lorillard, are overstated by MSAI.

Business
Environment

Participants in the U.S. tobacco
industry, including Lorillard, face a number of issues that have adversely
affected their results of operations and financial condition in the past and
will continue to do so, including:

·

A
      substantial volume of litigation seeking compensatory and punitive damages
      ranging into the billions of dollars, as well as equitable and injunctive
      relief, arising out of allegations of cancer and other health effects
      resulting from the use of cigarettes, addiction to smoking or exposure to
      environmental tobacco smoke, including claims for economic damages
      relating to alleged misrepresentation concerning the use of descriptors
      such as “lights,” as well as other alleged damages. Please read Item 3 –
      Legal Proceedings and Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
      Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for information with respect
      to litigation and the State Settlement
  Agreements.

·

Substantial
      annual payments continuing in perpetuity, and significant restrictions on
      marketing and advertising agreed to under the terms of the State
      Settlement Agreements. The State Settlement Agreements impose a stream of
      future payment obligations on Lorillard and the other major U.S. cigarette
      manufacturers and place significant restrictions on their ability to
      market and sell cigarettes.

·

The
      continuing contraction of the U.S. cigarette market, in which Lorillard
      currently conducts its only significant business. As a result of price
      increases, restrictions on advertising and promotions, increases in
      regulation and excise taxes, health concerns, a decline in the social
      acceptability of smoking, increased pressure from anti-tobacco groups and
      other factors, U.S. cigarette shipments have decreased at a compound
      annual rate of approximately 2.5% over the period 1998 through 2007
      according to information provided by
MSAI.

Increases
      in cigarette prices since 1998 have led to an increase in the volume of
      discount and, specifically, deep discount cigarettes. This has led, and
      continues to lead, to high levels of discounting and other promotional
      activities for premium brands. Deep discount brands have grown from an
      estimated share in 1998 of less than 1.5% to an estimated 12.6% for 2007,
      and continue to be a significant competitive factor in the domestic
      market.

·

Substantial
      federal, state and local excise taxes are reflected in the retail price of
      cigarettes. In 2007, the federal excise tax was $0.39 per pack and
      combined state and local excise taxes ranged from $0.07 to $3.66 per pack.
      In 2007, excise tax increases ranging from $0.20 to $1.00 per pack were
      implemented in ten states. Proposals continue to be made to increase
      federal, state and local excise taxes. One measure passed by Congress in
      September of 2007 would have increased the federal excise tax on
      cigarettes by $0.61 per pack to finance health insurance for children.
      While this bill was vetoed by the President, it is possible that similar
      bills or other proposals containing a federal excise tax increase may be
      considered by Congress in the future. Lorillard believes that increases in
      excise and similar taxes have had an adverse impact on sales of cigarettes
      and that future increases, the extent of which cannot be predicted, could
      result in further volume declines for the cigarette industry, including
      Lorillard, and an increased sales shift toward deep discount cigarettes
      rather than premium brands. In addition, Lorillard, other cigarette
      manufacturers and importers are required to pay an assessment under a
      federal law designed to fund payments to tobacco quota holders and
      growers.

·

Substantial
      and increasing regulation of the tobacco industry and governmental
      restrictions on smoking. A bill was introduced in February of 2007 by the
      U.S. Congress to grant the FDA authority to regulate tobacco products. The
      bill has been considered in hearings by Congressional committees in both
      houses of Congress during 2007, and one Senate committee has approved the
      bill with certain modifications. No further hearings have been scheduled
      in Congress at this time. Lorillard believes that FDA regulations, if
      enacted, could among other things result in new restrictions on the manner
      in which cigarettes can be advertised and marketed, require larger and
      more severe health warnings on cigarette packaging, restrict the level of
      tar and nicotine contained in or yielded by cigarettes and may alter the
      way cigarette products are developed and manufactured. Lorillard also
      believes that any such proposals, if enacted, would provide Lorillard’s
      larger competitors with a competitive
advantage.

Results of Operations

Results
of Operations – Diamond Offshore – (Continued)

Diamond Offshore’s revenues vary
based upon demand, which affects the number of days the fleet is utilized and
the dayrates earned. When a rig is idle, no dayrate is earned and revenues will
decrease as a result. Revenues can also be affected as a result of the
acquisition or disposal of rigs, required surveys and shipyard upgrades. In
order to improve utilization or realize higher dayrates, Diamond Offshore may
mobilize its rigs from one market to another. However, during periods of
mobilization, revenues may be adversely affected. As a response to changes in
demand, Diamond Offshore may withdraw a rig from the market by stacking it or
may reactivate a rig stacked previously, which may decrease or increase
revenues, respectively.

The two most significant variables
affecting revenues are dayrates for rigs and rig utilization rates, each of
which is a function of rig supply and demand in the marketplace. As utilization
rates increase, dayrates tend to increase as well, reflecting the lower supply
of available rigs, and vice versa. Demand for drilling services is dependent
upon the level of expenditures set by oil and gas companies for offshore
exploration and development as well as a variety of political and economic
factors. The availability of rigs in a particular geographical region also
affects both dayrates and utilization rates. These factors are not within
Diamond Offshore’s control and are difficult to predict.

Diamond Offshore’s operating income is
primarily affected by revenue factors, but is also a function of varying levels
of operating expenses. Diamond Offshore’s contract drilling expenses represent
all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation and maintenance of
its drilling equipment. The principal components of Diamond Offshore’s contract
drilling costs are, among other things, direct and indirect costs of labor and
benefits, repairs and maintenance, freight, regulatory inspections, boat and
helicopter rentals and insurance. Labor and repair and maintenance costs
represent the most significant components of contract drilling expenses. In the
current period of high, sustained utilization, maintenance and repairs costs may
increase in order to maintain Diamond Offshore’s equipment in proper, working
order. Costs to repair and maintain equipment fluctuate depending upon the type
of activity the drilling unit is performing, as well as the age and condition of
the equipment and the regions in which the rigs are working. In general, Diamond
Offshore’s labor costs increase primarily due to higher salary levels, rig
staffing requirements and costs associated with labor regulations in the
geographic regions in which Diamond Offshore’s rigs operate. Diamond Offshore
has experienced and continues to experience upward pressure on salaries and
wages as a result of the strengthening offshore drilling market and increased
competition for skilled workers. In response to these market conditions, Diamond
Offshore has implemented retention programs, including increases in
compensation.

Contract drilling expenses generally
are not affected by changes in dayrates, and short term reductions in
utilization do not necessarily result in lower operating expenses. For instance,
if a rig is to be idle for a short period of time, few decreases in contract
drilling expenses may actually occur since the rig is typically maintained in a
prepared or “ready stacked” state with a full crew. In addition, when a rig is
idle, Diamond Offshore is responsible for certain contract drilling expenses
such as rig fuel and supply boat costs, which are typically costs of the
operator when a rig is under contract. However, if the rig is to be idle for an
extended period of time, Diamond Offshore may reduce the size of a rig’s crew
and take steps to “cold stack” the rig, which lowers expenses and partially
offsets the impact on operating income.

Operating income is also negatively
impacted when Diamond Offshore performs certain regulatory inspections that are
due every five years (“5-year survey”) for each of Diamond Offshore’s rigs as
well as intermediate surveys, which are performed at interim periods between
5-year surveys. Contract drilling revenue decreases because these surveys are
performed during scheduled downtime in a shipyard. Contract drilling expenses
increase as a result of these surveys due to the cost to mobilize the rigs to a
shipyard, inspection costs incurred and repair and maintenance costs. Repair and
maintenance costs may be required resulting from the survey or may have been
previously planned to take place during this mandatory downtime. The number of
rigs undergoing a 5-year survey will vary from year to year.

Costs of mobilizing Diamond Offshore’s
rigs to shipyards for scheduled surveys, which were a major component of its
survey-related costs during 2007, are indicative of higher prices commanded by
support businesses to the offshore drilling industry. Diamond Offshore expects
mobilization costs to be a significant component of its survey-related costs in
2008.

Results
of Operations – Diamond Offshore – (Continued)

Compared with 2006

Revenues increased by $514 million, or
24.5%, and net income increased by $42 million in 2007, as compared to
2006.

Revenues from high specification
floaters and intermediate semisubmersible rigs increased by $508 million in
2007, as compared to 2006. The increase primarily reflects increased dayrates of
$477 million and increased utilization of $29 million.

Revenues from jack-up rigs increased $11
million in 2007, as compared to 2006, primarily due to increased dayrates of $19
million. This increase was partially offset by decreased utilization of $18
million. Revenues were also favorably impacted by the recognition of a lump-sum
demobilization fee of $7 million in 2007.

Net income increased in 2007, as
compared to 2006, due to the revenue increases as noted above and reduced
interest expense, partially offset by increased contract drilling expenses and
income tax expense.

Interest expense decreased $5 million in
2007, as compared to 2006, primarily due to reduced debt related to conversions
of Diamond Offshore’s 1.5% debentures into common stock. The decline in interest
expense in 2007 was partially offset by a $9 million write-off of debt issuance
costs related to the conversions.

In connection with a non-recurring
distribution of $850 million from a Diamond Offshore foreign subsidiary, a
portion of which consisted of earnings of the subsidiary that had not previously
been subjected to U.S. federal income tax, Diamond Offshore recognized $59
million of U.S. federal income tax expense. It remains Diamond Offshore’s
intention to indefinitely reinvest future earnings of the subsidiary to finance
foreign activities.

Compared with 2005

Revenues increased by $809 million,
or 62.6%, and net income increased by $225 million in 2006, as compared to
2005.

Revenues from high specification
floaters and intermediate semisubmersible rigs increased by $646 million or
71.4% in 2006, as compared to 2005. The increase primarily reflects increased
dayrates of $545 million and improved utilization of $101 million.

Revenues from jack-up rigs increased
$163 million, or 60.1%, in 2006, as compared to 2005, due primarily to increased
dayrates of $197 million, partially offset by decreased utilization of $25
million, respectively. In addition, there was a $3 million increase in the
amortization of deferred mobilization revenue for 2006.

In the third quarter of 2005, one of
Diamond Offshore’s jack-up drilling rigs, the

Ocean Warwick

, was damaged
beyond repair during Hurricane Katrina and other rigs in Diamond Offshore’s
fleet sustained lesser damage in Hurricanes Katrina or Rita, or in some cases
from both storms. Diamond Offshore recognized a $34 million casualty gain in
2005 as a result of the constructive total loss of the

Ocean Warwick

. During 2005,
this drilling unit generated $12 million in revenues.

Investment income increased by $12
million for 2006, primarily due to the combined effect of higher interest rates
earned on higher average cash balances in 2006, as compared to the prior
year.

Interest expense decreased $18 million
in 2006, primarily due to the 2005 redemption of zero coupon debentures,
partially offset by the additional expense related to the 2005 issuance of 4.9%
senior unsecured notes. In 2005, interest expense included a write-off of $7
million of debt issuance costs associated with the partial repurchase of Diamond
Offshore’s Zero Coupon Debentures.

Net income increased in 2006 due
primarily to the increased revenues noted above, and reduced interest expense,
partially offset by increased contract drilling expenses driven by higher labor
and benefit costs as a result of wage increases and other compensation
enhancement programs implemented in late 2005. In addition, Diamond

incurred
higher repair and maintenance costs for most of its rigs primarily due to the
high utilization of its fleet and higher prices experienced throughout the
offshore drilling industry and support businesses.

HighMount

HighMount Exploration & Production
LLC (“HighMount”). HighMount is a wholly owned subsidiary.

The results of HighMount include
operations from July 31, 2007, the date of the acquisition of certain
exploration and production assets, and assumption of certain related
obligations, from subsidiaries of Dominion. Prior to the acquisition, natural
gas forwards were entered into in order to manage the commodity price risk of
the natural gas assets to be acquired. The mark-to-market adjustments related to
these forwards have been reflected as investment gains in the following table.
Concurrent with the closing of the acquisition, these forwards were designated
as hedges and included in HighMount’s operating results or Accumulated other
comprehensive income on the balance sheet.

The following table summarizes the
results of operations for HighMount for 2007 as presented in Note 25 of the

Operating revenues consisted
primarily of natural gas and NGL sales of $268 million for 2007. During 2007,
HighMount produced approximately 44 billion cubic feet equivalents of natural
gas (“Bcfe”) and sold approximately 41 Bcfe for an average realized price per
thousand cubic feet (“Mcf”) of gas, including the impact of hedging
activities, of $6.00. The production was supported by its successful
drilling efforts during the period. HighMount drilled 242 wells during 2007, of
which 236 were productive, for a success rate of 98%. Sales were primarily
driven by production from the Permian basin, which contributed approximately 37
Bcfe. The average realized price, per Mcf of gas sold, without hedging activity,
was $5.95.

Operating expenses primarily consist
of production expenses, general and administrative costs and depreciation,
depletion and amortization. Production expenses totaled $59 million for 2007, or
$1.44 per thousand cubic feet equivalents of natural gas (“Mcfe”) sold, and
included production and ad valorem taxes of $22 million. General and
administrative expenses were $24 million, or $0.55 per Mcfe produced, and
primarily consisted of salary related costs. Depreciation, depletion and
amortization expenses totaled $67 million and included depletion of natural gas
and NGL properties of $62 million. HighMount calculates depletion using the
units-of-production method, which depletes the capitalized costs and future
development costs associated with evaluated properties based on the ratio of
production volume for the current period to total remaining reserve volume for
the evaluated properties. On a per unit basis, depletion expense was $1.41 per
Mcfe.

Interest expense for 2007 was $32
million, net of capitalized interest on unproved properties of $10 million.
Interest expense consists primarily of $30 million on HighMount’s long term
debt. HighMount entered into $1.6 billion of term loans to finance its
acquisition as described further in “Liquidity and Capital Resources –
HighMount.”

Boardwalk Pipeline derives revenues
primarily from the interstate transportation and storage of natural gas for
third parties. Transportation and storage services are provided under firm
service and interruptible service agreements. Transportation and storage rates
and general terms and conditions of service are established by, and subject to
review and revision by, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(“FERC”).

Under firm transportation agreements,
customers generally pay a fixed “capacity reservation” fee to reserve pipeline
capacity at certain receipt and delivery points, plus a commodity and fuel
charge paid on the volume of gas actually transported. Firm storage customers
reserve a specific amount of storage capacity and generally pay a capacity
reservation charge based on the amount of capacity being reserved plus an
injection and/or withdrawal fee. Capacity reservation revenues derived from a
firm service contract is consistent from year to year, but is generally higher
in winter peak periods than off-peak periods resulting in a seasonal earnings
pattern where the majority of earnings are generated in the first and fourth
quarters of a calendar year.

Interruptible transportation and storage
service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers
that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm
service. Customers pay for interruptible services when capacity is
used.

Boardwalk Pipeline’s parking and lending
(“PAL”) service is an interruptible service offered to customers providing them
the ability to park (inject) or borrow (withdraw) gas into or out of Boardwalk
Pipeline’s storage facilities at a specific location for a specific period of
time. Customers pay for PAL service in advance or on a monthly basis depending
on the terms of the agreement.

Boardwalk Pipeline’s business is
affected by trends involving natural gas price levels and natural gas price
spreads, including spreads between physical locations on its pipeline system,
which affects its transportation revenues, and spreads in natural gas prices
across time (for example summer to winter), which primarily affects its PAL and
storage revenues. High natural gas prices in recent years have helped to drive
increased production levels in producing locations such as the Bossier Sands and
Barnett Shale gas producing regions in East Texas, which has resulted in
additional supply being available on the west side of Boardwalk Pipeline’s
system. This has resulted in widened west-to-east basis differentials which have
benefited its transportation revenues. The high natural gas prices have also
driven increased production in regions such as the Fayetteville Shale in
Arkansas and the Caney Woodford Shale in Oklahoma, which,


Item
7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

Results
of Operations – Boardwalk Pipeline – (Continued)

together
with the higher production levels in East Texas, have formed the basis for
several pipeline expansion projects including those being undertaken by
Boardwalk Pipeline. Wide spreads in natural gas prices between time periods
during the past two to three years, for example fall 2006 to spring 2007, were
favorable for Boardwalk Pipeline’s PAL and interruptible storage services during
that period. These spreads decreased substantially in 2007, which resulted in
reduced PAL and interruptible storage revenues. Boardwalk Pipeline cannot
predict future time period spreads or basis differentials.

Compared with 2006

Total revenues increased by $53
million to $671 million for 2007, compared to $618 million for 2006. Operating
revenues increased primarily due to a $23 million increase in transportation
fees due to higher reservation rates, including $9 million from new contracts
associated with the Carthage, Texas to Keatchie, Louisiana pipeline expansion
and a $12 million increase in fuel revenues due to increase retained volumes
from higher system utilization, including amounts associated with pipeline
expansion. Operating revenues also include a $22 million favorable variance from
a gain on the sale of gas associated with the Western Kentucky storage expansion
project. Net investment income increased $17 million as a result of higher
levels of invested cash.

Net income increased slightly in 2007,
as compared to 2006, primarily due to the increased revenues discussed above,
partially offset by a $23 million increase in operating expenses and a $25
million increase in minority interest expense. Operating expenses in 2007
include a $7 million increase in fuel costs mainly due to increased gas usage
and a $6 million increase in depreciation and amortization primarily due to
growth in operations. Operating expenses also include a $4 million charge
related to the cost of terminating an agreement with a construction contractor
on the Southeast expansion project. In addition, net income decreased due to a
$15 million loss due to impairment of the Magnolia storage facility discussed
below, and a $9 million charge related to pipeline in the South Timbalier Bay
area offshore Lousiana. The increase in minority interest expense is primarily
due to the sale of Boardwalk Pipeline common units in the fourth quarter of 2006
and the first and fourth quarters of 2007.

Boardwalk Pipeline was developing the
Magnolia storage facility, a salt dome storage cavern near Napoleonville,
Louisiana, when operational tests indicated that due to anomalies that could not
be corrected, the cavern could not be placed in service as expected. As a
result, Boardwalk Pipeline elected to abandon that cavern and is exploring the
possibility of securing a new site on which a new cavern could be developed. In
accordance with the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(“SFAS”) No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets,” the carrying value of the cavern and related facilities of
approximately $45 million was tested for recoverability. In 2007, Boardwalk
Pipeline recognized an impairment charge of approximately $15 million,
representing the carrying value of the cavern, the fair value of which was
determined to be zero based on discounted expected future cash flows. The charge
was included in Other revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Boardwalk Pipeline expects to use the other assets associated with the project,
which include pipeline, compressors, base gas and other equipment and
facilities, in conjunction with a replacement storage cavern to be developed. If
it is determined in the future that the assets cannot be used in conjunction
with a new cavern, Boardwalk Pipeline may be required to record an additional
impairment charge at the time that determination is made. Additional costs to
abandon the impaired cavern may be incurred due to regulatory or contractual
obligations; however, the amounts are inestimable at this time.

Compared with 2005

Total revenues increased by $46 million
to $618 million in 2006, compared to $572 million for 2005. Storage and PAL
services improved revenues by $39 million primarily due to favorable natural gas
price spreads and volatility in forward gas prices. In addition, operating
revenues increased due to higher firm transportation revenues of $26 million,
excluding fuel, primarily related to higher reservation rates and additional
capacity reserved by shippers due to higher production in the East Texas region,
and $5 million due to hurricane insurance recoveries in 2006 and gas lost in
2005 related to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. These increases were partially
offset by the absence of a $12 million gain from the sale of storage gas related
to Phase I of Boardwalk Pipeline’s Western Kentucky storage expansion project
that occurred in 2005, a $11 million decrease in interruptible transportation
services due to unseasonably warm weather in Boardwalk Pipeline’s market areas
during the fourth quarter of 2006, higher interruptible revenues in the third
and fourth quarters of 2005 due to supply disruptions caused by Hurricanes
Katrina and Rita, a $7 million decrease in fuel retained due to lower realized
natural gas prices and reduced throughput, and a $6 million decrease in revenues
for a reduction in the amortization of acquired executory
contracts.

of Operations – Boardwalk Pipeline – (Continued)

Net income increased by $11 million
to $103 million in 2006, as compared to $92 million in 2005, primarily due to
the increased revenues discussed above, partially offset by a $25 million
increase in minority interest expense and a $4 million increase in operating
expenses. Operating expenses in 2006, as compared to 2005, include a $13 million
increase in outside services and overhead mainly due to growth in operations and
regulatory compliance, a $10 million increase in employee labor and benefits
costs due primarily to a rate case settlement and a special termination benefit
charge recognized as a result of an early retirement incentive program.
Operating expenses also reflect a $4 million increase in depreciation and
amortization and a $3 million expense from the lease of third party pipeline
capacity. These increases were partially offset by an $18 million reduction in
hurricane related expense as compared to 2005, and a $15 million decrease in
company used gas due to operational efficiencies, lower natural gas prices and
reduced throughput resulting in decreased usage. Interest expense for 2006
increased by $2 million, primarily due to borrowings under a credit facility
that occurred in November of 2005 and senior notes issued in November of
2006.

compared to 2006.

Revenues and net income increased in
2007, as compared to 2006, due to an increase in revenue per available room to
$184.10, compared to $168.40 in 2006, reflecting improvements in average room
rates of $18.73, or 8.5%, and a 0.8% increase in occupancy rates, partially
offset by the classification of joint venture equity income as a component of
operating expenses in 2007, as compared to revenues in 2006.

Revenue per available room is an
industry measure of the combined effect of occupancy rates and average room
rates on room revenues. Other hotel operating revenues primarily include guest
charges for food and beverages.

Compared with 2005

Revenues increased by $21 million, or
6.0% and net income decreased by $2 million, or 6.5%, in 2006, as compared to
2005.

Revenues increased in 2006, as compared
with 2005, due primarily to an increase in revenue per available room of $16.51,
or 10.9%, to $168.40, from $151.89 in the prior year. Revenue per available room
increased due to higher average room rates, which increased $20.39, or 10.2%,
and a 0.7% increase in occupancy rates for 2006. These increases were partially
offset by a non-recurring pretax gain in 2005 of $5 million from the early
repayment of a note in connection with the sale of a hotel property and lower
equity income of $4 million due primarily to higher land rent at the Orlando
property.

Net income for 2006 decreased
primarily due to the non-recurring gain in 2005 discussed above and increased
costs related to linen and service upgrades, partially offset by the increase in
revenue per available room.

Compared with 2006

Revenues increased $70 million, or
18.9%, and net income increased by $47 million in 2007, as compared to 2006, due
to increased investment gains of $134 million, partially offset by reduced
investment income of $56 million. Investment gains for 2007 include a $143
million gain ($93 million after tax) due to the conversion of $456 million
principal amount of Diamond Offshore’s 1.5% debentures into Diamond Offshore
common stock. The decrease in investment income is due to a lower invested asset
balance (reflecting the $2.4 billion use of cash to partially fund the HighMount
acquisition) and reduced performance of the Company’s trading
portfolio.

Net income increased in 2007 due to
the increase in revenues, and also benefited from lower corporate interest
expenses due to the maturity of $300 million principal amount of 6.8% notes in
December of 2006.

Compared with 2005

Revenues increased by $254 million,
and net income increased by $168 million in December 31, 2006, compared to
2005.

Revenues increased in 2006, as
compared to 2005, due primarily to higher net investment income of $242 million
and increased investment gains of $13 million. Net investment income includes
income from the trading portfolio of $224 million and $43 million ($146 million
and $28 million after taxes) for 2006 and 2005. In addition, interest income in
2006 increased due to improved yields and higher invested amounts.

Net income increased in 2006 due
primarily to the increased revenues discussed above and the absence of costs
($23 million after taxes) incurred in 2005 associated with the early retirement
of our $400 million principal amount of 7.0% senior notes due 2023 and $1,150
million principal amount of 3.1% exchangeable subordinated notes due 2007, as
well as reduced interest expense. Net income for 2005 also reflected a lower
effective tax rate related to the federal income tax settlement as discussed
below.

The lower income tax expense in 2005 was
primarily due to a review of tax liabilities we performed subsequent to the
settlement of our 1998 through 2001 tax returns with the Internal Revenue
Service. As a result, we reduced our deferred tax liabilities by $24 million in
2005.

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CNA
Financial

Cash
Flow

CNA’s principal operating cash flow
sources are premiums and investment income from its insurance subsidiaries.
CNA’s primary operating cash flow uses are payments for claims, policy benefits
and operating expenses.

For 2007, net cash provided by operating
activities was $1,239 million as compared to $2,250 million in 2006. Cash
provided by operating activities was unfavorably impacted by decreased net sales
of trading securities to fund policyholder withdrawals of investment contract
products issued by CNA.  Policyholder fund withdrawals are reflected
as financing cash flows. Cash provided by operating activities was unfavorably
impacted by decreased premium collections, increased tax payments, and increased
loss payments.

For 2006, net cash provided by operating
activities was $2,250 million as compared to $2,169 million in 2005. Cash
provided by operating activities was favorably impacted by increased net sales
of trading securities to fund policyholder withdrawals of investment contract
products issued by CNA and increased investment income receipts. Policyholder
fund withdrawals are reflected as financing cash flows. Cash provided by
operating activities was unfavorably impacted by decreased premium collections,
increased tax payments, and increased loss payments.

Net cash used for investing activities
was $1,082 million, $1,646 million, and $1,316 million for 2007, 2006, and
2005. Cash flows used by investing activities related principally to purchases
of fixed maturity securities and short term investments. The cash flow from
investing activities is impacted by various factors such as the anticipated
payment of claims, financing activity, asset/liability management and individual
security buy and sell decisions made in the normal course of portfolio
management. In 2007, net cash flows provided by investing
activities-discontinued operations included $65 million of cash proceeds related
to the sale of the United Kingdom discontinued operations business.

For 2007, 2006 and 2005, net cash used
for financing activities was $185 million, $605 million, and $837 million.
The decrease in cash used by financing activities is primarily related to
decreased policyholder fund withdrawals in 2007 as compared to 2006, which are
reflected as return of investment contract account balances on the Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows included under Item 8.

CNA believes that its present cash flows
from operating, investing and financing activities, including cash dividends
from CNA subsidiaries, are sufficient to fund its working capital and debt
obligation needs.

CNA has an effective shelf registration
statement under which it may issue debt or equity securities.

CNA
Series H Preferred Stock

In December of 2002, CNA sold $750
million of a new issue of preferred stock, the Series H Issue, to us. The Series
H Issue accrued cumulative dividends at an initial rate of 8% per year,
compounded annually. In August 2006, CNA repurchased the Series H Issue for
approximately $993 million, a price equal to the liquidation
preference.

CNA financed the repurchase of the
Series H Issue with the proceeds from the sales of: (i) 7 million shares of
CNA’s common stock in a public offering for approximately $236 million; (ii)
$400 million of new 6.0% five-year senior notes and $350 million of new 6.5%
ten-year senior notes in a public offering; and (iii) 7.86 million shares of
CNA’s common stock to us in a private placement for approximately $265
million.

Dividends

In 2007, CNA paid dividends of $0.35 per
share of its common stock. On February 6, 2008, CNA’s Board of Directors
declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share, payable March 20, 2008 to
shareholders of record on February 25, 2008. The declaration and payment of
future dividends to holders of CNA’s common stock will be at the discretion of
CNA’s Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including CNA’s
earnings, financial condition, business needs, and regulatory
constraints.


Item

Results of Operations

Liquidity
and Capital Resources – CNA Financial – (Continued)

CNA’s ability to pay dividends and other
credit obligations is significantly dependent on receipt of dividends from its
subsidiaries. The payment of dividends to CNA by its insurance subsidiaries
without prior approval of the insurance department of each subsidiary’s
domiciliary jurisdiction is limited by formula. Dividends in excess of these
amounts are subject to prior approval by the respective state insurance
departments.

Share
Repurchase Program

CNA’s Board of Directors has approved a
Share Repurchase Program to purchase, in the open market or through privately
negotiated transactions, CNA’s outstanding common stock, as CNA’s management
deems appropriate. No shares of CNA common stock were purchased during 2007 or
2006. On February 12, 2008, CNA began repurchasing shares pursuant to these
Board of Directors resolutions. As of February 22, 2008, CNA repurchased a total
of 945,656 shares at a cost of approximately $26 million. Share repurchases may
continue.

Commitments,
Contingencies and Guarantees

CNA has various commitments,
contingencies and guarantees which it becomes involved with during the ordinary
course of business. The impact of these commitments, contingencies and
guarantees should be considered when evaluating CNA’s liquidity and capital
resources.

Regulatory
Matters

CNA previously established a plan to
reorganize and streamline its U.S. property and casualty insurance legal entity
structure in order to realize capital, operational, and cost efficiencies. The
remaining phase of this multi-year plan has been completed with the December 31,
2007 merger of Transcontinental Insurance Company, a New York domiciled insurer,
into its parent company, National Fire Insurance Company of Hartford, which is a
CCC subsidiary.

Along with other companies in the
industry, CNA received subpoenas, interrogatories and inquiries from and have
produced documents and/or provided information to: (i) California, Connecticut,
Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York,
North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, West Virginia and the
Canadian Council of Insurance Regulators concerning investigations into
practices including contingent compensation arrangements, fictitious quotes and
tying arrangements; (ii) the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the New
York State Attorney General, the United States Attorney for the Southern
District of New York, the Connecticut Attorney General, the Connecticut
Department of Insurance, the Delaware Department of Insurance, the Georgia
Office of Insurance and Safety Fire Commissioner and the California Department
of Insurance concerning reinsurance products and finite insurance products
purchased and sold by CNA; (iii) the Massachusetts Attorney General and the
Connecticut Attorney General concerning investigations into anti-competitive
practices; and (iv) the New York State Attorney General concerning declinations
of attorney malpractice insurance.

The SEC and representatives of the
United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York conducted
interviews with several of CNA’s current and former executives relating to the
restatement of CNA’s financial results for 2004, including CNA’s relationship
with and accounting for transactions with an affiliate that were the basis for
the restatement. CNA has also provided the SEC with information relating to
CNA’s restatement in 2006 of prior period results. It is possible that CNA’s
analyses of, or accounting treatment for, finite reinsurance contracts or
discontinued operations could be questioned or disputed by regulatory
authorities.

Ratings

Ratings are an important factor in
establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. CNA’s insurance
company subsidiaries are rated by major rating agencies, and these ratings
reflect the rating agency’s opinion of the insurance company’s financial
strength, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its
obligations to policyholders. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy,
sell or hold any security, and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the
issuing organization. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of
any other agency’s rating. One or more of these agencies could take action in
the future to change the ratings of CNA’s insurance
subsidiaries.

      November 2, 2007, Moody's affirmed CNA’s ratings and stable
      outlook.

·

On
      December 18, 2007, A.M. Best affirmed CNA’s ratings and stable
      outlook.

If CNA’s property and casualty insurance
financial strength ratings were downgraded below current levels, CNA’s business
and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The
severity of the impact on CNA’s business is dependent on the level of downgrade
and, for certain products, which rating agency takes the rating action. Among
the adverse effects in the event of such downgrades would be the inability to
obtain a material volume of business from certain major insurance brokers, the
inability to sell a material volume of CNA’s insurance products to certain
markets and the required collateralization of certain future payment obligations
or reserves.

In addition, it is possible that a
lowering of our debt ratings by certain of these agencies could result in an
adverse impact on CNA’s ratings, independent of any change in circumstances at
CNA. None of the major rating agencies which rates us currently maintains a
negative outlook or has us on negative Credit Watch.

CNA has entered into several settlement
agreements and assumed reinsurance contracts that require collateralization of
future payment obligations and assumed reserves if CNA’s ratings or other
specific criteria fall below certain thresholds. The ratings triggers are
generally more than one level below CNA’s current ratings.

Lorillard

Lorillard and other cigarette
manufacturers continue to be confronted with substantial litigation. Plaintiffs
in most of the cases seek unspecified amounts of compensatory damages and
punitive damages, although some seek damages ranging into the billions of
dollars. Plaintiffs in some of the cases seek treble damages, statutory damages,
disgorgement of profits, equitable and injunctive relief, and medical
monitoring, among other damages.

Lorillard believes that it has valid
defenses to the cases pending against it. Lorillard also believes it has valid
bases for appeal of the adverse verdicts against it. To the extent we are a
defendant in any of the lawsuits, we believe that we are not a proper defendant
in these matters and have moved or plan to move for dismissal of all such claims
against us. While Lorillard intends to defend vigorously all tobacco products
liability litigation, it is not possible to predict the outcome of any of this
litigation. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and it is possible that
some of these actions could be decided unfavorably. Lorillard may enter into
discussions in an attempt to settle particular cases if it believes it is
appropriate to do so.

Except for the impact of the State
Settlement Agreements and

Scott

as described above, as
described below, we are unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or
range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of


Item

Liquidity
and Capital Resources – Lorillard – (Continued)

pending
tobacco related litigation and, therefore, no material provision has been made
in the Consolidated Financial Statements for any unfavorable outcome. It is
possible that our results of operations, cash flows and our financial position
could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome of certain
pending litigation.

The State Settlement Agreements require
Lorillard and the other Original Participating Manufacturers (“OPMs”) to make
aggregate annual payments of $8.4 billion through 2007 and $9.4 billion
thereafter, subject to adjustment for several factors described below. In
addition, the OPMs are required to pay plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees, subject to
an aggregate annual cap of $500 million, as well as an additional aggregate
amount of up to $125 million in each year through 2008. These payment
obligations are the several and not joint obligations of each of the OPMs. We
believe that Lorillard’s obligations under the State Settlement Agreements will
materially adversely affect our cash flows and operating income in future
years.

Both
the aggregate payment obligations of the OPMs, and the payment obligations of
Lorillard, individually, under the State Settlement Agreements are subject to
adjustment for several factors which include:

·

inflation;

·

aggregate
      volume of domestic cigarette
shipments;

·

market
      share; and

·

industry
      operating income.

The inflation adjustment increases
payments on a compounded annual basis by the greater of 3.0% or the actual total
percentage change in the consumer price index for the preceding year. The
inflation adjustment is measured starting with inflation for 1999. The volume
adjustment increases or decreases payments based on the increase or decrease in
the total number of cigarettes shipped in or to the 50 U.S. states, the District
of Columbia and Puerto Rico by the OPMs during the preceding year, as compared
to the 1997 base year shipments. If volume has increased, the volume adjustment
would increase the annual payment by the same percentage as the number of
cigarettes shipped exceeds the 1997 base number. If volume has decreased, the
volume adjustment would decrease the annual payment by 98.0% of the percentage
reduction in volume. In addition, downward adjustments to the annual payments
for changes in volume may, subject to specified conditions and exceptions, be
reduced in the event of an increase in the OPMs aggregate operating income from
domestic sales of cigarettes over base year levels established in the State
Settlement Agreements, adjusted for inflation. Any adjustments resulting from
increases in operating income would be allocated among those OPMs who have had
increases.

Lorillard’s cash payment under the State
Settlement Agreements in 2007 was $945 million, including Lorillard’s deposit of
$111 million, in an interest-bearing escrow account in accordance with
procedures established in the MSA pending resolution of a claim by Lorillard and
the OPMs that they are entitled to reduce their MSA payments based on a loss of
market share to non-participating manufacturers. Most of the states that are
parties to the MSA are disputing the availability of the reduction and Lorillard
believes that this dispute will ultimately be resolved by judicial and
arbitration proceedings. Lorillard’s $111 million reduction is based upon the
OPMs collective loss of market share in 2004. In April of 2006, Lorillard had
previously deposited $109 million in the same escrow account discussed above,
which was based on a loss of market share in 2003 to non-participating
manufacturers. Lorillard and other OPMs have the right to claim additional
reductions of MSA payments in subsequent years under provisions of the MSA.
Lorillard anticipates the amount payable in 2008 will be approximately $1,050
million to $1,100 million, primarily based on 2007 estimated industry
volume.

See Item 3 – Legal Proceedings and Note
21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this
Report for additional information regarding this settlement and other litigation
matters.

Lorillard’s cash and investments, net of
receivables and payables, totaled $1.489 billion and $1.769 billion at December
31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. At December 31, 2007, 82.4% of Lorillard’s cash
and investments were invested in short term securities.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources – Lorillard – (Continued)

The principal source of liquidity for
Lorillard’s business and operating needs is internally generated funds from its
operations. Lorillard’s operating activities resulted in a net cash inflow of
$882 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $778 million for
the prior year. Lorillard believes, based on current conditions, that cash flows
from operating activities will be sufficient to enable it to meet its
obligations under the State Settlement Agreements and to fund its working
capital and capital expenditures. Lorillard cannot predict the impact on its
cash flows of cash requirements related to any future settlements or judgments,
including cash required to bond any appeals, if necessary, or the impact of
subsequent legislative actions, and thus can give no assurance that it will be
able to meet all of those requirements.

Diamond
Offshore

Cash and investments, net of receivables
and payables, totaled $640 million at December 31, 2007 compared to $825 at
December 31, 2006. In 2007, Diamond Offshore paid cash dividends totaling $796
million, consisting of special cash dividends in 2007 of $727 million and its
regular quarterly cash dividends of $69 million. In February of 2008, Diamond
Offshore announced a special dividend of $1.25 per share and a regular quarterly
dividend of $0.125 per share.

Cash provided by operating activities
was $1,208 million in 2007, compared to $760 million in 2006. The increase in
cash flow from operations in 2006 is the result of higher utilization and
average dayrates earned by Diamond Offshore’s drilling units as a result of an
increase in overall demand for offshore contract drilling services.

The newly upgraded

Ocean Endeavor

commenced
drilling operations in July of 2007. The aggregate cost of the upgrade was
approximately $248 million of which $39 million was spent in 2007. In addition,
the upgrade of the

Ocean

Monarch

continues in
Singapore with expected delivery of the upgraded rig late in the fourth quarter
of 2008. Diamond Offshore expects to spend approximately $305 million to
modernize this rig of which $181 million had been spent through December 31,
2007.

Construction of two high-performance,
premium jack-up rigs, the

Ocean Shield

and

Ocean Scepter

is nearing
completion, and delivery of both units is expected in the second quarter of
2008. The aggregate expected cost for both rigs is approximately $320 million,
including drill pipe and capitalized interest, of which $249 million had been
spent through December 31, 2007.

Diamond Offshore estimates that capital
expenditures in 2008 associated with its ongoing rig equipment replacement and
enhancement programs and other corporate requirements will be approximately $500
million. In 2007, Diamond Offshore spent approximately $388 million for capital
additions, including $63 million towards modification of certain of its rigs to
meet contractual requirements.

In 2007, the holders of $456 million
principal amount of Diamond Offshore’s 1.5% Debentures converted their
outstanding debentures into 9.3 million shares of Diamond Offshore’s common
stock.

As of December 31, 2007 and December 31,
2006, there were no loans outstanding under Diamond Offshore’s $285 million
credit facility; however, $54 million in letters of credit were issued under the
credit facility in 2007.

Diamond Offshore’s liquidity and capital
requirements are primarily a function of its working capital needs, capital
expenditures and debt service requirements.

Cash required
to meet Diamond Offshore’s capital commitments is determined by evaluating the
need to upgrade rigs to meet specific customer requirements and by evaluating
Diamond Offshore’s ongoing rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs,
including water depth and drilling capability upgrades. It is the opinion of
Diamond Offshore’s management that its operating cash flows and cash reserves
will be sufficient to meet these capital commitments; however, Diamond Offshore
will continue to make periodic assessments based on industry
conditions.

For physical damage due to named
windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, as of the date of this report, Diamond
Offshore’s deductible is $75 million per occurrence (or lower for some rigs if
they are declared a constructive total loss) with an annual aggregate limit of
$125 million. Accordingly, Diamond Offshore’s insurance coverage for all
physical damage to its rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the U.S.
Gulf of Mexico for the policy period ending April 30, 2008 is limited to $125
million. If named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico cause significant damage

HighMount

On July 31, 2007, HighMount acquired,
through its subsidiaries, certain exploration and production assets, and assumed
certain related obligations, from subsidiaries of Dominion Resources, Inc. for
$4.0 billion, subject to adjustment. The acquisition was funded with
approximately $2.4 billion in cash, as a capital contribution from us, and $1.6
billion of term loans entered into by HighMount (the “Acquisition Debt”). The
Acquisition Debt bears interest at a variable rate equal to the London Interbank
Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus an applicable margin and matures on July 26, 2012,
subject to acceleration by the lenders upon the occurrence of customary events
of default. HighMount has entered into interest rate swaps for a notional amount
of $1.6 billion to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in LIBOR. These swaps
effectively fix the interest rate at 5.8%. The Credit Agreement also provides
for a five year, $400 million revolving credit facility, borrowings under which
bear interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus an applicable margin. At
December 31, 2007, $47 million was outstanding under the revolving credit
facility. In addition, $6 million in letters of credit were issued, which
reduced the available capacity under the facility to $347 million.

Net cash flows provided by operating
activities were $146 million. Key drivers of net operating cash flows are
commodity prices, production volumes, and operating costs.

The primary driver of cash used in
investing activities was capital spending, inclusive of acquisitions. Cash used
in investing activities in 2007 was $4.2 billion. Included in cash used in
investing activities is HighMount’s July 31, 2007 acquisition of certain
exploration and production assets from subsidiaries of Dominion for $4.0
billion. In addition, during 2007, HighMount spent $185 million on capital
expenditures in conjunction with its drilling program.

Boardwalk
Pipeline

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, cash and
investments amounted to $317 million and $399 million, respectively. Funds from
operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 amounted to $282 million,
compared to $256 million in 2006. In 2007 and 2006, Boardwalk Pipeline’s capital
expenditures were $1.2 billion and $197 million, respectively.

Boardwalk Pipeline maintains a $1.0
billion revolving credit facility, which was recently increased from $700
million. As of December 31, 2007, Boardwalk Pipeline was in compliance with all
the covenant requirements under its $1.0 billion revolving credit agreement and
no funds were drawn under this facility. However, Boardwalk Pipeline has
outstanding letters of credit for $186 million to support certain obligations
associated with its Fayetteville Lateral and Gulf Crossing expansion projects,
which reduced the available capacity under the facility.

In August of 2007, Gulf South Pipeline,
LP, a wholly owned subsidiary of Boardwalk Pipeline, issued $500 million
aggregate principal amount of senior notes, consisting of $225 million aggregate
principal amount of 5.8% senior notes due 2012 and $275 million aggregate
principal amount of 6.3% senior notes due 2017. The proceeds from the offering
will be primarily used to finance a portion of Gulf South’s expansion
projects.

In August of 2007, Boardwalk Pipeline
entered into a Treasury rate lock for a notional amount of $150 million to hedge
the risk attributable to changes in the risk-free component of forward 10 year
interest rates through February 1, 2008. The reference rate on the Treasury rate
lock was 4.7%. On February 1, 2008, Boardwalk Pipeline paid the counterparty
approximately $15 million to settle the Treasury rate lock. The Treasury rate
lock was designated as a cash flow hedge; therefore, the loss will be recognized
in Interest expense over the term of the related debt to be issued.

In the first and fourth quarters of
2007, Boardwalk Pipeline sold 8.0 million and 7.5 million common units at prices
of $36.50 and $30.90 per unit in public offerings and received net proceeds of
$288 million and $228 million, respectively. In addition, we contributed $6
million and $5 million, respectively to maintain our 2.0% general partner
interest.

Maintenance capital expenditures were
$47 million in 2007. Boardwalk Pipeline expects to fund its 2008 maintenance
capital expenditures of approximately $60 million from operating cash
flows.

Expansion Capital
Expenditures.

Boardwalk Pipeline has undertaken significant
capital expansion projects, substantially all of which have been or are expected
to be funded with proceeds from its equity and debt financings.

Boardwalk Pipeline expects to incur
expansion capital expenditures of approximately $3.1 billion in 2008 and
approximately $0.2 billion in 2009 to complete its pipeline expansion projects,
based upon current cost estimates. However, as noted elsewhere in this report,
Boardwalk Pipeline has experienced cost increases in these projects and various
factors could cause its costs to exceed that amount. Boardwalk Pipeline expects
to finance its remaining pipeline expansion capital costs through equity
financings and the incurrence of debt, including sales of debt by it and its
subsidiaries and borrowings under its revolving credit facility, as well as
available operating cash flow in excess of operating needs. However, the impact
in the cost increases Boardwalk Pipeline has experienced and may experience in
the future to complete its expansion capital projects could adversely
impact Boardwalk Pipeline’s financing costs. Please read Item 1, “Business –
Boardwalk Pipeline – Expansion Projects” and Item 1A,

“

Risk Factors –
Boardwalk Pipeline is undertaking large, complex expansion projects which
involve significant risks that may adversely affect its business.”

At December 31, 2007, Boardwalk Pipeline
had approximately $317 million in cash and $814 million of borrowing capacity
available under its $1.0 billion revolving credit facility.

During the year ended December 31, 2007,
Boardwalk Pipeline paid cash distributions of $205 million, including $156
million to us. In February of 2008, Boardwalk Pipeline declared a quarterly
distribution of $0.46 per unit.

Cash and short term investments
increased to $73 million at December 31, 2007 from $25 million at December 31,

other capital expenditures and working capital requirements are expected to be
provided from existing cash balances and operations and advances or capital
contributions from us.

Corporate
and Other

Parent Company cash and investments, net
of receivables and payables, at December 31, 2007 totaled $3.8 billion, as
compared to $5.3 billion at December 31, 2006. The decrease in net cash and
investments is primarily due to the payment of $2.4 billion in conjunction with
the HighMount acquisition, $331 million of dividends paid to our shareholders
and $672 million related to repurchases of our common stock, partially offset by
the receipt of $1,844 million in dividends from subsidiaries, which includes
$368 million from Diamond Offshore special dividends paid in 2007, and
investment income.

As of December 31, 2007, there were
529,683,628 shares of Loews common stock outstanding and 108,459,141 shares of
Carolina Group stock outstanding. Depending on market and other conditions, we
may purchase shares of our, and our subsidiaries’, outstanding common stock in
the open market or otherwise. During 2007, we purchased 14,789,949 shares of
Loews common stock at an aggregate cost of $672 million. As a result of the
proposed Separation and related proposed exchange offer of Loews common stock
for Lorillard common stock referred to under “Overview-Lorillard Separation,” we
are restricted by SEC regulations, unless we are granted an exemption by the SEC
or we abandon the proposed exchange offer, from purchasing Loews common stock
and Carolina Group stock until ten business days following completion or
termination of the proposed exchange offer.

In January of 2008, we sold Bulova to
Citizen Watch Co., Ltd. for approximately $250 million, subject to adjustment.
We expect to record a pretax gain of approximately $105 million due to the
transaction.

We have an effective Registration
Statement on Form S-3 registering the future sale of an unlimited amount of our
debt and equity securities.

We continue to pursue conservative
financial strategies while seeking opportunities for responsible growth. These
include the expansion of existing businesses, full or partial acquisitions and
dispositions, and opportunities for efficiencies and economies of
scale.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

In the course of selling business
entities and assets to third parties, CNA has agreed to indemnify purchasers for
losses arising out of breaches of representation and warranties with respect to
the business entities or assets being sold, including, in certain cases, losses
arising from undisclosed liabilities or certain named litigation. Such
indemnification provisions generally survive for periods ranging from nine
months following the applicable closing date to the expiration of the relevant
statutes of limitation. As of December 31, 2007, the aggregate amount of
quantifiable indemnification agreements in effect for sales of CNA business
entities, assets, and third party loans was $873 million.

In addition, CNA has agreed to provide
indemnification to third party purchasers for certain losses associated with
sold business entities or assets that are not limited by a contractual monetary
amount. As of December 31, 2007, CNA had outstanding unlimited indemnifications
in connection with the sales of certain of its business entities or assets that
included tax liabilities arising prior to a purchaser’s ownership of an entity
or asset, defects in title at the time of sale, employee claims arising prior to
closing and in some cases, losses arising from certain litigation and
undisclosed liabilities. These indemnification agreements survive until the
applicable statutes of limitation expire, or until the agreed upon contract
terms expire. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, CNA has recorded approximately
$27 million and $28 million of liabilities related to the CNA indemnification
agreements.

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had no
other off-balance sheet arrangements.

INVESTMENTS

Investment activities of non-insurance
companies include investments in fixed income securities, equity securities
including short sales, derivative instruments and short term investments, and
are carried at fair value. Securities that are considered part of our trading
portfolio, short sales and derivative instruments are marked to market and
reported as net investment income in the Consolidated Statements of
Income.

We enter into short sales and invest in
certain derivative instruments that are used for asset and liability management
activities, income enhancements to our portfolio management strategy and to
benefit from anticipated future movements in the underlying markets. If such
movements do not occur as anticipated, then significant losses may occur.
Monitoring procedures include senior management review of daily detailed reports
of existing positions and valuation fluctuations to ensure that open positions
are consistent with our portfolio strategy.

Credit exposure associated with
non-performance by the counterparties to derivative instruments is generally
limited to the uncollateralized change in fair value of the derivative
instruments recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We mitigate the risk
of non-performance by monitoring the creditworthiness of counterparties and
diversifying derivatives to multiple counterparties. We occasionally require
collateral from our derivative investment counterparties depending on the amount
of the exposure and the credit rating of the counterparty.

We do not believe that any of the
derivative instruments we use are unusually complex, nor do the use of these
instruments, in our opinion, result in a higher degree of risk. See “Results of
Operations,” “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” and
Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of
this Report for additional information with respect to derivative instruments,
including recognized gains and losses on these instruments.

The
      change in net unrealized losses on trading securities included in net
      investment income was $15 million and $7 million for the years ended
      December 31, 2007 and 2005. There was no change in net unrealized gains
      (losses) on trading securities included in net investment income for the
      year ended December 31, 2006.

Net investment income increased by $21
million for 2007 compared with 2006. The improvement was primarily driven by an
increase in the overall invested asset base and a reduction of interest expense
on funds withheld and other deposits as discussed further below. These increases
were substantially offset by decreases in limited partnership income and results
from the trading portfolio. The decreased income from the trading portfolio was
largely offset by a

– (Continued)

corresponding
decrease in the policyholders’ funds reserves supported by the trading
portfolio, which is included in Insurance claims and policyholders’ benefits on
the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Net investment income increased by $520
million for 2006 compared with 2005. The improvement was primarily driven by
interest rate increases across fixed maturity securities and short term
investments, an increase in the overall invested asset base resulting from
improved cash flow and a reduction of interest expense on funds withheld and
other deposits as discussed further below. Also impacting net investment income
was increased income from the trading portfolio of approximately $56 million.
The increased income from the trading portfolio was largely offset by a
corresponding increase in the policyholders’ funds reserves supported by the
trading portfolio.

During 2006 and 2005, CNA commuted
several significant finite reinsurance contracts which contained interest
crediting provisions. The pretax interest expense on funds withheld related to
these significant commuted contracts was $14 million and $84 million for the

investment income in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The 2005 amount
included interest charges associated with the contract commuted in 2006. As of
December 31, 2006, no further interest expense was due on the funds withheld on
the commuted contracts. See Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included under Item 8 for additional information related to interest
costs on funds withheld and other deposits.

The bond segment of the investment
portfolio yielded 5.8%, 5.6% and 4.9% for the years ended December 31, 2007,

Net realized investment results
decreased by $243 million for 2007 compared with 2006. The decrease in net
realized investment results was primarily driven by an increase in
other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) losses related to securities for which
CNA did not assert an intent to hold until an anticipated recovery in value. For
2007, OTTI losses of $428 million were recorded primarily within asset-backed
bonds and corporate and other taxable bonds sectors. The judgment as to whether
an impairment is other-than-temporary incorporates many factors including the
likelihood of a security recovering to cost, CNA’s intent and ability to hold
the security until recovery, general market conditions, specific sector views
and significant changes in expected cash flows. The Impairment Committee’s
decision to record an OTTI loss is primarily based on whether the security’s
fair value is likely to recover to its amortized cost in light of all the
factors considered over the expected holding period. Current factors and market
conditions that contributed to recording impairments included significant credit
spread widening in fixed income sectors and market disruptions

surrounding
sub-prime residential mortgage concerns. In some instances, an OTTI loss was
recorded because, in the Impairment Committee’s judgment, recovery to cost is
not likely. The majority of the OTTI losses recorded in 2007 were due to CNA’s
lack of intent to hold until an anticipated recovery of cost or maturity. For
2007, 9.0% of the OTTI losses were taken on common and preferred stocks and
41.0% were taken on below investment grade securities. Further information on
CNA’s OTTI process is set forth in Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial
Statements included under Item 8.

Net realized investment results
increased by $70 million for 2006 compared with 2005. The increase in net
realized investment results was primarily driven by improved results in fixed
maturity securities, partially offset by increases in interest rate related OTTI
losses for which CNA did not assert an intent to hold until an anticipated
recovery in value. OTTI losses of $101 million were recorded in 2006 primarily
in the corporate and other taxable bonds sector. Other realized investment gains
for the year ended December 31, 2006, included a $37 million pretax gain related
to a settlement received as a result of bankruptcy litigation of a major
telecommunications corporation. OTTI losses of $64 million were recorded in 2005
across various sectors, including an OTTI loss of $20 million related to loans
made under a credit facility to a national contractor, that were classified as
fixed maturities. For additional information on loans to the national
contractor, see Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

A primary objective in the management of
the fixed maturity and equity portfolios is to optimize return relative to
underlying liabilities and respective liquidity needs. CNA’s views on the
current interest rate environment, tax regulations, asset class valuations,
specific security issuer and broader industry segment conditions, and the
domestic and global economic conditions, are some of the factors that enter into
an investment decision. CNA also continually monitors exposure to issuers of
securities held and broader industry sector exposures and may from time to time
adjust such exposures based on its views of a specific issuer or industry
sector.

A further consideration in the
management of the investment portfolio is the characteristics of the underlying
liabilities and the ability to align the duration of the portfolio to those
liabilities to meet future liquidity needs, minimize interest rate risk and
maintain a level of income sufficient to support the underlying insurance
liabilities. For portfolios where future liability cash flows are determinable
and long term in nature, CNA segregates investments for asset/liability
management purposes.

The segregated investments support
liabilities primarily in the Life & Group Non-Core segment including
annuities, structured benefit settlements and long term care products. The
remaining investments are managed to support the Standard Lines, Specialty Lines
and Other Insurance segments.

The effective durations of fixed
maturity securities, short term investments and interest rate derivatives are
presented in the table below. Short term investments are net of securities
lending collateral and accounts payable and receivable amounts for securities
purchased and sold, but not yet settled. The segregated investments had an
effective duration of 10.7 years and 9.8 years at December 31, 2007 and 2006.
The remaining interest sensitive investments had an effective duration of 3.3
years and 3.2 years at December 31, 2007 and 2006. The overall effective
duration was 5.1 years and 4.7 years at December 31, 2007 and 2006.

The investment portfolio is periodically
analyzed for changes in duration and related price change risk. Additionally,
CNA periodically reviews the sensitivity of the portfolio to the level of
foreign exchange rates and other factors that

Results of Operations

Investments

contribute
to market price changes. A summary of these risks and specific analysis on
changes is included in Item 7A – Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about
Market Risk included herein.

CNA invests in certain derivative
financial instruments primarily to reduce its exposure to market risk
(principally interest rate, equity price and foreign currency risk) and credit
risk (risk of nonperformance of underlying obligor). Derivative securities are
recorded at fair value at the reporting date. CNA also uses derivatives to
mitigate market risk by purchasing Standard and Poor’s 500 Index futures in a
notional amount equal to the contract liability relating to Life & Group
Non-Core indexed group annuity contracts. CNA provided collateral to satisfy
margin deposits on exchange-traded derivatives totaling $35 million as of
December 31, 2007. For over-the-counter derivative transactions CNA utilizes
International Swaps and Derivatives Association Master Agreements that specify
certain limits over which collateral is exchanged. As of December 31, 2007, CNA
provided $29 million of cash as collateral for over-the-counter derivative
instruments.

CNA classifies its fixed maturity and
equity securities as either available-for-sale or trading, and as such, they are
carried at fair value. The amortized cost of fixed maturity securities is
adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity,
which is included in Net investment income. Changes in fair value related to
available-for-sale securities are reported as a component of Accumulated other
comprehensive income. Changes in fair value of trading securities are reported
within Net investment income. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included under Item 8 for additional information on the valuation of
investments.

A significant judgment in the valuation
of investments is the determination of when an OTTI has occurred. CNA analyzes
securities on at least a quarterly basis. Part of this analysis is to monitor
the length of time and severity of the decline below amortized cost for those
securities in an unrealized loss position. Information on CNA’s OTTI process is
set forth in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included
under Item 8.

Investments in the general account had a
net unrealized gain of $74 million at December 31, 2007 compared with a net
unrealized gain of $966 million at December 31, 2006. The unrealized position at
December 31, 2007 was comprised of a net unrealized loss of $131 million for
fixed maturities, a net unrealized gain of $202 million for equity securities
and a net unrealized gain of $3 million for short term securities. The
unrealized position at December 31, 2006 was comprised of a net unrealized gain
of $716 million for fixed maturities, a net unrealized gain of $249 million for
equity securities, and a net unrealized gain of $1 million for short term
securities. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included under Item 8 for further detail on the unrealized position of CNA’s
general account investment portfolio.

As part of the ongoing OTTI monitoring
process, CNA evaluated the facts and circumstances based on available
information for each of the non-investment grade securities and determined that
the securities presented in the above tables were temporarily impaired when
evaluated at December 31, 2007 or 2006. This determination was based on a number
of factors that CNA regularly considers including, but not limited to: the
issuers’ ability to meet current and future interest and principal payments, an
evaluation of the issuers’ financial condition and near term prospects, CNA’s
assessment of the sector outlook and estimates of the fair value of any
underlying collateral. In all cases where a decline in value is judged to be
temporary, CNA has the intent and ability to hold these securities for a period
of time sufficient to recover the amortized cost of its investment through an
anticipated recovery in the fair value of such securities or by holding the
securities to maturity. In many cases, the securities held are matched to
liabilities as part of ongoing asset/liability duration management. As such, CNA
continually assesses its ability to hold securities for a time sufficient to
recover any temporary loss in value or until maturity. CNA believes it has
sufficient levels of liquidity so as to not impact the asset/liability
management process.

CNA’s equity securities classified as
available-for-sale as of December 31, 2007 that were in a gross unrealized
loss position had a fair value of $102 million and gross unrealized losses of
$12 million. Under the same process as followed for fixed maturity securities,
CNA monitors the equity securities for other-than-temporary declines in value.
In all cases where a decline in value is judged to be temporary, CNA has the
intent and ability to hold these securities for a period of time sufficient to
recover the cost of our investment through an anticipated recovery in the fair
value of such securities.

Invested assets are exposed to various
risks, such as interest rate and credit risk. Due to the level of risk
associated with certain invested assets and the level of uncertainty related to
changes in the value of these assets, it is possible that changes in these risks
in the near term, including increases in interest rates and further credit
spread widening, could have an adverse material impact on our results of
operations or equity.

Within CNA’s overall investment
portfolio, $3,810 million of CNA’s securities are rated AAA as a result of
insurance from six different mono-line insurers. Insured municipal bonds are
$3,602 million of this total and represent 47.0% of CNA’s total municipal bond
holdings. The underlying average credit quality of the municipal bonds would be
A+ without the benefit of the insurance. Should the insurance be deemed
worthless, we do not believe there would be a material impact to our results of
operations or financial condition.

The general account portfolio consists
primarily of high quality bonds, 89.2% and 90.9% of which were rated as
investment grade (rated BBB- or higher) at December 31, 2007 and
2006.

Included in the Company’s fixed
maturity securities at December 31, 2007 were $11,632 million of asset-backed
securities, at fair value, which represents 24.3% of total invested assets.
Structured security types within this category consist of approximately 10.4% in
mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”), 60.6% in collateralized mortgage obligations
(“CMO”), 25.8% in corporate asset-backed obligations (“ABS”), and 3.2% in
collateralized debt obligations (“CDO”). Of the total asset-backed securities,
88.1% were U.S. Government Agency issued or AAA rated. The majority of these
asset-backed securities are actively traded in liquid markets. The Company
obtains fair values for a majority of these securities from a third party
pricing service. Of the total invested assets, $1,105 million or 2.3% have
exposure to sub-prime residential mortgage (“sub-prime”) collateral, as measured
by the original deal structure, while 2.5% have exposure to Alternative A (“Alt
A”) collateral. Of the securities with sub-prime exposure, approximately 98.0%
were rated as investment grade, while 99.0% of the Alt A securities were rated
investment grade. In addition to sub-prime exposure in fixed maturity
securities, there is exposure of approximately $30 million through other
investments, including limited partnerships. The Company has mitigated a portion
of its sub-prime exposure through an economic hedge position in Credit Default
Swaps (“CDS”) from which it recognized net gains of $40 million for the year
ended December 31, 2007.

All available-for-sale asset-backed
securities in an unrealized loss position are reviewed as part of the ongoing
OTTI process and resulted in OTTI losses of $180 million for the year ended
December 31, 2007. Included in this OTTI loss was $145 million related to
securities with sub-prime and Alt A exposure. The Company’s review of these
securities includes an analysis of cash flow modeling under various default
scenarios, the seniority of the specific tranche within the deal structure, the
composition of the collateral and the actual default experience. Given current

Company’s individual sub-prime and Alt A exposures, the Company believes that
all remaining unrealized losses are temporary in nature. Continued deterioration
in these markets beyond current expectations may cause the Company to reconsider

ACCOUNTING
STANDARDS

In September of 2006, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value
Measurements.” SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP and expands disclosures about fair
value measurements. SFAS No. 157 retains the exchange price notion in the
definition of fair value and clarifies that the exchange price is the price in
an orderly transaction between market participants to sell the asset or transfer
the liability in the market in which the reporting entity would transact for the
asset or liability. SFAS No. 157 emphasizes that fair value is a market-based
measurement, not an entity-specific measurement and the fair value measurement
should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use
in pricing the asset or liability. SFAS No. 157 expands disclosures surrounding
the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities and specifically focuses
on the sources used to measure fair value. In instances of recurring use of fair
value measures using unobservable inputs, SFAS No. 157 requires separate
disclosure of the effect on earnings for the period. SFAS No. 157 is effective
for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. A one year deferral has been
granted for the implementation of SFAS No. 157 for other nonfinancial assets and
liabilities. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 is not expected to have a material
impact on our results of operations and equity.

In February of 2007, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities.” SFAS No. 159 provides companies with an option to report selected
financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The objective of SFAS No. 159 is
to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the
volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities
differently. Generally accepted accounting principles have required different
measurement attributes for different assets and liabilities that can create
artificial volatility in earnings. SFAS No. 159 helps to mitigate volatility by
enabling companies to report related assets and liabilities at fair value, which
would likely reduce the need for companies to comply with detailed rules for
hedge accounting. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2007. The adoption of SFAS No. 159 is not expected to have a
material impact on our results of operations and equity.

In December of 2007, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements.”
This standard will improve, simplify, and converge internationally the reporting
of noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 160
requires all entities to report noncontrolling (minority) interests in
subsidiaries in the same way - as equity in the consolidated financial
statements. Moreover, SFAS No. 160 requires that transactions between an entity
and noncontrolling interests be treated as equity transactions. SFAS No. 160 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. As a result, after
January 1, 2009, the Company’s deferred gains related to the issuances of
Boardwalk Pipeline common units ($472 million at December 31, 2007) will be
recognized in the Shareholders’ equity section of the Consolidated Balance
Sheets as opposed to the Consolidated Statements of Income.

FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS

Investors are cautioned that certain
statements contained in this Report as well as some statements in periodic press
releases and some oral statements made by our officials and our subsidiaries
during presentations about us, are “forward-looking” statements within the
meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”).
Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, any statement that may
project, indicate or imply future results, events, performance or achievements,
and may contain the words “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “estimate,”

expressions. In addition, any statement concerning future financial performance
(including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business
strategies or prospects, and possible actions taken by us or our subsidiaries,
which may be provided by management are also forward-looking statements as
defined by the Act.

Forward-looking statements are based on
current expectations and projections about future events and are inherently

Item
7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

We are a large diversified financial
services company. As such, we and our subsidiaries have significant amounts of
financial instruments that involve market risk. Our measure of market risk
exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair value of our financial
instruments. Changes in the trading portfolio are recognized in the Consolidated
Statements of Income. Market risk exposure is presented for each class of
financial instrument held by us at December 31, assuming immediate adverse
market movements of the magnitude described below. We believe that the various
rates of adverse market movements represent a measure of exposure to loss under
hypothetically assumed adverse conditions. The estimated market risk exposure
represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the
maximum possible loss nor any expected actual loss, even under adverse
conditions, because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ. In
addition, since our investment portfolio is subject to change based on our
portfolio management strategy as well as in response to changes in the market,
these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results which may
occur.


Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Exposure
to market risk is managed and monitored by senior management. Senior management
approves our overall investment strategy and has responsibility to ensure that
the investment positions are consistent with that strategy with an acceptable
level of risk. We may manage risk by buying or selling instruments or entering
into offsetting positions.

Interest
Rate Risk – We have exposure to interest rate risk arising from changes in the
level or volatility of interest rates. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to
interest rate risk by utilizing instruments such as interest rate swaps,

interest
rate caps, commitments to purchase securities, options, futures and forwards. We
monitor our sensitivity to interest rate risk by evaluating the change in the
value of our financial assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest
rates. The evaluation is performed by applying an instantaneous change in
interest rates by varying magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the
effect such a change in rates would have on the recorded market value of our
investments and the resulting effect on shareholders’ equity. The analysis
presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to
selected changes in market rates and prices which we believe are reasonably
possible over a one-year period.

The sensitivity analysis estimates the
change in the market value of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities that
were held on December 31, 2007 and 2006 due to instantaneous parallel shifts in
the yield curve of 100 basis points, with all other variables held
constant.

The interest rates on certain types of
assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest
rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market
rates. Accordingly, the analysis may not be indicative of, is not intended to
provide, and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes of
market interest rates on our earnings or shareholders’ equity. Further, the
computations do not contemplate any actions we could undertake in response to
changes in interest rates.

Our debt is denominated in U.S. Dollars
and has been primarily issued at fixed rates, therefore, interest expense would
not be impacted by interest rate shifts. The impact of a 100 basis point
increase in interest rates on fixed rate debt would result in a decrease in
market value of $333 million and $560 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. The impact of a 100 basis point decrease would result in an
increase in market value of $350 million and $353 million at December 31, 2007
and 2006 respectively. HighMount has entered into interest rate swaps for a
notional amount of $1.6 billion to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in LIBOR.
These swaps effectively fix the interest rate at 5.8%. Gains or losses from
derivative instruments used for hedging purposes, to the extent realized, will
generally be offset by recognition of the hedged transaction.

Equity Price Risk – We have exposure to
equity price risk as a result of our investment in equity securities and equity
derivatives. Equity price risk results from changes in the level or volatility
of equity prices which affect the value of equity securities or instruments that
derive their value from such securities or indexes. Equity price risk was
measured assuming an instantaneous 25% decrease in the underlying reference
price or index from its level at December 31, 2007 and 2006, with all other
variables held constant.

Foreign Exchange Rate Risk – Foreign
exchange rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in foreign currency
exchange rates will impact the value of financial instruments. We have foreign
exchange rate exposure when we buy or sell foreign currencies or financial
instruments denominated in a foreign currency. This exposure is mitigated by our
asset/liability matching strategy and through the use of futures for those
instruments which are not matched. Our foreign transactions are primarily
denominated in Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, British pounds, Japanese
yen and the European Monetary Unit. The sensitivity analysis assumes an
instantaneous 20% decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates versus the
U.S. dollar from their levels at December 31, 2007 and 2006, with all other
variables held constant.

Commodity Price Risk – We have exposure
to price risk as a result of our investments in commodities. Commodity price
risk results from changes in the level or volatility of commodity prices that
impact instruments which derive their value from such commodities. Commodity
price risk was measured assuming an instantaneous increase in commodity prices
of 20% from their levels at December 31, 2007 and 2006. The impact of a change
in commodity prices on HighMount’s non-trading commodity-based financial
derivative instruments at a point in time is not necessarily representative of
the results that will be realized when such contracts are ultimately settled.
Net losses from commodity derivative instruments used for hedging purposes, to
the extent realized, will generally be offset by recognition of the underlying
hedged transaction, such as revenue from sales.


Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Credit
Risk – We are exposed to credit risk which relates to the risk of loss resulting
from the nonperformance by a customer of its contractual obligations. Boardwalk
Pipeline has exposure related to receivables for services provided, as well as
volumes owed by customers for imbalances or gas lent by Boardwalk Pipeline to
them generally under parking and lending services and no-notice services.
Boardwalk Pipeline maintains credit policies intended to minimize this risk and
actively monitors these policies. Natural gas price volatility has increased
dramatically in recent years, which has materially increased Boardwalk
Pipeline’s credit risk related to gas loaned to its customers. As of December
31, 2007,

the
amount of gas loaned out was approximately 12.7 trillion British thermal units
(“TBtu”) and, assuming an average market price during December 2007 of $7.13 per
million British thermal units (“MMBtu”), the market value of gas loaned out at
December 31, 2007 would have been approximately $91 million. If any significant
customer should have credit or financial problems resulting in a delay or
failure to repay the gas it owes Boardwalk Pipeline, it could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows.

The following tables present our market
risk by category (equity markets, interest rates, foreign currency exchange
rates and commodity prices) on the basis of those entered into for trading
purposes and other than trading purposes.

Note:

The
      calculation of estimated market risk exposure is based on assumed adverse
      changes in the underlying reference price or index of (1) a decrease in
      equity prices of 25%, (2) an increase in interest rates of 100 basis
      points and (3) an increase in commodity prices of 20%. Adverse changes on
      options which differ from those presented above would not necessarily
      result in a proportionate change to the estimated market risk
      exposure.

(a)

A
      decrease in equity prices of 25% would result in market risk amounting to
      $(171) and $(162) at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. This market
      risk would be offset by decreases in liabilities to customers under
      variable insurance contracts.

      points and (3) an increase in commodity prices of
  20%.

(a)

Certain
      securities are denominated in foreign currencies. An assumed 20% decline
      in the underlying exchange rates would result in an aggregate foreign
      currency exchange rate risk of $(317) and $(283) at December 31, 2007 and
      2006, respectively.

(b)

Certain
      fixed maturities positions include options embedded in convertible debt

      market risk amounting to $(106) and $(227) at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
      respectively.

(c)

The
      market risk at December 31, 2007 will generally be offset by recognition

NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note
1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of
presentation

-

Loews
Corporation is a holding company. Its subsidiaries are engaged in the following
lines of business: commercial property and casualty insurance (CNA Financial
Corporation (“CNA”), an 89% owned subsidiary); the production and sale of
cigarettes (Lorillard, Inc. (“Lorillard”), a wholly owned subsidiary); the
operation of offshore oil and gas drilling rigs (Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.
(“Diamond Offshore”), a 51% owned subsidiary); exploration, production and
marketing of natural gas and natural gas liquids (HighMount Exploration &
Production LLC (“HighMount”), a wholly owed subsidiary); the operation of
interstate natural gas transmission pipeline systems (Boardwalk Pipeline
Partners, LP (“Boardwalk Pipeline”), a 70% owned subsidiary); and the operation
of hotels (Loews Hotels Holding Corporation (“Loews Hotels”), a wholly owned
subsidiary). The Company sold Bulova Corporation (“Bulova”) to Citizen Watch
Co., Ltd. for approximately $250 million, subject to adjustment, in January of
2008. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “Company,” “Loews” and
“Registrant” as used herein mean Loews Corporation excluding its
subsidiaries.

On July
31, 2007, HighMount acquired certain exploration and production assets, and
assumed certain related obligations, from subsidiaries of Dominion Resources,
Inc. (“Dominion”) for $4.0 billion, subject to adjustment. (See Note
14.)

On
December 17, 2007, the Company announced that its Board of Directors has
approved a plan to dispose of its entire ownership interest in Lorillard in a
tax-free manner, resulting in the elimination of the Carolina Group, and all of
the Carolina Group stock, and establishing Lorillard as an independent public
company. The disposition would be accomplished through (i) redemption of all
outstanding Carolina Group stock in exchange for shares of Lorillard common
stock, with holders of Carolina Group stock receiving one share of Lorillard
common stock in exchange for each share of Carolina Group stock they currently
own, and (ii) disposition of the Company’s remaining Lorillard common stock in
an exchange offer for shares of outstanding Loews common stock or, if the
Company determines not to effect the exchange offer or if the exchange offer is
not fully subscribed, as a pro rata dividend to holders of Loews common
stock.

Principles
of consolidation – The consolidated financial statements include all significant
subsidiaries and all material intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated. The equity method of accounting is used for investments in
associated companies in which the Company generally has an interest of 20% to
50%.

Accounting
estimates – The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related notes.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Accounting
changes

-

In March of
2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Staff
Position (“FSP”) FTB 85-4-1, “Accounting for Life Settlement Contracts by Third
Party Investors.” A life settlement contract for purposes of FSP FTB 85-4-1 is a
contract between the owner of a life insurance policy (the “policy owner”) and a
third party investor (“investor”). The previous accounting guidance, FASB
Technical Bulletin (“FTB”) No. 85-4, “Accounting for Purchases of Life
Insurance,” required the purchaser of life insurance contracts to account for
the life insurance contract at its cash surrender value. Because life insurance
contracts are purchased in the secondary market at amounts in excess of the
policies’ cash surrender values, the application of guidance in FTB No. 85-4
created a loss upon acquisition of policies. FSP FTB 85-4-1 provides initial and
subsequent measurement guidance and financial statement presentation and
disclosure guidance for investments by third party investors in life settlement
contracts. FSP FTB 85-4-1 allows an investor to elect to account for its
investments in life settlement contracts using either the investment method or
the fair value method. The election shall be made on an instrument-by-instrument
basis and is irrevocable. The Company adopted FSP FTB 85-4-1 on January 1,
2007.

Prior to
2002, CNA purchased investments in life settlement contracts. Under a life
settlement contract, CNA obtained the ownership and beneficiary rights of an
underlying life insurance policy. CNA elected to account for its investments in
life settlement contracts using the fair value method and the initial impact
upon adoption of FSP FTB


Notes
      to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
      1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies –
      (Continued)

85-4-1
under the fair value method was an increase to retained earnings of $34 million,
net of tax and minority interest.

Under the
fair value method, each life settlement contract is carried at its fair value at
the end of each reporting period. The change in fair value, life insurance
proceeds received and periodic maintenance costs, such as premiums, necessary to
keep the underlying policy in force, are recorded in Other revenues on the
Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2007. Amounts
presented related to prior years were accounted for under the previous
accounting guidance, FTB No. 85-4, where the carrying value of life settlement
contracts was the cash surrender value, and revenue was recognized and included
in Other revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income when the life
insurance policy underlying the life settlement contract matured. Under the
previous accounting guidance, maintenance expenses were expensed as incurred and
included in Other operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income.
CNA’s investments in life settlement contracts of $115 million at December 31,
2007 are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The cash
receipts and payments related to life settlement contracts are included in Cash
flows from operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for
all periods presented.

The fair
value of each life insurance policy is determined as the present value of the
anticipated death benefits less anticipated premium payments for that policy.
These anticipated values are determined using mortality rates and policy terms
that are distinct for each insured. The discount rate used reflects current
risk-free rates at applicable durations and the risks associated with assessing
the current medical condition of the insured, the potential volatility of
mortality experience for the portfolio and longevity risk. CNA used its own
experience to determine the fair value of its portfolio of life settlement
contracts. The mortality experience of this portfolio of life insurance policies
may vary by quarter due to its relatively small size.

The
following table details the values of life settlement contracts as of December
31, 2007.

CNA uses
an actuarial model to estimate the aggregate face amount of life insurance that
is expected to mature in each future year and the corresponding fair value. This
model projects the likelihood of the insured’s death for each in force policy
based upon CNA’s estimated mortality rates. The number of life settlement
contracts presented in the table above is based upon the average face amount of
in force policies estimated to mature in each future year.

The
increase in fair value recognized for the year ended December 31, 2007 on
contracts still being held was $12 million. The gain recognized during the year
ended December 31, 2007 on contracts that matured was $38 million.

In June
of 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 48, “Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.” FIN
No. 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize,
measure, present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax
positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return. FIN No.
48 states that a tax benefit from an uncertain position may be recognized only
if it is “more likely than not” that the position is sustainable, based on its
technical merits. The tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount
of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon
ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all
relevant information. The Company adopted FIN No. 48 on January 1, 2007 and
recorded a decrease to retained earnings of


Notes

Note
      1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies –
      (Continued)

approximately
$37 million, net of minority interest. See Note 11 for additional information on
the provision for income taxes.

In
September of 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Standards (“SFAS”) No.
158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
Plans.” SFAS No. 158 requires an employer to recognize the funded status of a
defined benefit postretirement plan in its statement of financial position and
to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes
occur through comprehensive income. The Company adopted SFAS No. 158 in December
of 2006. Adoption of the pronouncement decreased equity by $143 million as of
December 31, 2006. See Note 18 for additional information on the Company’s
benefit plans.

Investments
– Investments in securities are carried as follows:

The
Company classifies its fixed maturity securities (bonds and redeemable preferred
stocks) and its equity securities held principally by insurance subsidiaries as
either available-for-sale or trading, and as such, they are carried at fair
value.Changes in fair value of trading securities are reported within net
investment income. The amortized cost of fixed maturity securities classified as
available-for-sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts to maturity, which are included in net investment income. Changes in
fair value related to available-for-sale securities are reported as a component
of Accumulated other comprehensive income. Investments are written down to fair
value and losses are recognized in the income statement when a decline in value
is determined to be other-than-temporary. See Note 2 for information related to
the Company’s impairment charges.

For
asset-backed securities included in fixed maturity securities, the Company
recognizes income using a constant effective yield based on anticipated
prepayments and the estimated economic life of the securities. When estimates of
prepayments change, the effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual
payments to date and anticipated future payments. The net investment in the
securities is adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the new
effective yield been applied since the acquisition of the securities. Such
adjustments are reflected in net investment income. Interest income on lower
rated beneficial interests in securitized financial assets is determined using
the prospective yield method.

Real
estate investments are carried at the lower of cost or market value. These items
are included in “Other investments” in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets.

Short
term investments consist primarily of U.S. government securities, repurchase
agreements, money market funds and commercial paper. These investments are
generally carried at fair value, which approximates amortized cost.

All
securities transactions are recorded on the trade date. The cost of securities
sold is generally determined by the identified certificate method.

The
Company’s carrying value of investments in limited partnerships is its share of
the net asset value of each partnership, as determined by the general partner,
and typically reflects a reporting lag of up to three months. Changes in net
asset values are accounted for under the equity method and recorded within net
investment income. The majority of the limited partnerships employ strategies to
generate returns through investing in a substantial number of securities that
are readily marketable. These strategies may include the use of leverage and
hedging techniques that potentially introduce more volatility and risk to the
partnerships. In accordance with FIN No. 46R, “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51,” the Company consolidated
one limited partnership.

Other
investments also include certain derivative securities. Investments in
derivative securities are carried at fair value with changes in fair value
reported as a component of investment gains or losses or Accumulated other
comprehensive income, depending on their hedge designation. Changes in the fair
value of derivative securities which are not designated as hedges, are reported
as a component of investment gains or losses in the Consolidated Statements of
Income. A derivative is typically defined as an instrument whose value is
“derived” from an underlying instrument, index or rate, has a notional amount,
requires little or no initial investment, and can be net settled. Derivatives
include, but are not limited to, the following types of investments: interest
rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, put and call options, warrants,
futures, forwards, commitments to purchase securities, credit


Notes
      to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
      1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies –
      (Continued)

default
swaps and combinations of the foregoing. Derivatives embedded within
non-derivative instruments (such as

call options embedded in convertible
bonds) must be split from the host instrument when the embedded derivative is
not clearly and closely related to the host instrument.

The
Company’s derivatives are reported as other invested assets or other
liabilities. Embedded derivative instruments subject to bifurcation are reported
together with the host contract, at fair value. If certain criteria are met, a
derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge of exposures to changes in
fair value, cash flows or foreign currency exchange rates. The accounting for
changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the
derivative, the nature of any hedge designation thereon and whether the
derivative was transacted in a designated trading portfolio.

The
Company’s accounting for changes in the fair value of derivative instruments is
as follows:

Nature
      of Hedge Designation

Derivative’s
      Change in Fair Value Reflected in

No
      hedge designation

Investment
      gains (losses).

Fair
      value

Investment
      gains (losses), along with the change in fair value of   the
      hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged
        risk.

Cash
      flow

Accumulated
      other comprehensive income (loss), with   subsequent
      reclassification to earnings when the hedged   transaction,
      asset   or liability impacts earnings.

Foreign
      currency

Consistent
      with fair value or cash flow above, depending on the   nature of
      the hedging relationship.

The
Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and
hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for
undertaking various hedging transactions. The Company also formally assesses
(both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis) whether the derivatives
that are used in hedging transactions have been highly effective in offsetting
changes in fair value or cash flows of hedged items and whether those
derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. When
it is determined that a derivative for which hedge accounting has been
designated is not (or ceases to be) highly effective, the Company discontinues
hedge accounting prospectively.

The
Company and certain of its subsidiaries periodically enter into derivative
contracts to manage exposure to commodity price risk. A significant portion of
the Company’s hedge strategies represents cash flow hedges of the variable price
risk associated with the purchase and sale of natural gas and other
energy-related products. The Company also uses interest rate swaps to hedge its
exposure to variable interest rates on long term debt. Any ineffectiveness is
recorded currently in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Derivatives
held in designated trading portfolios are carried at fair value with changes
therein reflected in investment income. These derivatives are generally not
designated as hedges.

Securities
lending and repurchase activities – The Company lends securities to unrelated
parties, primarily major brokerage firms. Borrowers of these securities must
deposit collateral with the Company of at least 102% of the fair value of the
securities loaned if the collateral is cash or securities. The Company maintains
effective control over all loaned securities and, therefore, continues to report
such securities as Fixed maturity securities in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets.

Cash
collateral received on these transactions is invested in short term investments
with an offsetting liability recognized for the obligation to return the
collateral. Non-cash collateral, such as securities received by the Company, is
not reflected as assets of the Company as there exists no right to sell or
re-pledge the collateral. The fair value of collateral held and included in
short term investments was $63 million and $3,602 million at December 31, 2007
and 2006. The fair value of non-cash collateral was $273 million and $385
million at December 31, 2007 and 2006.

      (Continued)

Gain on
issuance of subsidiary stock – Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)
Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5-H, “Accounting for Sales of Stock by a
Subsidiary” (“SAB No. 51”), provides guidance on accounting for

the
effect of issuances of a subsidiary’s stock on the parent’s investment in that
subsidiary. SAB No. 51 allows registrants to elect an accounting policy of
recording such increases or decreases in a parent’s investment (SAB No. 51 gains
or losses, respectively) either in income or in shareholders’ equity. In
accordance with the election provided in SAB No. 51, the Company’s policy is to
record such SAB No. 51 gains or losses directly to the income
statement.

Revenue
Recognition – Insurance premiums on property and casualty and accident and
health insurance contracts are recognized in proportion to the underlying risk
insured which principally are earned ratably over the duration of the policies
after deductions for ceded insurance premiums. The reserve for unearned premiums
on these contracts represents the portion of premiums written relating to the
unexpired terms of coverage.

An
estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded on the basis of periodic
evaluations of balances due currently or in the future from insureds, including
amounts due from insureds related to losses under high deductible policies,
management’s experience and current economic conditions.

Property
and casualty contracts that are retrospectively rated contain provisions that
result in an adjustment to the initial policy premium depending on the contract
provisions and loss experience of the insured during the experience period. For
such contracts, CNA estimates the amount of ultimate premiums that CNA may earn
upon completion of the experience period and recognizes either an asset or a
liability for the difference between the initial policy premium and the
estimated ultimate premium. CNA adjusts such estimated ultimate premium amounts
during the course of the experience period based on actual results to date. The
resulting adjustment is recorded as either a reduction of or an increase to the
earned premiums for the period.

Revenue
from cigarette sales is recognized upon shipment of goods, when title and risk
of loss passes to customers and collectability is reasonably
assured.

Contract
drilling revenue from dayrate drilling contracts is recognized as services are
performed. In connection with such drilling contracts, Diamond Offshore may
receive fees (either lump-sum or dayrate) for the mobilization of equipment.
These fees are earned as services are performed over the initial term of the
related drilling contracts. Absent a contract, mobilization costs are recognized
currently. From time to time, Diamond Offshore may receive fees from its
customers for capital improvements to their rigs. Diamond Offshore defers such
fees received and recognizes these fees into revenue on a straight-line basis
over the period of the related drilling contract. Diamond Offshore capitalizes
the costs of such capital improvements and depreciates them over the estimated
useful life of the improvement.

Natural
gas and natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) production revenue is recognized based on
actual volumes of natural gas and NGLs sold to purchasers. Sales require
delivery of the product to the purchaser, passage of title and probability of
collection of purchaser amounts owed. Natural gas and NGL production revenue
includes sales of natural gas and NGLs by HighMount. Natural gas and NGL
production revenue is reported net of royalties. HighMount uses the sales method
of accounting for gas imbalances. An imbalance is created when the volumes of
gas sold by HighMount pertaining to a property do not equate to the volumes
produced to which HighMount is entitled based on its interest in the property.
An asset or liability is recognized to the extent that HighMount has an
imbalance in excess of the remaining reserves on the underlying
properties.

Revenues
from the transportation of natural gas are recognized in the period the service
is provided based on contractual terms and the related transported volumes.
Revenues from storage services are recognized over the term of the contract.
Texas Gas Transmission, LLC (“Texas Gas”), a wholly owned subsidiary of
Boardwalk Pipeline, is subject to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”)
regulations and, accordingly, certain revenues collected may be subject to
possible refunds upon final orders in pending cases. An estimated refund
liability is recorded considering regulatory proceedings, advice of counsel and
estimated total exposure.

Insurance

Claim and
claim adjustment expense reserves – Claim and claim adjustment expense reserves,
except reserves for structured settlements not associated with asbestos and
environmental pollution (“A&E”), workers’ compensation


Notes
      to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note

      (Continued)

lifetime
claims, accident and health claims and certain claims associated with
discontinued operations, are not discounted and are based on 1) case basis
estimates for losses reported on direct business, adjusted in the aggregate for
ultimate loss expectations; 2) estimates of incurred but not reported losses; 3)
estimates of losses on assumed reinsurance; 4) estimates of future expenses to
be incurred in the settlement of claims; 5) estimates of salvage and subrogation
recoveries and 6) estimates of amounts due from insureds related to losses under
high deductible policies. Management considers current conditions and trends as
well as past CNA and industry experience in establishing these estimates. The
effects of inflation, which can be significant, are implicitly considered in the
reserving process and are part of the recorded reserve balance. Ceded claim and
claim adjustment expense reserves are reported as a component of Receivables in
the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 23 for further information on claim
and claim adjustment expense reserves for discontinued operations.

Claim and
claim adjustment expense reserves are presented net of anticipated amounts due
from insureds related to losses under high deductible policies of $2.2 billion
and $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. A significant portion of
these amounts is supported by collateral. CNA also has an allowance for
uncollectible deductible amounts, which is presented as a component of the
allowance for doubtful accounts included in Receivables on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. See Note 7.

Structured
settlements have been negotiated for certain property and casualty insurance
claims. Structured settlements are agreements to provide fixed periodic payments
to claimants. Certain structured settlements are funded by annuities purchased
from Continental Assurance Company (“CAC”) for which the related annuity
obligations are reported in future policy benefits reserves. Obligations for
structured settlements not funded by annuities are included in claim and claim
adjustment expense reserves and carried at present values determined using
interest rates ranging from 4.6% to 7.5% at December 31, 2007 and 2006. At
December 31, 2007 and 2006, the discounted reserves for unfunded structured
settlements were $786 million and $814 million, net of discount of $1.2 billion
and $1.3 billion.

Workers’
compensation lifetime claim reserves are calculated using mortality assumptions
determined through statutory regulation and economic factors. Accident and
health claim reserves are calculated using mortality and morbidity assumptions
based on CNA and industry experience. Workers’ compensation lifetime claim
reserves and accident and health claim reserves are discounted at interest rates
that range from 3.0% to 6.5% at December 31, 2007 and 2006. At December 31, 2007
and 2006, such discounted reserves totaled $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion, net of
discount of $438 million and $416 million.

Future
policy benefits reserves – Reserves for long term care products are computed
using the net level premium method, which incorporates actuarial assumptions as
to interest rates, mortality, morbidity, persistency, withdrawals and expenses.
Actuarial assumptions generally vary by plan, age at issue and policy duration,
and include a margin for adverse deviation. Interest rates range from 6.0% to
8.6% at December 31, 2007 and 2006, and mortality, morbidity and withdrawal
assumptions are based on CNA and industry experience prevailing at the time of
issue. Expense assumptions include the estimated effects of inflation and
expenses to be incurred beyond the premium paying period.

Policyholders’
funds reserves – Policyholders’ funds reserves primarily include reserves for
investment contracts without life contingencies. For these contracts,
policyholder liabilities are equal to the accumulated policy account values,
which consist of an accumulation of deposit payments plus credited interest,
less withdrawals and amounts assessed through the end of the
period.

Guaranty
fund and other insurance-related assessments – Liabilities for guaranty fund and
other insurance-related assessments are accrued when an assessment is probable,
when it can be reasonably estimated, and when the event obligating the entity to
pay an imposed or probable assessment has occurred. Liabilities for guaranty
funds and other insurance-related assessments are not discounted and are
included as part of Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of
December 31, 2007 and 2006, the liability balances were $178 million and $189
million. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, included in Other assets were $6
million and $7 million of related assets for premium tax offsets. The related
asset is limited to the amount that is able to be assessed on future premium
collections from business written or committed to be written.


Notes
      to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
      1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies –
      (Continued)

Reinsurance
– Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with
claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves
and are reported as Receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The cost of
reinsurance is primarily accounted for over the life of the underlying reinsured
policies

using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the
underlying policies or over the reinsurance contract period. The ceding of
insurance does not discharge the primary liability of CNA. An estimated
allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations
of balances due from reinsurers, reinsurer solvency, management’s experience and
current economic conditions. The expenses incurred related to uncollectible
reinsurance receivables are presented as a component of Insurance claims and
policyholders’ benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Reinsurance
contracts that do not effectively transfer the underlying economic risk of loss
on policies written by CNA are recorded using the deposit method of accounting,
which requires that premium paid or received by the ceding company or assuming
company be accounted for as a deposit asset or liability. At December 31, 2007,
CNA had $40 million recorded as deposit assets and $117 million recorded as
deposit liabilities.

Income on
reinsurance contracts accounted for under the deposit method is recognized using
an effective yield based on the anticipated timing of payments and the remaining
life of the contract. When the estimate of timing of payments changes, the
effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments to date and the
estimated timing of future payments. The deposit asset or liability is adjusted
to the amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been applied
since the inception of the contract. This adjustment is reflected in other
revenue or other operating expense as appropriate.

Participating
insurance – Policyholder dividends are accrued using an estimate of the amount
to be paid based on underlying contractual obligations under policies and
applicable state laws. When limitations exist on the amount of net income from
participating life insurance contracts that may be distributed to shareholders,
the share of net income on those policies that cannot be distributed to
shareholders is excluded from Shareholders’ equity by a charge to operations and
the establishment of a corresponding liability.

Deferred
acquisition costs – Acquisition costs include commissions, premium taxes and
certain underwriting and policy issuance costs which vary with and are related
primarily to the acquisition of business. Such costs related to property and
casualty business are deferred and amortized ratably over the period the related
premiums are earned.

Deferred
acquisition costs related to accident and health insurance are amortized over
the premium-paying period of the related policies using assumptions consistent
with those used for computing future policy benefits reserves for such
contracts. Assumptions as to anticipated premiums are made at the date of policy
issuance or acquisition and are consistently applied during the lives of the
contracts. Deviations from estimated experience are included in results of
operations when they occur. For these contracts, the amortization period is
typically the estimated life of the policy.

CNA
evaluates deferred acquisition costs for recoverability. Adjustments, if
necessary, are recorded in current results of operations. Anticipated investment
income is considered in the determination of the recoverability of deferred
acquisition costs. Deferred acquisition costs are recorded net of ceding
commissions and other ceded acquisition costs. Unamortized deferred acquisition
costs relating to contracts that have been substantially changed by a
modification in benefits, features, rights or coverages are no longer deferred
and are included as a charge to operations in the period during which the
contract modification occurred.

Separate
Account Business –  Separate account assets and liabilities represent
contract holder funds related to investment and annuity products, which are
segregated into accounts with specific underlying investment objectives. The
assets and liabilities of these contracts are legally segregated and reported as
assets and liabilities of the separate account business. Substantially all
assets of the separate account business are carried at fair value. Separate
account liabilities are primarily carried at contract values. Fee income
accruing to CNA related to separate accounts is primarily included within Other
revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Tobacco
product inventories – These inventories, aggregating $224 million and $183
million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, are stated at the lower of
cost or market, using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method and primarily consist
of leaf tobacco and are included in other assets. If the average cost method of
accounting had been


Notes
      to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
      1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies –
      (Continued)

used for tobacco inventories
instead of the LIFO method, such inventories would have been $151 million and
$156 million higher at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Goodwill
and other intangible assets – Goodwill and other intangible assets with
indefinite lives are annually tested for impairment. Goodwill represents the
excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets of acquired entities.
Impairment losses, if any, are included in the Consolidated Statements of
Income.

Property,
plant and equipment – Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed principally by the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the various classes of
properties. Leaseholds and leasehold improvements are depreciated or amortized
over the terms of the related leases (including optional renewal periods where
appropriate) or the estimated lives of improvements, if less than the lease
term.

The
principal service lives used in computing provisions for depreciation are as
follows:

Years

Buildings
      and building equipment

      to 40

Leaseholds
      and leasehold improvements

      to 20

HighMount
follows the full cost method of accounting for natural gas and NGL exploration
and production activities prescribed by the SEC. Under the full cost method, all
direct costs of property acquisition, exploration and development activities are
capitalized. These capitalized costs are subject to a quarterly ceiling test.
Under the ceiling test, amounts capitalized are limited to the present value of
estimated future net revenues to be derived from the anticipated production of
proved natural gas and NGL reserves, assuming period-end pricing adjusted for
cash flow hedges in place. If net capitalized costs exceed the ceiling test at
the end of any quarterly period, then a permanent write-down of the assets must
be recognized in that period. A write-down may not be reversed in future
periods, even though higher natural gas and NGL prices may subsequently increase
the ceiling. Approximately 2.7% (unaudited) of HighMount’s total proved reserves
is hedged by qualifying cash flow hedges, for which hedge adjusted prices were
used to calculate estimated future net revenue. Whether period-end market prices
or hedge adjusted prices were used for the portion of production that is hedged,
there was no ceiling test impairment as of December 31, 2007. Future cash flows
associated with settling asset retirement obligations that have been accrued in
the Consolidated Balance Sheets pursuant to SFAS No. 143,

“

Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations,” are excluded from HighMount’s calculations of
discounted cash flows under the full cost ceiling test.

Depletion
of natural gas and NGL producing properties is computed using the
units-of-production method. Under the full cost method, the depletable base of
costs subject to depletion also includes estimated future costs to be incurred
in developing proved natural gas and NGL reserves, as well as capitalized asset
retirement costs, net of projected salvage values. The costs of investments in
unproved properties including associated exploration-related costs are initially
excluded from the depletable base. Until the properties are evaluated, a ratable
portion of the capitalized costs is periodically reclassified to the depletable
base, determined on a property by property basis, over terms of underlying
leases. Once a property has been evaluated, any remaining capitalized costs are
then transferred to the depletable base. In addition, gains or losses on the
sale or other disposition of natural gas and NGL properties are not recognized,
unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between
capitalized costs and proved reserves.

Impairment
of long-lived assets – The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment
when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
not be recoverable. Long-lived assets and intangibles with finite lives, under
certain circumstances, are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair
value. Assets to be disposed of and assets not expected to provide any future
service potential to the Company are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or
fair value less cost to sell.


Notes
      to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
      1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies –
      (Continued)

Pension
and postretirement benefits – The Company recognizes the overfunded or
underfunded status of its defined benefit plans as an asset or liability in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognizes changes in that

funded
status in the year in which the changes occur through Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss). The Company measures its benefit plan assets and
obligations at December 31 in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets.

Foreign
currency – Foreign currency translation gains and losses are reflected in
Shareholders’ equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss). The Company’s foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheet accounts are
translated at the exchange rates in effect at each year end and income statement
accounts are translated at the average exchange rates. Foreign currency
transaction losses of $6 million, $4 million and $15 million (after tax and
minority interest) were included in determining net income for the years ended
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

Stock
option plans – In December of 2004, the FASB issued a complete replacement of
SFAS No. 123, “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS No. 123R”), which covers a wide range
of share-based compensation arrangements, including share options, restricted
share plans, performance-based awards, share appreciation rights, and employee
share purchase plans.

Effective
January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified
prospective transition method. The Company applied the transition method in
calculating its pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb future tax
deficiencies as provided by FSP FAS 123(R)-3, “Transition Election Related to
Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards.” The Company
recognized compensation expense that decreased net income attributable to Loews
common stock by $9 million and $7 million, or $0.02 and $0.01 per Loews common
share, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 respectively. Net income
attributable to Carolina Group stock decreased by approximately $800,000 and
$300,000 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, or $0.01
per Carolina Group common share in 2007. There was no impact per Carolina Group
share in 2006. Several of the Company’s subsidiaries also maintain their own
stock option plans. The amounts reported above include the Company’s share of
expense related to its subsidiaries’ plans as well.

Prior to
the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company elected to follow Accounting
Principles Board Opinion (“APB”) No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees” and related interpretations in accounting for its employee stock
options and awards. Under APB No. 25, no compensation expense was recognized
when the exercise prices of options equaled the fair value (market price) of the
underlying stock on the date of grant. These amounts were not included in the
Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income, in accordance with APB No. 25. The
pro forma effect of applying SFAS No. 123 included the Company’s share of
expense related to its subsidiaries’ plans as well. The Company’s pro forma net
income and the related basic and diluted income per Loews common share would
have been as follows:

      1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies –
      (Continued)

Regulatory
accounting – The FERC regulates the operations of Texas Gas. SFAS No. 71,
“Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation,” requires Texas Gas
to report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the
manner in which independent third party regulators establish rates. Accordingly,
certain costs and benefits are capitalized as regulatory assets and liabilities
in order to provide for recovery from or refund to customers in future
periods.

Supplementary
cash flow information – Cash payments made for interest on long term debt, net
of capitalized interest, amounted to approximately $299 million, $352 million
and $405 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. Cash payments for federal, foreign, state and local income taxes
amounted to approximately $1,572 million, $1,160 million and $504 million for
the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Accrued capital
expenditures amounted to approximately $215 million, $30 million and $55 million
for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

New
accounting pronouncements not yet adopted – In September of 2006, the FASB
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 157, “Fair Value
Measurements.” SFAS No. 157 provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to
measure assets and liabilities. The standard also responds to investors’
requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure
assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair
value, and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS No. 157 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. A one year
deferral has been granted for the implementation of SFAS No. 157 for other
nonfinancial assets and liabilities. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 is not
expected to have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations and
equity.

In
February of 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.” SFAS No. 159 provides companies
with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair
value. The objective of SFAS No. 159 is to reduce both complexity in accounting
for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring
related assets and liabilities differently. Generally accepted accounting
principles have required different measurement attributes for different assets
and liabilities that can create artificial volatility in earnings. SFAS No. 159
helps to mitigate volatility by enabling companies to report related assets and
liabilities at fair value, which would likely reduce the need for companies to
comply with detailed rules for hedge accounting. SFAS No. 159 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The adoption of SFAS No. 159 is
not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s results of
operations and equity.

In
December of 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in
Consolidated Financial Statements.” This standard will improve, simplify, and
converge internationally the reporting of noncontrolling interests in
consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 160 requires all entities to report
noncontrolling (minority) interests in subsidiaries in the same way - as equity
in the consolidated financial statements. Moreover, SFAS No. 160 requires that
transactions between an entity and noncontrolling interests be treated as equity
transactions. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2008. As a result, after January 1, 2009, the Company’s deferred
gains related to the issuances of Boardwalk Pipeline common units ($472 million
at December 31, 2007), as discussed in Note 14, will be recognized in the
Shareholders’ equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets as opposed to
the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Reclassifications
– Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to the classifications
followed in 2007.

Realized
investment losses included $741 million, $173 million and $107 million of
other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) losses for the years ended December 31,
2007, 2006 and 2005. The 2007 OTTI losses were recorded primarily in the
asset-backed bonds and corporate and other taxable bonds sectors. The 2006 and
2005 OTTI losses were recorded across various sectors. The increase in OTTI
losses for 2007 was primarily driven by credit issue related OTTI losses on
securities for which the Company did not assert an intent to hold until an
anticipated recovery in value. These OTTI losses were driven mainly by credit
market conditions and the continued disruption caused by issues surrounding the
sub-prime residential mortgage (“sub-prime”) crisis. The increase in OTTI losses
for 2006 was primarily driven by an increase in interest rate related OTTI
losses on securities for which the Company did not assert an intent to hold
until an anticipated recovery in value. The 2005 OTTI losses included $47
million related to loans made under a credit facility to a national contractor,
that were classified as fixed maturity securities. See Note 22 for additional
information on loans to the national contractor.

The
investment policies emphasize high credit quality and diversification by
industry, issuer and issue. Assets supporting interest rate sensitive
liabilities are segmented within the general account to facilitate
asset/liability duration management.

An
investment is impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its cost
adjusted for accretion, amortization, previous OTTI and hedging, otherwise
defined as an unrealized loss. When an investment is impaired, the impairment is
evaluated to determine whether it is temporary or
other-than-temporary.

Significant
judgment is required in the determination of whether an OTTI has occurred for an
investment. CNA follows a consistent and systematic process for determining and
recording an OTTI. CNA has established a committee responsible for the OTTI
process. This committee, referred to as the Impairment Committee, is made up of
three officers appointed by CNA’s Chief Financial Officer. The Impairment
Committee is responsible for analyzing all securities in an unrealized loss
position (“watch list”) on at least a quarterly basis.

All watch
list securities are monitored for further market value changes and additional
information related to the issuer’s financial condition. The focus is on
objective evidence that may influence the evaluation of OTTI
factors.

The
decision to record an OTTI incorporates both quantitative criteria and
qualitative information. The Impairment Committee considers a number of factors
including, but not limited to: (a) the length of time and the extent to which
the fair value has been less than amortized cost, (b) the financial condition
and near term prospects of the issuer, (c) the intent and ability of CNA to
retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an
anticipated recovery in value, (d) whether the debtor is current on interest and
principal payments and (e) general market conditions and industry or sector
specific factors.


Notes
      to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
      2. Investments – (Continued)

The
Committee also considers results and analysis of cash flow modeling to
supplement its review of various asset-backed securities. The focus of this
analysis is on assessing the sufficiency and quality of the underlying
collateral and timing of cash flow based on various scenario tests. This
additional data provides the Committee with additional context to evaluate
current market conditions to determine if the impairment is temporary in
nature.

The
Impairment Committee’s decision to record an OTTI loss is primarily based on
whether the security’s fair value is likely to recover to its amortized cost in
light of all of the factors considered over the expected holding period. For
securities considered to be OTTI, the security is adjusted to fair value and the
resulting losses are recognized in Realized investment gains (losses) in the
Consolidated Statements of Income. Recording an OTTI loss on a security does not
always reflect CNA’s view on whether an equity security will recover to cost or
if a fixed maturity security will make timely repayment of principal and
interest.

At
December 31, 2007, the fair value of the available-for-sale fixed maturities was
$34,081 million, representing 71% of the total investment portfolio. The
unrealized position associated with the available-for-sale fixed maturity
portfolio included $863 million in gross unrealized losses, consisting of
asset-backed securities which represented 47.0%, corporate bonds which
represented 18.7%, redeemable preferred stock which represented 18.5%, and all
other fixed maturity securities which represented 15.8%. The gross unrealized
loss for any single issuer was no greater than 0.2% of the carrying value of the
total fixed maturity portfolio. The total available-for-sale fixed maturity
portfolio gross unrealized losses included 1,380 securities which were, in
aggregate, approximately 6.0% below amortized cost.

The gross
unrealized losses on equity securities were $12 million, including 245
securities which were, in aggregate, approximately 11.0% below
cost.

Given the
current facts and circumstances, the Impairment Committee has determined that
the securities presented in the above unrealized gain/loss tables were
temporarily impaired when evaluated at December 31, 2007 or December 31, 2006,
and therefore no related realized losses were recorded. A discussion of some of
the factors reviewed in making that determination as of December 31, 2007 is
presented below.

Asset-Backed
Securities

The
unrealized losses on the Company’s investments in asset-backed securities were
caused by a combination of factors during 2007 related to the market disruption
caused by credit concerns surrounding the sub-prime issue, but also extended
into other asset-backed securities in the market and specifically in the
Company’s portfolio.

The
majority of the holdings in this category are collateralized mortgage
obligations (“CMOs”) typically collateralized with prime residential mortgages
and corporate asset-backed structured securities. The holdings in these sectors
include 482 securities in a gross unrealized loss position of $402 million. Of
these securities in a gross unrealized loss position, 43.0% are rated AAA, 22.0%
are rated AA, 32.0% are rated A and 3.0% are rated BBB or lower. The aggregate
severity of the unrealized loss was approximately 6.0% of amortized cost. The
contractual cash flows on the asset-backed structured securities are
passed-through but may be structured into classes of preference. The structured
securities held are generally secured by over collateralization or default
protection provided by subordinated tranches. Within this category, securities
subject to Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 99-20, Recognition of
Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests in
Securitized Financial Assets, are monitored for significant adverse changes in
cash flow projections. If there are adverse changes in cash flows, the amount of
accretable yield is prospectively adjusted and an OTTI loss is recognized. As of
December 31, 2007, there was no adverse change in estimated cash flows noted for
the securities in an unrealized loss position held subject to EITF No. 99-20,
which have a gross unrealized loss of $118 million and an aggregate severity of
the unrealized loss of approximately 22.0% of amortized cost. For the year ended
December 31, 2007, there were OTTI losses of $311 million recorded on
asset-backed securities, $209 million of which were related to EITF 99-20
securities.

The
remainder of the holdings in this category includes mortgage-backed securities
guaranteed by an agency of the U.S. Government. There were 235 agency
mortgage-backed pass-through securities and 3 agency CMOs in an unrealized loss
position of $4 million as of December 31, 2007. The aggregate severity of the
unrealized losses on


Notes
      to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
      2. Investments – (Continued)

these
securities was approximately 3.0% of amortized cost. These securities do not
tend to be influenced by the credit of the issuer but rather the characteristics
and projected cash flows of the underlying collateral.

The
Company believes the decline in fair value was primarily attributable to the
market disruption caused by sub-prime related issues and other temporary market
conditions. Because the Company has the ability and intent to hold these
investments until an anticipated recovery of fair value, which may be maturity,
the Company considers these investments to be temporarily impaired at December
31, 2007.

States,
Municipalities and Political Subdivisions – Tax-Exempt Securities

The
unrealized losses on the Company’s investments in municipal securities were
caused primarily by changes in credit spreads, and to a lesser extent, changes
in interest rates. The Company invests in tax-exempt municipal securities as an
asset class for economic benefits of the returns on the class compared to like
after tax returns on alternative classes. The holdings in this category include
223 securities in a gross unrealized loss position of $84 million with 100% of
these unrealized losses related to investment grade securities (rated BBB- or
higher) where the cash flows are secured by the credit of the issuer. The
aggregate severity of the unrealized losses were approximately 4.0% of amortized
cost. Because the Company has the ability and intent to hold these investments
until an anticipated recovery of fair value, which may be maturity, the Company
considers these investments to be temporarily impaired at December 31,
2007.

Corporate
Bonds

The
Company’s portfolio management objective for corporate bonds focuses on sector
and issuer exposures and value analysis within sectors. In order to maximize
investment objectives, corporate bonds are analyzed on a risk adjusted basis
compared to other opportunities that are available in the market. Trading
decisions may be made based on an issuer that may be overvalued in the Company’s
portfolio compared to a like issuer that may be undervalued in the market. The
Company also monitors issuer exposure and broader industry sector exposures and
may reduce exposures based on its current view of a specific issuer or
sector.

The
holdings in this category include 312 securities in a gross unrealized loss
position of $161 million. Of the unrealized losses in this category, over 49.0%
relate to securities rated as investment grade. The total holdings in this
category are diversified across 11 industry sectors. The aggregate severity of
the unrealized losses were approximately 5.0% of amortized cost. Within
corporate bonds, the largest industry sectors were financial, consumer cyclical
and communications which as a percentage of total gross unrealized losses were
approximately 30.0%, 22.0% and 15.0% at December 31, 2007. The decline in fair
value was primarily attributable to deterioration in the broader credit markets
that resulted in widening of credit spreads over risk free rates and macro
conditions in certain sectors that the market viewed as out of favor. Because
the decline was not related to specific credit quality issues, and because the
Company has the ability and intent to hold those investments until an
anticipated recovery of fair value, which may be maturity, the Company considers
these investments to be temporarily impaired at December 31, 2007. For the year
ended December 31, 2007, there were OTTI losses of $209 million recorded on
corporate bonds.

Redeemable
Preferred Stock

The
unrealized losses on the Company’s investments in redeemable preferred stock
were caused by similar factors as those that affected the Company’s corporate
bond portfolio. The holdings in this category have been adversely impacted by
significant credit spread widening brought on by a combination of factors in the
capital markets. Many of the securities in this category have fallen out of
favor in the current market conditions. Approximately 58.0% of the gross
unrealized losses in this category come from securities issued by diversified
financial institutions, 31.0% from losses on government agency issued securities
and 4.0% from utilities. The holdings in this category include 41 securities in
a gross unrealized loss position of $160 million. Of these securities in a gross
unrealized loss position, 31.0% are rated AA, 55.0% are rated A, 12.0% are rated
BBB and 2.0% are rated less than BBB. The Company believes the decline in fair
value was primarily due to the market disruption caused by the sub-prime related
issues and other temporary market conditions. Because the Company has the
ability and intent to hold these investments until an anticipated recovery of
fair value, which may be maturity, the Company considers these investments to be
temporarily impaired at December 31, 2007.

maturity securities. As of December 31, 2006, the carrying value of fixed
maturity investments that did not produce income was $10 million. As of December
31, 2007, no investments exceeded 10.0% of shareholders’ equity. As of December
31, 2006, no investments, other than investments in U.S. Treasury and U.S.
Government agency securities, exceeded 10.0% of shareholders’
equity.

Investment
Commitments

The
Company’s investments in limited partnerships contain withdrawal provisions that
typically require advanced written notice of up to 90 days for withdrawals. The
carrying value of these investments, reported as a separate line item in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets, were $2,370 million and $2,161 million as of
December 31, 2007 and 2006.

As of
December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had committed approximately $461 million
and $109 million to future capital calls from various third party limited
partnership investments in exchange for an ownership interest in the related
partnerships.

The
Company invests in multiple bank loan participations as part of its overall
investment strategy and has committed to additional future purchases and sales.
The purchase and sale of these investments are recorded on the date that the
legal agreements are finalized and cash settlement is made. As of December 31,
2007 and 2006, the Company had commitments to purchase $58 million and $64
million and sell $3 million and $24 million of various bank loan participations.
When loan participation purchases are settled and recorded they may contain both
funded and unfunded amounts. An unfunded loan represents an obligation by the
Company to provide additional amounts under the terms of the loan participation.
The funded portions are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, while any
unfunded amounts are not recorded until a draw is made under the loan facility.
As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had obligations on unfunded bank
loan participations in the amount of $23 million and $29 million.

In cases
where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are estimated using
present value or other valuation techniques. These techniques are significantly
affected by management’s assumptions, including discount rates and estimates of
future cash flows. The amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for
fixed maturity securities, equity securities, derivative instruments, short term
investments and collateral on loaned securities and derivatives and certain
other assets and liabilities are at fair value. As such, these financial
instruments are not shown in the table above. See Note 4 for the fair value of
derivative instruments. Since the disclosure excludes certain financial
instruments and non-financial instruments such as real estate, deferred
acquisition costs and insurance reserves, the aggregate fair value amounts
cannot be summed to determine the underlying economic value of the
Company.

The
following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating its
fair value disclosures for financial instruments:

The fair
values of fixed maturity securities, equity securities and other invested assets
were based on quoted market prices, where available. For securities not actively
traded, fair values were estimated using values obtained from independent
pricing services or quoted market prices of comparable instruments rates and
estimates of future cash flows.

Other
investments consist of mortgage loans and notes receivable, policy loans and
various miscellaneous assets. Valuation techniques to determine fair value of
other investments and other separate account assets consisted of discounting
cash flows, obtaining quoted market prices of the investments and comparing the
investments to similar instruments or to the comparable underlying assets of the
investments.


Notes
      to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
      3. Fair Value of Financial Instruments –
  (Continued)

Premium
deposits and annuity contracts were valued based on cash surrender values,
estimated fair values or policyholder liabilities, net of amounts ceded related
to sold businesses.

Fair
value of debt was based on quoted market prices when available. When quoted
market prices were not available, the fair value for debt was based on quoted
market prices of comparable instruments adjusted for differences between the
quoted instruments and the instruments being valued or is estimated using
discounted cash flow analyses, based on current incremental borrowing rates for
similar types of borrowing arrangements.

Note
4.  Derivative Financial Instruments

The
Company invests in certain derivative instruments for a number of purposes,
including: (i) asset and liability management activities, (ii) income
enhancements for its portfolio management strategy, and (iii) benefit from
anticipated future movements in the underlying markets. If such movements do not
occur as anticipated, then significant losses may occur.

Monitoring
procedures include senior management review of daily detailed reports of
existing positions and valuation fluctuations to ensure that open positions are
consistent with the Company’s portfolio strategy.

The
Company does not believe that any of the derivative instruments utilized by it
are unusually complex, nor do these instruments contain embedded leverage
features which would expose the Company to a higher degree of risk.

CNA uses
derivatives in the normal course of business, primarily in an attempt to reduce
its exposure to market risk (principally interest rate risk, equity stock price
risk and foreign currency risk) stemming from various assets and liabilities and
credit risk (the ability of an obligor to make timely payment of principal
and/or interest). CNA’s principal objective under such risk strategies is to
achieve the desired reduction in economic risk, even if the position will not
receive hedge accounting treatment.

CNA’s use
of derivatives is limited by statutes and regulations promulgated by the various
regulatory bodies to which it is subject, and by its own derivative policy. The
derivative policy limits the authorization to initiate derivative transactions
to certain personnel. Derivatives entered into for hedging, regardless of the
choice to designate hedge accounting, shall have a maturity that effectively
correlates to the underlying hedged asset or liability. The policy prohibits the
use of derivatives containing greater than one-to-one leverage with respect to
changes in the underlying price, rate or index. The policy also prohibits the
use of borrowed funds, including funds obtained through securities lending, to
engage in derivative transactions.

Credit
exposure associated with non-performance by the counterparties to derivative
instruments is generally limited to the uncollateralized fair value of the asset
related to the instruments recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The
Company attempts to mitigate the risk of non-performance by monitoring the
creditworthiness of counterparties and diversifying derivatives to multiple
counterparties. The Company generally requires that all over-the-counter
derivative contracts be governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives
Association (“ISDA”) Master Agreement, and exchanges collateral under the terms
of these arrangements with its derivative investment counterparties depending on
the amount of the exposure and the credit rating of the
counterparty.

The
Company has exposure to economic losses due to interest rate risk arising from
changes in the level or volatility of interest rates. The Company attempts to
mitigate its exposure to interest rate risk through portfolio management, which
includes rebalancing its existing portfolios of assets and liabilities, as well
as changing the characteristics of investments to be purchased or sold in the
future. In addition, various derivative financial instruments are used to modify
the interest rate risk exposures of certain assets and liabilities. These
strategies include the use of interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and
floors, options, futures, forwards and commitments to purchase securities. These
instruments are generally used to lock interest rates or market values, to
shorten or lengthen durations of fixed maturity securities or investment
contracts, or to hedge (on an economic basis) interest rate risks associated
with investments and variable rate debt. The Company has used these types of
instruments as designated hedges against specific assets or liabilities on an
infrequent basis.


Notes
      to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
      4. Derivative Financial Instruments –
  (Continued)

The
Company is exposed to equity price risk as a result of its investment in equity
securities and equity derivatives. Equity price risk results from changes in the
level or volatility of equity prices, which affect the value of equity
securities, or instruments that derive their value from such securities. The
Company attempts to mitigate its exposure to such risks by limiting its
investment in any one security or index. The Company may also manage this risk
by utilizing instruments such as options, swaps, futures and collars to protect
appreciation in securities held. CNA uses derivatives in one of its separate
accounts to mitigate equity price risk associated with its indexed group annuity
contracts by purchasing Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (“S&P 500”) futures
contracts in a notional amount equal to the contract holder
liability.

The
Company has exposure to credit risk arising from the uncertainty associated with
a financial instrument obligor’s ability to make timely principal and/or
interest payments. The Company attempts to mitigate this risk by limiting credit
concentrations, practicing diversification, and frequently monitoring the credit
quality of issuers and counterparties. In addition, the Company may utilize
credit derivatives such as credit default swaps to modify the credit risk
inherent in certain investments. Credit default swaps involve a transfer of
credit risk from one party to another in exchange for periodic payments. The
Company infrequently designates these types of instruments as hedges against
specific assets.

Foreign
exchange rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in foreign currency
exchange rates will impact the fair value of financial instruments denominated
in a foreign currency. The Company’s foreign transactions are primarily
denominated in Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, British pounds, Japanese
yen and the European Monetary Unit. The Company typically manages this risk via
asset/liability matching and through the use of foreign currency futures and
forwards. The Company has infrequently designated these types of instruments as
hedges against specific assets or liabilities.

The
contractual or notional amounts for derivatives are used to calculate the
exchange of contractual payments under the agreements and are not representative
of the potential for gain or loss on these instruments. Interest rates, equity
prices, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices affect the fair
value of derivatives. The fair values generally represent the estimated amounts
that the Company would expect to receive or pay upon termination of the
contracts at the reporting date. Dealer quotes are available for substantially
all of the Company’s derivatives. For derivative instruments not actively
traded, fair values are estimated using values obtained from independent pricing
services, costs to settle or quoted market prices of comparable
instruments.

The
Company is required to provide collateral for all exchange-traded futures and
options contracts. These margin requirements are determined by the individual
exchanges based on the fair value of the open positions and are in the custody
of the exchange. Collateral may also be required for over-the-counter contracts
such as interest rate swaps, credit default swaps and currency forwards per the
ISDA agreements in place. The fair value of collateral provided, consisting
primarily of cash, was $84 million at December 31, 2007 and $58 million at
December 31, 2006.

Fair
value hedges

-

The
Company’s hedging activities primarily involve hedging risk exposures to
interest rate and foreign currency risks on various assets and liabilities. The
Company periodically enters into interest rate swaps to modify the interest rate
exposures of designated invested assets. Changes in the fair value of a
derivative that are highly effective and that are designated and qualify as fair
value hedges, along with the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset that
are attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded as Investment gains (losses)
in the Consolidated Statements of Income. For the years ended December 31, 2007
and 2006, there was no gain or loss on the ineffective portion of fair value
hedges because CNA did not designate any derivatives as fair value hedges. For
the year ended December 31, 2005, CNA recognized a net gain of approximately
$300,000, which represents the ineffective portion of all fair value
hedges.

Cash flow
hedges − A significant portion of the Company’s hedge strategies represents cash
flow hedges of the variable price risk associated with the purchase and sale of
natural gas and other energy-related products. The Company and certain of its
subsidiaries also use interest rate swaps and Treasury rate locks to hedge its
exposure to variable interest rates or risk attributable to changes in interest
rates on long term debt. Any ineffectiveness is recorded currently in the
Consolidated Statements of Income. The effective portion of the hedges is
amortized to interest expense over the term of the related notes.

The
Company also enters into short sales as part of its portfolio management
strategy. Short sales are commitments to sell a financial instrument not owned
at the time of sale, usually done in anticipation of a price decline. These
sales resulted in proceeds of $91 million and $54 million with fair value
liabilities of $84 million and

Note
5.  Earnings Per Share

Companies
with complex capital structures are required to present basic and diluted
earnings per share. Basic earnings per share excludes dilution and is computed
by dividing net income attributable to each class of common stock by the
weighted average number of common shares of each class of common stock
outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential
dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock
were exercised or converted into common stock.

Certain
options were not included in the diluted weighted shares amount due to the
exercise price being greater than the average stock price for the respective
periods. The number of weighted average shares not included in the diluted
computations is as follows:

6.  Loews and Carolina Group Consolidating Condensed Financial
Information

The
issuance of Carolina Group stock has resulted in a two class common stock
structure for the Company. Carolina Group stock, commonly called a tracking
stock, is intended to reflect the economic performance of a defined group of
assets and liabilities of the Company referred to as the Carolina Group. The
principal assets and liabilities attributed to the Carolina Group are the
Company’s 100% stock ownership interest in Lorillard, Inc.; notional intergroup
debt owed by the Carolina Group to the Loews Group ($424 million outstanding at
December 31, 2007), bearing interest at the annual rate of 8.0% and, subject to
optional prepayment, due December 31, 2021; and any and all liabilities, costs
and expenses of the Company and Lorillard arising out of or related to tobacco
or tobacco-related businesses.

As of
December 31, 2007, the outstanding Carolina Group stock represents a 62.4%
economic interest in the economic performance of the Carolina Group. The Loews
Group consists of all of the Company’s assets and liabilities other than the
62.4% economic interest represented by the outstanding Carolina Group stock, and
includes as an asset the notional intergroup debt of the Carolina Group. Holders
of the Company’s common stock and of Carolina Group stock are shareholders of
Loews Corporation and are subject to the risks related to an equity investment
in Loews Corporation. Each outstanding share of Carolina Group stock has 3/10 of
a vote per share.

In August
of 2006, May of 2006 and November of 2005, the Company sold an additional 15
million, 15 million and 10 million shares of Carolina Group stock for net
proceeds of $877 million, $752 million and $415 million,
respectively.

The
Company has separated, for financial reporting purposes, the Carolina Group and
Loews Group. The following schedules present the consolidating condensed
financial information for these individual groups. Neither group is a separate
company or legal entity. Rather, each group is intended to reflect a defined set
of assets and liabilities.

Boardwalk
Pipeline Expansion Projects

Boardwalk
Pipeline is engaged in several major expansion projects that will require the
investment of significant capital resources. These projects include a pipeline
expansion (“East Texas to Mississippi”) consisting of approximately 242 miles of
42-inch pipeline from DeSoto Parish in western Louisiana to near Harrisville,
Mississippi and adding approximately 1.7 billion cubic feet (“Bcf”) of new
peak-day transmission capacity to its pipeline system. Boardwalk Pipeline is
pursuing construction of a new interstate pipeline (“Gulf Crossing Project”)
that will begin near Sherman, Texas and proceed to the Perryville, Louisiana
area and will consist of approximately 357 miles of 42-inch pipeline having
approximately up to 1.7 Bcf of peak-day transmission capacity. Boardwalk
Pipeline is planning a pipeline expansion (“Southeast Expansion”) originating
near Harrisville, Mississippi and extending to an interconnect with
Transcontinental Pipe Line Company in Choctaw County, Alabama, which will
consist of approximately 112 miles of 42-inch pipeline having initial capacity
of approximately 1.2 Bcf of peak-day transmission capacity and will be expanded
to 2.2 Bcf of peak-day transmission capacity.

Boardwalk
Pipeline is also pursuing the construction of two laterals connected to its
pipeline system to transport gas from the Fayetteville Shale area in Arkansas to
markets directly and indirectly served by its existing interstate
pipelines.  The Fayetteville Lateral, consisting of approximately 165
miles of 36-inch pipeline, has an initial design capacity of approximately 0.8
Bcf of peak-day transmission capacity. This lateral will originate in Arkansas
and proceed to Mississippi. The Greenville Lateral, consisting of approximately
95 miles of pipeline with an initial design capacity of approximately 0.8 Bcf of
peak-day transmission capacity, will originate near Greenville, Mississippi and
proceed east to the Kosciusko, Mississippi area.

On
December 31, 2007, Boardwalk Pipeline placed in service a portion of its East
Texas to Mississippi expansion project from Keatchie, Louisiana in DeSoto Parish
to its interconnects with Texas Gas near Bosco, Louisiana and Columbia Gulf
Transmission pipeline at Delhi, Louisiana. As a result, approximately $476
million was transferred from Construction in process to Pipeline equipment. The
assets will generally be depreciated over a term of 35 years. The remaining
pipeline to Harrisville, Mississippi was placed in service during January of
2008.


Notes
      to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
      8. Property, Plant and Equipment –
  (Continued)

The total
cost of the pipeline expansion projects discussed above is estimated to be
approximately $4.5 billion. Actual costs may exceed the current estimate due to
a variety of factors, including delays in obtaining regulatory approvals,
adverse weather conditions, delays in obtaining key materials,
and shortages of qualified labor and escalating costs of labor and
materials resulting from the high level of construction activity in the pipeline
industry.

Note
9.  Claim and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves

CNA’s
property and casualty insurance claim and claim adjustment expense reserves
represent the estimated amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims,
including claims that are incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) as of the reporting
date. CNA’s reserve projections are based primarily on detailed analysis of the
facts in each case, CNA’s experience with similar cases and various historical
development patterns. Consideration is given to such historical patterns as
field reserving trends and claims settlement practices, loss payments, pending
levels of unpaid claims and product mix, as well as court decisions, economic
conditions and public attitudes. All of these factors can affect the estimation
of claim and claim adjustment expense reserves.

Establishing
claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, including claim and claim
adjustment expense reserves for catastrophic events that have occurred, is an
estimation process. Many factors can ultimately affect the final settlement of a
claim and, therefore, the necessary reserve. Changes in the law, results of
litigation, medical costs, the cost of repair materials and labor rates can all
affect ultimate claim costs.  In addition, time can be a critical part
of reserving determinations since the longer the span between the incidence of a
loss and the payment or settlement of the claim, the more variable the ultimate
settlement amount can be.  Accordingly, short-tail claims, such as
property damage claims, tend to be more reasonably estimable than long-tail
claims, such as general liability and professional liability
claims.  Adjustments to prior year reserve estimates, if necessary,
are reflected in the results of operations in the period that the need for such
adjustments is determined.

Catastrophes
are an inherent risk of the property and casualty insurance business and have
contributed to material period-to-period fluctuations in the Company’s results
of operations and/or equity. Catastrophe losses, related to events occurring in
2007, 2006, and 2005, net of reinsurance, were $78 million, $59 million and $493
million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.  The
catastrophe losses in 2005 related primarily to Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma, Rita,
Dennis and Ophelia.  There can be no assurance that CNA’s ultimate
cost for catastrophes will not exceed current estimates.

Commercial
catastrophe losses, gross of reinsurance, were $79 million, $59 million and $976
million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and
2005.

The
following provides discussion of CNA’s asbestos and environmental pollution
(“A&E”) and core reserves.

A&E
Reserves

CNA’s
property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have actual and potential exposures
related to A&E claims.

Establishing
reserves for A&E claim and claim adjustment expenses is subject to
uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims. Traditional
actuarial methods and techniques employed to estimate the ultimate cost of
claims for more traditional property and casualty exposures are less precise in
estimating claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for A&E, particularly
in an environment of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise
from industry practices and legal, judicial and social conditions. Therefore,
these traditional actuarial methods and techniques are necessarily supplemented
with additional estimating techniques and methodologies, many of which involve
significant judgments that are required of management. Accordingly, a high
degree of uncertainty remains for CNA’s ultimate liability for A&E claim and
claim adjustment expenses.

In
addition to the difficulties described above, estimating the ultimate cost of
both reported and unreported A&E claims is subject to a higher degree of
variability due to a number of additional factors, including among others: the
number and outcome of direct actions against CNA; coverage issues, including
whether certain costs are covered under the policies and whether policy limits
apply; allocation of liability among numerous parties, some of whom may be in
bankruptcy proceedings, and in particular the application of “joint and several”
liability to specific insurers on a risk; inconsistent court decisions and
developing legal theories; continuing aggressive tactics of

      to Consolidated Financial Statements

      9. Claim and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves –
      (Continued)

plaintiffs’
lawyers; the risks and lack of predictability inherent in major litigation;
enactment of state and federal legislation to address asbestos claims; increases
and decreases in asbestos and environmental pollution claims which cannot now be
anticipated; increases and decreases in costs to defend asbestos and pollution
claims; changing liability theories against CNA’s policyholders in environmental
matters; possible exhaustion of underlying umbrella and excess coverage; and
future developments pertaining to CNA’s ability to recover reinsurance for
asbestos and pollution claims.

CNA has
annually performed ground up reviews of all open A&E claims to evaluate the
adequacy of its A&E reserves. In performing its comprehensive ground up
analysis, CNA considers input from its professionals with direct responsibility
for the claims, inside and outside counsel with responsibility for
representation of CNA and its actuarial staff. These professionals review, among
many factors, the policyholder’s present and predicted future exposures,
including such factors as claims volume, trial conditions, prior settlement
history, settlement demands and defense costs; the impact of asbestos defendant
bankruptcies on the policyholder; the policies issued by CNA, including such
factors as aggregate or per occurrence limits, whether the policy is primary,
umbrella or excess, and the existence of policyholder retentions and/or
deductibles; the existence of other insurance; and reinsurance
arrangements.

The
following table provides data related to CNA’s A&E claim and claim
adjustment expense reserves.

Asbestos

CNA’s
property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have exposure to asbestos-related
claims. Estimation of asbestos-related claim and claim adjustment expense
reserves involves limitations such as inconsistency of court decisions, specific
policy provisions, allocation of liability among insurers and insureds, and
additional factors such as missing policies and proof of coverage. Furthermore,
estimation of asbestos-related claims is difficult due to, among other reasons,
the proliferation of bankruptcy proceedings and attendant uncertainties, the
targeting of a broader range of businesses and entities as defendants, the
uncertainty as to which other insureds may be targeted in the future and the
uncertainties inherent in predicting the number of future claims.

As of
December 31, 2007 and 2006, CNA carried $1,322 million and $1,452 million of
claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, net of reinsurance recoverables,
for reported and unreported asbestos-related claims. For the years ended
December 31, 2007 and 2005, CNA recorded $6 million and $10 million of
unfavorable asbestos-related net claim and claim adjustment expense reserve
development. CNA recorded no asbestos-related net claim and claim adjustment
expense reserve development for the year ended December 31, 2006.  CNA
paid asbestos-related claims, net of reinsurance recoveries, of $136 million,
$102 million and $142 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and
2005. On February 2, 2007, CNA paid $31 million to the Owens Corning Fibreboard
Trust. Such payment was made pursuant to CNA’s 1993 settlement with
Fibreboard.

Certain
asbestos claim litigation in which CNA is currently engaged is described
below:

The
ultimate cost of reported claims, and in particular A&E claims, is subject
to a great many uncertainties, including future developments of various kinds
that CNA does not control and that are difficult or impossible to foresee
accurately. With respect to the litigation identified below in particular,
numerous factual and legal issues remain unresolved. Rulings on those issues by
the courts are critical to the evaluation of the ultimate cost to CNA. The
outcome of the litigation cannot be predicted with any reliability. Accordingly,
the extent of losses beyond any amounts that may be accrued are not readily
determinable at this time.


Notes
      to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
      9. Claim and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves –
      (Continued)

On
February 13, 2003, CNA announced it had resolved asbestos-related coverage
litigation and claims involving A.P. Green Industries, A.P. Green Services and
Bigelow – Liptak Corporation. Under the agreement, CNA is required to pay $70
million, net of reinsurance recoveries, over a ten year period commencing after
the final approval of a bankruptcy plan of reorganization. The settlement
resolves CNA’s liabilities for all pending and future asbestos and silica claims
involving A.P. Green Industries, Bigelow – Liptak Corporation and related
subsidiaries, including alleged “non-products” exposures. The settlement
received initial bankruptcy court approval on August 18, 2003. The debtor’s plan
of reorganization includes an injunction to protect CNA from any future claims.
The bankruptcy court issued an opinion on September 24, 2007 recommending
confirmation of that plan; the district court affirmed that ruling on December
18, 2007. Other insurer parties to the litigation have indicated their intent to
appeal that ruling to the Court of Appeals.

CNA is
engaged in insurance coverage litigation in New York State Court, filed in 2003,
with a defendant class of underlying plaintiffs who have asbestos bodily injury
claims against the former Robert A. Keasbey Company (“Keasbey”)

(Continental Casualty Co. v.
Employers Ins. of Wausau et al.

, No. 601037/03 (N.Y. County)). Keasbey, a
currently dissolved corporation, was a seller and installer of
asbestos-containing insulation products in New York and New Jersey. Thousands of
plaintiffs have filed bodily injury claims against Keasbey. However, under New
York court rules, asbestos claims are not cognizable unless they meet certain
minimum medical impairment standards. Since 2002, when these court rules were
adopted, only a small portion of such claims have met medical impairment
criteria under New York court rules and as to the remaining claims, Keasbey’s
involvement at a number of work sites is a highly contested issue.

CNA
issued Keasbey primary policies for 1970-1987 and excess policies for 1972-1978.
CNA has paid an amount substantially equal to the policies’ aggregate limits for
products and completed operations claims in the confirmed CNA policies.
Claimants against Keasbey allege, among other things, that CNA owes coverage
under sections of the policies not subject to the aggregate limits, an
allegation CNA vigorously contests in the lawsuit. In the litigation, CNA and
the claimants seek declaratory relief as to the interpretation of various policy
provisions. On May 8, 2007, the Court in the first phase of the trial held that
all of CNA’s primary policy products aggregates were exhausted and that past
products liability claims could not be recharacterized as operations claims. The
Court also found that while operations claims would not be subject to products
aggregates, such claims could be made only against the policies in effect when
the claimants were exposed to asbestos from Keasbey operations. These holdings
limit CNA’s exposure to those instances where Keasbey used asbestos in
operations between 1970 and 1987. Keasbey largely ceased using asbestos in its
operations in the early 1970’s. CNA noticed an appeal to the Appellate Division
to challenge certain aspects of the Court’s ruling. Other insurer parties to the
litigation also filed separate notices of appeal to the Court’s ruling. The
appeal was fully briefed and was argued on December 6, 2007. Numerous legal
issues remain to be resolved on appeal with respect to coverage that are
critical to the final result, which cannot be predicted with any reliability.
Accordingly, the extent of losses beyond any amounts that may be accrued are not
readily determinable at this time.

CNA has
insurance coverage disputes related to asbestos bodily injury claims against a
bankrupt insured, Burns & Roe Enterprises, Inc. (“Burns & Roe”). These
disputes are currently part of coverage litigation (stayed in view of the
bankruptcy) and an adversary proceeding in

In re: Burns & Roe Enterprises,
Inc

., pending in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of New
Jersey, No. 00-41610. Burns & Roe provided engineering and related services
in connection with construction projects. At the time of its bankruptcy filing,
on December 4, 2000, Burns & Roe asserted that it faced approximately 11,000
claims alleging bodily injury resulting from exposure to asbestos as a result of
construction projects in which Burns & Roe was involved. CNA allegedly
provided primary liability coverage to Burns & Roe from 1956-1969 and
1971-1974, along with certain project-specific policies from 1964-1970. On
December 5, 2005, Burns & Roe filed its Third Amended Plan of Reorganization
(“Plan”). In September of 2007, CNA entered into an agreement with Burns &
Roe, the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors appointed by the Bankruptcy
Court and the Future Claims Representative (the “Addendum”), which provides that
claims allegedly covered by CNA policies will be adjudicated in the tort system,
with any coverage disputes related to those claims to be decided in coverage
litigation. On September 14, 2007, Burns & Roe moved the bankruptcy court
for approval of the Addendum pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 9019. After several
extensions, the hearing on that motion is currently set for February 27, 2008.
If approved, Burns & Roe has agreed to include the Addendum in the proposed
plan, which will be the subject of a later confirmation hearing. With respect to
both confirmation of the Plan and coverage issues, numerous factual and legal
issues remain to be resolved that are critical to the final result, the outcome
of which cannot be predicted with any reliability. These factors include, among
others: (a) whether

CNA has
any further responsibility to compensate claimants against Burns & Roe under
its policies and, if so, under which; (b) whether CNA’s responsibilities under
its policies extend to a particular claimant’s entire claim or only to a limited
percentage of the claim; (c) whether CNA’s responsibilities under its policies
are limited by the occurrence limits or other provisions of the policies; (d)
whether certain exclusions, including professional liability exclusions, in some
of CNA’s policies apply to exclude certain claims; (e) the extent to which
claimants can establish exposure to asbestos materials as to which Burns &
Roe has any responsibility; (f) the legal theories which must be pursued by such
claimants to establish the liability of Burns & Roe and whether such
theories can, in fact, be established; (g) the diseases and damages alleged by
such claimants; (h) the extent that any liability of Burns & Roe would be
shared with other potentially responsible parties; and (i) the impact of
bankruptcy proceedings on claims and coverage issue resolution. Accordingly, the
extent of losses beyond any amounts that may be accrued are not readily
determinable at this time.

Suits
have also been initiated directly against the CNA companies and numerous other
insurers in two jurisdictions: Texas and Montana. Approximately 80 lawsuits
were filed in Texas beginning in 2002, against two CNA companies and numerous
other insurers and non-insurer corporate defendants asserting liability for
failing to warn of the dangers of asbestos (e.g.

Boson v. Union Carbide
Corp.,

(Nueces County,
Texas)). During 2003, several of the Texas suits were dismissed as
time-barred by the applicable Statute of Limitations. In other suits, the
carriers argued that they did not owe any duty to the plaintiffs or the general
public to advise the world generally or the plaintiffs particularly of the
effects of asbestos and that Texas statutes precluded liability for such claims,
and two Texas courts dismissed these suits. Certain of the Texas courts’
rulings were appealed, but plaintiffs later dismissed their appeals. A
different Texas court denied similar motions seeking dismissal at the pleading
stage, allowing limited discovery to proceed. After that court denied a
related challenge to jurisdiction, the insurers transferred those cases, among
others, to a state multi-district litigation court in Harris County charged with
handling asbestos cases, and the cases remain in that court. In February
2006, the insurers petitioned the appellate court in Houston for an order of
mandamus, requiring the multi-district litigation court to dismiss the cases on
jurisdictional and substantive grounds. The Texas Attorney General filed an
amicus curiae brief supporting the insurers’ position. After a long period of no
activity, the court asked the plaintiffs to file a response to the petition for
mandamus. Based on a letter from the appellate court, the insurers gave the
multi-district litigation court an opportunity to reconsider the original
court’s action, but the court declined to do so, and the case has now been fully
briefed and is back in front of the appellate court on the insurers’ mandamus
petition. With respect to this litigation in particular, numerous factual and
legal issues remain to be resolved that are critical to the final result, the
outcome of which cannot be predicted with any reliability. These factors
include: (a) the speculative nature and unclear scope of any alleged duties
owed to individuals exposed to asbestos and the resulting uncertainty as to the
potential pool of potential claimants; (b) the fact that imposing such
duties on all insurer and non-insurer corporate defendants would be
unprecedented and, therefore, the legal boundaries of recovery are difficult to
estimate; (c) the fact that many of the claims brought to date are barred by the
Statute of Limitations and it is unclear whether future claims would also be
barred; (d) the unclear nature of the required nexus between the acts of the
defendants and the right of any particular claimant to recovery; and (e) the
existence of hundreds of co-defendants in some of the suits and the
applicability of the legal theories pled by the claimants to thousands of
potential defendants. Accordingly, the extent of losses beyond any amounts that
may be accrued is not readily determinable at this time.

On March
22, 2002, a direct action was filed in Montana (

Pennock, et al. v. Maryland
Casualty, et al.

First Judicial District Court of Lewis & Clark
County, Montana) by eight individual plaintiffs (all employees of W.R. Grace
& Co. (“W.R. Grace”)) and their spouses against CNA, Maryland Casualty and
the State of Montana. This action alleges that the carriers failed to warn of or
otherwise protect W.R. Grace employees from the dangers of asbestos at a W.R.
Grace vermiculite mining facility in Libby, Montana. The Montana direct action
is currently stayed because of W.R. Grace’s pending bankruptcy. With respect to
such claims, numerous factual and legal issues remain to be resolved that are
critical to the final result, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with any
reliability. These factors include:  (a) the unclear nature and scope
of any alleged duties owed to people exposed to asbestos and the resulting
uncertainty as to the potential pool of potential claimants; (b) the potential
application of Statutes of Limitation to many of the claims which may be made
depending on the nature and scope of the alleged duties; (c) the unclear nature
of the required nexus between the acts of the defendants and the right of any
particular claimant to recovery; (d) the diseases and damages claimed by such
claimants; (e) the extent that such liability would be shared with other
potentially responsible parties; and (f) the impact of bankruptcy proceedings on
claims resolution. Accordingly, the extent of losses beyond any amounts that may
be accrued are not readily determinable at this time.

CNA is
vigorously defending these and other cases and believes that it has meritorious
defenses to the claims asserted. However, there are numerous factual and legal
issues to be resolved in connection with these claims, and it is extremely
difficult to predict the outcome or ultimate financial exposure represented by
these matters. Adverse developments with respect to any of these matters could
have a material adverse effect on CNA’s business and insurer financial strength
and debt ratings and the Company’s results of operations and/or
equity.

Environmental
Pollution

As of
December 31, 2007 and 2006, CNA carried $242 million and $285 million of claim
and claim adjustment expense reserves, net of reinsurance recoverables, for
reported and unreported environmental claims. There was $1 million of
unfavorable environmental pollution net claim and claim adjustment expense
reserve development recorded for the year ended December 31, 2007. There was no
unfavorable environmental pollution net claim and claim adjustment expense
reserve development recorded for the year ended December 31, 2006. CNA noted
adverse development in various pollution accounts in its 2005 ground up review.
In the course of its review, CNA did not observe a negative trend or
deterioration in the underlying pollution claims environment. Rather, individual
account estimates changed due to changes in liability and/or coverage
circumstances particular to those accounts. As a result, CNA increased pollution
reserves for prior accident years by $50 million in 2005. CNA paid environmental
pollution-related claims, net of reinsurance recoveries, of $44 million, $51
million and $56 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and
2005.

Net
Prior Year Claim and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserve Development

The
following tables and discussion include the net prior year development recorded
for the Standard Lines, Specialty Lines and Other Insurance segments for the
years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Unfavorable net prior year
development of $147 million was recorded in the Life & Group Non-Core
segment for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily related to the
settlement of the IGI contingency. The IGI contingency related to reinsurance
arrangements with respect to personal accident insurance coverages provided
between 1997 and 1999 which were the subject of arbitration proceedings. CNA
reached agreement in 2007 to settle the arbitration matter for a one-time
payment of $250 million, which resulted in an incurred loss, net of reinsurance,
of $167 million pretax. Unfavorable net prior year development of $13 million
and favorable net prior year development of $5 million was recorded in the Life
& Group Non-Core segment for the years ended December 31, 2006 and
2005.

The
development discussed below includes premium development due to its direct
relationship to claim and claim adjustment expense reserve development. The
development discussed below excludes the impact of the provision for
uncollectible reinsurance, but includes the impact of commutations. See Note 19
for further discussion of the provision for uncollectible
reinsurance.

In 2005,
CNA recorded favorable or unfavorable premium and claim and claim adjustment
expense reserve development related to the corporate aggregate reinsurance
treaties as movements in the claim and allocated claim adjustment expense
reserves for the accident years covered by the corporate aggregate reinsurance
treaties indicated such development was required. While the available limit of
these treaties was fully utilized in 2003, the ceded premiums and losses for an
individual segment changed in subsequent years because of the re-estimation of
the subject losses or commutations of the underlying contracts. In 2005, CNA
commuted a significant corporate aggregate reinsurance treaty and in 2006, CNA
commuted its remaining corporate aggregate reinsurance treaty. See Note 19 for
further discussion of the corporate aggregate reinsurance
treaties.

Net Prior Year Development

Standard
Lines

Approximately
$184 million of favorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
development was due to decreased frequency and severity on claims within the
general liability exposures in accident years 2005 and prior, as well as lower
frequency in accident years 1997 and prior, related to construction defect.
There was approximately $17 million of favorable premium development resulting
from audits on recent policies.

Approximately
$140 million of favorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
development was due to decreased frequency and severity on claims related to
property exposures, primarily in accident years 2005 and 2006. Included in this
favorable development is approximately $39 million related to the 2005
hurricanes.

Approximately
$16 million of favorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
development was recorded in marine exposures, due primarily to decreased
frequency in accident year 2006, and decreased severity in accident years 2005
and prior.

Approximately
$16 million of unfavorable premium development was recorded related to CNA’s
participation in involuntary pools. This unfavorable premium development was
partially offset by $9 million of favorable claim and allocated claim adjustment
expense reserve development.

Approximately
$257 million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
development was recorded due to increased severity in workers’ compensation
exposures, primarily on large claims in accident years 2003 and prior, as a
result of continued claim cost inflation in older accident years, driven by
increasing medical inflation and advances in medical care. This was partially
offset by $12 million of favorable premium development.

Specialty
Lines

Approximately
$39 million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
development was recorded for large law firm exposures. The change was due to
increased severity estimates on large claims in accident years 2005 and prior.
The increase in severity was due to a comprehensive case by case claim review
for large law firm exposures, causing an overall increase in estimated ultimate
loss.

Approximately
$59 million of favorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
development was recorded in CNA’s foreign operations. This favorable development
was recorded primarily due to decreased severity and frequency in accident years
2003 through 2006.

Approximately
$37 million of favorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
development was recorded on claims for healthcare facilities across several
accident years. This was primarily due to decreased severity on claims within
the general liability exposures and decreased incurred losses as a result of
changes in individual claims reserve estimates.

Approximately
$67 million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
development was recorded on claims for architects and engineers. This
unfavorable development was primarily due to large loss emergence in accident
years 1999 through 2004.

Approximately
$16 million of favorable claim and claim adjustment expense reserve development
was recorded due primarily to better than expected loss experience in the
vehicle warranty coverages in accident year 2006. The reserves for this business
were initially estimated based on the loss ratio expected for the
business.  Subsequent estimates rely more heavily on the actual case
incurred losses, which have been significantly lower than expected.

Approximately
$24 million of favorable claim and claim adjustment expense reserve development
was related to surety business resulting from better than expected salvage and
subrogation recoveries from older accident years and a lack of emergence of
large claims in more recent accident years.

Approximately
$9 million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
development was related to commutation activity, a portion of which was offset
by a release of a previously established allowance for uncollectible
reinsurance.

Approximately
$70 million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
development was recorded due to higher than anticipated litigation costs related
to miscellaneous chemical exposures, primarily in accident years 1997 and
prior.

Net Prior Year Development

Standard
Lines

Approximately
$119 million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
development was due to commutation activity that took place in the fourth
quarter of 2006. Approximately $102 million of unfavorable claim and allocated
claim adjustment expense reserve development was related to casualty lines of
business, primarily workers’ compensation, due to continued claim cost inflation
in older accident years, primarily 2002 and prior. The primary drivers of the
continuing claim cost inflation were medical inflation and advances in medical
care.

Favorable
claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development of
approximately $88 million was recorded in relation to the short-tail coverages
such as property and marine, primarily in accident years 2004 and 2005. The
favorable results were primarily due to the underwriting actions taken by CNA
that significantly improved the results on this business and favorable outcomes
on individual claims.

The
majority of the favorable premium development was due to additional premium
primarily resulting from audits and changes to premium on several ceded
reinsurance agreements. Business impacted included various middle market
liability coverages, workers’ compensation, property, and large accounts. This
favorable premium development was partially offset by approximately $44 million
of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development
recorded as a result of this favorable premium development.

Specialty
Lines

Approximately
$55 million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
development was recorded due to increased claim adjustment expenses and
increased severities in the architects and engineers book of business in
accident years 2003 and prior. Previous reviews assumed that incurred
severities had increased, at least in part, due to increases in the adequacy of
case reserve estimates with relatively minor changes in underlying severity.
Subsequent changes in paid and case incurred losses have shown that more of the
change was due to underlying increases in verdict and settlement size for these
accident years rather than increases in case reserve adequacy, resulting in
higher ultimate losses. One of the primary drivers of these larger verdicts and
settlements is the continuing general increase in commercial and private real
estate values.

Approximately
$60 million of favorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
development was due to improved claim severity and claim frequency in the
healthcare professional liability business, primarily in dental, nursing home
liability, physicians and other healthcare facilities. The improved severity and
frequency were due to underwriting changes. CNA no longer writes large national
nursing home chains and focuses on smaller insureds in selected areas of the
country. These changes have resulted in business that experiences fewer large
claims.

Approximately
$15 million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
development was primarily related to increased severity on individual large
claims from large law firm errors and omissions (“E&O”) and directors and
officers (“D&O”) coverages. These increases result in higher ultimate loss
projections from the average loss methods used by CNA’s
actuaries.

Note
      9. Claim and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves –
      (Continued)

Approximately
$17 million of favorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
development was recorded in the warranty line of business for accident years
2004 and 2005. The reserves for this business were initially estimated based on
the loss ratio expected for the business. Subsequent estimates rely more heavily
on the actual case incurred losses due to the short-tail nature of this
business. The short-tail nature of the business is due to the short period of
time that passes between the time the business is written and the time when all
claims are known and settled. Case incurred loss for the most recent accident
year has been lower than indicated by the initial loss ratio.

Approximately
$43 million of favorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
development was related to favorable loss trends on accidents years 2002 through
2005 in CNA’s foreign operations, primarily Europe and Canada, in the marine,
casualty, and property coverages.

Approximately
$30 million of favorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
development was related to lower severities on the excess and surplus lines
business in accident years 2000 and subsequent. These severity changes were
driven primarily by favorable judicial decisions and settlement activities on
individual cases.

Other
Insurance

The
majority of the unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
development was primarily related to CNA’s exposure arising from claims
typically involving allegations by multiple plaintiffs alleging injury resulting
from exposure to or use of similar substances or products over multiple policy
periods. Examples include, but are not limited to, lead paint claims, hardboard
siding, polybutylene pipe, mold, silica, latex gloves, benzene products, welding
rods, diet drugs, breast implants, medical devices, and various other toxic
chemical exposures. During CNA’s 2006 ground up review, CNA noted adverse
development in various accounts. The adverse development resulted primarily from
increases related to defense costs in a small number of accounts arising out of
various substances and products.

Net Prior Year Development

Standard
Lines

During
the fourth quarter of 2005, CNA executed commutation agreements with certain
reinsurers, including the commutation of a corporate aggregate reinsurance
agreement. These agreements resulted in approximately $255 million of
unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development.
This unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
development was partially offset by a release of a previously established
allowance for uncollectible reinsurance.

Also, in
the fourth quarter of 2005, reserve reviews of certain products were conducted
and changes in reserve estimates were recorded. Approximately $102 million of
unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development was
due to higher frequency and severity on claims related to excess workers’
compensation, particularly in accident years 2003 and prior. The primary drivers
of the higher frequency and severity were increasing medical inflation and
advances in medical care. Medical inflation increases the cost of claims
resulting in more claims reaching the excess layers covered by CNA. Medical
inflation also increases the size of claims in CNA’s layers. Similarly, advances
in medical care extend the life expectancies of claimants again resulting in
additional costs to be covered by CNA as well as more claims reaching the excess
layers covered by CNA.

In
addition, approximately $4 million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim
adjustment expense reserve development was recorded due to increased severity on
known claims on package policies provided to small businesses in accident years
2002 and 2003. Approximately $4 million of favorable net prior year claim and
allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development was due to less than
expected losses in the involuntary business.

Approximately
$140 million of favorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment
expense reserve development was recorded due to improvement in the severity and
number of claims for property coverages and marine business, primarily in
accident year 2004. The improvements in severity and frequency were
substantially due to underwriting actions taken by CNA that significantly
improved the results on this business.

Note
      9. Claim and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves –
      (Continued)

Approximately
$126 million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment
expense reserve development resulted from increased severity trends for workers’
compensation, primarily in accident years 2002 and prior. The primary drivers of
the higher severity trends were increasing medical inflation and advances in
medical care.  Medical inflation increases the cost of medical
services, and advances in medical care extend the life expectancies of claimants
resulting in additional costs to be covered by CNA.

Approximately
$15 million of unfavorable premium development was recorded in relation to this
unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
development which resulted from additional ceded reinsurance premium on
agreements where the ceded premium is impacted by the level of ceded
losses.

Approximately
$76 million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment
expense reserve development was attributed to increased severity in liability
coverages for large account policies. These increases were driven by increasing
medical inflation and larger verdicts than anticipated, both of which increased
the severity of these claims.

The
remainder of the favorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment
expense reserve development was primarily a result of improved experience on
several coverages on middle market business, mainly in accident year
2004.

Favorable
net prior year premium development was recorded primarily as a result of
additional premium resulting from audits on recent policies, primarily workers’
compensation.

Additionally,
there was $15 million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim
adjustment expense reserve development and $4 million of favorable premium
development related to the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties, excluding
the impact of a corporate aggregate reinsurance commutation as discussed
above.

Specialty
Lines

Approximately
$60 million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
development was recorded due to increased claim adjustment expenses and
increased severities in the architects and engineers book of business, in
accident years 2000 through 2003. Previous reviews assumed that severities had
increased, at least in part, due to increases in the adequacy of case reserve
estimates. Subsequent changes in paid and incurred loss have shown that more of
the change was due to larger verdicts and settlements during these accident
years. One of the primary drivers of these larger verdicts and settlements is
the continuing general increase in real estate values. Favorable net prior year
premium development of approximately $10 million was recorded in relation to
this unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
development.

Approximately
$45 million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment
expense reserve development was related to large D&O claims assumed from a
London syndicate, primarily in accident years 2001 and prior. Approximately $43
million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment
expense reserve development was recorded due to large claims under excess
coverages provided to health care facilities.

Approximately
$32 million of favorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
development related to surety business was due to a favorable outcome on several
specific large claims and lower than expected emergence of additional large
claims related to accident years 1999 through 2003.

Approximately
$61 million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
development was related to a commutation agreement executed in the fourth
quarter of 2005 of a corporate aggregate reinsurance agreement. This unfavorable
claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development was partially
offset by a release of a previously established allowance for uncollectible
reinsurance.

Approximately
$24 million of favorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment
expense reserve development was recorded as a result of improvements in the
claim severity and claim frequency, mainly in recent accident years, from
nursing home businesses. The improved severity and frequency were due to

in this business. CNA no longer writes large national chains and focuses on
smaller insureds in selected areas of the country. These changes resulted in
business that experiences fewer large claims.

Approximately
$14 million of favorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment
expense reserve development was recorded due to lower severity in the dental
program. The lower severity was driven by efforts to resolve a higher percentage
of claims without a resulting indemnity payment.

Approximately
$10 million of favorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
development was due to lower severities in the excess and surplus lines runoff
business in accident years 2001 and prior.  These severity changes
were driven primarily by judicial decisions and settlement activities on
individual cases.

Approximately
$23 million of favorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
development was related to favorable loss trends on accidents years 2002 and
subsequent in CNA’s foreign operations, specifically Europe and Canada,
primarily in property, cargo and marine coverages.

Approximately
$90 million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment
expense reserve development and $83 million of favorable net prior year premium
development resulted from an unfavorable arbitration ruling on two reinsurance
treaties.

Approximately
$53 million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment
expense reserve development was related to reviews of liquor liability, trucking
and habitational business that indicated that the number of large claims was
higher than previously expected in recent accident years.

The
remainder of the favorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment
expense reserve development was primarily attributed to favorable experience in
the warranty line of business, partially offset by unfavorable net prior year
claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development attributed to
other large D&O claims.

Additionally,
there was approximately $21 million of favorable net prior year claim and
allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development and $17 million of
unfavorable premium development related to the corporate aggregate reinsurance
treaties in 2005, excluding the impact of a corporate aggregate reinsurance
commutation as discussed above.

Other
Insurance

Approximately
$157 million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
development was attributable to CNA’s assumed reinsurance operations, driven by
a significant increase in large claim activity during 2005 across multiple
accident years. This development was concentrated in the proportional liability,
excess of loss liability, and professional liability business, which impacted
underlying coverages that included general liability, umbrella, E&O and
D&O. CNA’s assumed reinsurance operations were put into run-off in
2003.

During
the fourth quarter of 2005, CNA executed significant commutation agreements with
certain reinsurers, including the commutation of a corporate aggregate
reinsurance agreement. These agreements resulted in approximately $62 million of
unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
development.

Approximately
$56 million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
development recorded in 2005 was a result of a second quarter commutation of a
finite reinsurance contract put in place in 1992.  CNA recaptured $400
million of losses and received $344 million of cash. The commutation was
economically attractive because of the reinsurance agreement’s contractual
interest rate and maintenance charges.

Approximately
$6 million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
development was related to the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties,
excluding the impact of a corporate aggregate reinsurance commutation as
discussed above. The unfavorable premium development was driven by $10 million
of additional ceded reinsurance premium on agreements where the ceded premium
depends on the ceded loss and $4 million of additional premium ceded to the
corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties.

Note
      9. Claim and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves –
      (Continued)

CNA noted
adverse development in various pollution accounts in its 2005 ground up review.
In the course of its review, CNA did not observe a negative trend or
deterioration in the underlying pollution claims environment. Rather, individual
account estimates changed due to changes in the liability and/or coverage
circumstances particular to those accounts. As a result, CNA increased pollution
reserves by $50 million in 2005.

The
overall unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
development was partially decreased by favorable claim and allocated claim
adjustment expense reserve development in various other programs in runoff,
including Financial Guarantee, Guarantee and Credit, and Mortgage Guarantee.
These programs exhibited favorable trends due to offsetting recoveries and
commutations, leading to reductions in the estimated liabilities.

Note
11.  Income Taxes

The
Company and its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax
return. The Company has entered into a separate tax allocation agreement with
CNA, a majority-owned subsidiary in which its ownership exceeds 80%. The
agreement provides that the Company will (i) pay to CNA the amount, if any, by
which the Company’s consolidated federal income tax is reduced by virtue of
inclusion of CNA in the Company’s return, or (ii) be paid by CNA an amount, if
any, equal to the federal income tax that would have been payable by CNA if it
had filed a separate consolidated return. The agreement may be canceled by
either of the parties upon thirty days written notice.

The
Company settled its 2005 federal income tax return with the Internal Revenue
Service (“IRS”) in 2007. The outcome of this examination did not have a material
effect on its financial condition or results of operations of the
Company.

In 2006,
the Company’s consolidated federal income tax returns for 2002 through 2004 were
settled with the IRS, including related carryback claims for refund which were
approved by the Joint Committee on Taxation. As a result, the Company recorded a
federal income tax benefit of $9 million and net refund interest of $2 million,
net of tax and minority interest, in the year ended December 31,
2006.

In 2005,
the Company’s consolidated federal income tax returns were settled with the IRS
through 2001 as the tax returns for 1998 through 2001, including related
carryback claims and prior claims for refund, were approved by the Joint
Committee on Taxation. As a result, the Company recorded net refund interest of
$131 million that is included in Other revenues in the Consolidated Statements
of Income. Subsequent to this settlement, a review of tax liabilities was
performed and the Company reduced its deferred tax liabilities by $59 million
for the year ended December 31, 2005. The tax benefit related primarily to the
release of federal income tax reserves.


Notes
      to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
      11. Income Taxes – (Continued)

The
federal income tax return for 2006 is subject to examination by the IRS. In
addition for 2007 and 2008, the IRS has invited the Company to participate in
the Compliance Assurance Process (“CAP”), which is a voluntary program for a
limited number of large corporations. Under CAP, the IRS conducts a real-time
audit and works contemporaneously with the Company to resolve any issues prior
to the filing of the tax return. The Company has agreed to participate. The
Company believes this approach should reduce tax-related uncertainties, if
any.

The
Company and/or its subsidiaries also file income tax returns in various state,
local and foreign jurisdictions. These returns, with few exceptions, are no
longer subject to examination by the various taxing authorities before
2000.

As
discussed in Note 1, the Company adopted the provisions of FIN No. 48,
“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” on January 1, 2007. As a result of
the implementation of FIN No. 48, the Company recognized a decrease to beginning
retained earnings on January 1, 2007 of $37 million. The total amount of
unrecognized tax benefits as of the date of adoption was approximately $70
million. Included in the balance at January 1, 2007, were $51 million of tax
positions that if recognized would affect the effective tax rate.

A
reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits
is as follows:

The
Company anticipates that it is reasonably possible that payments of
approximately $2 million will be made primarily due to the conclusion of state
income tax examinations within the next 12 months. Additionally, certain state
and foreign income tax returns will no longer be subject to examination and as a
result, there is a reasonable possibility that the amount of unrecognized tax
benefits will decrease by $7 million. At December 31, 2007, there were $42
million of tax benefits that if recognized would affect the effective
rate.

The
Company recognizes interest accrued related to: (1) unrecognized tax benefits in
Interest expense and (2) tax refund claims in Other revenues on the Consolidated
Statements of Income. The Company recognizes penalties in Income tax
expense (benefit) on the Consolidated Statements of Income. During 2007, the
Company recorded charges of approximately $4 million for interest expense
and $2 million for penalties.

Provision
has been made for the expected U.S. federal income tax liabilities applicable to
undistributed earnings of subsidiaries, except for certain subsidiaries for
which the Company intends to invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely, or
recover such undistributed earnings tax-free. At December 31, 2007, the Company
has not provided deferred taxes of $126 million, if sold through a taxable sale,
on $361 million of undistributed earnings related to a domestic affiliate. The
determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related
to the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries is not
practicable.

In
connection with a non-recurring distribution of $850 million to Diamond Offshore
from a foreign subsidiary, a portion of which consisted of earnings of the
subsidiary that had not previously been subjected to U.S. federal income tax,
Diamond Offshore recognized $59 million of U.S. federal income tax expense as a
result of the distribution. It remains Diamond Offshore’s intention to
indefinitely reinvest future earnings of the subsidiary to finance foreign
activities.

Total
income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, was
different than the amounts of $1,601 million, $1,557 million and $639 million,
computed by applying the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 35% to income
before income taxes and minority interest for each of the
years.

Although
realization of deferred tax assets is not assured, management believes it is
more likely than not that the recognized net deferred tax asset will be realized
through future earnings, including but not limited to future income from
continuing operations, reversal of existing temporary differences, and available
tax planning strategies. As a result, no valuation allowance was recorded at
December 31, 2007 and 2006.

At
December 31, 2007, Diamond Offshore, which is not included in the Company’s
consolidated federal income tax return, had a net operating loss carryforward of
approximately $5 million which will expire by 2010. It is expected that the net
operating loss carryforward will be fully utilized by Diamond Offshore in future
years. Diamond Offshore is currently under audit by the IRS for 2004 and 2005.
Diamond Offshore’s 2006 return remains subject to examination.

      option of the holder on the tenth and fifteenth anniversaries of issuance
      at the accreted value through the date of repurchase. The debentures were
      issued on June 6, 2000. Diamond Offshore, at its option, may elect to pay
      the purchase price in cash or shares of common stock, or in certain
      combinations thereof. The debentures are redeemable at the option of
      Diamond Offshore at any time at prices which reflect a yield of 3.5% to

      has the right to deliver cash in lieu of shares of its common stock.
      Diamond Offshore may redeem all or a portion of the debentures at any time
      on or after April 15, 2008 at a price equal to 100% of the principal
      amount. Holders may require Diamond Offshore to purchase all or a portion
      of the debentures on April 15, 2008, at a price equal to 100% of the
      principal amount. Diamond Offshore, at its option, may elect to pay the
      purchase price in cash or shares of common stock, or in certain
      combinations thereof.

In August
of 2007, CNA entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks and other
lenders. The credit agreement established a five-year $250 million senior
unsecured revolving credit facility which is intended to be used for general
corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2007, CNA had no outstanding borrowings
under the agreement.

Under the credit agreement, CNA is
required to pay certain fees, including a facility fee and a utilization fee,
both of which would adjust automatically in the event of a change in CNA’s
financial ratings. The credit agreement includes several covenants including
maintenance of a minimum consolidated net worth and a specified ratio of
consolidated indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization.

In the normal course of business, CNA
has provided letters of credit in favor of various unaffiliated insurance
companies, regulatory authorities and other entities. At December 31, 2007 there
were approximately $7 million of outstanding letters of credit.

As of December 31, 2007, there were no
loans outstanding under Diamond Offshore’s $285 million credit facility;
however, $54 million in letters of credit were issued which reduced the
available capacity under the facility.

On July
31, 2007, HighMount entered into $1.6 billion of term loans (the “Acquisition
Debt”) in conjunction with the acquisition described in Note 14. The Acquisition
Debt bears interest at a variable rate equal to the London Interbank Offered
Rate (“LIBOR”) plus an applicable margin and matures on July 26, 2012, subject
to acceleration by the lenders upon the occurrence of customary events of
default. HighMount has entered into interest rate swaps for a notional amount of
$1.6 billion to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in LIBOR. These swaps
effectively fix the interest rate at 5.8%. A Credit Agreement also provides for
a five year, $400 million revolving credit facility, borrowings under which bear
interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus an applicable margin. As of
December 31, 2007, $47 million was outstanding under the facility. In addition,
$6 million in letters of credit were issued, which reduced the available
capacity to $347 million.

In August
of 2007, Gulf South Pipeline, LP, a wholly owned subsidiary of Boardwalk
Pipeline, issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes,
consisting of $225 million aggregate principal amount of 5.8% senior notes due
2012 and $275 million aggregate principal amount of 6.3% senior notes due 2017.
The proceeds from this offering will primarily be used to finance a portion of
Gulf South’s expansion projects.

As of December 31, 2007, Boardwalk
Pipeline had outstanding letters of credit for $186 million to support certain
obligations associated with its Fayetteville Lateral and Gulf Crossing expansion
projects. Boardwalk Pipeline maintains a $1.0 billion credit facility, which was
recently increased from $700 million. The outstanding letters of credit reduced
the available capacity under its $1.0 billion credit facility to $814
million.

At December 31, 2007, the aggregate of
long term debt maturing in each of the next five years is approximately as
follows: $358 million in 2008, $74 million in 2009, $8 million in 2010, $580
million in 2011, $1,946 million in 2012 and $4,324 million
thereafter.

Acquisition
of business

On July 31, 2007, HighMount acquired,
through its subsidiaries, certain exploration and production assets and assumed
certain related obligations, from subsidiaries of Dominion for $4.0 billion,
subject to adjustment. The acquired business consists primarily of natural gas
exploration and production operations located in the Permian Basin in Texas, the
Antrim Shale in Michigan and the Black Warrior Basin in Alabama, with estimated
proved reserves totaling approximately 2.5 trillion cubic feet equivalent
(unaudited). These properties produce predominantly natural gas and related
natural gas liquids and are characterized by long reserve lives and high well
completion success rates. The amount of tax deductible goodwill is $1.0
billion.

The acquisition was funded with
approximately $2.4 billion in cash and $1.6 billion of Acquisition Debt
described in Note 12.

Diamond
Offshore

In 2007, the holders of $456 million in
principal amount of Diamond Offshore’s 1.5% debentures converted their
outstanding debentures into 9.3 million shares of Diamond Offshore’s common
stock at a price of $49.02 per share. In addition, the holders of $2 million
aggregate principal amount at maturity of Diamond Offshore’s Zero Coupon
Debentures converted their outstanding debentures into 20,658 shares of Diamond
Offshore’s common stock at a price of $73.00 per share.

The Company’s ownership interest in
Diamond Offshore declined from approximately 54% to 51% due to these
transactions. In accordance with SAB No. 51, the Company recognized a pretax
gain of $143 million ($93 million after provision for deferred income taxes) on
the issuance of subsidiary stock.

Prior to the conversion of Diamond
Offshore’s 1.5% convertible debentures, the Company carried a deferred tax
liability related to interest expense imputed on the bonds for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. As a result of the conversion, the deferred tax liability
was settled and a tax benefit of $29 million, net of minority interest, was
included in shareholders’ equity as an increase in additional
paid-in-capital.

Boardwalk
Pipeline

In the first and fourth quarters of
2007, Boardwalk Pipeline sold 8.0 million and 7.5 million common units at a
price of $36.50 and $30.90 per unit in a public offering and received net
proceeds of $288 million and $228 million, respectively. In addition, the
Company contributed $6 million and $5 million, respectively to maintain its 2.0%
general partner interest. The Company’s ownership interest in Boardwalk Pipeline
declined from approximately 80% to 70% as a result of these transactions. The
issuance price of the common units exceeded the Company’s carrying amount,
increasing the amount of cumulative pretax SAB No. 51 gains to approximately
$472 million at December 31, 2007, from $235 million at December 31, 2006. In
accordance with SAB No. 51, recognition of a gain is only appropriate if the
class of securities sold by the subsidiary does not contain any preference over
the subsidiary’s other classes of securities. As a result, the Company has
deferred gain recognition until the subordinated units are converted into common
units. Provided the subordinated units convert into common units after January
1, 2009, the Company will not recognize a gain in the income statement, pursuant
to the terms of SFAS No. 160.

Note
15.  Restructuring and Other Related Charges

In 2001, CNA finalized and approved a
restructuring plan related to the property and casualty segments and Life &
Group Non-Core segment, discontinuation of its variable life and annuity
business and consolidation of real estate locations. During 2006, management
reevaluated the sufficiency of the remaining accrual, which related to lease
termination costs, and determined that the liability was no longer required as
CNA had completed its lease obligations. As a result, the excess remaining
accrual was released in 2006, resulting in pretax income of $13 million for the
year ended December 31, 2006.  During 2005, approximately $1 million
of costs were paid. The initial restructuring and other related charges amounted
to $189 million in 2001.

16.  Statutory Accounting Practices (Unaudited)

CNA’s domestic insurance subsidiaries
maintain their accounts in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or
permitted by insurance regulatory authorities, which vary in certain respects
from GAAP. In converting from statutory accounting principles to GAAP, typical
adjustments include deferral of policy acquisition costs and the inclusion of
net unrealized holding gains or losses in shareholders’ equity relating to
certain fixed maturity securities.

CNA’s insurance subsidiaries are
domiciled in various jurisdictions. These subsidiaries prepare statutory
financial statements in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or
permitted by the respective jurisdictions’ insurance regulators. Prescribed
statutory accounting practices are set forth in a variety of publications of the
National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) as well as state laws,
regulations and general administrative rules.

CCC follows a permitted practice related
to the statutory provision for reinsurance, or the uncollectible reinsurance
reserve. This permitted practice allows CCC to record an additional
uncollectible reinsurance reserve amount through a different financial statement
line item than the prescribed statutory convention. This permitted practice had
no effect on CCC’s statutory surplus at December 31, 2007 or 2006.

CNA’s ability to pay dividends and other
credit obligations is significantly dependent on receipt of dividends from its
subsidiaries. The payment of dividends to CNA by its insurance subsidiaries
without prior approval of the insurance department of each subsidiary’s
domiciliary jurisdiction is limited by formula. Dividends in excess of these
amounts are subject to prior approval by the respective state insurance
departments.

Dividends from CCC are subject to the
insurance holding company laws of the State of Illinois, the domiciliary state
of CCC. Under these laws, ordinary dividends, or dividends that do not require
prior approval of the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional
Regulation – Division of Insurance (the “Department”), may be paid only from
earned surplus, which is calculated by removing unrealized gains from unassigned
surplus. As of December 31, 2007, CCC is in a positive earned surplus position,
enabling CCC to pay approximately $630 million of dividend payments during 2008
that would not be subject to the Department’s prior approval. The actual level
of dividends paid in any year is determined after an assessment of available
dividend capacity, holding company liquidity and cash needs as well as the
impact the dividends will have on the statutory surplus of the applicable
insurance company.

CNA’s domestic insurance subsidiaries
are subject to risk-based capital requirements. Risk-based capital is a method
developed by the NAIC to determine the minimum amount of statutory capital
appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations
in consideration of its size and risk profile. The formula for determining the
amount of risk-based capital specifies various factors, weighted based on the
perceived degree of risk, which are applied to certain financial balances and
financial activity. The adequacy of a company’s actual capital is evaluated by a
comparison to the risk-based capital results, as determined by the formula.
Companies below minimum risk-based capital requirements are classified within
certain levels, each of which requires specified corrective action. As of
December 31, 2007 and 2006, all of CNA’s domestic insurance subsidiaries
exceeded the minimum risk-based capital requirements.

Combined statutory capital and surplus
and net income, determined in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or
permitted by insurance regulatory authorities for the property and casualty and
the life insurance subsidiaries, were as follows:

17.  Supplemental Natural Gas and NGL Information
(Unaudited)

Users of this information should be
aware that the process of estimating quantities of proved and proved developed
natural gas, NGLs and crude oil reserves is very complex, requiring significant
subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, engineering
and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may also
change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but
not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and
continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic
conditions. As a result, revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from
time to time. Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure reserve
estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible, the
subjective decisions and variances in available data for various reservoirs make
these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in the
financial statement disclosures.

Proved reserves represent estimated
quantities of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil that geological and engineering
data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years
from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions in effect when the
estimates were made. Proved developed reserves are proved reserves expected to
be recovered through wells and equipment in place and under operating methods
used when the estimates were made.

Estimates of proved reserves at December
31, 2007 were prepared by HighMount’s staff engineers and reviewed by Ryder
Scott Company, L.P., HighMount’s independent consulting petroleum engineers. All
proved reserves are located in the United States of America.

Estimated net quantities of proved
natural gas and oil (including condensate and NGLs) reserves at December 31,
2007 and changes in the reserves during 2007 are shown in the schedule

Amounts
      exclude the effect of derivative instruments designated as hedges of
      future sales of production at year-end. Year-end prices used in the
      calculation of future cash flows are $6.80 per million British thermal
      units of gas, $62.16 per barrel of NGL, and $96.00 per barrel of
      oil.

In the foregoing determination of future
cash inflows, sales prices for natural gas and NGL were based on contractual
arrangements or market prices at year-end. Future costs of developing and
producing the proved natural gas and NGL reserves reported at the end of each
year shown were based on costs determined at each such year end, assuming the
continuation of existing economic conditions. Future income taxes were computed
by applying the appropriate year-end or future statutory tax rate to future
pretax net cash flows, less the tax basis of the properties involved, and giving
effect to tax deductions, permanent differences and tax credits.

It is not intended that the FASB’s
standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows represent the fair
market value of HighMount’s proved reserves. HighMount cautions that the
disclosures shown are based on estimates of proved reserve quantities and future
production schedules which are inherently imprecise and subject to revision, and
the 10% discount rate is arbitrary. In addition, costs and prices as of the
measurement date are used in the determinations, and no value may be assigned to
probable or possible reserves.

18.  Benefit Plans

Pension Plans – The Company has several
non-contributory defined benefit plans for eligible employees. The benefits for
certain plans which cover salaried employees and certain union employees are
based on formulas which include, among others, years of service and average pay.
The benefits for one plan which covers union workers under various union
contracts and certain salaried employees are based on years of service
multiplied by a stated amount. Benefits for another plan are determined annually
based on a specified percentage of annual earnings (based on the participant’s
age) and a specified interest rate (which is established annually for all
participants) applied to accrued balances. The Company’s funding policy is to
make contributions in accordance with applicable governmental regulatory
requirements.

Other Postretirement Benefit Plans – The
Company has several postretirement benefit plans covering eligible employees and
retirees. Participants generally become eligible after reaching age 55 with
required years of service. Actual requirements for coverage vary by plan.
Benefits for retirees who were covered by bargaining units vary by each unit and
contract. Benefits for certain retirees are in the form of a Company health care
account.

Benefits for retirees reaching age 65
are generally integrated with Medicare. Other retirees, based on plan
provisions, must use Medicare as their primary coverage, with the Company
reimbursing a portion of the unpaid amount; or are reimbursed for the Medicare
Part B premium or have no Company coverage. The benefits provided by the Company
are basically health and, for certain retirees, life insurance type
benefits.

The Company funds certain of these
benefit plans and accrues postretirement benefits during the active service of
those employees who would become eligible for such benefits when they
retire.

The Company uses December 31 as the
measurement date for its plans.

active total return oriented portfolio management style. Long term trends are
evaluated relative to market factors such as inflation, interest rates and
fiscal and monetary policies, in order to assess the capital market assumptions
as applied to the plan. Consideration of diversification needs and rebalancing
is maintained.

The Company employs a total return
approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to
maximize the long term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk. The
intent of this strategy is to minimize plan expenses by outperforming plan
liabilities over the long run. Risk tolerance is established through careful
consideration of the plan liabilities, plan funded status and corporate
financial conditions. The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of
U.S. and non-U.S. fixed income and equity investments. Alternative investments,
including hedge funds, are used judiciously to enhance risk adjusted long term
returns while improving portfolio diversification. Derivatives may be used to
gain market exposure in an efficient and timely manner. Investment risk is
measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability
measurements, periodic asset/liability studies and quarterly investment
portfolio reviews.

The Company’s pension plan and other
postretirement benefit weighted-average asset allocation at December 31, 2007
and 2006, by asset category are as follows:

In 2008, it is expected that
contributions of $40 million will be made to pension plans and $28 million to
postretirement healthcare and life insurance benefit plans.

Savings Plans – The Company and its
subsidiaries have several contributory savings plans which allow employees to
make regular contributions based upon a percentage of their salaries. Matching
contributions are made up to specified percentages of employees’ contributions.
The contributions by the Company and its subsidiaries to these plans amounted to
$72 million, $72 million and $40 million for the years ended December 31, 2007,
2006 and 2005, respectively.

Stock Option Plans – In 2005,
shareholders approved the amended and restated Loews Corporation 2000 Stock
Option Plan (the “Loews Plan”). The aggregate number of shares of Loews common
stock for which options or stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) may be granted
under the Loews Plan is 12,000,000 shares, and the maximum number of shares of
Loews common stock with respect to which options or SARs may be granted to any
individual in any calendar year is 1,200,000 shares. The exercise price per
share may not be less than the fair value of the common stock on the date of
grant. Generally, options and SARs vest ratably over a four-year period and
expire in ten years.

A summary of the stock option and SAR
transactions for the Loews Plan follows:

The
following table summarizes information about the Company’s stock options and
SARs outstanding in connection with the Loews Plan at December 31,
2007:

In 2007, the Company awarded SARs
totaling 959,250 shares. In accordance with the Loews Plan, the Company has the
ability to settle SARs in shares or cash and has the intention to settle in
shares. The SARs balance at December 31, 2007 was 1,874,924
shares.

Note
19.  Reinsurance

CNA cedes insurance to reinsurers to
limit its maximum loss, provide greater diversification of risk, minimize
exposures on larger risks and to exit certain lines of business. The ceding of
insurance does not discharge the primary liability of CNA. Therefore, a credit
exposure exists with respect to property and casualty and life reinsurance ceded
to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations or to the
extent that the reinsurer disputes the liabilities assumed under reinsurance
agreements. Property and casualty reinsurance coverages are tailored to the
specific risk characteristics of each product line and CNA’s retained amount
varies by type of coverage. Reinsurance contracts are purchased to protect
specific lines of business such as property and workers’ compensation. Corporate
catastrophe reinsurance is also purchased for property and workers’ compensation
exposure. Most reinsurance contracts are purchased on an excess of loss basis.
CNA also utilizes facultative reinsurance in certain lines. In addition, CNA
assumes reinsurance as a member of various reinsurance pools and
associations.

Reinsurance accounting allows for
contractual cash flows to be reflected as premiums and losses, as compared to
deposit accounting, which requires cash flows to be reflected as assets and
liabilities. To qualify for reinsurance accounting, reinsurance agreements must
include risk transfer. To meet risk transfer requirements, a reinsurance
contract must include both insurance risk, consisting of underwriting and timing
risk, and a reasonable possibility of a significant loss for the assuming
entity. Reinsurance contracts that include both significant risk sharing
provisions, such as adjustments to premiums or loss coverage based on loss
experience, and relatively low policy limits as evidenced by a high proportion
of maximum premium assessments to loss limits, may require considerable judgment
to determine whether or not risk transfer requirements are met. For such
contracts, often referred to as finite products, CNA assesses risk transfer for
each contract generally by developing quantitative analyses at

CNA has established an allowance for
uncollectible reinsurance receivables. The provision for uncollectible
reinsurance was $1 million, $23 million and $35 million for the years ended
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

CNA attempts to mitigate its credit
risk related to reinsurance by entering into reinsurance arrangements with
reinsurers that have credit ratings above certain levels and by obtaining
collateral. The primary methods of obtaining collateral are through reinsurance
trusts, letters of credit and funds withheld balances. Such collateral was
approximately $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006. On a
more limited basis, CNA may enter into reinsurance agreements with reinsurers
that are not rated.

CNA’s largest recoverables from a
single reinsurer at December 31, 2007, including prepaid reinsurance premiums,
were approximately $1.5 billion from subsidiaries of Swiss Re Group, $886
million from subsidiaries of Munich Re Group, $834 million from subsidiaries of
Hartford Insurance Group, $357 million from Allstate Insurance Group, and $333
million from Associated Accident & Health Reinsurance
Underwriters.

$1.5 billion and $3.3 billion related to property and casualty business that is
100% reinsured as a result of business dispositions and a significant captive
program.

Life and accident and health premiums
are primarily from long duration contracts; property and casualty premiums are
primarily from short duration contracts.

Insurance claims and policyholders’

reinsurance recoveries of $1.4 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion for the
years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, CNA
has ceded $1.8 billion and $2.0 billion of claim and claim adjustment expense
reserves, future policyholder benefits and policyholder funds as a result of
business operations sold in prior years.  Subject to certain
exceptions, the purchasers assumed the credit risk of the sold business that was
primarily reinsured to other carriers.  As of December 31, 2007 and
2006, the assumed credit risk was $49 million.

Commutations

In 2001,
CNA entered into a one-year corporate aggregate reinsurance treaty related to
the 2001 accident year covering substantially all property and casualty lines of
business in the Continental Casualty Company pool (the “CCC Cover”). The CCC
Cover was fully utilized in 2003 and interest charges accrued on the related
funds held balance at 8.0% per annum. In 2006, CNA commuted the CCC Cover. This
commutation had no impact on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year
ended December 31, 2006.

Also, in 2006, CNA commuted several
reinsurance treaties, including several finite treaties, with a European
reinsurance group. This commutation resulted in a pretax loss, net of allowance
for uncollectible reinsurance, of $48 million. CNA received $35 million of cash
in connection with this significant commutation.

In 2005, CNA entered into several
significant commutation agreements, including the commutation of the Aggregate
Cover, which was a corporate aggregate reinsurance treaty related to the 1999
through 2001 accident years and covered substantially all of CNA’s property and
casualty lines of business. These commutations resulted in an unfavorable pretax
impact of $399 million and CNA received $446 million of cash in connection with
these significant commutations.

Funds
Withheld Reinsurance Arrangements

CNA’s
overall reinsurance program has included certain property and casualty
contracts, such as the commuted CCC and Aggregate Covers, that were entered into
and accounted for on a “funds withheld” basis and which were deemed to be finite
reinsurance. Under the funds withheld basis, CNA recorded the cash remitted to
the reinsurer for the reinsurer’s margin, or cost of the reinsurance contract,
as ceded premiums. The remainder of the premiums ceded under the reinsurance
contract not remitted in cash were recorded as funds withheld liabilities. CNA
was required to increase the funds withheld balance at stated interest crediting
rates applied to the funds withheld balance or as otherwise specified under the
terms of the contract. The funds withheld liability was reduced by any
cumulative claim payments made by CNA in excess of CNA’s retention under the
reinsurance contract. If the funds withheld liability was exhausted, interest
crediting would cease and additional claim payments would have
been

recoverable
from the reinsurer. The funds withheld liability was recorded in Reinsurance
balances payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Interest cost on reinsurance
contracts accounted for on a funds withheld basis was incurred during all
periods in which a funds withheld liability existed and was included in net
investment income. There were no amounts subject to such interest crediting at
December 31, 2007 or 2006.

As of December 31, 2007 there were no
ceded reinsurance treaties inforce that CNA considers to be finite reinsurance.
The remaining treaty at December 31, 2006 was fully utilized in 2006 and
formally commuted as of September 1, 2007 with no impact to CNA. In 2003, CNA
discontinued purchases of such contracts.

pretax impact of contracts accounted for on a funds withheld basis for the years

Included in “All Other” above for the
year ended December 31, 2006 is $110 million of unfavorable development
resulting from a commutation, which is included in the ceded claim and claim
adjustment expenses above. This unfavorable development was partially offset by
the release of previously established allowance for uncollectible reinsurance,
resulting in an unfavorable impact of $48 million.

Included in “All Other” above for the
year ended December 31, 2005, is approximately $24 million of pretax expense
which resulted from an unfavorable arbitration ruling on two reinsurance
treaties impacting ceded earned premiums, ceded claim and claim adjustment
expenses, ceding commissions and interest charges. This unfavorable outcome was
partially offset by a release of previously established reinsurance bad debt
reserves resulting in a net impact from the arbitration ruling of $10 million
pretax expense for the year ended December 31, 2005.

There was no pretax impact by operating

California
Long Term Care Litigation

Shaffer v. Continental Casualty
Company

,

et al

.,
U.S. District Court, Central District of California, CV06-2235 RGK, is a class
action on behalf of certain California individual long term health care
policyholders, alleging that Continental Casualty Company (“CCC”) and CNA
knowingly or negligently used unrealistic actuarial assumptions in pricing these
policies, which according to plaintiff, would inevitably necessitate premium
increases. On January 8, 2008, CCC, CNA and the plaintiffs entered into a
binding agreement settling the case on a nationwide basis for the policy forms
potentially affected by the allegations of the complaint. Under the settlement
agreement, CCC will provide certain enhanced benefits to eligible class members
including certain non-forfeiture benefits, opportunities to exchange policies
and free health screenings. The agreement, which is subject to notice to the
class as well as Court approval, did not have a material adverse effect on the
financial condition, cash flows or results of operations of the
Company.

Insurance
Brokerage Antitrust Litigation

On August 1, 2005, CNA and several of
its insurance subsidiaries were joined as defendants, along with other insurers
and brokers, in multidistrict litigation pending in the United States District
Court for the District of New Jersey,

In re Insurance Brokerage Antitrust
Litigation,

Civil No. 04-5184 (FSH). The plaintiffs in this litigation
allege improprieties in the payment of contingent commissions to brokers and bid
rigging in connection with the sale of various lines of insurance. The
plaintiffs further allege the existence of a conspiracy and assert claims for
federal and state antitrust law violations, for violations of the federal
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (“RICO”) Act and for recovery
under various state common law theories. On April 5, 2007, the Court dismissed
the plaintiffs’ complaint, but granted the plaintiffs an opportunity to amend
their complaint. On May 22, 2007, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, and
on June 21, 2007, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss this amended
complaint. On August 31, 2007, the Court dismissed the federal antitrust claims
of the complaint.  On September 28, 2007, the Court dismissed the
federal RICO claims, which were the sole remaining federal claims of the
complaint, and, after declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the
state law claims, dismissed the complaint in its entirety. On October 10, 2007,
the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal from the foregoing orders to the Third
Circuit Court of Appeals. CNA believes it has meritorious defenses to this
action and intends to defend the case vigorously.

The extent of losses beyond any
amounts that may be accrued are not readily determinable at this time. However,
based on facts and circumstances presently known, in the opinion of management,
an unfavorable outcome will not materially affect the equity of the Company,
although results of operations may be adversely affected.

Global
Crossing Limited Litigation

CCC has been named as a defendant in
an action brought by the bankruptcy estate of Global Crossing Limited (“Global
Crossing”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of
New York. In the Complaint, plaintiff seeks unspecified monetary damages from
CCC and the other defendants for alleged fraudulent transfers and alleged
breaches of fiduciary duties arising from actions taken by Global Crossing while
CCC was a shareholder of Global Crossing. On August 3, 2006, the Court granted
in part and denied in part CCC’s motion to dismiss the Estate Representative’s
Amended Complaint.  The case is now in discovery. CCC believes it has
meritorious defenses to the remaining claims in this action and intends to
defend the case vigorously.

The extent of losses beyond any
amounts that may be accrued are not readily determinable at this

Approximately 4,775 product liability
cases are pending against cigarette manufacturers in the United States.
Lorillard is a defendant in approximately 3,775 of these cases. Approximately
1,050 of these lawsuits are

Engle

Progeny Cases,
described below, in which the claims of approximately 3,000 individual
plaintiffs are asserted.

The pending product liability cases are
composed of the following types of cases:

“

Conventional product
liability cases” are brought by individuals who allege cancer or other health
effects caused by smoking cigarettes, by using smokeless tobacco products, by
addiction to tobacco, or by exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.
Approximately 215 cases are pending against the tobacco industry, including
approximately 55 cases against Lorillard.

“

West Virginia Individual
Personal Injury Cases” are brought by individuals who allege cancer or other
health effects caused by smoking cigarettes, by using smokeless tobacco
products, or by addiction to cigarette smoking. The cases are pending in a
single West Virginia court and have been consolidated for trial. Defendants have
petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review the order that will govern the
trial. Lorillard is a defendant in approximately 55 of the 730 pending cases
that are part of this proceeding. The court has stayed activity in the
proceeding, including the start of a trial, until a petition pending before the
U.S. Supreme Court, in a case in which Lorillard is not a defendant, is
resolved.

“

Flight Attendant cases” are
brought by non-smoking flight attendants alleging injury from exposure to
environmental smoke in the cabins of aircraft. Plaintiffs in these cases may not
seek punitive damages for injuries that arose prior to January 15, 1997.
Lorillard is a defendant in each of the approximately 2,625 pending Flight
Attendant Cases.

“

Class action cases” are
purported to be brought on behalf of large numbers of individuals for damages
allegedly caused by smoking. Ten of these cases are pending against Lorillard.
In

Schwab v. Philip Morris
USA, Inc., et al.

, a Class Action Case pending against Lorillard, the
court has certified a nationwide class composed of purchasers of “light”
cigarettes. Lorillard is not a defendant in approximately 25 additional “lights”
class actions that are pending against other cigarette
manufacturers.

One of the cases pending against
Lorillard,

Engle

, was
certified as a class action prior to trial. Following trial, the class was
ordered decertified by the Florida Supreme Court, which allowed the class
members to proceed with individual cases. Approximately 1,050 of these

Engle

Progeny cases have been
filed in which the claims of approximately 3,000 individual plaintiffs are
asserted.

“

Reimbursement cases” are
brought by or on behalf of entities who seek reimbursement of expenses incurred
in providing health care to individuals who allegedly were injured by smoking.
Plaintiffs in these cases have included the U.S. federal government, U.S. state
and local governments, foreign governmental entities, hospitals or hospital
districts, American Indian tribes, labor unions, private companies and private
citizens. Three such cases are pending against Lorillard and other cigarette
manufacturers in the United States and one such case is pending in
Israel.

Included in this category is the suit
filed by the federal government,

United States of America v. Philip
Morris USA, Inc., et al.,

that sought disgorgement of profits and
injunctive relief. During 2005, an appellate court ruled that the government may
not seek disgorgement of profits. During August 2006, the trial court issued its
verdict and granted injunctive relief. The verdict did not award monetary
damages. See Reimbursement Cases below.

Loews is a defendant in four pending
product liability cases. One of these is a Reimbursement Case in Israel, while
the three other cases are on file in U.S. courts. One of the cases pending
against Loews in the U.S. is a Conventional Product Liability Case, while the
two other suits are purported Class Action Cases. Lorillard also is a defendant
in each of the four product liability cases in which Loews is a
party.

In addition to the above, “Filter cases”
are brought by individuals, including former employees of Lorillard, who seek
damages resulting from their alleged exposure to asbestos fibers that were
incorporated into filter material used in one brand of cigarettes manufactured
by Lorillard for a limited period of time ending more than 50 years ago.
Lorillard is a defendant in approximately 30 such cases.

Plaintiffs assert a broad range of legal
theories in these cases, including, among others, theories of negligence, fraud,
misrepresentation, strict liability, breach of warranty, enterprise liability
(including claims asserted under the federal Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (“RICO”)), civil conspiracy, intentional infliction of harm,
injunctive relief, indemnity, restitution, unjust enrichment, public nuisance,
claims based on antitrust laws and state consumer protection acts, and claims
based on failure to warn of the harmful or addictive nature of tobacco
products.

Plaintiffs in most of the cases seek
unspecified amounts of compensatory damages and punitive damages, although some
seek damages ranging into the billions of dollars. Plaintiffs in some of the
cases seek treble damages, statutory damages, disgorgement of profits, equitable
and injunctive relief, and medical monitoring, among other damages.

CONVENTIONAL
PRODUCT LIABILITY CASES

–

Approximately 215 cases are pending against the tobacco industry
in the United States. Lorillard is a defendant in approximately 55 of these
cases.

Since January 1, 2006, verdicts have
been returned in five cases. Lorillard was not a defendant in any of these
trials. Defense verdicts were returned in four of the five trials, while juries
found in favor of the plaintiffs and awarded damages in the remaining case. The
defendants are pursuing an appeal in this matter. In rulings addressing cases
tried in earlier years, some appellate courts have reversed verdicts returned in
favor of the plaintiffs while other judgments that awarded damages to smokers
have been affirmed on appeal. Manufacturers have exhausted their appeals and
have been required to pay damages to plaintiffs in nine individual cases in
recent years. Punitive damages were paid to the smokers in three of the nine
cases. Lorillard was not a party to these nine matters.

Lorillard is a defendant in two cases
that are scheduled for trial in 2008. The trial dates are subject to
change.

WEST
VIRGINIA INDIVIDUAL PERSONAL INJURY CASES

Approximately 730 cases
are pending in a single West Virginia court in a consolidated proceeding known
as West Virginia Individual Personal Injury Cases. Lorillard is a defendant in
approximately 55 of the 730 cases.

The proceeding has been governed by the
court’s trial plan. Defendants have sought review of the trial plan by the U.S.
Supreme Court. The court has stayed activity in the proceeding, including the
start of a trial, until a petition pending before the U.S. Supreme Court in a
case in which Lorillard is not a defendant is resolved.

During the third quarter of 2006 and the
fourth quarter of 2007, Lorillard was dismissed from approximately 825 of the
cases because those plaintiffs had not submitted evidence that they had smoked a
Lorillard product. These dismissals are not final and it is possible some or all
of these dismissals could be contested in subsequent appeals noticed by the
plaintiffs.

FLIGHT
ATTENDANT CASES

–

Approximately 2,625 Flight Attendant Cases are pending. Lorillard and
three other cigarette manufacturers are the defendants in each of these matters.
These suits were filed as a result of a settlement agreement by the parties,
including Lorillard, in

Broin
v. Philip Morris Companies, Inc., et al.

(Circuit Court, Miami-Dade
County, Florida, filed October 31, 1991), a class action brought on behalf of
flight attendants claiming injury as a result of exposure to environmental
tobacco smoke. The settlement agreement, among other things, permitted the
plaintiff class members to file these individual suits. These individuals may
not seek punitive damages for injuries that arose prior to January 15,
1997.

(Continued)

The judges that have presided over the
cases that have been tried have relied upon an order entered during October 2000
by the Circuit Court of Miami-Dade County, Florida. The October 2000 order has
been construed by these judges as holding that the flight attendants are not
required to prove the substantive liability elements of their claims for
negligence, strict liability and breach of implied warranty in order to recover
damages. The court further ruled that the trials of these suits are to address
whether the plaintiffs’ alleged injuries were caused by their exposure to
environmental tobacco smoke and, if so, the amount of damages to be
awarded.

Lorillard has been a defendant in each
of the eight flight attendant cases in which verdicts have been returned.
Defendants have prevailed in seven of the eight trials. In the single trial
decided for the plaintiff, the jury awarded $6 million in damages. The court,
however, reduced this award to $500,000. This verdict, as reduced by the trial
court, was affirmed on appeal and the defendants have paid the award.
Lorillard’s share of the judgment in this matter, including interest, was
approximately $60,000. In addition, Lorillard has paid its share of the
attorneys’ fees, costs and interest awarded to the plaintiff’s counsel in this
matter. In one of the seven cases in which a defense verdict was returned, the
court granted plaintiff’s motion for a new trial and, following appeal, the case
has been returned to the trial court for a second trial that has been scheduled
for 2008. The six remaining cases in which defense verdicts were returned are
concluded.

A trial date is scheduled in one of the
flight attendant cases. Trial dates are subject to change.

CLASS
ACTION CASES

–

Lorillard is a defendant in ten pending cases. In most of the pending
cases, plaintiffs seek class certification on behalf of groups of cigarette
smokers, or the estates of deceased cigarette smokers, who reside in the state
in which the case was filed. One of the cases in which Lorillard is a
defendant,

Schwab v. Philip
Morris USA, Inc., et al.

, is a purported national class action on behalf
of purchasers of “light” cigarettes in which plaintiffs’ claims are based on
defendants’ alleged RICO violations. Lorillard is not a defendant in
approximately 25 additional class action cases in which plaintiffs assert claims
on behalf of smokers or purchasers of “light” cigarettes.

Cigarette manufacturers, including
Lorillard, have defeated motions for class certification in a total of 35 cases,
13 of which were in state court and 22 of which were in federal court. Motions
for class certification have also been ruled upon in some of the “lights” cases
or in other class actions to which Lorillard was not a party. In some of these
cases, courts have denied class certification to the plaintiffs, while classes
have been certified in other matters.

The

Engle

case

–

During 2006, the Florida
Supreme Court issued rulings in the case of

Engle v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,
et al.

(Circuit Court, Miami-Dade County, Florida, filed May 5, 1994)
that affirmed the 2003 holding of an intermediate appellate court vacating the
$145.0 billion punitive damages award, including approximately $16.3 billion
against Lorillard. Prior to trial,

Engle

was certified as a
class action on behalf of Florida residents, and survivors of Florida residents,
who were injured or died from medical conditions allegedly caused by addiction
to smoking. The Florida Supreme Court determined that the case could not proceed
further as a class action and ordered decertification of the class. During
February of 2008, the trial court entered an order on remand from the Florida
Supreme Court that formally decertified the class.

The Florida Supreme Court’s 2006
decision also reinstated awards of actual damages to two of the three
individuals whose claims were heard during the second phase of the

Engle

trial. These awards
totaled approximately $3 million to one smoker and $4 million to the second, and
bear interest at the rate of 10.0% per year. Both individuals have informed the
court that they will not seek punitive damages. These verdicts were paid during
February 2008. The Lorillard payment was approximately $3 million for the
verdicts and the interest that accrued since November 2000.

During October 2007, the U.S. Supreme
Court denied defendants’ petition for review of the Florida Supreme Court’s
holdings that permit members of the

Engle

class to rely upon the
jury’s first-phase verdict. The Supreme Court subsequently rejected defendants’
petition for rehearing, and

Engle

has been returned to
the trial court.

The

Engle

Agreement

–

Florida enacted
legislation during the

Engle

trial that limited the
amount of an appellate bond required to be posted in order to stay execution of
a judgment for punitive damages in a certified class action. While Lorillard
believed this legislation was valid and that any challenges to the possible
application or constitutionality of this legislation by the

Engle

class would fail,
Lorillard entered into an agreement with the


Notes to

–

(Continued)

plaintiffs
during May 2001 in which it contributed $200 million to a fund held for the
benefit of the

Engle

class members (the “

Engle

Agreement”). As a
result, the class agreed to a stay of execution with respect to Lorillard on its
punitive damages judgment until appellate review was completed, including any
review by the U.S. Supreme Court. Final appellate review was completed in
November 2007. The $200 million will continue to be maintained for the benefit
of the members of the

Engle

class, with the court
to determine how that fund will be allocated consistent with state rules of
procedure. The

Engle

Agreement contained certain additional restrictions that no longer remain in
force now that final appellate review has been completed.

Engle

Progeny cases

–

Plaintiffs are individuals
who allege they or their decedents are members of the class that was decertified
in

Engle

. A 2006 ruling
by the Florida Supreme Court that ordered decertification of the class also
permitted class members to file individual actions, including claims for
punitive damages. The court further held that these individuals are entitled to
rely on a number of the jury’s findings in favor of the plaintiffs in the first
phase of the

Engle

trial.

Lorillard was a defendant in
approximately 1,050 cases filed by individuals who allege they were members of
the

Engle

class. The
claims of approximately 3,000 class members are asserted in these 1,050 cases
because some suits are on behalf of multiple purported class members. These
cases are pending in various Florida courts. The period for filing these cases
expired during January 2008, but Florida law permits plaintiffs 120 days after a
suit is initiated to effect service. As a result, the full number of

Engle

Progeny Cases is not
yet known. One of these matters pending against Lorillard is set for trial in
2008. Trial dates are subject to change.

The

Scott

case

–

Another class action
pending against Lorillard is

Scott v. The American Tobacco Company, et al.

(District Court, Orleans
Parish, Louisiana, filed May 24, 1996). During 1997, the court certified a
class composed of certain cigarette smokers resident in the State of Louisiana
who desire to participate in medical monitoring or smoking cessation programs
and who began smoking prior to September 1, 1988, or who began smoking prior to
May 24, 1996 and allege that defendants undermined compliance with the warnings
on cigarette packages.

Trial in

Scott

was heard in two
phases. In its July 2003 Phase I verdict, the jury rejected medical monitoring,
the primary relief requested by plaintiffs, and returned sufficient findings in
favor of the class to proceed to a Phase II trial on plaintiffs’ request for a
state-wide smoking cessation program.

During June 2004, the jury awarded
approximately $591 million to fund cessation programs for Louisiana smokers. The
court subsequently awarded prejudgment interest. During February 2007, the
Louisiana Court of Appeal reduced the amount of the award by approximately $328
million; struck the award of prejudgment interest, which totaled approximately
$440 million as of December 31, 2006; and limited class membership to
individuals who began smoking by September 1, 1988, and whose claims accrued by
September 1, 1988. The Louisiana Court of Appeal has returned the case to the
trial court, for further proceedings. During January 2008, the Louisiana Supreme
Court denied plaintiffs’ and defendants’ separate petitions for review.
Lorillard’s share of any judgment has not been determined. It is possible that
post-judgment interest could be assessed on any award to the class that survives
appeal. In the fourth quarter of 2007, Lorillard recorded a pretax provision of
approximately $66 million for this matter.

The parties filed a stipulation in the
trial court agreeing that an article of Louisiana law required that the amount
of the bond for the appeal be set at $50 million for all defendants
collectively. The parties further agreed that the plaintiffs have full
reservations of rights to contest in the trial court the sufficiency of the bond
on any grounds. The trial court entered an order setting the amount of the bond
at $50 million for all defendants. Defendants collectively posted a surety bond
in that amount, of which Lorillard secured 25%, or $13 million. While Lorillard
believes the limitation on the appeal bond amount is valid as required by
Louisiana law, in the event of a successful challenge the amount of the appeal
bond could be set as high as 150% of the judgment and judicial interest
combined. If such an event occurred, Lorillard’s share of the appeal bond has
not been determined.

Other class action cases –

Two additional cases are pending against Lorillard in which motions for
class certification were granted. In one of them,

Brown v. The American Tobacco
Company, Inc., et al.

(Superior Court, San Diego County, California,
filed June 10, 1997), a California court granted defendants’ motion to
decertify the class. The class decertification order has been affirmed on
appeal, but the California Supreme Court has agreed to hear the case. The class
originally certified in

Brown

was composed of
residents of California who smoked at least

–

(Continued)

one of
defendants’ cigarettes between June 10, 1993 and April 23, 2001 and who were
exposed to defendants’ marketing and advertising activities in California. In
the second case,

Daniels v.
Philip Morris, Incorporated, et al.

(Superior Court, San Diego County,
California, filed August 2, 1998), the court granted defendants’ motion for
summary judgment during 2002 and dismissed the case. Both the California Court
of Appeal and the California Supreme Court have affirmed

Daniels’

dismissal.
Plaintiffs have petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review

Daniels,

but the Court has
not determined whether it will hear the case. Prior to granting defendants’
motion for summary judgment, the court had certified a class composed of
California residents who, while minors, smoked at least one cigarette between
April of 1994 and December 31, 1999 and were exposed to defendants’ marketing
and advertising activities in California. It is possible that either or both of
these class certification rulings could be reinstated as a result of the pending
appeals.

As discussed above, other cigarette
manufacturers are defendants in approximately 25 cases in which plaintiffs’
claims are based on the allegedly fraudulent marketing of “lights” or
“ultra-lights” cigarettes. Classes have been certified in some of these matters.
In one of the pending “lights” cases,

Good v. Altria Group, Inc.,
et al.

, the U.S. Supreme Court announced during January 2008 that it
will consider whether federal law bars plaintiffs from challenging statements
authorized by the Federal Trade Commission about tar and nicotine yields that
have been made in cigarette advertisements.

The

Schwab

case

–

Lorillard is a defendant
in one “lights” class action,

Schwab v. Philip Morris USA, Inc.,
et al.

(U.S. District Court, Eastern District, New York, filed May 11,
2004). Plaintiffs in

Schwab

base their claims on
defendants’ alleged violations of the RICO statute in the manufacture, marketing
and sale of “lights” cigarettes. Plaintiffs have estimated damages to the class
in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Any damages awarded to the plaintiffs
based on defendants’ violation of the RICO statute would be trebled. During
September 2006, the court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification and
certified a nationwide class action on behalf of purchasers of “light”
cigarettes. During July 2007, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals heard
defendants’ appeal of the class certification ruling. The court of appeals has
prohibited activity before the trial court until the appeal is
concluded.

REIMBURSEMENT
CASES

–

Lorillard is a
defendant in the three Reimbursement Cases that are pending in the U.S. and it
has been named as a party to the case in Israel.

U.S. Federal Government Action

–

During August 2006, the
U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued its final judgment and
remedial order in the federal government’s reimbursement suit (

United States of

America v. Philip Morris USA, Inc.,
et al.

, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia, filed September 22,
1999). The verdict concluded a bench trial that began in September 2004.
Lorillard, other cigarette manufacturers, two parent companies and two trade
associations are defendants in this action.

In its 2006 verdict, the court
determined that the defendants, including Lorillard, violated certain provisions
of the RICO statute, that there was a likelihood of present and future RICO
violations, and that equitable relief was warranted. The government was not
awarded monetary damages. The equitable relief included permanent injunctions
that prohibit the defendants, including Lorillard, from engaging in any act of
racketeering, as defined under RICO; from making any material false or deceptive
statements concerning cigarettes; from making any express or implied statement
about health on cigarette packaging or promotional materials (these prohibitions
include a ban on using such descriptors as “low tar,” “light,” “ultra-light,”
“mild,” or “natural”); and from making any statements that “low tar,” “light,”
“ultra-light,” “mild,” or “natural” or low-nicotine cigarettes may result in a
reduced risk of disease. The final judgment and remedial order also requires the
defendants, including Lorillard, to make corrective statements on their
websites, in certain media, in point-of-sale advertisements, and on cigarette
package “onserts” concerning: the health effects of smoking; the addictiveness
of smoking; that there are no significant health benefits to be gained by
smoking “low tar,” “light,” “ultra-light,” “mild,” or “natural” cigarettes; that
cigarette design has been manipulated to ensure optimum nicotine delivery to
smokers; and that there are adverse effects from exposure to secondhand smoke.
If the final judgment and remedial order are not modified or vacated on appeal,
the costs to Lorillard for compliance could exceed $10 million. Defendants have
appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit which
has stayed the judgment and remedial order while the appeal is proceeding. The
government also has noticed an appeal from the final judgment. While trial was
underway, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals ruled that plaintiff may not
seek disgorgement of profits, but this appeal was interlocutory in nature and
could be reconsidered in the present appeal. Prior to trial, the government had
estimated that it was entitled to approximately $280.0 billion from the
defendants for its disgorgement of profits

claim. In
addition, the government sought during trial more than $10.0 billion for the
creation of nationwide smoking cessation, public education and counter-marketing
programs. In its 2006 verdict, the trial court declined to award such relief. It
is possible that these claims could be reinstated on appeal.

SETTLEMENT
OF STATE REIMBURSEMENT LITIGATION

–

On November 23, 1998,
Lorillard and the other Original Participating Manufacturers entered into the
MSA with 46 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,
Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the
Northern Mariana Islands to settle the asserted and unasserted health care cost
recovery and certain other claims of those states. These settling entities are
generally referred to as the Settling States. The Original Participating
Manufacturers had previously settled similar claims brought by Mississippi,
Florida, Texas and Minnesota, which together with the MSA are referred to in
this Information Statement as the State Settlement Agreements.

The State Settlement Agreements provide
that the agreements are not admissions, concessions or evidence of any liability
or wrongdoing on the part of any party, and were entered into by the Original
Participating Manufacturers to avoid the further expense, inconvenience, burden
and uncertainty of litigation.

Lorillard recorded pretax charges of
$1,048 million, $911 million and $876 million ($680 million, $560 million and
$538 million after taxes) for 2007, 2006 and 2005, to accrue its obligations
under the State Settlement Agreements. Lorillard’s portion of ongoing adjusted
payments and legal fees is based on its share of domestic cigarette shipments in
the year preceding that in which the payment is due. Accordingly, Lorillard
records its portions of ongoing settlement payments as part of cost of
manufactured products sold as the related sales occur.

The State Settlement Agreements require
that the domestic tobacco industry make annual payments of $9.4 billion, subject
to adjustment for several factors, including inflation, market share and
industry volume. In addition, the domestic tobacco industry is required to pay
settling plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees, subject to an annual cap of $500 million,
as well as an additional amount of up to $125 million in each year through 2008.
These payment obligations are the several and not joint obligations of each
settling defendant.

The State Settlement Agreements also
include provisions relating to significant advertising and marketing
restrictions, public disclosure of certain industry documents, limitations on
challenges to tobacco control and underage use laws, and other provisions.
Lorillard and the other Original Participating Manufacturers have notified the
States that they intend to seek an adjustment in the amount of payments made in
2003 pursuant to a provision in the MSA that permits such adjustment if the
companies can prove that the MSA was a significant factor in their loss of
market share to companies not participating in the MSA and that the States
failed to diligently enforce certain statutes passed in connection with the MSA.
If the Original Participating Manufacturers are ultimately successful, any
adjustment would be reflected as a credit against future payments by the
Original Participating Manufacturers under the agreement.

From time to time, lawsuits have been
brought against Lorillard and the Other Participating Manufacturers, or against
one or more of the states, challenging the validity of the MSA on certain
grounds, including as a violation of the antitrust laws. Lorillard is a
defendant in one such case, which has been dismissed by the trial court but has
been appealed by the plaintiffs. Lorillard understands that additional such
cases are proceeding against other defendants.

In addition, in connection with the MSA,
the Original Participating Manufacturers entered into an agreement to establish
a $5.2 billion trust fund payable between 1999 and 2010 to compensate the
tobacco growing communities in 14 states (the “Trust”). Payments to the Trust
will no longer be required as a result of an assessment imposed under a new
federal law repealing the federal supply management program for tobacco growers,
although the states of Maryland and Pennsylvania are contending that payments
under the Trust should continue to growers in those states since the new federal
law did not cover them, and the matter is being litigated. In 2005 other
litigation was resolved over the Trust’s obligation to return payments made by
the Original Participating Manufacturers in 2004 or withheld from payment to the
Trust for the fourth quarter of 2004, when the North Carolina Supreme Court
ruled that such payments were due to the Trust. Lorillard’s share of payments
into the Trust in 2004 was approximately $30 million and its share of the
payment due for the last quarter of that year was approximately $10 million.
Under the new law, enacted in October of 2004, tobacco quota holders and growers
will be compensated with payments totaling $10.1 billion, funded by an
assessment on tobacco manufacturers and importers. Payments to qualifying
tobacco quota holders and growers commenced in 2005.

(Continued)

Lorillard believes that the State
Settlement Agreements will materially adversely affect its cash flows and
operating income in future years. The degree of the adverse impact will depend,
among other things, on the rates of decline in domestic cigarette sales in the
premium price and discount price segments, Lorillard’s share of the domestic
premium price and discount price cigarette segments, and the effect of any
resulting cost advantage of manufacturers not subject to significant payment
obligations under the State Settlement Agreements.

FILTER
CASES

–

In addition to
the above, claims have been brought against Lorillard by individuals who seek
damages resulting from their alleged exposure to asbestos fibers that were
incorporated into filter material used in one brand of cigarettes manufactured
by Lorillard for a limited period of time ending more than 50 years ago.
Approximately 30 such matters are pending against Lorillard. Since January 1,
2006, Lorillard has paid, or has reached agreement to pay, a total of
approximately $9 million in payments of judgments and settlements to finally
resolve approximately 40 claims. No such cases have been tried since January 1,
2006. Trial dates are scheduled in some of the pending cases. Trial dates are
subject to change.

Other
Tobacco – Related

ANTITRUST
CASES – Indirect Purchaser Suits – Approximately 30 antitrust suits were filed
on behalf of putative classes of consumers in various state courts against
Lorillard and its major competitors. The suits all alleged that the defendants
entered into agreements to fix the wholesale prices of cigarettes in violation
of state antitrust laws which permit indirect purchasers, such as retailers and
consumers, to sue under price fixing or consumer fraud statutes. More than 20
states permit such suits. Lorillard was a defendant in all but one of these
indirect purchaser cases. Three indirect purchaser suits, in New York, Florida
and Michigan, were dismissed by courts in their entirety and the plaintiffs
withdrew their appeals. The actions in all other states except for New Mexico
and Kansas, have been voluntarily dismissed.

In the Kansas case, the District
Court of Seward County certified a class of Kansas indirect purchasers in 2002.
The parties are in the process of litigating certain privilege issues. On July
14, 2006, the Court issued an order confirming that fact discovery is closed,
with the exception of privilege issues that the Court determines, based on a
Special Master’s report, justify further limited fact discovery. On October 29,
2007 the Court denied all of the defendants’ privilege claims, and the
defendants have filed a mandamus petition before the Kansas Supreme Court, which
currently is considering the petition. Expert discovery, as necessary, will take
place later this year. No date has as yet been set by the Court for dispositive
motions and trial.

A decision granting class
certification in New Mexico was affirmed by the New Mexico Court of Appeals on
February 8, 2005. As ordered by the Court, class notice was sent out on October
30, 2005. The New Mexico plaintiffs were permitted to rely on discovery produced
in the Kansas case. On June 30, 2006, the New Mexico Court granted summary
judgment to all defendants, and the suit was dismissed. An appeal was filed by
the plaintiffs on August 14, 2006, and has not yet been heard.

MSA Antitrust Suits – Lorillard and
the other major cigarette manufacturers, along with the Attorney General of the
State of California, have been sued by a consumer purchaser of cigarettes in a
putative class action alleging violations of the Sherman Act and California
state antitrust and unfair competition laws (Sanders v. Lockyer, et al., U.S.
District Court, Northern District of California, filed June 9, 2004). The
plaintiff seeks treble damages of an unstated amount for the putative class as
well as declaratory and injunctive relief. All claims are based on the assertion
that the Master Settlement Agreement together with certain implementing
legislation enacted by the state of California, constitute unlawful restraints
of trade. On March 28, 2005 the defendants’ motion to dismiss the suit was
granted. Plaintiff appealed the dismissal to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit. Argument was heard on February 15, 2007, and the Court of Appeals
issued an opinion on September 26, 2007 affirming dismissal of the suit. On
January 25, plaintiff filed a petition seeking certiorari from the U.S. Supreme
Court.

Other MSA related cases have been
filed and are still pending in federal and state courts challenging the MSA
under federal antitrust statutes and state antitrust and unfair competition
laws.  Lorillard is not named as a defendant in these other cases, but
in some cases state Attorneys General and other cigarette manufacturers are
named as defendants, and the result in these cases could affect the viability of
the MSA or some of its provisions.

Defenses

Lorillard believes that it has valid
defenses to the cases pending against it. Lorillard also believes it has valid
bases for appeal should any adverse verdicts be returned against it. To the
extent the Company is a defendant in any of the lawsuits described in this
section, the Company believes that it is not a proper defendant in these matters
and has moved or plans to move for dismissal of all such claims against it.
While Lorillard intends to defend vigorously all tobacco products liability
litigation, it is not possible to predict the outcome of any of this litigation.
Litigation is subject to many uncertainties. Plaintiffs have prevailed in
several cases, as noted above. It is possible that one or more of the pending
actions could be decided unfavorably as to Lorillard or the other defendants.
Lorillard may enter into discussions in an attempt to settle particular cases if
it believes it is appropriate to do so.

Lorillard cannot predict the outcome of
pending litigation. Some plaintiffs have been awarded damages from cigarette
manufacturers at trial. While some of these awards have been overturned or
reduced, other damages awards have been paid after the manufacturers have
exhausted their appeals. These awards and other litigation activities against
cigarette manufacturers continue to receive media attention. In addition, health
issues related to tobacco products also continue to receive media attention. It
is possible, for example, that the 2006 verdict in

United States of America v. Philip
Morris USA, Inc., et al.

, which made many adverse findings regarding the
conduct of the defendants, including Lorillard, could form the basis of
allegations by other plaintiffs or additional judicial findings against
cigarette manufacturers. The 2006 decision by the Florida Supreme Court in

Engle

has led to the filing
of many additional new cases against cigarette manufacturers, including
Lorillard. These events could have an adverse affect on the ability of Lorillard
to prevail in smoking and health litigation and could influence the filing of
new suits against Lorillard. Lorillard also cannot predict the type or extent of
litigation that could be brought against it and other cigarette manufacturers in
the future.

Except for the impact of the State
Settlement Agreements and

Scott

as described above,
management is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of
loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of material pending
litigation and, therefore, no material provision has been made in the
Consolidated Financial Statements for any unfavorable outcome. It is possible
that Lorillard’s results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarterly
or annual period or its financial position could be materially adversely
affected by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending
litigation.

OTHER
LITIGATION

The Company and its subsidiaries are
also parties to other litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. The
outcome of this other litigation will not, in the opinion of management,
materially affect the Company’s results of operations or equity.

Guarantees

In the course of selling business
entities and assets to third parties, CNA has agreed to indemnify purchasers for
losses arising out of breaches of representation and warranties with respect to
the business entities or assets being sold, including, in certain cases, losses
arising from undisclosed liabilities or certain named litigation. Such
indemnification provisions generally survive for periods ranging from nine
months following the applicable closing date to the expiration of the relevant
statutes of limitation. As of December 31, 2007, the aggregate amount of
quantifiable indemnification agreements in effect for sales of business
entities, assets and third party loans was $873 million.

In addition, CNA has agreed to
provide indemnification to third party purchasers for certain losses associated
with sold business entities or assets that are not limited by a contractual
monetary amount. As of December 31, 2007, CNA had outstanding unlimited
indemnifications in connection with the sales of certain of its business
entities or assets that included tax liabilities arising prior to a purchaser’s
ownership of an entity or asset, defects in title at the time of sale, employee
claims arising prior to closing and in some cases losses arising from certain
litigation and undisclosed liabilities. These indemnification agreements survive
until the applicable statutes of limitation expire, or

(Continued)

until the
agreed upon contract terms expire. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, CNA has
recorded $27 million and $28 million of liabilities related to these
indemnification agreements.

In connection with the issuance of
preferred securities by CNA Surety Capital Trust I, CNA Surety, a 62% owned and
consolidated subsidiary of CNA, issued a guarantee of $75 million to guarantee
the payment by CNA Surety Capital Trust I of annual dividends of $2 million over
30 years and redemption of $30 million of preferred securities.

CNA
Surety

CNA Surety has provided significant
surety bond protection for a large national contractor that undertakes projects
for the construction of government and private facilities, a substantial portion
of which have been reinsured by CCC. In order to help this contractor meet its
liquidity needs and complete projects which had been bonded by CNA Surety,
commencing in 2003 CNA provided loans to the contractor through a credit
facility. Due to reduced operating cash flow at the contractor these loans were
fully impaired through realized investment losses in 2005. The Company, through
a participation agreement with CNA, has funded and owns an interest in the
credit facility. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded a
pretax impairment charge of $47 million. CNA no longer provides additional
liquidity to the contractor and has not recognized interest income related to
the loans since June 30, 2005.

In addition to the impairment of loans
outstanding under the credit facility, CNA determined that the contractor would
likely be unable to meet its obligations under the surety bonds. Accordingly,
during 2005, CNA Surety established $110 million of surety loss reserves in
anticipation of future loss payments, $50 million of which was ceded to CCC
under the reinsurance agreements discussed below. Further deterioration of the
contractor’s operating cash flow could result in higher loss estimates and
trigger additional reserve actions. If any such reserve additions were required,
CCC would incur the unfavorable net prior year development through the
reinsurance arrangements. During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and
2005, CNA Surety paid $3 million, $34 million and $26 million related to surety
losses of the contractor.

CNA Surety may provide surety bonds on a
limited basis on behalf of the contractor to support its revised restructuring
plan, subject to the contractor’s compliance with CNA Surety’s underwriting
standards and ongoing management of CNA Surety’s exposure in relation to the
contractor. All surety bonds written for the contractor are issued by CCC and
its affiliates, other than CNA Surety, and are subject to underlying reinsurance
treaties pursuant to which all bonds written on behalf of CNA Surety are 100%
reinsured to one of CNA Surety’s insurance subsidiaries.

CCC provides reinsurance protection to
CNA Surety for losses in excess of an aggregate of $60 million associated with
the contractor. This treaty provides coverage for the life of bonds either in
force or written from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2005. CCC and
CNA Surety agreed by addendum to extend this contract through December 31,
2008.

CNA has also guaranteed or provided
collateral for the contractor’s letters of credit and certain specified
insurance policies. As of December 31, 2007 these guarantees and collateral
obligations aggregated $9 million.

CCC provided an excess of loss
reinsurance contract to the insurance subsidiaries of CNA Surety over a period
that expired on December 31, 2000 (the “stop loss contract”). The stop loss
contract limits the net loss ratios for CNA Surety with respect to certain
accounts and lines of insurance business. In the event that CNA Surety’s
accident year net loss ratio exceeds 24.0% for 1997 through 2000 (the
“contractual loss ratio”), the stop loss contract requires CCC to pay amounts
equal to the amount, if any, by which CNA Surety’s actual accident year net loss
ratio exceeds the contractual loss ratio multiplied by the applicable net earned
premiums. The minority shareholders of CNA Surety do not share in any losses
that apply to this contract.

Diamond
Offshore Construction Projects

As of December 31, 2007, Diamond
Offshore had purchase obligations aggregating approximately $200 million related
to the major upgrade of one rig and construction of two new jack-up rigs, as
described in Note 8. Diamond

Offshore
expects to complete funding of these projects in 2008. However, the actual
timing of these expenditures will vary based on the completion of various
construction milestones, which are beyond Diamond Offshore’s
control.

HighMount
Volumetric Production Payment Transactions

As part
of the acquisition of exploration and production assets from Dominion, HighMount
assumed an obligation to deliver approximately 15 Bcf of natural gas through
February 2009 under previously existing VPP agreements. Under these agreements,
certain HighMount acquired properties are subject to fixed-term overriding
royalty interests which had been conveyed to the VPP purchaser. While HighMount
is obligated under the agreement to produce and deliver to the purchaser its
portion of future natural gas production from the properties, HighMount retains
control of the properties and rights to future development drilling. If
production from the properties subject to the VPP is inadequate to deliver the
natural gas provided for in the VPP, HighMount has no obligation to make up the
shortfall. At December 31, 2007, the remaining obligation under these agreements
is approximately 10.9 Bcf of natural gas.

Pipeline
Expansion Projects

As discussed in Note 8, Boardwalk
Pipeline is engaged in several major expansion projects that will require the
investment of significant capital resources. These projects are subject to FERC
approval. As of December 31, 2007, Boardwalk Pipeline had purchase commitments
of $851 million primarily related to its expansion projects.

Note
23.  Discontinued Operations

CNA has discontinued operations, which
consist of run-off insurance and reinsurance operations acquired in its merger
with The Continental Corporation in 1995. As of December 31, 2007, the remaining
run-off business is administered by Continental Reinsurance Corporation
International, Ltd., a Bermuda subsidiary. The business consists of facultative
property and casualty, treaty excess casualty and treaty pro-rata reinsurance
with underlying exposure to a diverse, multi-line domestic and international
book of business encompassing property, casualty, and marine
liabilities.

Effective
October 4, 2007, the Company entered into an agreement to sell Bulova to Citizen
Watch Co., Ltd. for approximately $250 million, subject to adjustment, in
January of 2008. The Company estimates that it will record a pretax gain of
approximately $105 million due to this transaction.

On May 4, 2007, CNA sold Continental
Management Services Limited, its United Kingdom discontinued operations
subsidiary. In anticipation of the 2007 sale, the Company recorded an impairment
loss of $26 million, after tax and minority interest, in 2006. After closing the
transaction in 2007, the loss was reduced by approximately $4 million. The
assets and liabilities sold were $239 million and $157 million at December 31,
2006. Net loss for the business through the date of the sale in 2007 was $1
million. Excluding the impairment loss recorded in 2006, net income (loss) for
the business was $(1) million and $12 million for the years ended December 31,
2006 and 2005. CNA’s subsidiary, The Continental Corporation, provided a
guarantee for a portion of the liabilities related to certain marine products.
The sale agreement included provisions that significantly limit CNA’s exposure
related to this guarantee.

Net assets of CNA’s discontinued
operations, totaling $23 million and $68 million as of December 31, 2007 and
2006, are included in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Total
assets and liabilities of Bulova’s discontinued operations, totaling $218
million and $50 million as of December 31, 2007 and $226 million and $52 million
as of December 31, 2006, are included in Other Assets and Other Liabilities in
the Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows:

In 2007, CNA transferred an investment
portfolio comprised of fixed maturity securities of $22 million, short term
investments of $14 million and cash of $4 million from its continuing operations
to its discontinued operations.

CNA’s accounting and reporting for
discontinued operations is in accordance with APB No. 30, “Reporting the Results
of Operations – Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business,
and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions.”
At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the insurance reserves are net of discount of $73
million and $94 million. The income (loss) from discontinued operations reported
above primarily represents the net investment income, realized investment gains
and losses, foreign currency gains and losses, effects of the accretion of the
loss reserve discount and re-estimation of the ultimate claim and claim
adjustment expense of the discontinued operations.

Note
24.  Business Segments

The Company’s reportable segments are
primarily based on its individual operating subsidiaries. Each of the principal
operating subsidiaries are headed by a chief executive officer who is
responsible for the operation of its business and has the duties and authority
commensurate with that position. Investment gains (losses) and the related
income taxes, excluding those of CNA Financial, are included in the Corporate
and other segment.

CNA’s core property and casualty
commercial insurance operations are reported in two business segments: Standard
Lines and Specialty Lines. As a result of CNA’s realignment of management
responsibilities in the fourth quarter of 2007, CNA has revised its property and
casualty segments. Standard Lines includes standard property
and


Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
24.  Business Segments – (Continued)

casualty
coverages sold to small businesses and middle market entities and organizations
in the U.S. primarily through an independent agency distribution system.
Standard Lines also includes commercial insurance and risk management products
sold to large corporations in the U.S. primarily through insurance brokers.
Specialty Lines provides a broad array of professional, financial and specialty
property and casualty products and services, including excess and surplus lines,
primarily through insurance brokers and managing general underwriters. Specialty
Lines also includes insurance coverages sold globally through CNA’s foreign
operations (“CNA Global”). Previously, excess and surplus lines and CNA Global
were included in Standard Lines.

The new segment structure reflects
the way CNA management currently reviews results and makes business decisions.
Prior period segment disclosures have been conformed to the current year
presentation.

The non-core operations are managed in
Life & Group Non-Core segment and Other Insurance segment. Life & Group
Non-Core primarily includes the results of the life and group lines of business
sold or placed in run-off. Other Insurance primarily includes the results of
certain property and casualty lines of business placed in run-off, including CNA
Re. This segment also includes the results related to the centralized adjusting
and settlements of A&E.

Lorillard is engaged in the production
and sale of cigarettes with its principal products marketed under the brand
names of Newport, Kent, True, Maverick and Old Gold with substantially all of
its sales in the United States.

Diamond
Offshore’s business primarily consists of operating 44 offshore drilling rigs
that are chartered on a contract basis for fixed terms by companies engaged in
exploration and production of hydrocarbons. Offshore rigs are mobile units that
can be relocated based on market demand. On December 31, 2007, half of these
rigs were located in the Gulf of Mexico region with the remainder operating in
Brazil, the North Sea, and various other foreign markets.

HighMount’s business consists primarily
of natural gas exploration and production operations located in the Permian
Basin in Texas, the Antrim Shale in Michigan, and the Black Warrior Basin in
Alabama, with estimated proved reserves totaling approximately 2.5 trillion
cubic feet equivalent.

Boardwalk Pipeline is engaged in the
interstate transportation and storage of natural gas. This segment consists of
two interstate natural gas pipeline systems originating in the Gulf Coast area
and running north and east through Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama,
Florida, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio and Illinois with
approximately 13,550 miles of pipeline.

Loews Hotels owns and/or operates 18
hotels, 16 of which are in the United States and two are in Canada.

The Corporate and other segment consists
primarily of corporate investment income, including investment gains (losses)
from non-insurance subsidiaries, equity earnings from shipping operations, as
well as corporate interest expenses and other corporate administrative
costs.

The accounting policies of the segments
are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting
policies. In addition, CNA does not maintain a distinct investment portfolio for
each of its insurance segments, and accordingly, allocation of assets to each
segment is not performed. Therefore, net investment income and investment gains
(losses) are allocated based on each segment’s carried insurance reserves, as
adjusted.

The following schedules present the
Company’s consolidating balance sheet information at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
and consolidating statements of income information for the years ended December
31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. These schedules present the individual subsidiaries of
the Company and their contribution to the consolidated financial statements.
Amounts presented will not necessarily be the same as those in the individual
financial statements of the Company’s subsidiaries due to adjustments for
purchase accounting, income taxes and minority interests. In addition, many of
the Company’s subsidiaries use a classified balance sheet which also leads to
differences in amounts reported for certain line items. This information also
does not reflect the impact of the Company’s issuance of Carolina Group stock.
Lorillard is reported as a 100% owned subsidiary and does not include any
adjustments relating to the tracking stock structure. See Note 6 for
consolidating information of the Carolina Group and Loews Group.

The Corporate and Other column primarily
reflects the parent company’s investment in its subsidiaries, invested cash
portfolio and corporate long term debt. The elimination adjustments are for
intercompany assets and liabilities, interest and dividends, the parent
company’s investment in capital stocks of subsidiaries, and various reclasses of
debit or credit balances to the amounts in consolidation. Purchase accounting
adjustments have been pushed down to the appropriate
subsidiary.

including this report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a
timely basis. These disclosure controls and procedures include controls and
procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the
Company under the federal securities laws is accumulated and communicated to the
Company’s management on a timely basis to allow decisions regarding required

officer (“CEO”) and principal financial officer (“CFO”) undertook an evaluation
of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this

of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007.

report are included on pages 70 and 71 under the captions entitled “Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting” and “Report of Independent

There were no other changes in the
