Summary




PART I

Item 1. Business.

Loews Corporation was incorporated in 1969 and is a holding company. Our subsidiaries are engaged in the following lines of
business:

•

commercial property and casualty insurance (CNA Financial Corporation, a 89% owned subsidiary);

•

operation of offshore oil and gas drilling rigs (Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc., a 53% owned subsidiary);

•

transportation and storage of natural gas and natural gas liquids (Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP, a 51%
owned subsidiary);

•

operation of a chain of hotels (Loews Hotels Holding Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary); and

•

manufacture of rigid plastic packaging solutions (Consolidated Container Company LLC, a 99% owned subsidiary).

Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this Report to “Loews Corporation,”
“the Company,” “Parent Company,” “we,” “our,” “us” or like terms refer to the business of Loews Corporation excluding its subsidiaries.

On May 22, 2017, we completed the acquisition of CCC Acquisition Holdings, Inc. for $1.2 billion, subject to
post-closing adjustments. CCC Acquisition Holdings, Inc., through its wholly owned subsidiary, Consolidated Container Company LLC (“Consolidated Container”), is a rigid plastic packaging and recycled resins manufacturer that provides
packaging solutions to end markets such as beverage, food and household chemicals through a network of manufacturing locations across North America. The acquisition was funded with approximately $620 million of Parent Company cash and debt
financing proceeds at Consolidated Container of $600 million. For further information about this acquisition, see Notes 2 and 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

We have five reportable segments comprised of CNA Financial Corporation, Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc., Boardwalk Pipeline
Partners, LP, Loews Hotels Holding Corporation and the Corporate segment. The operations of Consolidated Container since the acquisition date are included in the Corporate segment. Each of our operating subsidiaries is headed by a chief executive
officer who is responsible for the operation of its business and has the duties and authority commensurate with that position. Additional financial information on each of our segments is included under Item 7, Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”).

CNA FINANCIAL CORPORATION

CNA Financial Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “CNA”) is an insurance holding company.
CNA’s property and casualty and remaining life and group insurance operations are primarily conducted by Continental Casualty Company (“CCC”), The Continental Insurance Company, Western Surety Company, CNA Insurance Company
Limited and Hardy Underwriting Bermuda Limited and its subsidiaries (“Hardy”). CNA accounted for 69.8%, 71.6% and 67.8% of our consolidated total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

CNA’s insurance products primarily include commercial property and casualty coverages, including surety. CNA’s
services include warranty, risk management, information services, and claims administration. CNA’s products and services are primarily marketed through independent agents, brokers and managing general underwriters to a wide variety of
customers, including small, medium and large businesses, insurance companies, associations, professionals and other groups.



Property and Casualty Operations

CNA’s commercial property and casualty insurance operations (“Property and Casualty Operations”) includes its
Specialty, Commercial and International lines of business.

Specialty

Specialty provides management and professional liability and other coverages through property and casualty products and
services using a network of brokers, independent agencies and managing general underwriters. Specialty includes the following business groups:

Management

& Professional Liability

: Management & Professional Liability provides
management and professional liability insurance and risk management services and other specialized property and casualty coverages. This group provides professional liability coverages to various professional firms, including architects, real estate
agents, accounting firms, law firms and other professional firms. Management & Professional Liability also provides directors and officers (“D&O”), employment practices, fiduciary and fidelity coverages. Specific areas of
focus include small and

mid-size

firms, public as well as privately held firms and

not-for-profit

organizations, where tailored
products for these client segments are offered. Products within Management & Professional Liability are distributed through brokers, independent agents and managing general underwriters. Management & Professional Liability also
offers insurance products to serve the health care industry. Products include professional and general liability as well as associated standard property and casualty coverages, and are distributed on a national basis through brokers, independent
agents and managing general underwriters. Key customer groups include aging services, allied medical facilities, life sciences, dentists, physicians, hospitals and nurses and other medical practitioners.

Surety

: Surety offers small, medium and large contract and commercial surety and fidelity bonds. Surety provides
surety and fidelity bonds in all 50 states through a network of independent agencies and brokers.

Warranty and
Alternative Risks

:

Warranty and Alternative Risks provides extended service contracts and related products that provide protection from the financial burden associated with mechanical breakdown and other related losses, primarily for
vehicles and cell phones.

Commercial

Commercial works with a network of brokers and independent agents to market a broad range of property and casualty insurance
products and services to small, middle-market and large businesses. Property products include standard and excess property, marine and boiler and machinery coverages. Casualty products include standard casualty insurance products such as
workers’ compensation, general and product liability, commercial auto and umbrella coverages. Most insurance programs are provided on a guaranteed cost basis; however, CNA also offers specialized loss-sensitive insurance programs and total risk
management services relating to claim and information services to the large commercial insurance marketplace. These property and casualty

products are offered through CNA’s Middle Market, Small Business and Other Commercial insurance
groups.

International

International provides property and casualty insurance and specialty coverages through a network of brokers, independent
agencies and managing general underwriters, on a global basis through its operations in Canada, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), Continental Europe and Singapore as well as through its presence at Lloyd’s of London
(“Lloyd’s”). The International business is grouped into broad business units which include Energy & Marine, Property, Casualty, Specialty and Healthcare & Technology, and is managed across three underwriting
platforms from Head Offices in London and Toronto.



Property and Casualty Structure

CNA’s Property and Casualty Operations field structure consists of 49 underwriting locations across the United States
(“U.S.”). In addition, there are five centralized processing operations which handle policy processing, billing and collection activities and also act as call centers to optimize service. CNA’s claim presence consists of six primary
locations where it handles multiple claim types and key business functions. Additionally, claim maintains regional offices which are aligned with CNA’s underwriting field structure. CNA also has a presence in Canada, Europe and Singapore
consisting of 17 branch operations and access to business placed at Lloyd’s through Hardy Syndicate 382.

Other Insurance Operations

Other

Competition:

The property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive both as to rate and
service. CNA competes with a large number of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities for both distributors and customers. Insurers compete on the basis of factors including products, price, services, ratings and financial strength.
Accordingly, CNA must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve its insurance products and services.

There
are approximately 2,600 individual companies that sell property and casualty insurance in the United States. Based on 2016 statutory net written premiums, CNA is the eighth largest commercial insurer in the United States of America.

Regulation:

The insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision. Regulatory
oversight by applicable agencies is exercised through review of submitted filings and information, examinations (both financial and market conduct), direct inquiries and interviews. Each domestic and foreign jurisdiction has established supervisory
agencies with broad administrative powers relative to licensing insurers and agents, approving policy forms, establishing reserve requirements, prescribing the form and content of statutory financial reports and regulating capital adequacy and the
type, quality and amount of investments permitted. Such regulatory powers also extend to governance requirements and risk assessment practices and disclosures and premium rate regulations requiring rates not to be excessive, inadequate or unfairly
discriminatory. In addition to regulation of dividends by insurance subsidiaries, intercompany transfers of assets may be subject to prior notice or



approval by insurance regulators, depending on the size of such transfers and payments in relation to the financial position of the insurance subsidiaries making the transfer or payment.

Domestic insurers are also required by state insurance regulators to provide coverage to certain insureds who would not
otherwise be considered eligible by the insurers. Each state dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks. CNA’s share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function
of its respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each state.

Further, domestic insurance companies
are subject to state guaranty fund and other insurance-related assessments. Guaranty funds are governed by state insurance guaranty associations which levy assessments to meet the funding needs of insolvent insurer estates. Other insurance-related
assessments are generally levied by state agencies to fund various organizations including disaster relief funds, rating bureaus, insurance departments, and workers’ compensation second injury funds, or by industry organizations that assist in
the statistical analysis and ratemaking process and CNA has the ability to recoup certain of these assessments from policyholders.

As CNA’s insurance operations are conducted in a multitude of both domestic and foreign jurisdictions, CNA is subject to
a number of regulatory agency requirements applicable to a portion, or all, of its operations. These include, but are not limited to, the State of Illinois Department of Insurance (which is CNA’s global group-wide supervisor), the U.K.
Prudential Regulatory Authority and Financial Conduct Authority, the Bermuda Monetary Authority and the Office of Superintendent of Financial Institutions in Canada.

Hardy, a specialized Lloyd’s underwriter, is also supervised by the Council of Lloyd’s, which is the franchisor for
all Lloyd’s operations. The Council of Lloyd’s has wide discretionary powers to regulate Lloyd’s underwriting, such as establishing the capital requirements for syndicate participation. In addition, the annual business plans of each
syndicate are subject to the review and approval of the Lloyd’s Franchise Board, which is responsible for business planning and monitoring for all syndicates.

Capital adequacy and risk management regulations, referred to as Solvency II, apply to CNA’s European operations and are
enacted by the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union (“E.U.”). Additionally, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (“IAIS”) continues to consider regulatory proposals addressing group
supervision, capital requirements and enterprise risk management. The U.S. Federal Reserve, the U.S. Federal Insurance Office and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) are working with other global regulators to
define such proposals. It is not currently clear to what extent the IAIS activities will affect CNA as any final proposal would ultimately need to be legislated or regulated by each individual country or state.

However, there have been definitive developments recently with respect to prudential insurance supervision. On
September 22, 2017, the U.S. Treasury Department, the U.S. Trade Representative (“USTR”) and the E.U. announced they had formally signed a covered agreement on Prudential Measures Regarding Insurance and Reinsurance (“Covered
Agreement”). The Covered Agreement requires U.S. states to prospectively eliminate the requirement that domestic insurance companies must obtain collateral from reinsurance companies that are not licensed in their state (“alien
reinsurers”) in order to obtain reserve credit under statutory accounting. In exchange, the E.U. will not impose local presence requirements on U.S. firms operating in the E.U., and effectively must defer to U.S. group capital regulation for
these firms. The Treasury Department and USTR also released a U.S. policy statement clarifying their interpretation of the Covered Agreement in several key areas, including capital, group supervision and reinsurance.

Because the Covered Agreement is not self-executing, U.S. state laws will need to be revised to change reinsurance collateral
requirements to conform to the Covered Agreement. Before any such revision to state laws can be advanced, the NAIC must develop a new approach for determination of the appropriate reserve credit under statutory accounting for E.U.-based alien
reinsurers. In addition, the NAIC is currently developing an approach to group capital regulation as the current U.S. regulatory regime is based on legal entity regulation. Both the reinsurance collateral requirement change and adoption of group
capital regulation must be affected by the states within five years from the signing of the Covered Agreement, or states risk federal preemption. CNA will monitor the modification of state laws and regulations in order to comply with the provisions
of the Covered Agreement and assess its potential effects on the operations and prospects of CNA.



Although the U.S. federal government does not currently directly regulate the
business of insurance, federal legislative and regulatory initiatives can affect the insurance industry. These initiatives and legislation include proposals relating to potential federal oversight of certain insurers; terrorism and natural
catastrophe exposures; cybersecurity risk management; federal financial services reforms; and certain tax reforms.

The
Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 provides for a federal government backstop for insured terrorism risks through 2020. The mitigating effect of such law is part of the analysis of CNA’s overall risk posture for
terrorism and, accordingly, its risk positioning may change if such law were modified.

CNA also continues to invest in
the security network of its systems on an enterprise-wide basis, especially considering the implications of data and privacy breaches. This requires an investment of a significant amount of resources by CNA on an ongoing basis. Potential
implications of possible cybersecurity legislation on such current investment, if any, are uncertain.

The foregoing laws
and proposals, either separately or in the aggregate, create a regulatory and legal environment that may require changes in CNA’s business plan or significant investment of resources in order to operate in an effective and compliant manner.

Additionally, various legislative and regulatory efforts to reform the tort liability system have, and will continue to,
affect CNA’s industry. Although there has been some tort reform with positive impact to the insurance industry, new causes of action and theories of damages continue to be proposed in court actions and by federal and state legislatures that
continue to expand liability for insurers and their policyholders.

Properties:

CNA’s principal
executive offices are based in Chicago, Illinois. CNA’s subsidiaries maintain office space in various cities throughout the United States and various countries. CNA leases all of its office space.

DIAMOND OFFSHORE DRILLING, INC.

Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “Diamond Offshore”) provides contract drilling
services to the energy industry around the world with a fleet of 17 offshore drilling rigs consisting of four drillships and seven ultra-deepwater, four deepwater and two

mid-water

semisubmersible rigs.
Diamond Offshore accounted for 10.9%, 12.1% and 18.1% of our consolidated total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

A floater rig is a type of mobile offshore drilling rig that floats and does not rest on the seafloor. This asset class
includes self-propelled drillships and semisubmersible rigs. Semisubmersible rigs are comprised of an upper working and living deck resting on vertical columns connected to lower hull members. Such rigs operate in a “semi-submerged”
position, remaining afloat, off bottom, in a position in which the lower hull is approximately 55 feet to 90 feet below the water line and the upper deck protrudes well above the surface. Semisubmersibles hold position while drilling by use of a
series of small propulsion units or thrusters that provide dynamic positioning (“DP”) to keep the rig on location, or with anchors tethered to the seabed. Although DP semisubmersibles are self-propelled, such rigs may be moved long
distances with the assistance of tug boats.

Non-DP,

or moored, semisubmersibles require tug boats or the use of a heavy lift vessel to move between locations.

A drillship is an adaptation of a maritime vessel that is designed and constructed to carry out drilling operations by means
of a substructure with a moon pool centrally located in the hull. Drillships are typically self-propelled and are positioned over a drillsite through the use of a DP system similar to those used on semisubmersible rigs.



Diamond Offshore’s fleet can be further categorized based on the nominal
water depth for each class of rig as follows:

Category

Rated Water Depth (a) (in feet)

Number of Units in Fleet

Ultra-Deepwater

7,501    to    12,000


Deepwater

5,000    to      7,500


Mid-Water

400    to      4,999


(a)

Rated water depth for semisubmersibles and drillships reflects the maximum water depth in which a floating rig
has been designed to operate. However, individual rigs are capable of drilling, or have drilled, in marginally greater water depths depending on various conditions (such as salinity of the ocean, weather and sea conditions).

Fleet Enhancements and Additions:

Diamond Offshore’s long-term strategy is to upgrade its fleet to meet
customer demand for advanced, efficient and high-tech rigs by acquiring or building new rigs when possible to do so at attractive prices. Diamond Offshore’s most recent fleet enhancement cycle was completed in 2016 with the delivery of the

Ocean GreatWhite

.

Diamond Offshore continues to evaluate further rig acquisition and enhancement opportunities as
they arise. However, Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance whether, or to what extent, it will continue to make rig acquisitions or enhancements to its fleet.

Pressure Control by the Hour:

In 2016, Diamond Offshore entered into a

ten-year

collaborative arrangement with a subsidiary of GE Oil & Gas (“GE”) to monitor the blowout preventer equipment and proactively manage the maintenance, certification and reliability
of such equipment on its rigs. In connection with the services agreement with GE, Diamond Offshore sold the equipment to a GE affiliate and leased back such equipment under four separate

ten-year

operating
leases.

Markets:

The principal markets for Diamond Offshore’s contract drilling services are:

•

the Gulf of Mexico, including the U.S. and Mexico;

•

South America, principally offshore Brazil and Trinidad and Tobago;

•

Australia and Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam;

•

Europe, principally offshore the U.K. and Norway;

•

East and West Africa;

•

the Mediterranean; and

•

the Middle East.

Diamond Offshore actively markets its rigs worldwide.

Drilling Contracts:

Diamond Offshore’s contracts to provide offshore drilling services vary in their terms
and provisions. Diamond Offshore typically obtains its contracts through a competitive bid process, although it is not unusual for Diamond Offshore to be awarded drilling contracts following direct negotiations. Drilling contracts generally provide
for a basic dayrate regardless of whether or not drilling results in a productive well. Drilling contracts generally also provide for reductions in rates during periods when the rig is being moved or when drilling operations are interrupted or
restricted by equipment breakdowns, adverse weather conditions or other circumstances. Under dayrate contracts, Diamond Offshore generally pays the operating expenses of the rig, including wages and the cost of incidental supplies. Historically,
dayrate contracts have accounted for the majority of Diamond Offshore’s revenues. In addition, from time to time, Diamond Offshore’s dayrate contracts may also provide for the ability to earn an incentive bonus from its customer based upon
performance.



The duration of a dayrate drilling contract is generally tied to the time
required to drill a single well or a group of wells, which Diamond Offshore refers to as a

well-to-well

contract, or a fixed period of time, in what Diamond Offshore
refers to as a term contract. Many drilling contracts may be terminated by the customer in the event the drilling rig is destroyed or lost or if drilling operations are suspended for an extended period of time as a result of a breakdown of equipment
or, in some cases, due to events beyond the control of either party to the contract. Certain of Diamond Offshore’s contracts also permit the customer to terminate the contract early by giving notice; in most circumstances, this requires the
payment of an early termination fee by the customer. The contract term in many instances may also be extended by the customer exercising options for the drilling of additional wells or for an additional length of time, generally at competitive
market rates and mutually agreeable terms at the time of the extension. In periods of decreasing demand for offshore rigs, drilling contractors may prefer longer term contracts to preserve dayrates at existing levels and ensure utilization, while
customers may prefer shorter contracts that allow them to more quickly obtain the benefit of declining dayrates. Moreover, drilling contractors may accept lower dayrates in a declining market in order to obtain longer-term contracts and add backlog.

Customers:

Diamond Offshore provides offshore drilling services to a customer base that includes major and
independent oil and gas companies and government-owned oil companies. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, Diamond Offshore performed services for 14, 18 and 19 different customers. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, Anadarko accounted for 25%, 22%, and 12% of
Diamond Offshore’s annual total consolidated revenues and Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. accounted for 19%, 18%, and 24% of Diamond Offshore’s annual total consolidated revenues. During 2017, Hess Corporation and BP each accounted for 16%
of Diamond Offshore’s annual consolidated revenues. During 2015, ExxonMobil accounted for 12% of Diamond Offshore’s annual consolidated revenues. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of Diamond Offshore’s annual total
consolidated revenues during 2017, 2016 or 2015.

As of January 1, 2018, Diamond Offshore’s contract backlog was
$2.4 billion attributable to 13 customers. All four of its drillships are currently contracted to work in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (“GOM”). As of January 1, 2018, contract backlog attributable to Diamond Offshore’s expected
operations in the GOM was $653 million, $554 million and $86 million for the years 2018, 2019 and 2020, all of which was attributable to two customers.

Competition

:

Based on industry data as of the date of this Report, there are approximately 800 mobile
drilling rigs in service worldwide, including approximately 260 floater rigs. Despite consolidation in previous years, the offshore contract drilling industry remains highly competitive with numerous industry participants, none of which at the
present time has a dominant market share. Some of Diamond Offshore’s competitors may have greater financial or other resources than it does.

Drilling contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis. Price is typically the primary factor in determining
which qualified contractor is awarded a job. Customers may also consider rig availability and location, a drilling contractor’s operational and safety performance record, and condition and suitability of equipment. Diamond Offshore believes it
competes favorably with respect to these factors.

Diamond Offshore competes on a worldwide basis, but competition may
vary significantly by region at any particular time. Competition for offshore rigs generally takes place on a global basis, as these rigs are highly mobile and may be moved, although at a cost that may be substantial, from one region to another. It
is characteristic of the offshore drilling industry to move rigs from areas of low utilization and dayrates to areas of greater activity and relatively higher dayrates. The current oversupply of offshore drilling rigs also intensifies price
competition.

Governmental Regulation

:

Diamond Offshore’s operations are subject to numerous
international, foreign, U.S., state and local laws and regulations that relate directly or indirectly to its operations, including regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment, requiring removal and

clean-up

under some circumstances, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, and may include laws or regulations pertaining to climate change, carbon emissions or energy use.

Operations Outside the United States:

Diamond Offshore’s operations outside the U.S. accounted for
approximately 58%, 66% and 79% of its total consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.



Properties:

Diamond Offshore owns an office building in Houston,
Texas, where its corporate headquarters are located, and offices and other facilities in New Iberia, Louisiana, Aberdeen, Scotland, Macae, Brazil and Ciudad del Carmen, Mexico. Additionally, Diamond Offshore currently leases various office,
warehouse and storage facilities in Australia, Louisiana, Malaysia, Singapore and the U.K. to support its offshore drilling operations.

BOARDWALK PIPELINE PARTNERS, LP

Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP (together with its subsidiaries, “Boardwalk Pipeline”) is engaged in the business of
natural gas and natural gas liquids and hydrocarbons (herein referred to together as “NGLs”) transportation and storage. Boardwalk Pipeline accounted for 9.6%, 10.0% and 9.3% of our consolidated total revenue for the years ended
December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

We own approximately 51% of Boardwalk Pipeline comprised of 125,586,133 common
units and a 2% general partner interest. A wholly owned subsidiary of ours, Boardwalk Pipelines Holding Corp. (“BPHC”) is the general partner and also holds all of Boardwalk Pipeline’s incentive distribution rights which entitle the
general partner to an increasing percentage of the cash that is distributed by Boardwalk Pipeline in excess of $0.4025 per unit per quarter.

Boardwalk Pipeline owns and operates approximately 13,880 miles of interconnected natural gas pipelines directly serving
customers in 13 states and indirectly serving customers throughout the northeastern and southeastern U.S. through numerous interconnections with unaffiliated pipelines. Boardwalk Pipeline also owns and operates approximately 455 miles of NGL
pipelines in Louisiana and Texas. In 2017, its pipeline systems transported approximately 2.3 trillion cubic feet (“Tcf”) of natural gas and approximately 64.7 million barrels (“MMBbls”) of NGLs. Average daily throughput on
Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas pipeline systems during 2017 was approximately 6.4 billion cubic feet (“Bcf”). Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas storage facilities are comprised of 14 underground storage fields located in
four states with aggregate working gas capacity of approximately 205.0 Bcf and Boardwalk Pipeline’s NGL storage facilities consist of nine salt dome storage caverns located in Louisiana with an aggregate storage capacity of approximately 24.5
MMBbls. Boardwalk Pipeline also owns three salt dome caverns and related brine infrastructure for use in providing brine supply services and to support the NGL storage operations.

Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipeline and storage systems are described below:

The Gulf South pipeline system runs approximately 7,275 miles along the Gulf Coast in the states of Texas, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. The pipeline system has a

peak-day

delivery capacity of 8.3 Bcf per day and average daily throughput for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 2.8 Bcf per day. Gulf South
has ten natural gas storage facilities. The two natural gas storage facilities located in Louisiana and Mississippi have approximately 83.5 Bcf of working gas storage capacity and the eight salt dome natural gas storage caverns in Mississippi have
approximately 46.0 Bcf of total storage capacity, of which approximately 29.6 Bcf is working gas capacity. Gulf South also owns undeveloped land which is suitable for up to five additional storage caverns.

The Texas Gas pipeline system runs approximately 5,980 miles and is located in Louisiana, East Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi,
Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana and Ohio with smaller diameter lines extending into Illinois. The pipeline system has a

peak-day

delivery capacity of 5.6 Bcf per day and average daily throughput for the year
ended December 31, 2017 was 2.4 Bcf per day. Texas Gas owns nine natural gas storage fields with 84.3 Bcf of working gas storage capacity.

The Gulf Crossing pipeline system is located in Texas and runs approximately 375 miles into Louisiana. The pipeline system has
a

peak-day

delivery capacity of 1.9 Bcf per day and average daily throughput for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 1.1 Bcf per day.

Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream and Boardwalk Petrochemical Pipeline (collectively “Louisiana Midstream”) provide
transportation and storage services for natural gas, NGLs and ethylene, fractionation services for NGLs and brine supply services. These assets provide approximately 78.0 MMBbls of salt dome storage capacity, including approximately 7.6 Bcf of
working natural gas storage capacity, significant brine supply infrastructure, and approximately 290 miles of pipeline assets. Louisiana Midstream owns and operates the Evangeline Pipeline (“Evangeline”), which is an approximately 180 mile
interstate ethylene pipeline that is capable of transporting



approximately 2.6 billion pounds of ethylene per year between Texas and Louisiana, where it interconnects with its ethylene distribution system. Throughput for Louisiana Midstream was 64.7
MMBbls for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Boardwalk Texas Intrastate, LLC (“Texas Intrastate”) provides
intrastate natural gas transportation services on approximately 235 miles of pipeline located in South Texas. Texas Intrastate is situated to provide access to industrial and liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) export markets, proposed power
plants and third-party pipelines for exports to Mexico.

Boardwalk Pipeline has been engaged in several growth projects.
Several of these growth projects were placed into service in 2016, including the Ohio to Louisiana Access, the Southern Indiana Lateral and the Western Kentucky Market Lateral projects and a power plant project in South Texas. In 2017, the Northern
Supply Access Project and portions of the Coastal Bend Header and Sulphur Storage and Pipeline Expansion projects were placed into service. In 2018, Boardwalk Pipeline signed a precedent agreement for a new project on its Gulf South system that will
serve a proposed power plant in Texas. The project will provide approximately 0.2 Bcf/d of firm transportation service by adding compression at an existing compressor station and constructing a lateral. The cost of this project is expected to be
approximately $100 million and has a proposed

in-service

date in 2020. This project remains subject to customary approvals. See Liquidity and Capital Resources – Subsidiaries for further discussion
of capital expenditures and financing.

Customers:

Boardwalk Pipeline serves a broad mix of customers,
including producers of natural gas, and with

end-use

customers, including local distribution companies, marketers, electric power generators, industrial users and interstate and intrastate pipelines who, in
turn, provide transportation and storage services for

end-users.

These customers are located throughout the Gulf Coast, Midwest and Northeast regions of the U.S.

Competition:

Boardwalk Pipeline competes with numerous other pipelines that provide transportation, storage
and other services at many locations along its pipeline systems. Boardwalk Pipeline also competes with pipelines that are attached to natural gas supply sources that are closer to some of its traditional natural gas market areas. In addition,
regulators’ continuing efforts to increase competition in the natural gas industry have increased the natural gas transportation options of Boardwalk Pipeline’s traditional customers. For example, as a result of regulators’ policies,
capacity segmentation and capacity release have created an active secondary market which increasingly competes with Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas pipeline services. Further, natural gas competes with other forms of energy available to
Boardwalk Pipeline’s customers, including electricity, coal, fuel oils and alternative fuel sources.

The principal
elements of competition among pipelines are availability of capacity, rates, terms of service, access to gas supplies, flexibility and reliability of service. In many cases, the elements of competition, in particular, flexibility, terms of service
and reliability, are key differentiating factors between competitors. This is especially the case with capacity being sold on a longer term basis. Boardwalk Pipeline is focused on finding opportunities to enhance its competitive profile in these
areas by increasing the flexibility of its pipeline systems, such as modifying them to allow for

bi-directional

flows, to meet the demands of customers, such as power generators and industrial users, and is
continually reviewing its services and terms of service to offer customers enhanced service options.

Seasonality:

Boardwalk Pipeline’s revenues can be affected by weather, natural gas price levels, gas
price differentials between locations on its pipeline systems (basis spreads), gas price differentials between time periods, such as winter to summer (time period price spreads) and natural gas price volatility. Weather impacts natural gas demand
for heating needs and power generation, which in turn influences the short term value of transportation and storage across Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipeline systems. Colder than normal winters can result in an increase in the demand for natural gas
for heating needs and warmer than normal summers can impact cooling needs, both of which typically result in increased pipeline transportation revenues and throughput. While traditionally peak demand for natural gas occurs during the winter months
driven by heating needs, the increased use of natural gas for cooling needs during the summer months has partially reduced the seasonality of revenues. In 2017, approximately 53% of Boardwalk Pipeline’s operating revenues were recognized in the
first and fourth quarters of the year.

Governmental Regulation:

The Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (“FERC”) regulates Boardwalk Pipeline’s interstate natural gas operating subsidiaries under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (“NGPA”). The FERC regulates, among other things, the
rates and charges for the transportation and



storage of natural gas in interstate commerce and the extension, enlargement or abandonment of facilities under its jurisdiction. Where required, Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas pipeline
subsidiaries hold certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by the FERC covering certain of their facilities, activities and services. The maximum rates that may be charged by Boardwalk Pipeline’s subsidiaries operating under the
FERC’s jurisdiction, for all aspects of the natural gas transportation services they provide, are established through the FERC’s

cost-of-service

rate-making
process. Key determinants in the FERC’s

cost-of-service

rate-making process are the costs of providing service, the volumes of gas being transported, the rate
design, the allocation of costs between services, the capital structure and the rate of return a pipeline is permitted to earn. The maximum rates that may be charged by Boardwalk Pipeline for storage services on Texas Gas, with the exception of
services associated with a portion of the working gas capacity on that system, are also established through the FERC’s

cost-of-service

rate-making process. The FERC
has authorized Boardwalk Pipeline to charge market-based rates for its firm and interruptible storage services for the majority of its other natural gas storage facilities. None of Boardwalk Pipeline’s FERC-regulated entities has an obligation
to file a new rate case and Gulf South is prohibited from filing a rate case until May 1, 2023, subject to certain exceptions. Texas Intrastate transports natural gas in intrastate commerce under the rules and regulations established by the
Texas Railroad Commission and in interstate commerce that is subject to FERC jurisdiction under Section 311 of the NGPA. The maximum rates for services are established under Section 311 of the NGPA and are generally subject to review every
five years by the FERC.

Boardwalk Pipeline is also regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”)
through the Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended (“NGPSA”) and the Hazardous Liquids Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, as amended
(“HLPSA”). The NGPSA and HLPSA govern the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of interstate natural gas and NGL pipeline facilities. Boardwalk Pipeline has received authority from PHMSA to
operate certain natural gas pipeline assets under special permits that will allow it to operate those pipeline assets at higher than normal operating pressures of up to 0.80 of the pipe’s Specified Minimum Yield Strength (“SMYS”).
Operating at higher than normal operating pressures allows these pipelines to transport all of the existing natural gas volumes Boardwalk Pipeline has contracted for with its customers. PHMSA retains discretion whether to grant or maintain authority
for Boardwalk Pipeline to operate its natural gas pipeline assets at higher pressures and, in the event that PHSMA should elect not to allow Boardwalk Pipeline to operate at these higher pressures, it could affect its ability to transport all of its
contracted quantities of natural gas on these pipeline assets, and Boardwalk Pipeline could incur significant additional costs to reinstate this authority or to develop alternate ways to meet its contractual obligations. PHMSA has also developed
regulations that require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain high risk areas, known as high consequence areas (“HCAs”) along Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipelines
and take additional safety measures in the event of a release to protect pipeline segments located in those areas, which include highly populated areas. The NGPSA and HLPSA were amended by the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation
Act of 2011 (“2011 Act”). The 2011 Act increased the penalties for safety violations, established additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines and required studies of safety issues that could result in the adoption of new
regulatory requirements by PHMSA for existing pipelines. In June of 2016, the NGPSA and HLPSA were amended by the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 (“2016 Act”), extending PHMSA’s statutory
mandate through 2019 and, among other things, requiring PHMSA to complete certain of its outstanding mandates under the 2011 Act and developing new safety standards for natural gas storage facilities by June 22, 2018. The 2016 Act also empowers
PHMSA to address imminent hazards by imposing emergency restrictions, prohibitions and safety measures on owners and operators of gas or hazardous liquid pipeline facilities without prior notice or an opportunity for a hearing. PHMSA issued interim
final regulations in October of 2016 to implement the agency’s expanded authority to address unsafe pipeline conditions or practices that pose an imminent hazard to life, property, or the environment. New laws or regulations adopted by PHMSA
may impose more stringent requirements applicable to integrity management programs and other pipeline safety aspects of Boardwalk Pipeline’s operations, which could cause it to incur increased capital and operating costs and operational delays.

The Surface Transportation Board (“STB”), has authority to regulate the rates Boardwalk Pipeline charges for
service on certain of its ethylene pipelines, while the Louisiana Public Service Commission (“LPSC”) regulates the rates Boardwalk Pipeline charges for service on its other NGL pipelines. The STB and LPSC require that Boardwalk
Pipeline’s transportation rates are reasonable and that its practices cannot unreasonably discriminate among its shippers.



Boardwalk Pipeline’s operations are also subject to extensive federal,
state, and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment and occupational health and safety. Such laws and regulations impose, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation,
handling, use, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste and in connection with spills, releases, discharges and emissions of various substances into the environment. Environmental regulations also require
that Boardwalk Pipeline’s facilities, sites and other properties be operated, maintained, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities. Occupational health and safety regulations establish standards
protective of workers, both generally and within the pipeline industry.

Many states where Boardwalk Pipeline operates
also have, or are developing, similar environmental or occupational health and safety legal requirements governing many of the same types of activities and those requirements can be more stringent than those adopted under federal laws and
regulations. Failure to comply with these federal, state and local laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of corrective or remedial obligations, the occurrence of delays in
permitting or the development or expansion of projects and the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of Boardwalk Pipeline’s operations in the affected areas. Historically, Boardwalk Pipeline’s environmental compliance
costs have not had a material adverse effect on its business, but there can be no assurance that continued compliance with existing requirements will not materially affect them, or that the current regulatory standards will not become more onerous
in the future, resulting in more significant costs to maintain compliance or increased exposure to significant liabilities.

Properties:

Boardwalk Pipeline is headquartered in approximately 103,000 square feet of leased office space
located in Houston, Texas. Boardwalk Pipeline also leases approximately 60,000 square feet of office space in Owensboro, Kentucky. Boardwalk Pipeline’s operating subsidiaries own their respective pipeline systems in fee. However, substantial
portions of these systems are constructed and maintained on property owned by others pursuant to

rights-of-way,

easements, permits, licenses or consents.

Competition:

Competition from other hotels and lodging facilities is vigorous in all areas in which Loews
Hotels & Co operates. The demand for hotel rooms is seasonal and dependent on general and local economic conditions. Loews Hotels & Co properties also compete with facilities offering similar services in locations other than those
in which its hotels are located. Competition among luxury hotels is based primarily on quality of location, facilities and service. Competition among resort and commercial hotels is based on price and facilities as well as location and service.
Because of the competitive nature of the industry, hotels must continually make expenditures for updating, refurnishing and repairs and maintenance in order to prevent competitive obsolescence.



Recent Developments and Growth Projects:

•

In 2017, the sales and culmination of managing the Loews Don CeSar Hotel in St. Pete Beach, Florida and Loews
Madison Hotel in Washington, D.C., properties in which Loews Hotels & Co had manager and joint venture interests, were completed;

•

In 2017, Universal Orlando’s Cabana Bay Beach Resort completed a 400 guestroom expansion;

•

In 2018, Universal Orlando’s Aventura Hotel, a 600 guestroom hotel, is expected to open. As with Loews
Hotels & Co’s other properties at Universal Orlando, Loews Hotels & Co has a manager and 50% joint venture interest in this hotel;

•

In 2019, Live! By Loews in Arlington, Texas, an approximately 300 guestroom hotel in which Loews
Hotels & Co has a manager and joint venture interest, is expected to be completed;

•

In 2019 and 2020, two hotels to be named at Universal Orlando, with approximately 2,800 guestrooms, are
expected to open. As with Loews Hotels & Co’s other properties at Universal Orlando, Loews Hotels & Co has a manager and 50% joint venture interest in these hotels;

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Our business and the businesses of our subsidiaries face many risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties could
lead to events or circumstances that have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition or equity and/or the business, results of operations, financial condition or equity of one or more of our
subsidiaries. We have described below the most significant risks facing us and our subsidiaries. There may be additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we do not currently perceive to be as significant that may also impact our business or
the businesses of our subsidiaries.



You should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information included in
this Report and any subsequent reports we may file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the information we make available to the public before investing in any securities issued by us. Our subsidiaries, CNA Financial
Corporation, Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP, are public companies and file reports with the SEC. You are also cautioned to carefully review and consider the information contained in the reports filed by those
subsidiaries with the SEC and the information they make available to the public before investing in any of their securities.

Risks Related to Us and
Our Subsidiary, CNA Financial Corporation

If CNA determines that its recorded insurance reserves are insufficient to cover its estimated
ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, CNA may need to increase its insurance reserves which would result in a charge to CNA’s earnings.

CNA maintains insurance reserves to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses,
including the estimated cost of the claims adjudication process, for reported and unreported claims. Insurance reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex management estimates developed utilizing a variety of actuarial
reserve estimation techniques as of a given reporting date. The reserve estimation process involves a high degree of judgment and variability and is subject to a number of factors which are highly uncertain. These variables can be affected by both
changes in internal processes and external events. Key variables include claim severity, frequency of claims, mortality, morbidity, discount rates, inflation, claim handling policies and procedures, case reserving approach, underwriting and pricing
policies, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured event and the time of its ultimate settlement. Mortality is the relative incidence of death. Morbidity is the frequency and severity of
injury, illness, sickness and diseases contracted.

There is generally a higher degree of variability in estimating
required reserves for long-tail coverages, such as general liability and workers’ compensation, as they require a relatively longer period of time for claims to be reported and settled. The impact of changes in inflation and medical costs are
also more pronounced for long-tail coverages due to the longer settlement period.

CNA is also subject to the uncertain
effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as industry practices and legal, judicial, social, economic and other environmental conditions change. These issues have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on
CNA’s business by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims, resulting in further increases in CNA’s reserves. The effects of unforeseen emerging claim and coverage
issues are extremely difficult to predict.

Emerging or potential claim and coverage issues include, but are not limited
to, uncertainty in future medical costs in workers’ compensation. In particular, medical cost inflation could be greater than expected due to new treatments, drugs and devices; increased health care utilization; and/or the future costs of
health care facilities. In addition, the relationship between workers’ compensation and government and private health care providers could change, potentially shifting costs to workers’ compensation.

In light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making the judgments necessary to establish
reserve levels, CNA continually reviews and changes its reserve estimates in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops from the actual reporting and settlement of claims and as the legal, regulatory and economic environment evolves. If
CNA’s recorded reserves are insufficient for any reason, the required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient. These charges could be substantial.



CNA’s actual experience could vary from the key assumptions used to determine active life reserves for
long term care policies.

CNA’s active life reserves for long term care policies are based on CNA’s best
estimate assumptions as of December 31, 2015 due to an unlocking at that date. Key assumptions include morbidity, persistency (the percentage of policies remaining in force), discount rate and future premium rate increases. These assumptions,
which are critical bases for its reserve estimates are inherently uncertain. If actual experience varies from these assumptions or the future outlook for these assumptions changes, CNA may be required to increase its reserves. See the Long Term Care
Policyholder Reserves portion of the Insurance Reserves section of MD&A in Item 7 for more information.

Estimating
future experience for long term care policies is highly uncertain because the required projection period is very long and there is limited historical and industry data available to CNA, as only a small portion of the long term care policies which
have been written to date are in claims paying status. Morbidity and persistency trends, inclusive of mortality, can be volatile and may be negatively affected by many factors including, but not limited to, policyholder behavior, judicial decisions
regarding policy terms, socioeconomic factors, cost of care inflation, changes in health trends and advances in medical care.

A prolonged period during which interest rates remain at levels lower than those anticipated in CNA’s reserving would
result in shortfalls in investment income on assets supporting CNA’s obligations under long term care policies, which may require changes to its reserves. This risk is more significant for CNA’s long term care products because the long
potential duration of the policy obligations exceeds the duration of the supporting investment assets. Further, changes to the corporate tax code may also affect the rate at which CNA discounts its reserves. In addition, CNA may not receive
regulatory approval for the level of premium rate increases it requests. Any adverse deviation between the level of future premium rate increases approved and the level included in CNA’s reserving assumptions may require an increase to its
reserves.

If CNA’s estimated reserves are insufficient for any reason, including changes in assumptions, the
required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient. These charges could be substantial.

Catastrophe and systemic losses are unpredictable and could result in material losses.

Catastrophe losses are an inevitable part of CNA’s business. Various events can cause catastrophe losses. These events
can be natural or

man-made,

and may include hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, severe winter weather, fires, floods, riots, strikes, civil commotion, cyber attacks, pandemics and acts of terrorism. The
frequency and severity of these catastrophe events are inherently unpredictable. In addition, longer-term natural catastrophe trends may be changing and new types of catastrophe losses may be developing due to climate change, a phenomenon that has
been associated with extreme weather events linked to rising temperatures, and includes effects on global weather patterns, greenhouse gases, sea, land and air temperatures, sea levels, rain, hail and snow.

The extent of CNA’s losses from catastrophes is a function of the total amount of its insured exposures in the affected
areas, the frequency and severity of the events themselves, the level of reinsurance assumed and ceded, reinsurance reinstatement premiums and state residual market assessments, if any. It can take a long time for the ultimate cost of any
catastrophe losses to CNA to be finally determined, as a multitude of factors contribute to such costs, including evaluation of general liability and pollution exposures, infrastructure disruption, business interruption and reinsurance
collectibility. Reinsurance coverage for terrorism events is provided only in limited circumstances, especially in regard to “unconventional” terrorism acts, such as nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological attacks. As a result of the
items discussed above, catastrophe losses are particularly difficult to estimate. Additionally, catastrophic events could cause CNA to exhaust its available reinsurance limits and could adversely affect the cost and availability of reinsurance.

Claim frequency and severity for some lines of business can be correlated to an external factor such as economic activity,
financial market volatility, increasing health care costs or changes in the legal or regulatory environment. Claim frequency and severity can also be correlated to insureds’ use of common business practices, equipment, vendors or software. This
can result in multiple insured losses emanating out of the same underlying cause. In these instances, CNA may be subject to increased claim frequency and severity across multiple policies or lines of



business concurrently. While CNA does not define such systemic losses as catastrophes for financial reporting purposes, they are similar to catastrophes in terms of the uncertainty and potential
impact on its results.

CNA has exposure related to A&EP claims, which could result in material losses.

CNA’s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have exposures related to A&EP claims. CNA’s experience has
been that establishing claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for casualty coverages relating to A&EP claims is subject to uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims. Additionally, traditional actuarial methods and
techniques employed to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional property and casualty exposures are less precise in estimating claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for A&EP. As a result, estimating the ultimate cost of
both reported and unreported A&EP claims is subject to a higher degree of variability.

On August 31, 2010, CNA
completed a retroactive reinsurance transaction under which substantially all of its legacy A&EP liabilities were ceded to National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., subject to an aggregate limit of
$4.0 billion (“loss portfolio transfer” or “LPT”). The cumulative amount ceded under the loss portfolio transfer as of December 31, 2017 is $2.9 billion. If the other parties to the loss portfolio transfer do not
fully perform their obligations, net losses incurred on A&EP claims covered by the loss portfolio transfer exceed the aggregate limit of $4.0 billion or CNA determines it has exposures to A&EP claims not covered by the loss portfolio
transfer, CNA may need to increase its recorded net reserves which would result in a charge against earnings. These charges could be substantial. Additionally, if the A&EP claims exceed the limit of the loss portfolio transfer, CNA will need to
assess whether to purchase additional limit or to reassume claim handling responsibility for A&EP claims from an affiliate of NICO. Any additional reinsurance premium or future claim handling costs would also reduce CNA’s earnings.

CNA uses analytical models to assist its decision making in key areas such as pricing, reserving and capital modeling and may be adversely affected if
actual results differ materially from the model outputs and related analyses.

CNA uses various modeling
techniques and data analytics (e.g., scenarios, predictive, stochastic and/or forecasting) to analyze and estimate exposures, loss trends and other risks associated with its assets and liabilities. This includes both proprietary and third party
modeled outputs and related analyses to assist in decision-making related to underwriting, pricing, capital allocation, reserving, investing, reinsurance and catastrophe risk, among other things. CNA incorporates therein numerous assumptions and
forecasts about the future level and variability of policyholder behavior, loss frequency and severity, interest rates, equity markets, inflation, capital requirements, and currency exchange rates, among others. The modeled outputs and related
analyses from both proprietary and third parties are subject to various assumptions, uncertainties, model design errors and the inherent limitations of any statistical analysis, including those arising from the use of historical internal and
industry data and assumptions.

In addition, the effectiveness of any model can be degraded by operational risks
including, but not limited to, the improper use of the model, including input errors, data errors and human error. As a result, actual results may differ materially from CNA’s modeled results. The profitability and financial condition of CNA
substantially depends on the extent to which its actual experience is consistent with the assumptions CNA uses in its models and the ultimate model outputs. If, based upon these models or other factors, CNA misprices its products or fails to
appropriately estimate the risks it is exposed to, its business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity may be adversely affected.

CNA faces intense competition in its industry.

All aspects of the insurance industry are highly competitive and CNA must continuously allocate resources to refine and
improve its insurance products and services to remain competitive. CNA competes with a large number of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities, some of which may be larger or have greater financial or other resources than CNA does,
for both distributors and customers. This includes agents and brokers who may increasingly compete with CNA to the extent that they continue to have direct access to providers of capital seeking exposure to insurance risk. Insurers compete on the
basis of many factors, including products, price, services, ratings and financial strength. The competitor landscape has evolved substantially in recent years, with significant



consolidation and new market entrants, resulting in increased pressures on CNA’s ability to remain competitive, particularly in implementing pricing that is both attractive to CNA’s
customer base and risk appropriate to CNA.

The property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods
characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, resulting in less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards
and relatively high premium rates. During periods in which price competition is high, CNA may lose business to competitors offering competitive insurance products at lower prices. As a result, CNA’s premium levels and expense ratio could be
materially adversely impacted.

CNA markets its insurance products worldwide primarily through independent insurance
agents and insurance brokers, who also promote and distribute the products of CNA’s competitors. Any change in CNA’s relationships with its distribution network agents and brokers, including as a result of consolidation and their increased
promotion and distribution of CNA’s competitors’ products, could adversely affect CNA’s ability to sell its products. As a result, CNA’s business volume and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted.

CNA may be adversely affected by technological changes or disruptions in the insurance marketplace.

Technological changes in the way insurance transactions are completed in the marketplace, and CNA’s ability to react
effectively to such change, may present significant competitive risks. For example, more insurers are utilizing “big data” analytics to make underwriting and other decisions that impact product design and pricing. If such utilization is
more effective than how CNA uses similar data and information, CNA will be at a competitive disadvantage. There can be no assurance that CNA will continue to compete effectively with its industry peers due to technological changes; accordingly this
may have a material adverse effect on CNA’s business and results of operations.

In addition, agents and brokers,
technology companies or other third parties may create alternate distribution channels for commercial business that may adversely impact product differentiation and pricing. For example, they may create a digitally enabled distribution channel that
may adversely impact CNA’s competitive position. CNA’s efforts or the efforts of agents and brokers with respect to new products or alternate distribution channels, as well as changes in the way agents and brokers utilize greater levels of
data and technology, could adversely impact CNA’s business relationships with independent agents and brokers who currently market its products, resulting in a lower volume and/or profitability of business generated from these sources.

CNA may not be able to obtain sufficient reinsurance at a cost it deems acceptable, which could result in increased exposure to risk or a decrease in
CNA’s underwriting commitments.

CNA purchases reinsurance to help manage its exposure to risk. Under
CNA’s ceded reinsurance arrangements, another insurer assumes a specified portion of CNA’s exposure in exchange for a specified portion of policy premiums. Market conditions determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection
CNA purchases, which affects the level of its business and profitability, as well as the level and types of risk CNA retains. If CNA is unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance at a cost it deems acceptable, CNA may have increased exposure to risk.
Alternatively, CNA may be unwilling to bear the increased risk and would reduce the level of its underwriting commitments.

CNA may not be able to
collect amounts owed to it by reinsurers, which could result in higher net incurred losses.

CNA has significant
amounts recoverable from reinsurers which are reported as receivables on its balance sheets and are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefit reserves. The ceding of insurance does
not, however, discharge CNA’s primary liability for claims. As a result, CNA is subject to credit risk relating to its ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers. Certain of CNA’s reinsurance carriers have experienced credit downgrades
by rating agencies within the term of CNA’s contractual relationship, which indicates an increase in the likelihood that CNA will not be able to recover amounts due. In addition, reinsurers could dispute amounts which CNA believes are due to
it. If the amounts due from reinsurers that CNA is able to collect are less than the amount recorded by CNA with respect to such amounts due, its incurred losses will be higher.



CNA may not be able to collect amounts owed to it by policyholders who hold deductible policies and/or who
purchase retrospectively rated policies, which could result in higher net incurred losses.

A portion of
CNA’s business is written under deductible policies. Under these policies, CNA is obligated to pay the related insurance claims and is reimbursed by the policyholder to the extent of the deductible, which may be significant. Moreover, certain
policyholders purchase retrospectively rated workers’ compensation policies (i.e., policies in which premiums are adjusted after the policy period based on the actual loss experience of the policyholder during the policy period).
Retrospectively rated policies expose CNA to additional credit risk to the extent that the adjusted premium is greater than the original premium, which may be significant. As a result, CNA is exposed to policyholder credit risk. If the amounts due
from policyholders that CNA is able to collect are less than the amounts recorded with respect to such amounts due, CNA’s net incurred losses will be higher.

CNA may incur significant realized and unrealized investment losses and volatility in net investment income arising from changes in the financial
markets.

CNA’s investment portfolio is exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit spread,
issuer default, equity prices and foreign currency, which are unpredictable. Financial markets are highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions, monetary policies, tax policies, domestic and international geopolitical issues and many other
factors. Changes in financial markets including fluctuations in interest rates, credit, equity prices and foreign currency prices, and many other factors beyond CNA’s control can adversely affect the value of its investments, the realization of
investment income and the rate at which it discounts certain liabilities.

CNA has significant holdings in fixed income
investments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. A decline in interest rates may reduce the returns earned on new fixed income investments, thereby reducing CNA’s net investment income, while an increase in interest rates may reduce
the value of its existing fixed income investments. The value of CNA’s fixed income investments is also subject to risk that certain investments may default or become impaired due to deterioration in the financial condition of issuers of the
investments CNA holds or in the underlying collateral of the security. Any such impairments which CNA deems to be other-than-temporary would result in a charge to earnings.

In addition, CNA invests a portion of its assets in limited partnerships which are subject to greater market volatility than
its fixed income investments. Limited partnership investments generally provide a lower level of liquidity than fixed maturity or equity investments, which may also limit CNA’s ability to withdraw assets.

Further, CNA holds a portfolio of commercial mortgage loans. CNA is subject to risk related to the recoverability of loan
balances, which is influenced by declines in the estimated cash flows from underlying property leases, fair value of collateral and creditworthiness of tenants of the underlying properties, where lease payments directly service the loan. Collecting
amounts from borrowers that are less than the amounts recorded would result in a charge to earnings.

As a result of these
factors, CNA may not earn an adequate return on its investments, may be required to write down the value of its investments and may incur losses on the disposition of its investments.

Inability to detect and prevent significant employee or third party service provider misconduct or inadvertent errors and omissions could result in a
material adverse effect on CNA’s operations.

CNA may incur losses which arise from employees or third party
service providers engaging in intentional misconduct, fraud, errors and omissions, failure to comply with internal guidelines, including with respect to underwriting authority, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements. CNA’s controls
may not be able to detect all possible circumstances of employee and third party service provider

non-compliant

activity and the internal structures in place to prevent this activity may not be effective in
all cases. Any losses relating to such

non-compliant

activity could adversely affect CNA’s results of operations.



CNA is subject to capital adequacy requirements and, if it is unable to maintain or raise sufficient
capital to meet these requirements, regulatory agencies may restrict or prohibit CNA from operating its business.

Insurance companies such as CNA are subject to capital adequacy standards set by regulators to help identify companies that
merit further regulatory attention. These standards apply specified risk factors to various asset, premium and reserve components of CNA’s legal entity statutory basis of accounting financial statements. Current rules, including those
promulgated by insurance regulators and specialized markets such as Lloyd’s, require companies to maintain statutory capital and surplus at a specified minimum level determined using the applicable jurisdiction’s regulatory capital
adequacy formula. If CNA does not meet these minimum requirements, CNA may be restricted or prohibited from operating its business in the applicable jurisdictions and specialized markets. If CNA is required to record a material charge against
earnings in connection with a change in estimated insurance reserves, the occurrence of a catastrophic event or if it incurs significant losses related to its investment portfolio, which severely deteriorates its capital position, CNA may violate
these minimum capital adequacy requirements unless it is able to raise sufficient additional capital. CNA may be limited in its ability to raise significant amounts of capital on favorable terms or at all.

Globally, insurance regulators are working cooperatively to develop a common framework for the supervision of internationally
active insurance groups. Finalization and adoption of this framework could increase CNA’s prescribed capital requirement, the level at which regulatory scrutiny intensifies, as well as significantly increase its cost of regulatory compliance.

CNA’s insurance subsidiaries, upon whom CNA depends for dividends in order to fund its corporate obligations, are limited by insurance
regulators in their ability to pay dividends.

CNA is a holding company and is dependent upon dividends, loans and
other sources of cash from its subsidiaries in order to meet its obligations. Ordinary dividend payments or dividends that do not require prior approval by the insurance subsidiaries’ domiciliary insurance regulator are generally limited to
amounts determined by formulas that vary by jurisdiction. If CNA is restricted from paying or receiving intercompany dividends, by regulatory rule or otherwise, CNA may not be able to fund its corporate obligations and debt service requirements from
available cash. As a result, CNA would need to look to other sources of capital which may be more expensive or may not be available at all.

Rating
agencies may downgrade their ratings of CNA and thereby adversely affect its ability to write insurance at competitive rates or at all.

Ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. CNA’s insurance company
subsidiaries, as well as CNA’s public debt, are rated by rating agencies, including, A.M. Best Company (“A.M. Best”), Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and S&P Global Ratings (“S&P”).
Ratings reflect the rating agency’s opinions of an insurance company’s or insurance holding company’s financial strength, capital adequacy, enterprise risk management practices, operating performance, strategic position and ability to
meet its obligations to policyholders and debt holders.

The rating agencies may take action to lower CNA’s ratings
in the future as a result of any significant financial loss or possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies. The severity of the impact on CNA’s business is dependent on the level of downgrade and, for certain
products, which rating agency takes the rating action. Among the adverse effects in the event of such downgrades would be the inability to obtain a material volume of business from certain major insurance brokers, the inability to sell a material
volume of CNA’s insurance products to certain markets and the required collateralization of certain future payment obligations or reserves.

In addition, it is possible that a significant lowering of our corporate debt ratings by certain of the rating agencies could
result in an adverse affect on CNA’s ratings, independent of any change in CNA’s circumstances.



CNA is subject to extensive regulations that restrict its ability to do business and generate revenues.

The insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision. Most insurance
regulations are designed to protect the interests of CNA’s policyholders and third-party claimants rather than its investors. Each jurisdiction in which CNA does business has established supervisory agencies that regulate the manner in which
CNA conducts its business. Any changes in regulation could impose significant burdens on CNA. In addition, the Lloyd’s marketplace sets rules under which its members, including CNA’s Hardy syndicate, operate.

These rules and regulations relate to, among other things, the standards of solvency (including risk-based capital measures),
government-supported backstops for certain catastrophic events (including terrorism), investment restrictions, accounting and reporting methodology, establishment of reserves and potential assessments of funds to settle covered claims against
impaired, insolvent or failed private or quasi-governmental insurers.

Regulatory powers also extend to premium rate
regulations which require that rates not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. State jurisdictions ensure compliance with such regulations through market conduct exams, which may result in losses to the extent

non-compliance

is ascertained, either as a result of failure to document transactions properly or failure to comply with internal guidelines, or otherwise. CNA may also be required by the jurisdictions in which it
does business to provide coverage to persons who would not otherwise be considered eligible or restrict CNA from withdrawing from unprofitable lines of business or unprofitable market areas. Each jurisdiction dictates the types of insurance and the
level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks. CNA’s share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of its respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each jurisdiction.

The United Kingdom’s expected exit from the European Union is expected to increase the complexity and cost of regulatory compliance of CNA’s
European business.

In 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the E.U., commonly
referred to as “Brexit.” As a result of the referendum, in 2017 the British government formally commenced the process to leave the E.U. and began negotiating the terms of treaties that will govern the U.K.’s future relationship with
the E.U. Although the terms of any future treaties are unknown, CNA believes changes in its international operating platform will be required to allow CNA to continue to write business in the E.U. after the completion of Brexit. Therefore, CNA has
begun the process of establishing a new European subsidiary in Luxembourg. As a result of these changes, the complexity and cost of regulatory compliance of CNA’s European business is likely to increase.

Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.

The worldwide demand for Diamond Offshore’s drilling services has historically been dependent on the price of oil and has declined significantly as
a result of the decline in oil prices, and demand has continued to be depressed in 2017.

Demand for Diamond
Offshore’s drilling services depends in large part upon the oil and natural gas industry’s offshore exploration and production activity and expenditure levels, which are directly affected by oil and gas prices and market expectations of
potential changes in oil and gas prices. Commencing in the second half of 2014, oil prices declined significantly, resulting in a sharp decline in the demand for offshore drilling services, including services that Diamond Offshore provides, and
adversely affecting Diamond Offshore’s operations and cash flows in 2015, 2016 and 2017, compared to previous years. Any prolonged continuation of low oil prices would have a material adverse effect on many of Diamond Offshore’s customers
and, therefore, on demand for its services and on its business.

Oil prices have been, and are expected to continue to be,
volatile and are affected by numerous factors beyond Diamond Offshore’s control.



An increase in the price of oil and gas will not necessarily result in an
increase in offshore drilling activity or an increase in the market demand for Diamond Offshore’s rigs, although, historically, higher commodity prices have generally resulted in increases in offshore drilling projects. The timing of commitment
to offshore activity in a cycle depends on project deployment times, reserve replacement needs, availability of capital and alternative options for resource development. Timing can also be affected by availability, access to, and cost of equipment
to perform work.

Diamond Offshore’s business depends on the level of activity in the offshore oil and gas industry, which has been cyclical
and is significantly affected by many factors outside of its control.

Demand for Diamond Offshore’s drilling
services depends upon the level of offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production in markets worldwide, and those activities depend in large part on oil and gas prices, worldwide demand for oil and gas and a variety of political and
economic factors. The level of offshore drilling activity is adversely affected when operators reduce or defer new investment in offshore projects, reduce or suspend their drilling budgets or reallocate their drilling budgets away from offshore
drilling in favor of other priorities, such as shale or other land-based projects. As a result, Diamond Offshore’s business and the oil and gas industry in general are subject to cyclical fluctuations.

As a result of the cyclical fluctuations in the market, there have been periods of lower demand, excess rig supply and lower
dayrates, followed by periods of higher demand, shorter rig supply and higher dayrates. Diamond Offshore cannot predict the timing or duration of such fluctuations. Periods of lower demand or excess rig supply, which have occurred in the recent past
and are continuing, intensify the competition in the industry and often result in periods of lower utilization and lower dayrates. During these periods, Diamond Offshore’s rigs may not obtain contracts for future work and may be idle for long
periods of time or may be able to obtain work only under contracts with lower dayrates or less favorable terms. Additionally, prolonged periods of low utilization and dayrates could also result in the recognition of further impairment charges on
certain of Diamond Offshore’s drilling rigs if future cash flow estimates, based upon information available to management at the time, indicate that the carrying value of these rigs may not be recoverable.

Diamond Offshore’s industry is highly competitive, with oversupply and intense price competition.

The offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive with numerous industry participants. Some of Diamond
Offshore’s competitors may be larger companies, have larger or more technologically advanced fleets and have greater financial or other resources than it does. The drilling industry has experienced consolidation in the past and may experience
additional consolidation, which could create additional large competitors. Drilling contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis. Price is typically the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job.

New rig construction and upgrades of existing drilling rigs, cancelation or termination of drilling contracts and
established rigs coming off contract have contributed to the current oversupply of drilling rigs, intensifying price competition.

Diamond Offshore
can provide no assurance that its drilling contracts will not be terminated early or that its current backlog of contract drilling revenue will be ultimately realized.

Currently, Diamond Offshore’s customers may terminate their drilling contracts under certain circumstances, such as the
destruction or loss of a drilling rig or if Diamond Offshore suspends drilling operations for a specified period of time as a result of a breakdown of major equipment, excessive downtime for repairs, failure to meet minimum performance criteria
(including customer acceptance testing) or, in some cases, due to other events beyond the control of either party.

In
addition, some of Diamond Offshore’s drilling contracts permit the customer to terminate the contract after specified notice periods, often by tendering contractually specified termination amounts, which may not fully compensate Diamond
Offshore for the loss of the contract. During depressed market conditions, such as those currently in effect, certain customers have utilized such contract clauses to seek to renegotiate or terminate a drilling contract or claim that Diamond
Offshore has breached provisions of its drilling contracts in order to avoid their obligations to Diamond Offshore under circumstances where Diamond Offshore believes it is in compliance with the



contracts. Additionally, because of depressed commodity prices, restricted credit markets, economic downturns, changes in priorities or strategy or other factors beyond Diamond Offshore’s
control, a customer may no longer want or need a rig that is currently under contract or may be able to obtain a comparable rig at a lower dayrate. For these reasons, customers may seek to renegotiate the terms of Diamond Offshore’s existing
drilling contracts, terminate their contracts without justification or repudiate or otherwise fail to perform their obligations under the contracts. As a result of such contract renegotiations or terminations, Diamond Offshore’s contract
backlog may be adversely impacted, it might not recover any compensation (or any recovery it obtains may not fully compensate it for the loss of the contract) and it may be required to idle one or more rigs for an extended period of time.

Diamond Offshore may not be able to renew or replace expiring contracts for its rigs.

As of the date of this Report, all of Diamond Offshore’s current customer contracts will expire between 2018 and 2020.
Diamond Offshore’s ability to renew or replace expiring contracts or obtain new contracts, and the terms of any such contracts, will depend on various factors, including market conditions and the specific needs of its customers at such times.
Given the historically cyclical and highly competitive nature of the industry, Diamond Offshore may not be able to renew or replace the contracts or it may be required to renew or replace expiring contracts or obtain new contracts at dayrates that
are below, and likely substantially below, existing dayrates, or that have terms that are less favorable than existing contracts. Moreover, Diamond Offshore may be unable to secure contracts for these rigs. Failure to secure contracts for a rig may
result in a decision to cold stack the rig, which puts the rig at risk for impairment and may competitively disadvantage the rig as customers during the most recent market downturn have expressed a preference for ready or “hot” stacked
rigs over cold-stacked rigs.

Diamond Offshore’s contract drilling expense includes fixed costs that will not decline in proportion to
decreases in rig utilization and dayrates.

Diamond Offshore’s contract drilling expense includes all direct
and indirect costs associated with the operation, maintenance and support of its drilling equipment, which is often not affected by changes in dayrates and utilization. During periods of reduced revenue and/or activity, certain of Diamond
Offshore’s fixed costs will not decline and often it may incur additional operating costs, such as fuel and catering costs, for which it is generally reimbursed by the customer when a rig is under contract. During times of reduced utilization,
reductions in costs may not be immediate as Diamond Offshore may incur additional costs associated with cold stacking a rig (particularly if Diamond Offshore cold stacks a newer rig, such as a drillship or other DP semisubmersible rig, for which
cold stacking costs are typically substantially higher than for an older floater rig), or it may not be able to fully reduce the cost of its support operations in a particular geographic region due to the need to support the remaining drilling rigs
in that region. Accordingly, a decline in revenue due to lower dayrates and/or utilization may not be offset by a corresponding decrease in contract drilling expense.

Contracts for Diamond Offshore’s drilling rigs are generally fixed dayrate contracts, and increases in Diamond Offshore’s operating costs
could adversely affect the profitability of those contracts.

Diamond Offshore’s contracts for its drilling
rigs generally provide for the payment of an agreed dayrate per rig operating day, although some contracts do provide for a limited escalation in dayrate due to increased operating costs it incurs on the project. Many of Diamond Offshore’s
operating costs, such as labor costs, are unpredictable and may fluctuate based on events beyond its control. In addition, equipment repair and maintenance expenses vary depending on the type of activity the rig is performing, the age and condition
of the equipment and general market factors impacting relevant parts, components and services. The gross margin that Diamond Offshore realizes on these fixed dayrate contracts will fluctuate based on variations in its operating costs over the terms
of the contracts. In addition, for contracts with dayrate escalation clauses, Diamond Offshore may not be able to fully recover increased or unforeseen costs from its customers.

Diamond Offshore is subject to extensive domestic and international laws and regulations that could significantly limit its business activities and
revenues and increase its costs.

Certain countries are subject to restrictions, sanctions and embargoes imposed
by the United States government or other governmental or international authorities. These restrictions, sanctions and embargoes may prohibit or limit Diamond Offshore from participating in certain business activities in those countries. Diamond
Offshore’s



operations are also subject to numerous local, state and federal laws and regulations in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions concerning the containment and disposal of hazardous
materials, the remediation of contaminated properties and the protection of the environment. Laws and regulations protecting the environment have become increasingly stringent, and may in some cases impose “strict liability,” rendering a
person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of that person. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject Diamond Offshore to civil or criminal enforcement action, for which it may not
receive contractual indemnification or have insurance coverage, and could result in the issuance of injunctions restricting some or all of Diamond Offshore’s activities in the affected areas. Diamond Offshore may be required to make significant
expenditures for additional capital equipment or inspections and recertifications to comply with existing or new governmental laws and regulations. It is also possible that these laws and regulations may, in the future, add significantly to Diamond
Offshore’s operating costs or result in a reduction in revenues associated with downtime required to install such equipment, or may otherwise significantly limit drilling activity.

In addition, Diamond Offshore’s business is negatively impacted when it performs certain regulatory inspections, which
Diamond Offshore refers to as a special survey, that are due every five years for most of its rigs. The inspection interval for Diamond Offshore’s North Sea rigs is two and one half years. These special surveys are generally performed in a
shipyard and require scheduled downtime, which can negatively impact operating revenue. Operating expenses increase as a result of these special surveys due to the cost to mobilize the rigs to a shipyard, and inspection, repair and maintenance
costs. Repair and maintenance activities may result from the special survey or may have been previously planned to take place during this mandatory downtime. The number of rigs undergoing a special survey will vary from year to year, as well as from
quarter to quarter. Diamond Offshore’s business may also be negatively impacted by intermediate surveys, which are performed at interim periods between special surveys. Although an intermediate survey normally does not require shipyard time,
the survey may require some downtime for the rig. Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance as to the exact timing and/or duration of downtime associated with regulatory inspections, planned rig mobilizations and other shipyard projects.

In addition, the offshore drilling industry is dependent on demand for services from the oil and gas exploration industry and,
accordingly, can be affected by changes in tax and other laws relating to the energy business generally. Governments in some countries are increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of concessions, the exploration for oil and
gas and other aspects of the oil and gas industry. The modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations curtailing exploratory or developmental drilling for oil and gas for economic, environmental or other
reasons could limit drilling opportunities.

Diamond Offshore’s business involves numerous operating hazards which could expose it to
significant losses and significant damage claims. Diamond Offshore is not fully insured against all of these risks and its contractual indemnity provisions may not fully protect Diamond Offshore.

Diamond Offshore’s operations are subject to the significant hazards inherent in drilling for oil and gas offshore, such
as blowouts, reservoir damage, loss of production, loss of well control, unstable or faulty sea floor conditions, fires and natural disasters such as hurricanes. The occurrence of any of these types of events could result in the suspension of
drilling operations, damage to or destruction of the equipment involved and injury or death to rig personnel and damage to producing or potentially productive oil and gas formations, oil spillage, oil leaks, well blowouts and extensive uncontrolled
fires, any of which could cause significant environmental damage. In addition, offshore drilling operations are subject to marine hazards, including capsizing, grounding, collision and loss or damage from severe weather. Operations also may be
suspended because of machinery breakdowns, abnormal drilling conditions, failure of suppliers or subcontractors to perform or supply goods or services or personnel shortages. Any of the foregoing events could result in significant damage or loss to
Diamond Offshore’s properties and assets or the properties and assets of others, injury or death to rig personnel or others, significant loss of revenues and significant damage claims against Diamond Offshore.

Diamond Offshore’s drilling contracts with its customers provide for varying levels of indemnity and allocation of
liabilities between its customers and Diamond Offshore with respect to the hazards and risks inherent in, and damages or losses arising out of, its operations, and Diamond Offshore may not be fully protected. Diamond Offshore’s contracts are
individually negotiated, and the levels of indemnity and allocation of liabilities in them can vary from contract to contract depending on market conditions, particular customer requirements and other factors existing at the time a contract is
negotiated.



Additionally, the enforceability of indemnification provisions in Diamond
Offshore’s contracts may be limited or prohibited by applicable law or such provisions may not be enforced by courts having jurisdiction, and Diamond Offshore could be held liable for substantial losses or damages and for fines and penalties
imposed by regulatory authorities. The indemnification provisions in Diamond Offshore’s contracts may be subject to differing interpretations, and the laws or courts of certain jurisdictions may enforce such provisions while other laws or
courts may find them to be unenforceable. The law with respect to the enforceability of indemnities varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and is unsettled under certain laws that are applicable to Diamond Offshore’s contracts. There can be
no assurance that Diamond Offshore’s contracts with its customers, suppliers and subcontractors will fully protect it against all hazards and risks inherent in its operations. There can also be no assurance that those parties with contractual
obligations to indemnify Diamond Offshore will be financially able to do so or will otherwise honor their contractual obligations.

Diamond Offshore maintains liability insurance, which generally includes coverage for environmental damage; however, because
of contractual provisions and policy limits, Diamond Offshore’s insurance coverage may not adequately cover its losses and claim costs. In addition, certain risks and contingencies related to pollution, reservoir damage and environmental risks
are generally not fully insurable. Also, Diamond Offshore does not typically purchase

loss-of-hire

insurance to cover lost revenues when a rig is unable to work. There
can be no assurance that Diamond Offshore will continue to carry the insurance it currently maintains, that its insurance will cover all types of losses or that it will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates it considers to be
reasonable or that Diamond Offshore will be able to obtain insurance against some risks.

If an accident or other event
occurs that exceeds Diamond Offshore’s insurance coverage limits or is not an insurable event under its insurance policies, or is not fully covered by contractual indemnity, it could result in significant loss to Diamond Offshore.

Significant portions of Diamond Offshore’s operations are conducted outside the United States and involve additional risks not associated with
United States domestic operations.

Diamond Offshore’s operations outside the United States accounted for
approximately 58%, 66% and 79% of its total consolidated revenues for 2017, 2016 and 2015 and include, or have included, operations in South America, Australia and Southeast Asia, Europe, East and West Africa, the Mediterranean and Mexico. Because
Diamond Offshore operates in various regions throughout the world, it is exposed to a variety of risks inherent in international operations, including risks of war or conflicts, political and economic instability and disruption, civil disturbance,
acts of piracy, terrorism or other assaults on property or personnel, corruption, possible economic and legal sanctions (such as possible restrictions against countries that the U.S. government may consider to be state sponsors of terrorism),
changes in global monetary and trade policies, laws and regulations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, restrictions on currency exchange, controls over the repatriation of income or capital and other risks. Diamond Offshore may not have
insurance coverage for these risks, or it may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage for such events at reasonable rates. Diamond Offshore’s operations may become restricted, disrupted or prohibited in any country in which any of
these risks occur.

Diamond Offshore is also subject to the regulations of the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of
Foreign Assets Control and other U.S. laws and regulations governing its international operations in addition to domestic and international anti-bribery laws and sanctions, trade laws and regulations, customs laws and regulations and other
restrictions imposed by other governmental or international authorities. In addition, international contract drilling operations are subject to various laws and regulations in countries in which Diamond Offshore operates, including laws and
regulations relating to the equipping and operation of drilling rigs, import-export quotas or other trade barriers, repatriation of foreign earnings or capital, oil and gas exploration and development, local content requirements, taxation of
offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel and use and compensation of local employees and suppliers by foreign contractors.



Diamond Offshore’s consolidated effective income tax rate may vary substantially from one reporting
period to another.

Diamond Offshore’s consolidated effective income tax rate is impacted by the mix between its domestic and
international

pre-tax

earnings or losses, as well as the mix of the international tax jurisdictions in which it operates. Diamond Offshore cannot provide any assurances as to what its consolidated effective
income tax rate will be in the future due to, among other factors, uncertainty regarding the nature and extent of its business activities in any particular jurisdiction in the future and the tax laws of such jurisdictions, as well as potential
changes in U.S. and foreign tax laws, regulations or treaties or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, changes in the administrative practices and precedents of tax authorities or any reclassification or other matter (such as changes in
applicable accounting rules) that increases the amounts Diamond Offshore has provided for income taxes or deferred tax assets and liabilities in its consolidated financial statements. This variability may cause its consolidated effective income tax
rate to vary substantially from one reporting period to another.

Diamond Offshore may be required to accrue additional tax liability on certain of
its foreign earnings.

Certain of Diamond Offshore’s international rigs are owned and operated, directly or indirectly, by
Diamond Foreign Asset Company (“DFAC”), a Cayman Islands subsidiary that it owns. It is Diamond Offshore’s intention to continue to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of DFAC and its foreign subsidiaries to finance its foreign
activities. Diamond Offshore does not expect to provide for U.S. taxes on any earnings generated by DFAC and its foreign subsidiaries, except to the extent that these earnings are immediately subjected to U.S. federal income tax, such as under the
Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”). Should a future distribution be made from any unremitted earnings of this subsidiary, Diamond Offshore may be required to record additional U.S. income taxes and/or withholding taxes in certain
jurisdictions; however, it is not practical to estimate this potential liability.

Diamond Offshore’s debt levels may limit its liquidity and
flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities.

Diamond Offshore’s business is
highly capital intensive and dependent on having sufficient cash flow and/or available sources of financing in order to fund its capital expenditure requirements. As of December 31, 2017, Diamond Offshore had outstanding $2 billion of
senior notes, maturing at various times from 2023 through 2043. As of February 9, 2018, Diamond Offshore had no outstanding borrowings and $1.5 billion available under its revolving credit facility to meet its short term liquidity
requirements. Diamond Offshore may incur additional indebtedness in the future and borrow from time to time under its revolving credit facility to fund working capital or other needs, subject to compliance with its covenants.

Diamond Offshore’s ability to meet its debt service obligations is dependent upon its future performance, which is subject to general
economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting its operations, many of which are beyond its control. High levels of indebtedness could have negative consequences to Diamond Offshore, including:

•

it may have difficulty satisfying its obligations with respect to its outstanding debt;

•

it may have difficulty obtaining financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes;

•

it may need to use a substantial portion of available cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on its debt, which would reduce the amount of money available to fund working capital requirements, capital
expenditures, the payment of dividends and other general corporate or business activities;

•

vulnerability to the effects of general economic downturns, adverse industry conditions and adverse operating results could increase;

•

flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and in its industry in general could be limited;



•

it may not have the ability to pursue business opportunities that become available;

•

the amount of debt and the amount it must pay to service its debt obligations could place Diamond Offshore at
a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt;

•

customers may react adversely to its significant debt level and seek alternative service providers; and

•

failure to comply with the restrictive covenants in its debt instruments that, among other things, require
Diamond Offshore to maintain a specified ratio of its consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization and limit the ability of its subsidiaries to incur debt, could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could have a material
adverse effect on its business.

In addition, Diamond Offshore’s $1.5 billion revolving credit
facility matures on October 22, 2020, except for $40 million of commitments that mature on March 17, 2019 and $60 million of commitments that mature on October 22, 2019. Diamond Offshore’s ability to renew or replace
its revolving credit facility is dependent on numerous factors, including its financial condition and prospects at the time and the then current state of the bank and capital markets in the U.S. Diamond Offshore’s liquidity may be adversely
affected if it is unable to replace the revolving credit facility upon acceptable terms when it matures.

In July of 2017,
Moody’s downgraded Diamond Offshore’s corporate credit rating to Ba3 with a negative outlook from Ba2 with a stable outlook. In October of 2017, S&P downgraded Diamond Offshore’s corporate credit rating to B+ from

BB-

with a negative outlook. These credit ratings are below investment grade and could raise the cost of financing. As a consequence, Diamond Offshore may not be able to issue additional debt in amounts and/or with
terms that it considers to be reasonable.

Diamond Offshore’s revolving credit facility bears interest at variable
rates, based on its corporate credit rating and market interest rates. If market interest rates increase, Diamond Offshore’s cost to borrow under its revolving credit facility may also increase. Although Diamond Offshore may employ hedging
strategies such that a portion of the aggregate principal amount outstanding under this credit facility would effectively carry a fixed rate of interest, any hedging arrangement put in place may not offer complete protection from this risk.

Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP

Boardwalk Pipeline may not be able to replace expiring natural gas transportation contracts at attractive rates or on a long-term basis and may not be
able to sell short-term services at attractive rates or at all due to market conditions.

Each year, a portion of
Boardwalk Pipeline’s firm natural gas transportation contracts expire and need to be replaced or renewed. Over the past several years, as a result of current market conditions, Boardwalk Pipeline has renewed some expiring contracts at lower
rates or for shorter terms than in the past. In addition to normal contract expirations, in the 2018 to 2020 timeframe, transportation agreements associated with Boardwalk Pipeline’s Gulf South, Texas Gas and Gulf Crossing Pipeline expansion
projects, which were placed into service in 2008 and 2009, will expire. These projects were large, new pipeline expansions that were developed to serve growing production in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana and anchored primarily by

ten-year

firm transportation agreements with producers and priced based on then current market conditions. As the terms of these remaining expansion contracts expire in 2018 through 2020, Boardwalk Pipeline will
have significantly more transportation contract expirations than it has had during the past several years. If these contracts are renewed, Boardwalk Pipeline expects that the new contracts will be at lower rates and for shorter contract terms than
the contracts they are replacing. If these contracts are renewed at current market rates, the revenues earned from these transportation contracts would be materially lower than they are today. For a discussion of current developments, see the Firm
Transportation Agreements portion of the Results of Operations – Boardwalk Pipeline section of MD&A under Item 7.



The narrowing of the price differentials between natural gas supplies and market demand for natural gas has
reduced the transportation rates that Boardwalk Pipeline can charge.

The transportation rates Boardwalk Pipeline
is able to charge customers are heavily influenced by market trends (both short and longer term), including the available supply, geographical location of natural gas production, the competition between producing basins, competition with other
pipelines for supply and markets, the demand for gas by

end-users

such as power plants, petrochemical facilities and LNG export facilities and the price differentials between the gas supplies and the market
demand for the gas (basis differentials). Current market conditions have resulted in a sustained narrowing of basis differentials on certain portions of Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipeline system, which has reduced transportation rates that can be
charged in the affected areas and adversely affected the contract terms Boardwalk Pipeline can secure from its customers for available transportation capacity and for contracts being renewed or replaced. The prevailing market conditions may also
lead some of its customers to seek to renegotiate existing contracts to terms that are less attractive to Boardwalk Pipeline; for example, seeking a current price reduction in exchange for an extension of the contract term. Boardwalk Pipeline
expects these market conditions to continue.

Boardwalk Pipeline’s actual construction and development costs could exceed its forecasts, its
anticipated cash flow from construction and development projects will not be immediate and its construction and development projects may not be completed on time or at all.

Boardwalk Pipeline is engaged in multiple significant construction projects involving its existing assets and the construction
of new facilities for which it has expended or will expend significant capital. Boardwalk Pipeline expects to continue to engage in the construction of additional growth projects and modifications of its system. When Boardwalk Pipeline builds a new
pipeline or expands or modifies an existing facility, the design, construction and development occurs over an extended period of time, and it will not receive any revenue or cash flow from that project until after it is placed in service. Typically,
there are several years between when the project is announced and when customers begin using the new facilities. During this period, Boardwalk Pipeline spends capital and incurs costs without receiving any of the financial benefits associated with
the projects. The construction of new assets involves regulatory (federal, state and local), landowner opposition, environmental, activist, legal, political, materials and labor costs, as well as operational and other risks that are difficult to
predict and beyond Boardwalk Pipeline’s control. Any of these projects may not be completed on time or at all due to a variety of factors, may be impacted by significant cost overruns or may be materially changed prior to completion as a result
of developments or circumstances that Boardwalk Pipeline is not aware of when it commits to the project, including the inability of any shipper to provide adequate credit support or to otherwise perform their obligations under any precedent
agreements. Any of these events could result in material unexpected costs or have a material adverse effect on Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits from its growth projects.

Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas transportation and storage operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FERC, including rules and
regulations related to the rates it can charge for its services and its ability to construct or abandon facilities. Boardwalk Pipeline may not be able to recover the full cost of operating its pipelines, including earning a reasonable return.

Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas transportation and storage

operations are subject to
extensive regulation by the FERC, including the types and terms of services Boardwalk Pipeline may offer to its customers, construction of new facilities, creation, modification or abandonment of services or facilities and recordkeeping
and relationships with affiliated companies. An adverse FERC action in any of these areas could affect Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to compete for business, construct new facilities, offer new services or recover the full cost of operating
its pipelines. This regulatory oversight can result in longer lead times to develop and complete any future project than competitors that are not subject to the FERC’s regulations. The FERC can also deny Boardwalk Pipeline the right to abandon
certain facilities from service.

The FERC also regulates the rates Boardwalk Pipeline can charge for its natural gas
transportation and storage operations. For cost-based services, the FERC establishes both the maximum and minimum rates Boardwalk Pipeline can charge. The basic elements that the FERC considers are the costs of providing service, the volumes of gas
being transported, the rate design, the allocation of costs between services, the capital structure and the rate of return a pipeline is permitted to earn. The FERC has issued a notice of inquiry concerning the inclusion of income



taxes in the rates of an interstate pipeline that operates as a master limited partnership. The ultimate outcome of this proceeding could impact the maximum rates Boardwalk Pipeline can charge on
its FERC regulated pipelines. The FERC has not finalized this proceeding.

Enacted on December 22, 2017, the Tax Act
changed several provisions of the federal tax code, including a reduction in the maximum corporate tax rate. Since the Tax Act was signed into law, filings have been made at the FERC requesting that the FERC require pipelines to lower their
transportation rates to account for lower corporate taxes. Following the effective date of the law, the FERC orders granting certificates to construct proposed pipeline facilities have directed pipelines proposing new rates for service on those
facilities to

re-file

such rates so that the rates reflect the reduction in the corporate tax rate, and the FERC has issued data requests in pending certificate proceedings for proposed pipeline facilities
requesting pipelines to explain the impacts of the reduction in the corporate tax rate on the rate proposals in those proceedings and to provide

re-calculated

initial rates for service on the proposed pipeline
facilities. The FERC may enact other regulations or issue further requests to pipelines regarding the impact of the corporate tax rate change on the rates. The FERC’s establishment of a just and reasonable rate is based on many components, and
the reduction in the corporate tax rate may only impact two such components, the allowance for income taxes and the amount for accumulated deferred income taxes. The FERC or Boardwalk Pipeline’s shippers may challenge rates in the future, which
could result in a new rate that may be lower than the rates Boardwalk Pipeline currently charges. The FERC or Boardwalk Pipeline’s customers can challenge the existing rates on any of Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipelines. Such a challenge
against Boardwalk Pipeline could adversely affect its ability to charge rates that would cover future increases in its costs or even to continue to collect rates to maintain its current revenue levels that are designed to permit a reasonable
opportunity to recover current costs and depreciation and earn a reasonable return.

In December of 2017, the FERC
announced it will review its 1999 Policy Statement on Certification of New Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Facilities that is used in the determination of whether to grant certificates for new pipeline projects. Boardwalk Pipeline is unable to
predict what, if any, changes may be proposed that will affect its natural gas pipeline business or when such proposals, if any, might become effective. Boardwalk Pipeline does not expect that any change in this policy would affect it in a
materially different manner than any other natural gas pipeline company operating in the U.S.

Legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to
pipeline safety that require the use of new or more prescriptive compliance activities, substantial changes to existing integrity management programs or withdrawal of regulatory waivers could subject Boardwalk Pipeline to increased capital and
operating costs and operational delays.

Boardwalk Pipeline’s interstate pipelines are subject to regulation
by PHMSA, which is part of DOT. PHMSA regulates the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of existing interstate natural gas and NGLs pipeline facilities. PHMSA regulation currently requires pipeline
operators to implement integrity management programs, including frequent inspections, correction of certain identified anomalies and other measures to promote pipeline safety in HCAs, such as high population areas, areas unusually sensitive to
environmental damage and commercially navigable waterways. States have jurisdiction over certain of Boardwalk Pipeline’s intrastate pipelines and have adopted regulations similar to existing PHMSA regulations. State regulations may impose more
stringent requirements than found under federal law that affect Boardwalk Pipeline’s intrastate operations. Compliance with these rules over time generally has resulted in an overall increase in maintenance costs. The imposition of new or more
stringent pipeline safety rules applicable to natural gas or NGL pipelines, or any issuance or reinterpretation of guidance from PHMSA or any state agencies with respect thereto could cause Boardwalk Pipeline to install new or modified safety
controls, pursue additional capital projects or conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis, any or all of which tasks could result in Boardwalk Pipeline incurring increased capital and operating costs, experience operational delays, and
result in potential adverse impacts to its operations or ability to reliably serve its customers. Requirements that are imposed under the 2011 Act or the more recent 2016 Act may also increase Boardwalk Pipeline’s capital and operating costs or
impact the operation of its pipelines.

Boardwalk Pipeline has entered into certain firm transportation contracts with
shippers on certain of its expansion projects that utilize the design capacity of certain of its pipeline assets, based upon the authority Boardwalk Pipeline received from PHMSA to operate those pipelines under special permits at higher than normal
operating pressures of



up to 0.80 of the pipeline’s SMYS. PHMSA retains discretion to withdraw or modify this authority. If PHMSA were to withdraw or materially modify such authority, it could affect Boardwalk
Pipeline’s ability to transport all of its contracted quantities of natural gas on these pipeline assets and it could incur significant additional costs to reinstate this authority or to develop alternate ways to meet its contractual
obligations.

Boardwalk Pipeline is exposed to credit risk relating to default or bankruptcy by its customers.

Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from the default by a customer of its contractual obligations or the
customer filing bankruptcy. Boardwalk Pipeline has credit risk with both its existing customers and those supporting its growth projects.

Natural gas producers comprise a significant portion of Boardwalk Pipeline’s revenues and support several of its growth
projects, including those recently placed into service. In 2017, approximately 46% of Boardwalk Pipeline’s revenues were generated from contracts with natural gas producers. For existing customers on its interstate pipelines, FERC gas tariffs
limit the amount of credit support Boardwalk Pipeline can obtain. Over the past several years, the prices of oil and natural gas have been unstable. If oil and natural gas prices continue to remain unstable for a sustained period of time, Boardwalk
Pipeline’s producer customers will be adversely affected, which could lead some customers to default on their obligations to Boardwalk Pipeline or file for bankruptcy.

Credit risk also exists in relation to Boardwalk Pipeline’s growth projects, both because foundation customers make long
term firm capacity commitments to Boardwalk Pipeline for such projects and certain of those foundation customers agree to provide credit support as construction for such projects progresses. If a customer fails to post the required credit support
during the growth project process, overall returns on the project may be reduced to the extent an adjustment to the scope of the project results or Boardwalk Pipeline is unable to replace the defaulting customer.

Boardwalk Pipeline’s credit exposure also includes receivables for services provided, future performance under firm
agreements and volumes of gas owed by customers for imbalances or gas loaned by Boardwalk Pipeline to them under certain NNS and parking and lending (“PAL”) services.

Boardwalk Pipeline relies on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of its revenues.

For 2017, while no customer comprised 10% or more of its operating revenues, the top ten customers comprised approximately 41%
of revenues. If any of Boardwalk Pipeline’s significant customers have credit or financial problems which result in bankruptcy, a delay or failure to pay for services provided by Boardwalk Pipeline to post the required credit support for
construction associated with its growth projects or existing contracts or to repay the gas they owe Boardwalk Pipeline, it could have a material adverse effect on its business.

Changes in energy prices, including natural gas, oil and NGLs, impact the supply of and demand for those commodities, which impact Boardwalk
Pipeline’s business.

Boardwalk Pipeline’s customers, especially producers, are directly impacted by
changes in commodity prices. The prices of natural gas, oil and NGLs fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors. The declines in the levels of natural gas, oil and NGLs prices
experienced in recent history have adversely affected the businesses of Boardwalk Pipeline’s producer customers and reduced the demand for Boardwalk Pipeline’s services and could result in defaults or the

non-renewal

of Boardwalk Pipeline’s contracted capacity when existing contracts expire. Future increases in the price of natural gas and NGLs could make alternative energy and feedstock sources more
competitive and reduce demand for natural gas and NGLs. A reduced level of demand for natural gas and NGLs could reduce the utilization of capacity on Boardwalk Pipeline’s systems and reduce the demand of its services.

A significant portion of Boardwalk Pipeline’s debt will mature over the next five years and will need to be paid or refinanced and changes to the
debt and equity markets could adversely affect its business.

A significant portion of Boardwalk Pipeline’s
debt is set to mature in the next five years, including its revolving credit facility. Boardwalk Pipeline may not be able to refinance its maturing debt on commercially reasonable terms,



or at all, depending on numerous factors, including its financial condition and prospects at the time and the then current state of the banking and capital markets in the U.S.

Limited access to the debt and equity markets could adversely affect Boardwalk Pipeline’s business.

Boardwalk Pipeline’s current strategy is to fund its announced growth projects through currently available financing
options, including utilizing cash generated from operations, borrowings under its revolving credit facility, accessing proceeds from its subordinated loan agreement with a subsidiary of the Company and accessing the capital markets. Changes in the
debt and equity markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity, and interest rate volatility, may increase the cost of financing as well as the risks of refinancing maturing debt. Instability in the financial markets may increase Boardwalk
Pipeline’s cost of capital while reducing the availability of funds. This may affect its ability to raise capital and reduce the amount of cash available to fund its operations or growth projects. If the debt and equity markets were not
available, it is not certain if other adequate financing options would be available to Boardwalk Pipeline on terms and conditions that it would find acceptable.

Any disruption in the capital markets could require Boardwalk Pipeline to take additional measures to conserve cash until the
markets stabilize or until it can arrange alternative credit arrangements or other funding for its business needs. Such measures could include reducing or delaying business activities, reducing its operations to lower expenses and reducing other
discretionary uses of cash. Boardwalk Pipeline may be unable to execute its growth strategy or take advantage of certain business opportunities.

Boardwalk Pipeline does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities are located, which could result in disruptions to its operations.

Boardwalk Pipeline does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities have been constructed, and
Boardwalk Pipeline is subject to the possibility of more onerous terms and/or increased costs to retain necessary land use if it does not have valid

rights-of-way

or if
such

rights-of-way

lapse or terminate. Boardwalk Pipeline obtains the rights to construct and operate its pipelines on land owned by third parties and governmental
agencies for a specific period of time. Boardwalk Pipeline cannot guarantee that it will always be able to renew, when necessary, existing

rights-of-way

or obtain new

rights-of-way

without experiencing significant costs. Any loss of these rights with respect to Boardwalk Pipeline’s real property, through its inability to renew

right-of-way

contracts or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on its business.

Boardwalk Pipeline may not be successful in executing its strategy to grow and diversify its business.

Boardwalk Pipeline relies primarily on the revenues generated from its natural gas long-haul transportation and storage
services. Negative developments in these services have significantly greater impact on Boardwalk Pipeline’s financial condition and results of operations than if it maintained more diverse assets. Boardwalk Pipeline is pursuing a strategy of
growing and diversifying its business through acquisition and development of assets in complementary areas of the midstream energy sector, such as liquids transportation and storage assets. Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to grow, diversify and
increase distributable cash flows will depend, in part, on its ability to expand its existing business lines and to close and execute on accretive acquisitions. Boardwalk Pipeline may not be successful in acquiring or developing such assets or may
do so on terms that ultimately are not profitable. Any such transactions involve potential risks that may include, among other things:

•

the diversion of management’s and employees’ attention from other business concerns;

•

inaccurate assumptions about volume, revenues and project costs, including potential synergies;

•

a decrease in Boardwalk Pipeline’s liquidity as a result of using available cash or borrowing capacity to
finance the acquisition or project;

•

a significant increase in interest expense or financial leverage if it incurs additional debt to finance the
acquisition or project;

•

inaccurate assumptions about the overall costs of equity or debt;



•

an inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate the acquired business and
assets or the developed assets;

•

unforeseen difficulties operating in new product areas or new geographic areas; and

•

changes in regulatory requirements or delays of regulatory approvals.

Additionally, acquisitions also contain the following risks:

•

an inability to integrate successfully the businesses Boardwalk Pipeline acquires;

•

the assumption of unknown liabilities for which it is not indemnified, for which its indemnity is inadequate
or for which its insurance policies may exclude from coverage;

•

limitations on rights to indemnity from the seller; and

•

customer or key employee losses of an acquired business.

Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to replace expiring gas storage contracts at attractive rates or on a long-term basis and to sell short-term services
at attractive rates or at all are subject to market conditions.

Boardwalk Pipeline owns and operates substantial
natural gas storage facilities. The market for the storage and PAL services that it offers is impacted by the factors and market conditions discussed above for Boardwalk Pipeline’s transportation services, and is also impacted by natural gas
price differentials between time periods, such as winter to summer (time period price spreads), and the volatility in time period price spreads. When market conditions cause a narrowing of time period price spreads and a decline in the price
volatility of natural gas, these factors adversely impact the rates Boardwalk Pipeline can charge for its storage and PAL services.

Boardwalk
Pipeline’s operations are subject to catastrophic losses, operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which it may not be adequately insured.

There are a variety of operating risks inherent in transporting and storing natural gas, ethylene and NGLs, such as leaks and
other forms of releases, explosions, fires, cyber-attacks and mechanical problems, some of which could have catastrophic consequences. Additionally, the nature and location of Boardwalk Pipeline’s business may make it susceptible to
catastrophic losses from hurricanes or other named storms, particularly with regard to its assets in the Gulf Coast region, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, and severe winter weather. Any of these or other similar occurrences could result in the
disruption of Boardwalk Pipeline’s operations, substantial repair costs, personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of its operations and substantial financial losses. The location
of pipelines in HCAs, which includes populated areas, residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could significantly increase the level of damages resulting from some of these risks.

Boardwalk Pipeline currently possesses property, business interruption, cyber threat and general liability insurance, but
proceeds from such insurance coverage may not be adequate for all liabilities or expenses incurred or revenues lost. Moreover, such insurance may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable costs and terms. The insurance coverage
Boardwalk Pipeline does obtain may contain large deductibles or fail to cover certain events, hazards or all potential losses.

Climate change
legislation and regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) could result in increased operating and capital costs and reduced demand for Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipeline and storage services.

Climate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention. As a result, numerous proposals have been
made and are likely to continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of greenhouse gases. While no comprehensive climate change legislation



has been implemented at the federal level, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and states or groupings of states have pursued legal initiatives in recent years that seek to
reduce GHG emissions through efforts that include consideration of

cap-and-trade

programs, carbon taxes and GHG reporting and tracking programs and regulations that
directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources such as, for example, limitations on emissions of methane through equipment control and leak detection and repair requirements.

In particular, the EPA has adopted rules that, among other things, establish certain permit reviews for GHG emissions from
certain large stationary sources, which reviews could require securing permits at covered facilities emitting GHGs and meeting defined technological standards for those GHG emissions. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and
annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources in the U.S., including, among others, onshore processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities as well as gathering, compression and boosting
facilities and blowdowns of natural gas transmission pipelines.

Federal agencies also have begun directly regulating
emissions of methane, a GHG, from oil and natural gas operations. The adoption and implementation of any international, federal or state legislation or regulations that require reporting of GHGs or otherwise restrict emissions of GHGs could result
in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions.

Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, Loews Hotels Holding Corporation

Loews Hotels & Co’s business may be adversely affected by various operating risks common to the lodging industry, including competition,
excess supply and dependence on business travel and tourism.

Loews Hotels & Co owns and operates hotels
which have different economic characteristics than many other real estate assets. A typical office property, for example, has long-term leases with third-party tenants, which provide a relatively stable long-term stream of revenue. Hotels, on the
other hand, generate revenue from guests that typically stay at the hotel for only a few nights, which causes the room rate and occupancy levels at each hotel to change every day, and results in earnings that can be highly volatile.

In addition, Loews Hotels & Co’s properties are subject to various operating risks common to the lodging
industry, many of which are beyond Loews Hotels & Co’s control, including:

•

changes in general economic conditions, including the severity and duration of any downturn in the U.S. or
global economy and financial markets;

•

war, political conditions or civil unrest, terrorist activities or threats and heightened travel security
measures instituted in response to these events;

•

outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases;

•

natural or

man-made

disasters;

•

any material reduction or prolonged interruption of public utilities and services;

•

decreased corporate or government travel-related budgets and spending and cancellations, deferrals or
renegotiations of group business due to adverse economic conditions or otherwise;

•

decreased need for business-related travel due to innovations in business-related technology;

•

competition from other hotels and alternative accommodations, such as Airbnb, in the markets in which Loews
Hotels & Co operates;

•

requirements for periodic capital reinvestment to maintain and upgrade hotels;



•

increases in operating costs, including labor (including minimum wage increases), workers’ compensation,
benefits, insurance, food, energy and unanticipated costs resulting from force majeure events, due to inflation, new or different federal, state or local governmental regulations and other factors that may not be offset by increased room rates;

•

the costs and administrative burdens associated with compliance with applicable laws and regulations;

•

organized labor activities, which could cause a diversion of business from hotels involved in labor
negotiations and loss of business for Loews Hotels & Co’s properties generally as a result of certain labor tactics;

•

changes in the desirability of particular locations or travel patterns of customers, including with respect to
the underlying attractions supporting Loews Hotels & Co’s existing and under development immersive destination properties, such as the Universal theme park for its Orlando, Florida properties, the stadiums in Arlington, Texas and St.
Louis, Missouri for its Live! By Loews hotels and the convention center for its Kansas City Hotel, geographic concentration of its operations and customers and shortages of desirable locations for development; and

•

relationships with third-party property owners, developers, landlords and joint venture partners, including
the risk that owners and/or partners may terminate management or joint venture agreements.

These
factors, and the reputational repercussions of these factors, could adversely affect, and from time to time have adversely affected, individual hotels and hotels in particular regions.

Loews Hotels & Co is exposed to the risks resulting from significant investments in owned and leased real estate, which could increase its
costs, reduce its profits, limit its ability to respond to market conditions or restrict its growth strategy.

Loews Hotels & Co’s proportion of owned and leased properties, compared to the number of properties that it
manages for third-party owners, is larger than that of some of its competitors. Real estate ownership and leasing is subject to risks not applicable to managed or franchised properties, including:

•

real estate, insurance, zoning, tax, environmental and eminent domain laws;

•

the ongoing need for owner-funded capital improvements and expenditures to maintain or upgrade properties;

•

risks associated with mortgage debt, including the possibility of default, fluctuating interest rate levels
and the availability of replacement financing;

•

risks associated with the possibility that cost increases will outpace revenue increases and that, in the
event of an economic slowdown, a high proportion of fixed costs will make it difficult to reduce costs to the extent required to offset declining revenues;

•

risks associated with real estate leases, including the possibility of rent increases and the inability to
renew or extend upon favorable terms;

•

fluctuations in real estate values and potential impairments in the value of Loews Hotels & Co’s
assets; and

•

the relative illiquidity of real estate compared to some other assets.

The hospitality industry is subject to seasonal and cyclical volatility.

The hospitality industry is seasonal in nature. The periods during which Loews Hotels & Co’s properties
experience higher revenues vary from property to property, depending principally upon location and the consumer base served. Loews Hotels & Co generally expects revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each



of the three subsequent quarters. In addition, the hospitality industry is cyclical and demand generally follows the general economy on a lagged basis. The seasonality and cyclicality of its
industry may contribute to fluctuation in Loews Hotels & Co’s results of operations and financial condition.

Loews
Hotels & Co operates in a highly competitive industry, both for customers and for acquisitions and developments of new properties.

The lodging industry is highly competitive. Loews Hotels & Co’s properties compete with other hotels and
alternative accommodations based on a number of factors, including room rates, quality of accommodations, service levels and amenities, location, brand affiliation, reputation and reservation systems. New hotels may be constructed and these
additions to supply create new competitors, in some cases without corresponding increases in demand for hotel rooms. Some of its competitors also have greater financial and marketing resources than Loews Hotels & Co. In addition, travelers
can book stays on websites that facilitate the short-term rental of homes and apartments from owners, thereby providing an alternative to hotel rooms.

Loews Hotels & Co also competes for hotel acquisitions and development projects with entities that have similar
investment objectives as it does. This competition could limit the number of suitable investment opportunities. It may also increase the bargaining power of Loews Hotels & Co’s counterparties, making it more difficult for Loews
Hotels & Co to acquire or develop new properties on attractive terms or on the terms contemplated in its business plan.

Any deterioration in the quality or reputation of Loews Hotels & Co’s brands could have an adverse effect on its
reputation and business.

Loews Hotels & Co’s brands and its reputation are among its most important
assets. Its ability to attract and retain guests depends, in part, on the public recognition of its brands and their associated reputation. If its brands become obsolete or consumers view them as unfashionable or lacking in consistency and quality,
or its brands or reputation are otherwise harmed, Loews Hotels & Co may be unable to attract guests to its properties, and may further be unable to attract or retain joint venture partners or hotel owners.

Loews Hotels & Co’s efforts to develop new properties and renovate existing properties could be delayed or become more
expensive.

Loews Hotels & Co from time to time renovates its properties and is currently expanding its
portfolio through the

ground-up

construction of a number of new developments, including new properties in Orlando, Florida, Arlington, Texas, Kansas City, Missouri and St. Louis, Missouri and in the future may
similarly develop additional new properties. Often these projects are undertaken with joint venture partners. These efforts are subject to a number of risks, including:

•

construction delays or cost overruns (including labor and materials or unforeseeable site conditions) that may
increase project costs or cause new development projects to not be completed by lender imposed required completion dates;

•

obtaining zoning, occupancy and other required permits or authorizations;

•

changes in economic conditions that may result in weakened or lack of demand or negative project returns;

•

governmental restrictions on the size or kind of development;

•

force majeure events, including earthquakes, tornados, hurricanes or floods; and

•

design defects that could increase costs.

Additionally, developing new properties typically involves lengthy development periods during which significant amounts of
capital must be funded before the properties begin to operate and generate revenue. If the cost of funding new development exceeds budgeted amounts, and/or the time period for development is longer than initially



anticipated, Loews Hotels & Co’s profits could be reduced. Further, due to the lengthy development cycle, intervening adverse economic conditions in general and as they apply to
Loews Hotels & Co and its development partners may alter or impede the development plans, thereby resulting in incremental costs or potential impairment charges. In addition, using multiple sources of capital to develop new properties
reduces or eliminates the ability of Loews Hotels & Co to cease commenced projects if the overall economic environment conditions change. Moreover, during the early stages of operations, charges related to interest expense and depreciation
may substantially detract from, or even outweigh, the profitability of certain new property investments.

Loews Hotels & Co’s
properties are geographically concentrated, which exposes its business to the effects of regional events and occurrences.

Loews Hotels & Co has a concentration of hotels in Florida. Specifically, as of December 31, 2017, six hotels,
representing approximately 49% of rooms in its system, were located in Florida. The concentration of hotels in one region or a limited number of markets may expose Loews Hotels & Co to risks of adverse economic and other developments that
are greater than if its portfolio were more geographically diverse. These developments include regional economic downturns, a decline in the popularity of or access to area tourist attractions, such as theme parks, significant increases in the
number of Loews Hotels & Co’s competitors’ hotels in these markets and potentially higher local property, sales and income taxes in the geographic markets in which it is concentrated. In addition, Loews Hotels & Co’s
properties in Florida are subject to the effects of adverse acts of nature, such as hurricanes, strong winds and flooding, which have in the past caused damage to its hotels in Florida, which may in the future be intensified as a result of climate
change, as well as outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases.

The growth and use of alternative reservation channels adversely affects Loews
Hotels & Co’s business.

A significant percentage of hotel rooms for guests at Loews
Hotels & Co’s properties is booked through internet travel and other intermediaries. In most cases, Loews Hotels & Co has agreements with such intermediaries and pays them commissions and/or fees for sales of its rooms through
their systems. If such bookings increase, these intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions or fees, reduced room rates or other significant concessions from Loews Hotels & Co. There can be no assurance that Loews
Hotels & Co will be able to negotiate such agreements in the future with terms as favorable as those that exist today. Moreover, these intermediaries generally employ aggressive marketing strategies, including expending significant
resources for online and television advertising campaigns to drive consumers to their websites and other outlets. As a result, consumers may develop brand loyalties to the intermediaries’ offered brands, websites and reservations systems rather
than to Loews Hotels & Co’s brands.

Under certain circumstances, Loews Hotels & Co’s insurance coverage may not cover
all possible losses, and it may not be able to renew its insurance policies on favorable terms, or at all.

Although Loews Hotels & Co maintains various property, casualty and other insurance policies, proceeds from such
insurance coverage may not be adequate for all liabilities or expenses incurred or revenues lost. Moreover, such insurance may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable costs and terms. The insurance coverage Loews Hotels &
Co does obtain may contain large deductibles or fail to cover certain events, hazards or all potential losses.

Labor shortages could restrict Loews
Hotels & Co’s ability to operate its properties or grow its business or result in increased labor costs that could reduce its profits.

Loews Hotels & Co’s properties are staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week by thousands of employees. If it is
unable to attract, retain, train and engage skilled employees, its ability to manage and staff its properties adequately could be impaired, which could reduce customer satisfaction. Staffing shortages could also hinder its ability to grow and expand
its business. Because payroll costs are a major component of the operating expenses at its properties, a shortage of skilled labor could also require higher wages that would increase its labor costs.



Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, Consolidated Container Company LLC

Consolidated Container’s substantial indebtedness could affect its ability to meet its obligations and may otherwise restrict its activities.

Consolidated Container has a significant amount of indebtedness, which requires significant interest payments.
Its inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy its debt obligations, or to refinance its obligations on commercially reasonable terms, would have a material adverse effect on its business. Consolidated Container’s substantial
indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:

•

limit its ability to borrow money for its working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or
other corporate purposes;

•

increase its vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and

•

limit its ability to respond to business opportunities, including growing its business through acquisitions.

In addition, the credit agreements governing its current indebtedness contain, and any future debt
instruments would likely contain, financial and other restrictive covenants, which impose significant operating and financial restrictions on it. As a result of these covenants, Consolidated Container could be limited in the manner in which it
conducts its business and may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs. Furthermore, a failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or
waived, could have a material adverse effect on Consolidated Container.

Fluctuations in raw material prices and raw material availability may
affect Consolidated Container’s results.

To produce its products, Consolidated Container uses large
quantities of plastic resins and recycled plastic materials. It faces the risk that its access to these raw materials may be interrupted or that it may not be able to purchase these raw materials at prices that are acceptable to it. In general,
Consolidated Container does not have long-term supply contracts with its suppliers, and its purchases of raw materials are subject to market price volatility. Although Consolidated Container generally is able to pass changes in the prices of raw
materials through to its customers over a period of time, it may not always be able to do so or there may be a lag between when its costs increase and when it passes those costs through to its customers. It may not be able to pass through all future
raw material price increases in a timely manner or at all due to competitive pressures. In addition, a sustained increase in resin and recycled plastic prices, relative to alternative packaging materials, would make plastic containers less
economical for its customers and could result in a slower pace of conversions to, or reductions in the use of, plastic containers. Any limitation on its ability to procure its primary raw materials or to pass through price increases in such
materials on a timely basis could negatively affect Consolidated Container.

Consolidated Container’s customers may increase
their self-manufacturing.

Increased self-manufacturing by Consolidated Container’s customers may have a
material adverse impact on its sales volume and financial results. Consolidated Container believes that its customers may engage in self-manufacturing over time at locations where transportation costs are high, and where low complexity and available
space to install blow molding equipment exists.

Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiaries Generally

In addition to the specific risks and uncertainties faced by our subsidiaries, as discussed above, we and all of our
subsidiaries face additional risks and uncertainties described below.



Acts of terrorism could harm us and our subsidiaries.

Terrorist attacks and the continued threat of terrorism in the United States or abroad, the continuation or escalation of
existing armed hostilities or the outbreak of additional hostilities, including military and other action by the United States and its allies, could have a significant impact on us and the assets and businesses of our subsidiaries. CNA issues
coverages that are exposed to risk of loss from an act of terrorism. Terrorist acts or the threat of terrorism could also result in increased political, economic and financial market instability, a decline in energy consumption and volatility in the
price of oil and gas, which could affect the market for Diamond Offshore’s drilling services and Boardwalk Pipeline’s transportation and storage services. In addition, future terrorist attacks could lead to reductions in business travel
and tourism which could harm Loews Hotels. While our subsidiaries take steps that they believe are appropriate to secure their assets, there is no assurance that they can completely secure them against a terrorist attack or obtain adequate insurance
coverage for terrorist acts at reasonable rates.

Changes in tax laws, regulations or treaties, or the interpretation or enforcement thereof in
jurisdictions in which we or our subsidiaries operate could adversely impact us.

Changes in federal, state or
foreign tax laws, regulations or treaties applicable to us or our subsidiaries or changes in the interpretation or enforcement thereof could materially and adversely impact our and our subsidiaries’ tax liability, financial condition, results
of operations and cash flows, including the amount of cash our subsidiaries have available to distribute to their shareholders, including us. In particular, potential changes to tax laws relating to tax credits, the corporate tax rate or the
taxation of interest from municipal bonds (and thus the rate at which CNA discounts its long term care reserves), foreign earnings and publicly traded partnerships could have such material adverse effects.

Our subsidiaries face significant risks related to compliance with environmental laws.

Our subsidiaries have extensive obligations and financial exposure related to compliance with federal, state, local, foreign
and international environmental laws, including those relating to the discharge of substances into the environment, the disposal, removal or clean up of hazardous wastes and other activities relating to the protection of the environment. Many of
such laws have become increasingly stringent in recent years and may in some cases impose strict liability, which could be substantial, rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of that
person. For example, Diamond Offshore could be liable for damages and costs incurred in connection with oil spills related to its operations, including for conduct of or conditions caused by others. Boardwalk Pipeline is also subject to
environmental laws and regulations, including requiring the acquisition of permits or other approvals to conduct regulated activities, restricting the manner in which it disposes of waste, requiring remedial action to remove or mitigate
contamination resulting from a spill or other release and requiring capital expenditures to comply with pollution control requirements. Further, existing environmental laws or the interpretation or enforcement thereof may be amended and new laws may
be adopted in the future.

Failures or interruptions in or breaches to our or our subsidiaries’ computer systems could materially and adversely
affect our or our subsidiaries’ operations.

We and our subsidiaries are dependent upon information
technologies, computer systems and networks, including those maintained by us and our subsidiaries and those maintained and provided to us and our subsidiaries by third parties (for example,

“software-as-a-service”

and cloud solutions), to conduct operations and are reliant on technology to help increase efficiency in our and their businesses. We
and our subsidiaries are dependent upon operational and financial computer systems to process the data necessary to conduct almost all aspects of our and their businesses. Any failure of our or our subsidiaries’ computer systems, or those of
our or their customers, vendors or others with whom we and they do business, could materially disrupt business operations. Computer, telecommunications and other business facilities and systems could become unavailable or impaired from a variety of
causes, including storms and other natural disasters, terrorist attacks, fires, utility outages, theft, design defects, human error or complications encountered as existing systems are replaced or upgraded. In addition, it has been reported that
unknown entities or groups have mounted

so-called

“cyber attacks” on businesses and other organizations solely to disable or disrupt computer systems, disrupt operations and, in some cases, steal
data. In particular, the U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate energy assets may be specific targets of cyber attacks, which can have catastrophic consequences and there have also been reports that hotel chains, among



other consumer-facing businesses, have been subject to various cyber attacks targeting payment card and other sensitive consumer information. Breaches of our and our subsidiaries’ computer
security infrastructure can result from actions by our employees, vendors, third party administrators or by unknown third parties, and may disrupt our or their operations, cause damage to our or their assets and surrounding areas and impact our or
their data framework or cause a failure to protect personal information of customers or employees.

The foregoing risks
relating to disruption of service, interruption of operations and data loss could impact our and our subsidiaries’ ability to timely perform critical business functions, resulting in disruption or deterioration in our and our subsidiaries’
operations and business and expose us and our subsidiaries to monetary and reputational damages. In addition, potential exposures include substantially increased compliance costs and required computer system upgrades and security related
investments. The breach of confidential information also could give rise to legal liability and regulatory action under data protection and privacy laws and regulations, both in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.

Some of our subsidiaries’ customer bases are concentrated.

Some of our subsidiaries’ customer bases are concentrated. For instance, during 2017, two of Diamond Offshore’s
customers in the Gulf of Mexico and Diamond Offshore’s three largest customers accounted for 41% and an aggregate of 60% of its annual total consolidated revenues. In addition, the number of customers that it has performed services for declined
from 35 in 2014 to 14 in 2017. For Boardwalk Pipeline, while no customer comprised more than 10% or more of its operating revenues, its top ten customers comprised approximately 41% of its revenues during 2017. Consolidated Container also depends on
several large customers. The loss of or other problem with a significant customer could have a material adverse impact on these subsidiaries’ and our financial results.

Loss of key vendor relationships or issues relating to the transitioning of vendor relationships could result in a materially adverse effect on our and
our subsidiaries’ operations.

We and our subsidiaries rely on products, equipment and services provided by
many third party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers in the United States and abroad, which exposes us and them to volatility in the quality, price and availability of such items. These include, for example, vendors of computer hardware,
software and services, as well as other critical materials and services (including, in the case of CNA, claims administrators performing significant claims administration and adjudication functions). Certain products, equipment and services may be
available from a limited number of sources. If one or more key vendors becomes unable to continue to provide products, equipment or services at the requisite level for any reason, or fails to protect our proprietary information, including in some
cases personal information of employees, customers or hotel guests, we and our subsidiaries may experience a material adverse effect on our or their business, operations and reputation.

We could incur impairment charges related to the carrying value of the long-lived assets and goodwill of our subsidiaries.

Our subsidiaries regularly evaluate their long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Most notably, we could incur impairment charges related to the carrying value of offshore drilling equipment at Diamond Offshore, pipeline and storage assets at
Boardwalk Pipeline and hotel properties owned by Loews Hotels.

In particular, Diamond Offshore is currently experiencing
declining demand for certain offshore drilling rigs as a result of excess rig supply in the industry and depressed market conditions. As a result, Diamond Offshore may incur additional asset impairments, rig retirements and/or rigs being scrapped.

We also test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that a
potential impairment exists. Asset impairment evaluations by us and our subsidiaries with respect to both long-lived assets and goodwill are, by nature, highly subjective. The use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially
different carrying values of our assets which could impact the need to record an impairment charge and the amount of any charge taken.



We are a holding company and derive substantially all of our income and cash flow from our subsidiaries.

We rely upon our invested cash balances and distributions from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary
to meet our obligations and to declare and pay any dividends to holders of our common stock. Our subsidiaries are separate and independent legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to make funds available to us, whether in the
form of loans, dividends or otherwise. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to, among other things, the availability of sufficient earnings and funds in such subsidiaries, applicable state laws, including in the case of the
insurance subsidiaries of CNA, laws and rules governing the payment of dividends by regulated insurance companies, and their compliance with covenants in their respective loan agreements. Claims of creditors of our subsidiaries will generally have
priority as to the assets of such subsidiaries over our claims and those of our creditors and shareholders.

We and our subsidiaries face
competition for senior executives and qualified specialized talent.

We and our subsidiaries depend on the
services of our key personnel, who possess skills critical to the operation of our and their businesses. Our and our subsidiaries’ executive management teams are highly experienced and possess extensive skills in their relevant industries. The
ability to retain senior executives and to attract and retain highly skilled professionals and personnel with specialized industry and technical experience is important to our and our subsidiaries’ success and future growth. Competition for
this talent can be intense, and we and our subsidiaries may not be successful in our efforts. The unexpected loss of the services of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us and our subsidiaries and could hinder our and their ability
to effectively compete in the various industries in which we and they operate.

From time to time we and our subsidiaries are subject to litigation,
for which we and they may be unable to accurately assess the level of exposure and which if adversely determined, may have a significant adverse effect on our or their consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

We and our subsidiaries are or may become parties to legal proceedings and disputes. These matters may include, among others,
contract disputes, claims disputes, reinsurance disputes, personal injury claims, environmental claims or proceedings, asbestos and other toxic tort claims, intellectual property disputes, disputes related to employment and tax matters and other
litigation incidental to our or their businesses. Although our current assessment is that, other than as disclosed in this Report, there is no pending litigation that could have a significant adverse impact, it is difficult to predict the outcome or
effect of any litigation matters and if our assessment proves to be in error, then the outcome of litigation could have a significant impact on our financial statements.

We could have liability in the future for tobacco-related lawsuits.

As a result of our ownership of Lorillard, Inc. (“Lorillard”) prior to the separation of Lorillard from us in 2008
(the “Separation”), from time to time we have been named as a defendant in tobacco-related lawsuits and could be named as a defendant in additional tobacco-related suits, notwithstanding the completion of the Separation. In the Separation
Agreement entered into between us and Lorillard and its subsidiaries in connection with the Separation, Lorillard and each of its subsidiaries has agreed to indemnify us for liabilities related to Lorillard’s tobacco business, including
liabilities that we may incur for current and future tobacco-related litigation against us. While we do not believe that we have any liability for tobacco-related claims, and we have never been held liable for any such claims, an adverse decision in
a tobacco-related lawsuit against us could, if the indemnification is deemed for any reason to be unenforceable or any amounts owed to us thereunder are not collectible, in whole or in part, have a material adverse effect on us.

OVERVIEW

We are a holding company and have five reportable segments comprised of four individual operating subsidiaries, CNA Financial
Corporation (“CNA”), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (“Diamond Offshore”), Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP (“Boardwalk Pipeline”) and Loews Hotels Holding Corporation (“Loews Hotels & Co”); and the
Corporate segment. The operations of Consolidated Container Company LLC (“Consolidated Container”) since the acquisition date are included in the Corporate segment. Each of our operating subsidiaries is headed by a chief executive officer
who is responsible for the operation of its business and has the duties and authority commensurate with that position.

We
rely upon our invested cash balances and distributions from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations and to declare and pay any dividends to our shareholders. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends is
subject to, among other things, the availability of sufficient earnings and funds in such subsidiaries, applicable state laws, including in the case of the insurance subsidiaries of CNA, laws and rules governing the payment of dividends by regulated
insurance companies (see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8) and compliance with covenants in their respective loan agreements. Claims of creditors of our subsidiaries will generally have priority as to
the assets of such subsidiaries over our claims and those of our creditors and shareholders.

Unless the context otherwise
requires, references in this Report to “Loews Corporation,” “the Company,” “Parent Company,” “we,” “our,” “us” or like terms refer to the business of Loews Corporation excluding its
subsidiaries.

2017 Compared with 2016

Consolidated net income attributable to Loews Corporation for 2017 was $1.16 billion, or $3.45 per share, compared to
$654 million, or $1.93 per share, in 2016.

Net income for 2017 includes a significant net benefit of
$200 million, or $0.59 per share, resulting from the enactment on December 22, 2017 of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017, (the “Tax Act”). The net benefit primarily relates to the remeasurement of Loews’s net deferred tax
liability precipitated by the lowering of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Excluding the impact of the Tax Act, net income for 2017 would have been $964 million. For additional details on the Tax Act, see the subsidiary
discussions below.



Net income attributable to Loews in 2017 increased as compared to the prior year
partially due to the net benefit from the Tax Act discussed above. Absent this benefit, net income increased $310 million primarily from higher earnings at CNA, Loews Hotels & Co and Diamond Offshore. Net income for 2017 and 2016
included asset impairment charges at Diamond Offshore of $32 million and $267 million (both after tax and noncontrolling interests).

2016 Compared with 2015

Consolidated net income attributable to Loews Corporation for 2016 was $654 million, or $1.93 per share, compared to
$260 million, or $0.72 per share, in 2015.

Net income for 2016 included asset impairment charges of
$267 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) at Diamond Offshore. In 2015, net income included asset impairment charges at Diamond Offshore of $341 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) and a reserve charge of
$177 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) related to the long term care business at CNA.

Net income
attributable to Loews Corporation in 2016 increased compared to the prior year primarily due to the impact of the reserve charge at CNA in 2015 and the asset impairment charges at Diamond Offshore which were lower in 2016 compared to 2015. Absent
these charges, net income increased $143 million due to higher earnings at CNA and Boardwalk Pipeline and improved results from the Parent Company investment portfolio. These increases were partially offset by lower earnings at Diamond
Offshore.

2017 Compared with 2016

Net income increased $27 million in 2017 as compared with 2016 primarily due to improved

non-catastrophe

current accident year underwriting results, lower adverse prior year reserve development recorded under the 2010 asbestos and environmental pollution (“A&EP”) loss portfolio
transfer, higher net investment income and higher net realized investment results. These increases were partially offset by higher net catastrophe losses in 2017, and a loss of $24 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) on the early
redemption of debt in 2017. As a result of the Tax Act, CNA’s net deferred tax assets were remeasured as of the date of enactment, resulting in a

one-time

decrease to net income of $87 million
($78 million after noncontrolling interests).

2016 Compared with 2015

Net income increased $380 million in 2016 as compared with 2015, primarily as a result of a $305 million
($177 million after tax and noncontrolling interests) charge in 2015 related to increasing long term care active life and claim reserves. As the active life reserve assumptions were unlocked in 2015, long term care results in 2016 improved
significantly. Results in 2016 also reflect favorable net prior year development of $314 million as compared to $218 million recorded in 2015. Further information on net prior year development is included in Note 8 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. In addition, net investment income increased $148 million and investment results improved $133 million in 2016 as compared with 2015, driven by improved limited partnership investments and
fixed maturity securities income, lower other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) losses recognized in earnings and higher net realized investment gains on sales of securities. These increases were partially offset by an increase in the
current accident year loss ratio and higher underwriting expenses.

CNA’s Property & Casualty and Other Insurance Operations

CNA’s Property and Casualty Operations include its Specialty, Commercial and International lines of business. CNA’s
Other Insurance Operations outside of Property and Casualty Operations include its long term care business that is in

run-off,

certain corporate expenses, including interest on CNA’s corporate debt, and
certain property and casualty businesses in

run-off,

including CNA Re and A&EP. CNA’s products and services are primarily marketed through independent agents, brokers and managing general underwriters
to a wide variety of customers, including small, medium and large businesses, insurance companies, associations, professionals and other groups. We believe the presentation of CNA as one reportable segment is appropriate in accordance with
applicable accounting standards on segment reporting. However, for purposes of this discussion and analysis of the results of operations, we provide greater detail with respect to CNA’s Property and Casualty Operations and Other Insurance
Operations to enhance the reader’s understanding and to provide further transparency into key drivers of CNA’s financial results.

What we previously referred to as Net operating income (loss) for CNA in our public disclosures, is now called Core income
(loss). With this terminology change,

Non-Core

operations is now called Other Insurance Operations. The fourth quarter 2017 net deferred tax asset remeasurement was excluded from core income (loss) for the
year ended December 31, 2017. Otherwise, there were no changes to the calculation of this measure. In assessing CNA’s insurance operations, the Company utilizes the core income (loss) financial measure. Core income (loss) is calculated by
excluding from net income (loss) (i) net realized investment gains or losses, (ii) income or loss from discontinued operations, (iii) any cumulative effects of changes in accounting guidance and (iv) deferred tax asset and
liability remeasurement as a result of an enacted U.S. federal tax rate change. In addition, core income (loss) excludes the effects of noncontrolling interests. The calculation of core income (loss) excludes net realized investment gains or losses
because net realized investment gains or losses are generally driven by economic factors that are not necessarily consistent with key drivers of underwriting performance, and are therefore not considered an indication of trends in insurance
operations. Core income (loss) is deemed to be a

non-GAAP

financial measure and management believes this measure is useful to investors as management uses this measure to assess financial performance.

Property and Casualty Operations

In evaluating the results of the Property and Casualty Operations, CNA utilizes the loss ratio, the expense ratio, the
dividend ratio and the combined ratio. These ratios are calculated using GAAP financial results. The loss ratio is



the percentage of net incurred claim and claim adjustment expenses to net earned premiums. The expense ratio is the percentage of insurance underwriting and acquisition expenses, including the
amortization of deferred acquisition costs, to net earned premiums. The dividend ratio is the ratio of policyholders’ dividends incurred to net earned premiums. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss, expense and dividend ratios. In
addition, CNA also utilizes renewal premium change, rate, retention and new business in evaluating operating trends. Renewal premium change represents the estimated change in average premium on policies that renew, including rate and exposure
changes. Rate represents the average change in price on policies that renew excluding exposure changes. Retention represents the percentage of premium dollars renewed in comparison to the expiring premium dollars from policies available to renew.
Renewal premium change, rate and retention presented for the prior year are updated to reflect subsequent activity on policies written in the period. New business represents premiums from policies written with new customers and additional policies
written with existing customers.

The following tables summarize the results of CNA’s Property and Casualty
Operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

Includes Hardy new business of $151 million and $133 million for the years ended December 31,
2017 and 2016. Prior year amounts are not included for Hardy.

2017 Compared with 2016

Total net written premiums increased $92 million in 2017 as compared with 2016. Net written premiums for International
increased $60 million in 2017 as compared with 2016 due to higher new business, positive renewal premium change and higher retention. Excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rates and premium development, net written premiums for
International increased 6.7% in 2017. Net written premiums for Specialty were consistent with 2016. New business, renewal premium change and retention also remained at consistent levels for Specialty. Net written premiums for Commercial increased
$41 million in 2017 as compared with 2016, primarily driven by higher new business within Middle Markets, strong retention and positive renewal premium change. This was partially offset by an unfavorable premium rate adjustment within its Small
Business unit as discussed in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. The change in net earned premiums for Commercial and International was consistent with the trend in net written premiums.

Core income decreased $23 million in 2017 as compared with 2016. The decrease was due to lower favorable net prior year
loss reserve development and higher net catastrophe losses, partially offset by improved

non-catastrophe

current accident year underwriting results and higher net investment income. In addition, results
reflect the favorable period over period effect of foreign currency exchange. Net catastrophe losses were $259 million (after tax) in 2017 as compared to net catastrophe losses of $111 million (after tax) in 2016.

Favorable net prior year development of $302 million and $316 million was recorded in 2017 and 2016. In 2017 and
2016, Specialty recorded favorable net prior year development of $216 million and $305 million. Commercial recorded favorable net prior year development of $59 million as compared with unfavorable net prior year development of
$53 million in 2016. International recorded favorable net prior year development of $27 million and $64 million in 2017 and 2016. Further information on net prior year development is included in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included under Item 8.

Specialty’s combined ratio increased 3.0 points in 2017 as compared with
2016. The loss ratio increased 3.0 points primarily due to lower favorable net prior year loss reserve development and higher net catastrophe losses. Net catastrophe losses were $49 million, or 1.8 points of the loss ratio, in 2017 as compared
with $18 million, or 0.6 points of the loss ratio, in 2016. The loss ratio, excluding catastrophes and development, improved 1.3 points. The expense ratio in 2017 was consistent with 2016.



Commercial’s combined ratio improved 2.1 points in 2017 as compared with
2016. The loss ratio improved 0.8 points primarily due to the favorable period over period effect of net prior year loss reserve development, partially offset by higher net catastrophe losses. Net catastrophe losses were $267 million, or 9.4
points of the loss ratio, in 2017, as compared with $116 million, or 4.1 points of the loss ratio, in 2016. The loss ratio, excluding catastrophes and development, improved 1.9 points. The expense ratio improved 1.6 points in 2017 as compared
with 2016 reflecting both CNA’s ongoing efforts to improve productivity and the actions taken in last year’s third and fourth quarters to reduce expenses.

International’s combined ratio increased 5.7 points in 2017 as compared with 2016. The loss ratio increased 6.0 points
primarily due to lower favorable net prior year loss reserve development and higher net catastrophe losses, partially offset by lower current accident year large losses. Net catastrophe losses were $64 million, or 7.9 points of the loss ratio,
in 2017, as compared to $31 million, or 3.9 points of the loss ratio, in 2016. The loss ratio excluding catastrophes and development improved 3.0 points. The expense ratio improved 0.3 points in 2017 as compared with 2016 primarily due to the
higher net earned premiums.

2016 Compared with 2015

Net written premiums increased $21 million in 2016 as compared with 2015. Net written premiums for Commercial increased
$23 million in 2016 as compared with 2015, driven by strong retention in Middle Markets, partially offset by a decrease in Small Business, which included a premium rate adjustment, as discussed in Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements under Item 8. Net written premiums for Specialty in 2016 were consistent with 2015 as growth in warranty was offset by a decrease in management and professional liability and health care due to underwriting actions undertaken in certain
business lines. Net written premiums for International in 2016 were consistent with 2015 and include favorable period over period premium development of $24 million. Excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rates and premium
development, net written premiums increased 1.4% in 2016 in International. The increase in net earned premiums was consistent with the trend in net written premiums in Commercial. Excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rates and premium
development, the increase in net earned premiums was consistent with the trend in net written premiums in International.

Core income increased $16 million in 2016 as compared with 2015. The increase in core income was primarily due to higher
favorable net prior year reserve development and net investment income, partially offset by an increase in the current accident year loss ratio and higher underwriting expenses. Net catastrophe losses were $111 million (after tax) in 2016 as
compared to catastrophe losses of $95 million (after tax) in 2015.

Favorable net prior year development of
$316 million and $218 million was recorded in 2016 and 2015. Specialty recorded favorable net prior year development of $305 million and $152 million in 2016 and 2015, Commercial recorded unfavorable net prior year development of
$53 million in 2016 as compared with favorable net prior year development of $30 million in 2015 and International recorded favorable net prior year development of $64 million and $36 million in 2016 and 2015. Further information
on net prior year development is included in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

Specialty’s combined ratio decreased 3.7 points in 2016 as compared with 2015. The loss ratio decreased 4.6 points due to
higher favorable net prior year reserve development, partially offset by a higher current accident year loss ratio. Specialty’s expense ratio increased 0.9 points in 2016 as compared with 2015 due to higher employee costs and higher information
technology (“IT”) spending primarily related to new underwriting platforms.

Commercial’s combined ratio
increased 4.3 points in 2016 as compared with 2015. The loss ratio increased 3.6 points due to the unfavorable period over period effect of net prior year reserve development and a higher current accident year loss ratio due to higher large losses.
Commercial’s expense ratio increased 0.7 points in 2016 as compared with 2015 due to higher employee costs and higher IT spending primarily related to a new underwriting platform.



International’s combined ratio increased 1.5 points in 2016 as compared with
2015. The loss ratio increased 1.5 points primarily due to an increase in the current accident year loss ratio driven by a higher level of large losses related to political risk, property and financial institutions, partially offset by higher
favorable net prior year development. International’s expense ratio was consistent with 2015.

2017 Compared with 2016

Core loss was $40 million in 2017, an improvement of $118 million as compared with 2016. This improvement was
primarily driven by lower adverse prior year reserve development in 2017 for A&EP under the loss portfolio transfer, as further discussed in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. In addition, the
improvement also reflects a higher release of long term claim reserves resulting from the annual claims experience study as compared with 2016, higher net investment income and improved results in the long term care business driven by favorable
morbidity partially offset by unfavorable persistency.

The effective tax rate for the long term care business is
generally a function of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate and the relative proportion of tax exempt investment income on municipal bonds supporting liabilities to the overall pretax income of the business. The reduction in the U.S. federal
corporate income tax rate effective January 1, 2018 will reduce the tax benefit on the long term care business’s pretax losses.

2016 Compared with 2015

Core loss decreased $293 million in 2016 as compared to 2015. In 2015, CNA recognized a $198 million

(after-tax)

charge relating to a premium deficiency and claim reserve strengthening in its long term care business. The December 31, 2015 Gross Premium Valuation (“GPV”) indicated a premium deficiency
of $296 million. The indicated premium deficiency necessitated a charge to income that was effected by the write off of the entire long term care deferred acquisition cost of $289 million and an increase to active life reserves of
$7 million. Due to the recognition of the premium deficiency and resetting of actuarial assumptions in the fourth quarter of 2015, the operating results of CNA’s long term care business in 2016 reflect the variance between actual
experience and the expected results contemplated in its best estimate reserves.

In 2016, the long term care business
recorded Core income of $20 million, driven by a favorable release of claim reserves resulting from the annual claims experience study and higher net investment income due to an increase in the invested asset base. The long term care results
were generally in line with expectations, as the impact of favorable morbidity was partially offset by unfavorable persistency. In 2015, results of CNA’s long term care business reflected variances between actual experience and actuarial
assumptions that were

locked-in

at policy issuance. As a result of the reserve assumption unlocking, the 2016 and 2015 results are not comparable. For further discussion of the GPV and premium deficiency, see
the Insurance Reserves section of this MD&A.



Core income in 2016 and 2015 was also negatively affected by $83 million and
$55 million (after tax) charges related to the application of retroactive reinsurance accounting to adverse reserve development ceded under the 2010 A&EP loss portfolio transfer, as further discussed in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included under Item 8.

Referendum on the United Kingdom’s Membership in the European Union

In 2016, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union
(“E.U.”), commonly referred to as “Brexit.” As a result of the referendum, in 2017 the British government formally commenced the process to leave the E.U. and began negotiating the terms of treaties that will govern the
U.K.’s future relationship with the E.U. Although the terms of any future treaties are unknown, CNA believes changes in its international operating platform will be required to allow CNA to continue to write business in the E.U. after the
completion of Brexit. Therefore CNA has begun the process of establishing a new European subsidiary in Luxembourg. As a result of these changes, the complexity and cost of regulatory compliance of CNA’s European business is likely to increase.

Diamond Offshore

Overview

Oil prices have partially rebounded from the historical

12-year

low of less than $30
per barrel in January of 2016 to the upper $60s per barrel range at the end of January of 2018. The increase in commodity price is in part due to the shutdown of a major North Sea pipeline in December of 2017, which led to production shutdowns at
several offshore fields, and production cuts by certain members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) and others that went into effect in 2017 to reduce the oversupply of oil and raise and potentially stabilize oil
prices. However, the increase in oil prices has not yet resulted in a measurable increase in demand for offshore contract drilling services or higher dayrates as capital spending for offshore exploration and development remains at a relatively low
level at the start of 2018. As a consequence, the offshore contract drilling industry remains weak.

Industry analysts
have reported that in 2017, for the third consecutive year, the global supply of floater rigs decreased with 30 floaters being scrapped during the year, for a total of over 80 floaters retired since 2015. Despite these events, the oversupply of
drilling rigs in the floater markets continues to persist as drilling rigs across all water depth categories continue to be cold stacked as they come off contract with no immediate future work. Industry reports indicate that there remain
approximately 40 newbuild floaters on order with scheduled deliveries between 2018 and 2021. Industry analysts predict that the 2018 delivery dates may be deferred.



Given the oversupply of rigs, competition for the limited number of offshore
drilling jobs remains intense. In some cases, dayrates have been negotiated at break-even or below-cost levels in order to enable the drilling contractor to recover a portion of operating costs for rigs that would otherwise be uncontracted or cold
stacked. In addition, customers have indicated a preference for “hot” rigs rather than reactivated cold-stacked rigs. This preference incentivizes the drilling contractor to contract rigs at lower rates for the sole purpose of maintaining
the rigs in an active state and allowing for at least partial cost recovery.

Diamond Offshore’s results of
operations and cash flows for the three years ended December 31, 2017 have been materially impacted by continuing depressed market conditions in the offshore drilling industry. Diamond Offshore currently expects that these adverse market
conditions will continue for the near term, which could result in more of Diamond Offshore’s rigs being without contracts, contracted at lower rates than the rigs are currently earning and/or cold stacked or scrapped. These events, if they were
to occur, could further materially and adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. When Diamond Offshore cold stacks or elects to scrap a rig, it evaluates the rig for impairment. During 2017, 2016 and 2015,
Diamond Offshore recognized aggregate impairment charges of $100 million (three rigs), $680 million (eight rigs and related spare parts) and $861 million (17 rigs).

Historically, the longer a drilling rig remains cold stacked, the higher the cost of reactivation and, depending on the age,
technological obsolescence and condition of the rig, the lower the likelihood that the rig will be reactivated at a future date. As of January 29, 2018, five rigs in Diamond Offshore’s fleet were cold stacked.

Contract Drilling Backlog

Diamond Offshore’s contract drilling backlog was $2.4 billion, $2.6 billion and $3.6 billion as of
January 1, 2018 (based on contract information known at that time), October 1, 2017 (the date reported in our Quarterly Report on Form

10-Q

for the quarter ended September 30, 2017) and
January 1, 2017 (the date reported in our Annual Report on Form

10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2016). The contract drilling backlog by year as of January 1, 2018 is $1.1 billion in
2018, $1.0 billion in 2019 and $0.3 billion in 2020.

Contract drilling backlog includes only firm commitments
(typically represented by signed contracts) and is calculated by multiplying the contracted operating dayrate by the firm contract period. Diamond Offshore’s calculation also assumes full utilization of its drilling equipment for the contract
period (excluding scheduled shipyard and survey days); however, the amount of actual revenue earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned will be different than the amounts and periods stated above due to various factors affecting
utilization such as weather conditions and unscheduled repairs and maintenance. Contract drilling backlog excludes revenues for mobilization, demobilization, contract preparation and customer reimbursables. Changes in Diamond Offshore’s
contract drilling backlog between periods are generally a function of the performance of work on term contracts, as well as the extension or modification of existing term contracts and the execution of additional contracts. In addition, under
certain circumstances, Diamond Offshore’s customers may seek to terminate or renegotiate its contracts, which could adversely affect its reported backlog.

Results of Operations

Diamond Offshore’s pretax operating income (loss) is primarily a function of contract drilling revenue earned less
contract drilling expenses incurred or recognized. The two most significant variables affecting Diamond Offshore’s contract drilling revenues are dayrates earned and rig utilization rates achieved by its rigs, each of which is a function of rig
supply and demand in the marketplace. Revenues are also affected by the acquisition or disposal of rigs, rig mobilizations, required surveys and shipyard projects.

Operating expenses represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation and maintenance of Diamond
Offshore’s drilling equipment. The principal components of Diamond Offshore’s operating costs are, among other things, direct and indirect costs of labor and benefits, repairs and maintenance, freight, regulatory inspections, boat and
helicopter rentals and insurance.



The following table summarizes the results of operations for Diamond Offshore for
the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 as presented in Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8:

2017 Compared with 2016

Contract drilling revenue decreased $74 million in 2017 as compared with 2016, primarily due to lower average daily
revenue earned by all rig types, partially offset by the favorable impact of an aggregate 353 incremental revenue earning days. Total contract drilling expense increased $30 million in 2017 as compared with 2016, reflecting higher amortized rig
mobilization expense of $25 million and incremental contract drilling costs associated with the drillships of $28 million, partially offset by a net reduction in other rig operating and overhead costs of $23 million.

Net results improved $159 million in 2017 as compared with 2016, primarily due to a lower aggregate impairment charge
recognized in 2017 of $100 million ($32 million after taxes and noncontrolling interests) as compared with $680 million ($267 million after taxes and noncontrolling interests) in 2016 and reduced depreciation expense, primarily
due to a lower depreciable asset base as a result of asset impairments recognized in 2016 and 2017. In addition, results reflect a net reduction in rig operating results for the floater and

jack-up

rigs and an
increase in interest expense due to a loss of $35 million ($11 million after tax and noncontrolling interests) related to the redemption of debt in 2017, as discussed in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included
under Item 8, and a reduction in interest capitalized during 2017 due to the completion of construction projects in 2016.

The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes a $36 million

one-time

charge related to the Tax Act, which consisted of: (i) a $75 million charge for the mandatory, deemed repatriation of foreign earnings, inclusive of the utilization of certain tax attributes
offset by a provisional liability for uncertain tax positions related to such attributes, (ii) a $74 million credit resulting from the remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities at the lower corporate tax rate and (iii) a
$35 million charge recorded at the Loews level for the difference between the book basis and tax basis in Diamond Offshore.

2016 Compared with 2015

Contract drilling revenue decreased $835 million in 2016 as compared with 2015 due to depressed market conditions in all
floater markets and for the

jack-up

rig, reflecting an aggregate of 2,577 fewer revenue earning days and lower average daily revenue earned by the ultra-deepwater and deepwater floater fleets. Average daily
revenue increased for the

mid-water

and

jack-up

fleets primarily due to the favorable settlement of a contractual dispute and



receipt of

loss-of-hire

insurance proceeds, each in 2016. Contract drilling expense decreased $456 million in
2016 as compared with 2015, reflecting Diamond Offshore’s lower cost structure due to additional rigs idled, cold stacked or retired during 2015 and 2016, as well as the favorable impact of cost control initiatives.

Net results decreased $30 million in 2016 as compared with 2015, primarily due to lower utilization of the rig fleet,
which reduced both contract drilling revenue and expense for the year. Results for 2016 also reflected an aggregate impairment charge of $680 million ($267 million after taxes and noncontrolling interests) compared to impairment charges
aggregating $861 million ($341 million after taxes and noncontrolling interests) in 2015. The results were also impacted by a $12 million ($4 million after tax and noncontrolling interests) loss on an investment in privately-held
corporate bonds. These unfavorable variances were partially offset by decreased depreciation expense, as a result of the impairment charges in 2015 and 2016 and resulting lower depreciable asset base, the absence of a $20 million impairment
charge in 2015 to

write-off

all goodwill associated with the Company’s investment in Diamond Offshore and a favorable $43 million tax adjustment primarily related to Diamond Offshore’s Egyptian
liability for uncertain tax positions related to the devaluation of the Egyptian pound.

Boardwalk Pipeline

Overview

Boardwalk Pipeline derives revenues primarily from the transportation and storage of natural gas and natural gas liquids
(“NGLs”). Transportation services consist of firm natural gas transportation, where the customer pays a capacity reservation charge to reserve pipeline capacity at receipt and delivery points along pipeline systems, plus a commodity and
fuel charge on the volume of natural gas actually transported, and interruptible natural gas transportation, under which the customer pays to transport gas only when capacity is available and used. The transportation rates Boardwalk Pipeline is able
to charge customers are heavily influenced by market trends (both short and longer term), including the available natural gas supplies, geographical location of natural gas production, the demand for gas by

end-users

such as power plants, petrochemical facilities and liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) export facilities and the price differentials between the gas supplies and the market demand for the gas
(basis differentials). Rates for short term firm and interruptible transportation services are influenced by shorter term market conditions such as current and forecasted weather.

Boardwalk Pipeline offers firm natural gas storage services in which the customer reserves and pays for a specific amount of
storage capacity, including injection and withdrawal rights, and interruptible storage and parking and lending (“PAL”) services where the customer receives and pays for capacity only when it is available and used. The value of Boardwalk
Pipeline’s storage and PAL services (comprised of parking gas for customers and/or lending gas to customers) is affected by natural gas price differentials between time periods, such as between winter and summer (time period price spreads),
price volatility of natural gas and other factors. Boardwalk Pipeline’s storage and parking services have greater value when the natural gas futures market is in contango (a positive time period price spread, meaning that current price quotes
for delivery of natural gas further in the future are higher than in the nearer term), while its lending service has greater value when the futures market is backwardated (a negative time period price spread, meaning that current price quotes for
delivery of natural gas in the nearer term are higher than further in the future). The value of both storage and PAL services may also be favorably impacted by increased volatility in the price of natural gas, which allows Boardwalk Pipeline to
optimize the value of its storage and PAL capacity.

Boardwalk Pipeline also transports and stores NGLs. Contracts for
Boardwalk Pipeline’s NGLs services are generally fee based or based on minimum volume requirements, while others are dependent on actual volumes transported. Boardwalk Pipeline’s NGLs storage rates are market-based and contracts are
typically fixed price arrangements with escalation clauses. Boardwalk Pipeline is not in the business of buying and selling natural gas and NGLs other than for system management purposes, but changes in natural gas and NGLs prices may impact the
volumes of natural gas or NGLs transported and stored by customers on its systems. Due to the capital intensive nature of its business, Boardwalk Pipeline’s operating costs and expenses typically do not vary significantly based upon the amount
of products transported, with the exception of fuel consumed at its compressor stations and not included in a fuel tracker.



Firm Transportation Agreements

A substantial portion of Boardwalk Pipeline’s transportation capacity is contracted for under firm transportation
agreements. The table below sets forth the approximate expected revenues from capacity reservation and minimum bill charges under committed firm transportation agreements in place as of December 31, 2017, for 2018 and 2019, as well as the
actual comparative amount recognized in revenues for 2017. The table does not include additional revenues Boardwalk Pipeline has recognized and may receive under firm transportation agreements based on actual utilization of the contracted pipeline
capacity, any expected revenues for periods after the expiration dates of the existing agreements, execution of precedent agreements associated with growth projects or other events that occurred or will occur subsequent to December 31, 2017.

In the third quarter of 2017, Boardwalk Pipeline executed an agreement regarding capacity on
its Fayetteville and Greenville Laterals with Southwestern Energy Company (“Southwestern”), the largest firm transportation customer on those laterals. The agreement, which was approved by the FERC, but is subject to a rehearing request
filed with the FERC by Fayetteville Express Pipeline LLC, reduces contracted volumes (or the amount of capacity under contract) on the Fayetteville Lateral for the remaining contract term and commits Southwestern to new firm transportation
agreements on its Fayetteville and Greenville Laterals that begin January 1, 2021, and expire on December 31, 2030, and to an interim agreement on the Greenville Lateral from April of 2019 through 2020. The agreement also provides
Boardwalk Pipeline the opportunity to transport natural gas produced from committed properties in the Fayetteville and Moorefield shales that are connected to its Fayetteville Lateral through 2030. Although the transaction will result in a reduction
of firm transportation reservation revenues of approximately $70 million from 2017 to 2020, including reductions in 2018 and 2019 of approximately $44 million and $15 million, it provides longer-term revenue generation by adding ten
years of firm transportation service commitments on both laterals and offers potential additional commodity fee revenue from Southwestern’s volume commitment.

The table below shows a reconciliation of the actual committed firm transportation revenues for 2017 and expected revenues
under committed firm transportation agreements for 2018 from the table shown above to the amounts disclosed in the Results of Operations – Boardwalk Pipeline section of our MD&A included under Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form

for the year ended December 31, 2016, taking into account the Southwestern transaction discussed above, the sale of a processing plant and related assets in the second quarter of 2017 discussed in Note 6
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 and contracts entered into since December 31, 2016. The table does not include additional revenues Boardwalk Pipeline has recognized and may receive under firm
transportation agreements based on actual utilization of the contracted pipeline capacity, any expected revenues for periods after the expiration dates of the existing agreements, execution of precedent agreements associated with growth projects or
other events that occurred or will occur subsequent to December 31, 2017.

In the 2018 to 2020 timeframe, the agreements associated with the East Texas to
Mississippi Pipeline, Southeast Expansion, Gulf Crossing Pipeline and Fayetteville and Greenville Laterals, which were placed into service in 2008 and 2009, will expire. These projects were large, new pipeline expansions, developed to serve growing
production in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana and anchored primarily by

ten-year

firm transportation agreements with producers. Since these projects went into service, gas production from the Utica and
Marcellus area in the Northeast has grown significantly and has altered the flow patterns of natural gas in North America. Over the last few years, gas production from other basins such as Barnett and Fayetteville, which primarily supported two of
these expansions, has declined because the production economics in those basins are not as competitive as other production basins. These market dynamics have resulted in less production from certain basins tied to Boardwalk Pipeline’s system
and a narrowing of basis differentials across portions of its pipeline systems, primarily for capacity associated with natural gas flows from west to east. Total revenues generated from these expansion projects’ capacity will be materially
lower when these contracts expire. For example, as shown directly above, revenues under committed firm transportation agreements for 2018 are expected to be approximately $100 million lower than the actual amount for 2017. This reduction is
mainly a result of (i) expansion contracts on the Gulf South system that expired in early 2018, which comprises approximately 60% of the $100 million reduction of revenues, and (ii) the Southwestern contract restructuring, which is
responsible for the remaining 40% reduction. While some of the Gulf South capacity has been remarketed at lower rates and for shorter terms, Boardwalk Pipeline believes that the current market rates are not indicative of the long-term value of that
capacity. Boardwalk Pipeline continues to focus its marketing efforts on enhancing the value of the remaining expansion capacity and is working with customers to match gas supplies from various basins to new and existing customers and markets,
including aggregating supplies at key locations along its pipelines to provide

end-use

customers with attractive and diverse supply options.

Partially as a result of the increase in overall gas supplies, demand markets, primarily in the Gulf Coast area, are growing
due to new natural gas export facilities, power plants and petrochemical facilities and increased exports to Mexico. These developments have resulted in significant growth projects for Boardwalk Pipeline. As of December 31, 2017, Boardwalk
Pipeline has placed several growth projects into service since 2016 and has additional growth projects under development that are expected to be fully placed into service through the end of 2020. These projects have lengthy planning and construction
periods. As a result, these projects will not contribute to Boardwalk Pipeline’s earnings and cash flows until they are fully placed into service. The revenues that are expected to be realized in 2018 and 2019 from these growth projects are
included in the estimates of expected revenues from capacity reservation and minimum bill charges under committed firm transportation agreements shown above.

Pipeline System Maintenance

Boardwalk Pipeline incurs substantial costs for ongoing maintenance of its pipeline systems and related facilities, including
those incurred for pipeline integrity management activities, equipment overhauls, general upkeep and repairs. These costs are not dependent on the amount of revenues earned from its transportation services. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials
Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) has developed regulations that require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain areas along pipelines and take additional measures to
protect pipeline segments located in highly populated areas. These regulations have resulted in an overall increase in ongoing maintenance costs, including maintenance capital and maintenance expense. PHMSA has proposed more prescriptive regulations
related to operations of Boardwalk Pipeline’s interstate natural gas and NGLs pipelines which, if adopted as proposed, will cause Boardwalk Pipeline to incur increased capital and operating costs, experience operational delays and result in
potential adverse impacts to its ability to reliably serve its customers. While these proposed regulations have not yet been finalized, they are representative of the types of regulatory changes that can be enacted which would affect Boardwalk
Pipeline’s operations and the cost of operating its facilities.

Maintenance costs may be capitalized or expensed,
depending on the nature of the activities. For any given reporting period, the mix of projects that Boardwalk Pipeline undertakes will affect the amounts it records as property, plant and equipment on its balance sheet or recognize as expenses,
which impacts Boardwalk Pipeline’s earnings. In 2018, Boardwalk Pipeline expects to spend approximately $320 million to maintain its pipeline systems, of which approximately $120 million is expected to be maintenance capital. In 2017,
Boardwalk Pipeline spent $342 million, of which $138 million was recorded as maintenance capital.

2017 Compared with 2016

Total revenues increased $9 million in 2017 as compared with 2016. Excluding the net effect of $13 million of
proceeds received from the settlement of a legal matter in 2016 and items offset in fuel and transportation expense, primarily retained fuel, operating revenues increased $44 million. The increase was driven by growth projects recently placed
into service, partially offset by a decrease in storage and PAL revenues, primarily from the effects of unfavorable market conditions on time period price spreads and a decrease in revenues associated with the sale of a processing plant, discussed
in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, and the Southwestern contract restructuring.

Operating expenses increased $26 million in 2017 as compared with 2016. Excluding items offset in operating revenues and
the $47 million loss on sale of a processing plant, operating expenses decreased $5 million primarily due to lower administrative and general expenses due to higher capitalization rates from the increase in capital projects and lower
employee incentive costs, largely offset by higher operations and maintenance expenses, primarily due to growth projects recently placed into service and a higher number of maintenance projects. Interest expense decreased $12 million primarily
due to higher capitalized interest from growth projects.

As a result of the Tax Act, we recorded a

one-time

decrease to income tax expense of $294 million at the holding company level. This decrease was a result of remeasuring the net deferred tax liabilities at the lower corporate tax rate.

Net income increased $291 million in 2017 as compared with 2016, primarily due to the changes discussed above.

2016 Compared with 2015

Total revenues increased $62 million in 2016 as compared with 2015. Excluding the net effect of $13 million of
proceeds received from the settlement of a legal matter in 2016, $9 million of proceeds received from a business interruption claim in 2015 and items offset in fuel and transportation expense, primarily retained fuel, operating revenues
increased $83 million. The increase was driven by an increase in transportation revenues of $71 million, which resulted primarily from growth projects placed into service, incremental revenues from the Gulf South rate case of
$18 million and a full year of revenues from the Evangeline pipeline. Storage and PAL revenues were higher by $17 million primarily from the effects of favorable market conditions on time period price spreads.



Operating expenses decreased $16 million in 2016 as compared with 2015.
Excluding receipt of a franchise tax refund of $10 million in 2015 and items offset in operating revenues, operating costs and expenses increased $5 million primarily due to higher employee related costs, partially offset by decreases in
maintenance activities and depreciation expense. Interest expense increased $7 million primarily due to higher average interest rates compared to 2015.

Net income increased $15 million in 2016 as compared with 2015, primarily reflecting higher revenues and lower operating
expenses, partially offset by higher interest expense as discussed above.

2017 Compared with 2016

Operating revenues increased $20 million and operating expenses increased $13 million in 2017 as compared with 2016
primarily due to an increase in revenue and expenses upon completion of renovations at the Loews Miami Beach Hotel.

Equity income from joint ventures increased $40 million in 2017 as compared with 2016 primarily due to a $25 million
gain on the sale of an equity interest in the Loews Don CeSar Hotel, a joint venture hotel property, in February of 2017, increased equity income from Universal Orlando joint venture properties and the absence of a $13 million impairment charge
related to an equity interest in a joint venture hotel property in the 2016 period. These increases were partially offset by a $15 million impairment charge in 2017 related to an equity interest in a joint venture hotel property.

Interest expense increased $4 million in 2017 as compared with 2016 primarily due to property-level debt incurred to fund
acquisitions in 2016 along with reduced capitalized interest.

Loews Hotels & Co recorded a $27 million
decrease to income tax expense resulting from the effect of the lower U.S. federal corporate tax rate on its net deferred tax liabilities.

Net income increased $52 million primarily due to the changes discussed above.



2016 Compared with 2015

Operating revenues increased $30 million in 2016 as compared with 2015 primarily due to the acquisition of one hotel
during 2016 and the acquisition of two hotels during 2015, partially offset by a decrease in revenue at the Loews Miami Beach Hotel due to renovations during 2016.

Operating and depreciation expenses increased $22 million and $9 million in 2016 as compared with 2015 primarily due
to the acquisition of one hotel during 2016 and the acquisition of two hotels during 2015.

Equity income from joint
ventures in 2016 was impacted by costs associated with opening one new hotel during 2016 and the $13 million impairment of an equity interest in a joint venture hotel property.

Interest expense increased $3 million in 2016 as compared with 2015 primarily due to new property-level debt incurred to
fund acquisitions.

Net income was consistent in 2016 as compared with 2015 due to the increases in revenues and expenses
discussed above.

Corporate

Corporate operations consist primarily of investment income at the Parent Company, operating results of Consolidated Container
since the May 22, 2017 acquisition date, corporate interest expenses and other corporate administrative costs. Investment income includes earnings on cash and short term investments held at the Parent Company to meet current and future
liquidity needs, as well as results of limited partnership investments and the trading portfolio.

2017 Compared with 2016

Net investment income was flat in 2017 as compared with 2016 primarily due to improved performance from limited partnership
investments offset by lower results from equity based investments in the trading portfolio.

Other revenues increased
$496 million in 2017 as compared with 2016 primarily due to $498 million of revenue from Consolidated Container’s operations for the period since the acquisition date.

Operating expenses increased $487 million in 2017 as compared with 2016 primarily due to $479 million of expenses
for Consolidated Container’s operations for the period since the acquisition date. In addition, operating expenses increased due to costs related to the acquisition of Consolidated Container, partially offset by the absence of prior year
expenses related to the implementation of the 2016 Incentive Compensation Plan. Interest expense



increased $23 million in 2017 as compared with 2016 primarily due to interest expense associated with Consolidated Container’s $605 million term loan from the date of acquisition.

Corporate recorded an $8 million increase to income tax expense resulting from the effect of the lower corporate tax
rate on net deferred tax assets.

Net results decreased $19 million in 2017 as compared with 2016 primarily due to
the changes discussed above.

2016 Compared with 2015

Net investment income increased $124 million in 2016 as compared with 2015 primarily due to improved performance of
equity based investments and fixed income investments in the trading portfolio and improved results from limited partnership investments.

Operating expenses increased $15 million in 2016 as compared with 2015 primarily due to expenses related to the 2016
Incentive Compensation Plan, which was approved by shareholders on May 10, 2016.

Net results improved
$68 million in 2016 as compared with 2015 primarily due to the changes discussed above.

LIQUIDITY AND
CAPITAL RESOURCES

Parent Company

Parent Company cash and investments, net of receivables and payables, at December 31, 2017 totaled $4.9 billion, as
compared to $5.0 billion at December 31, 2016. In 2017, we received $804 million in dividends from our subsidiaries, including a special dividend from CNA of $485 million. Cash outflows included the payment of $620 million
to fund the acquisition of Consolidated Container, which was in addition to approximately $600 million of debt financing proceeds at the subsidiary level as discussed in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under
Item 8. In addition, cash outflows included the payment of $84 million of cash dividends to our shareholders and $216 million to fund treasury stock purchases. As a holding company we depend on dividends from our subsidiaries and returns
on our investment portfolio to fund our obligations. We are not responsible for the liabilities and obligations of our subsidiaries and there are no Parent Company guarantees.

As of February 2, 2018, there were 328,825,271 shares of Loews common stock outstanding. Depending on market and other
conditions, we may purchase our shares and shares of our subsidiaries’ outstanding common stock in the open market or otherwise. In 2017, we purchased 4.8 million shares of Loews common stock. As of February 9, 2018, we had purchased
an additional 4.3 million shares of Loews common stock in 2018 at an aggregate cost of $218 million. We have an effective Registration Statement on Form

S-3

on file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”) registering the future sale of an unlimited amount of our debt and equity securities.

In
April of 2017, Fitch Ratings, Inc. affirmed our unsecured debt rating at A, with the rating outlook revised to negative from stable and in June of 2017, S&P Global Ratings (“S&P”) lowered our corporate credit and senior debt
ratings from A+ to A with a stable outlook. Our current unsecured debt rating is A3 for Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”), with a stable outlook. Should one or more rating agencies downgrade our credit ratings from
current levels, or announce that they have placed us under review for a potential downgrade, our cost of capital could increase and our ability to raise new capital could be adversely affected.

Future uses of our cash may include investing in our subsidiaries, new acquisitions, dividends and/or repurchases of our and
our subsidiaries’ outstanding common stock.

Subsidiaries

CNA’s cash provided by operating activities was $1.3 billion in 2017 and $1.4 billion in 2016. Cash provided by
operating activities in 2017 reflected higher net claim payments and a lower level of distributions on limited partnerships, partially offset by lower IT spend and an increase in premiums collected. In 2016, cash provided by



operating activities reflected lower income taxes paid and increased receipts relating to returns on limited partnerships offset by higher net claim and expense payments.

CNA paid dividends of $3.10 per share on its common stock, including a special dividend of $2.00 per share in 2017. On
February 9, 2018, CNA’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share and a special dividend of $2.00 per share payable March 14, 2018 to shareholders of record on February 26, 2018. CNA’s declaration
and payment of future dividends is at the discretion of its Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including CNA’s earnings, financial condition, business needs and regulatory constraints. The payment of dividends by CNA’s
insurance subsidiaries without prior approval of the insurance department of each subsidiary’s domiciliary jurisdiction is limited by formula. Dividends in excess of these amounts are subject to prior approval by the respective state insurance
departments.

Dividends from Continental Casualty Company (“CCC”), a subsidiary of CNA, are subject to the
insurance holding company laws of the State of Illinois, the domiciliary state of CCC. Under these laws, ordinary dividends, or dividends that do not require prior approval by the Illinois Department of Insurance (the “Department”), are
determined based on the greater of the prior year’s statutory net income or 10% of statutory surplus as of the end of the prior year, as well as timing and amount of dividends paid in the preceding 12 months. Additionally, ordinary dividends
may only be paid from earned surplus, which is calculated by removing unrealized gains from unassigned surplus. As of December 31, 2017, CCC is in a positive earned surplus position. The maximum allowable dividend CCC could pay during 2018 that
would not be subject to the Department’s prior approval is $1.1 billion, less dividends paid during the preceding 12 months measured at that point in time. CCC paid dividends of $955 million in 2017. The actual level of dividends paid
in any year is determined after an assessment of available dividend capacity, holding company liquidity and cash needs as well as the impact the dividends will have on the statutory surplus of the applicable insurance company.

Diamond Offshore’s cash provided by operating activities decreased approximately $153 million in 2017 as compared
with 2016, primarily due to lower cash receipts from contract drilling services of $245 million and higher taxes paid, net of refunds of $26 million, partially offset by a $119 million net decrease in cash payments for contract
drilling and general and administrative expenses, including personnel-related, maintenance and other rig operating costs. The decline in cash receipts and cash payments related to the performance of contract drilling services reflects continued
depressed market conditions in the offshore drilling industry, as well as positive results from focusing on controlling costs.

For 2018, Diamond Offshore has budgeted approximately $220 million for capital expenditures. Diamond Offshore has no
other purchase obligations for major rig upgrades at December 31, 2017.

As of December 31, 2017, Diamond
Offshore had no outstanding borrowings under its credit agreement and was in compliance with all covenant requirements thereunder. As of February 9, 2018, Diamond Offshore had no outstanding borrowings and $1.5 billion available under its
credit agreement to provide short term liquidity for payment obligations.

In July of 2017, Moody’s downgraded
Diamond Offshore’s corporate credit rating to Ba3 with a negative outlook from Ba2 with a stable outlook. In October of 2017, S&P downgraded Diamond Offshore’s corporate credit rating to B+ from

BB-

with a negative outlook. Market conditions and other factors, many of which are outside of Diamond Offshore’s control, could cause its credit ratings to be lowered further. Any downgrade in Diamond
Offshore’s credit ratings could adversely impact its cost of issuing additional debt and the amount of additional debt that it could issue, and could further restrict its access to capital markets and its ability to raise funds by issuing
additional debt. As a consequence, Diamond Offshore may not be able to issue additional debt in amounts and/or with terms that it considers to be reasonable. One or more of these occurrences could limit Diamond Offshore’s ability to pursue
other business opportunities.

Diamond Offshore will make periodic assessments of its capital spending programs based on
industry conditions and will make adjustments if it determines they are required. Diamond Offshore, may, from time to time, issue debt or equity securities, or a combination thereof, to finance capital expenditures, the acquisition of assets and
businesses or for general corporate purposes. Diamond Offshore’s ability to access the capital markets by issuing



debt or equity securities will be dependent on its results of operations, current financial condition, current credit ratings, current market conditions and other factors beyond its control.

Boardwalk Pipeline’s cash provided by operating activities increased $36 million in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily
due to increased net income, excluding the effects of

non-cash

items such as depreciation, amortization and the loss on the sale of operating assets. This increase also reflects the settlement of the Gulf
South rate refund in 2016.

In 2017 and 2016, Boardwalk Pipeline declared and paid distributions to its common unitholders
of record of $0.40 per common unit and an amount to the general partner on behalf of its 2% general partner interest. In February of 2018, the Partnership declared a quarterly cash distribution to unitholders of record of $0.10 per common unit.

As of February 13, 2018, Boardwalk Pipeline had $445 million of outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit
facility. During 2017, Boardwalk Pipeline extended the maturity date of its revolving credit facility by one year to May 26, 2022. Boardwalk Pipeline has a subordinated loan agreement with a subsidiary of the Company under which it could borrow
up to $300 million until December 31, 2018. As of February 13, 2018, Boardwalk Pipeline had no outstanding borrowings under the subordinated loan agreement.

For 2017 and 2016, Boardwalk Pipeline’s capital expenditures were $708 million and $590 million, consisting of
a combination of growth and maintenance capital. Boardwalk Pipeline expects total capital expenditures to be approximately $550 million in 2018 related to growth projects and pipeline system maintenance expenditures.

Boardwalk Pipeline anticipates that for 2018 its existing capital resources, including its revolving credit facility,
subordinated loan and cash flows from operating activities, will be adequate to fund its operations. Boardwalk Pipeline may seek to access the capital markets to fund some or all capital expenditures for growth projects, acquisitions or for general
business purposes. Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to access the capital markets for equity and debt financing under reasonable terms depends on its current financial condition, current credit ratings and current market conditions.

INVESTMENTS

Investment activities of

non-insurance

subsidiaries primarily include investments in
fixed income securities, including short term investments. The Parent Company portfolio also includes equity securities, including short sales and derivative instruments, and investments in limited partnerships. These types of investments generally
present greater volatility, less liquidity and greater risk than fixed income investments and are included within Results of Operations – Corporate.

We enter into short sales and invest in certain derivative instruments that are used for asset and liability management
activities, income enhancements to our portfolio management strategy and to benefit from anticipated future movements in the underlying markets. If such movements do not occur as anticipated, then significant losses may occur. Monitoring procedures
include senior management review of daily reports of existing positions and valuation fluctuations to seek to ensure that open positions are consistent with our portfolio strategy.

Credit exposure associated with

non-performance

by counterparties to our derivative
instruments is generally limited to the uncollateralized change in fair value of the derivative instruments recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We mitigate the risk of non-performance by monitoring the creditworthiness of counterparties
and diversifying derivatives by using multiple counterparties. We occasionally require collateral from our derivative investment counterparties depending on the amount of the exposure and the credit rating of the counterparty.



Insurance

CNA maintains a large portfolio of fixed maturity and equity securities, including large amounts of corporate and government
issued debt securities, residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, and other asset-backed securities and investments in limited partnerships which pursue a variety of long and short investment strategies across a broad array of asset
classes. CNA’s investment portfolio supports its obligation to pay future insurance claims and provides investment returns which are an important part of CNA’s overall profitability.

Net investment income after tax and noncontrolling interests increased $28 million in
2017 as compared with 2016. The increase was driven by limited partnership investments, which returned 9.1% in 2017 as compared with 6.3% in the prior year.

Net investment income after tax and noncontrolling interests increased $88 million in 2016 as compared with 2015. The
increase was driven by limited partnership investments, which returned 6.3% in 2016 as compared with 3.0% in the prior year. Income from fixed income securities increased by $40 million, after tax and noncontrolling interests, primarily due to
an increase in the invested asset base and a charge in 2015 related to a change in estimate effected by a change in accounting principle.

Duration

A primary objective in the management of CNA’s investment portfolio is to optimize return relative to corresponding
liabilities and respective liquidity needs. CNA’s views on the current interest rate environment, tax regulations, asset class valuations, specific security issuer and broader industry segment conditions and domestic and global economic
conditions, are some of the factors that enter into an investment decision. CNA also continually monitors exposure to issuers of securities held and broader industry sector exposures and may from time to time adjust such exposures based on its views
of a specific issuer or industry sector.

A further consideration in the management of CNA’s investment portfolio is
the characteristics of the corresponding liabilities and the ability to align the duration of the portfolio to those liabilities and to meet future liquidity needs, minimize interest rate risk and maintain a level of income sufficient to support the
underlying insurance liabilities. For portfolios where future liability cash flows are determinable and typically long term in nature, CNA segregates investments for asset/liability management purposes. The segregated investments support the long
term care and structured settlement liabilities in Other Insurance Operations.

INSURANCE RESERVES

The level of reserves CNA maintains represents its best estimate, as of a particular point in time, of what the ultimate
settlement and administration of claims will cost based on CNA’s assessment of facts and circumstances known at that time. Reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex estimates that CNA derives, generally
utilizing a variety of actuarial reserve estimation techniques, from numerous assumptions and expectations about future events, both internal and external, many of which are highly uncertain. As noted below, CNA reviews its reserves for each segment
of its business periodically, and any such review could result in the need to increase reserves in amounts which could be material and could adversely affect our results of operations and equity and CNA’s business and insurer financial strength
and corporate debt ratings. Further information on reserves is provided in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

Property and Casualty Claim and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves

CNA maintains loss reserves to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses,
including the estimated cost of the claims adjudication process, for claims that have been reported but not yet settled (case reserves) and claims that have been incurred but not reported (“IBNR”). IBNR includes a provision for development
on known cases as well as a provision for late reported incurred claims. Claim and claim adjustment expense reserves are reflected as liabilities and are included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets under the heading “Insurance Reserves.”
Adjustments to prior year reserve estimates, if necessary, are reflected in results



of operations in the period that the need for such adjustments is determined. The carried case and IBNR reserves as of each balance sheet date are provided in the discussion that follows and in
Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

There is a risk that CNA’s recorded
reserves are insufficient to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses. Unforeseen emerging or potential claims and coverage issues are difficult to predict and could materially adversely affect the
adequacy of CNA’s claim and claim adjustment expense reserves and could lead to future reserve additions.

In
addition, CNA’s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries also have actual and potential exposures related to A&EP claims, which could result in material losses. To mitigate the risks posed by CNA’s exposure to A&EP claims and
claim adjustment expenses, CNA completed a transaction with National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), under which substantially all of CNA’s legacy A&EP liabilities were ceded to NICO effective January 1, 2010. See Note 8 of the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 for further discussion about the transaction with NICO, its impact on CNA’s results of operations and the deferred retroactive reinsurance gain.

Establishing Property & Casualty Reserve Estimates

In developing claim and claim adjustment expense (“loss” or “losses”) reserve estimates, CNA’s
actuaries perform detailed reserve analyses that are staggered throughout the year. The data is organized at a reserve group level. A reserve group can be a line of business covering a subset of insureds such as commercial automobile liability for
small or middle market customers, it can encompass several lines of business provided to a specific set of customers such as aging services, or it can be a particular type of claim such as construction defect. Every reserve group is reviewed at
least once during the year. The analyses generally review losses gross of ceded reinsurance and apply the ceded reinsurance terms to the gross estimates to establish estimates net of reinsurance. In addition to the detailed analyses, CNA reviews
actual loss emergence for all products each quarter.

Most of CNA’s business can be characterized as long-tail. For
long-tail business, it will generally be several years between the time the business is written and the time when all claims are settled. CNA’s long-tail exposures include commercial automobile liability, workers’ compensation, general
liability, medical professional liability, other professional liability and management liability coverages, assumed reinsurance

run-off

and products liability. Short-tail exposures include property, commercial
automobile physical damage, marine, surety and warranty. Property and Casualty Operations contain both long-tail and short-tail exposures. Other Insurance Operations contain long-tail exposures.

Various methods are used to project ultimate losses for both long-tail and short-tail exposures.

The paid development method estimates ultimate losses by reviewing paid loss patterns and applying them to accident or policy
years with further expected changes in paid losses. Selection of the paid loss pattern may require consideration of several factors including the impact of inflation on claims costs, the rate at which claims professionals make claim payments and
close claims, the impact of judicial decisions, the impact of underwriting changes, the impact of large claim payments and other factors. Claim cost inflation itself may require evaluation of changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property,
changes in the cost of medical care, changes in the cost of wage replacement, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors. Because this method assumes that losses are paid at a consistent rate, changes in any of these factors can
affect the results. Since the method does not rely on case reserves, it is not directly influenced by changes in their adequacy.

For many reserve groups, paid loss data for recent periods may be too immature or erratic for accurate predictions. This
situation often exists for long-tail exposures. In addition, changes in the factors described above may result in inconsistent payment patterns. Finally, estimating the paid loss pattern subsequent to the most mature point available in the data
analyzed often involves considerable uncertainty for long-tail products such as workers’ compensation.

The incurred
development method is similar to the paid development method, but it uses case incurred losses instead of paid losses. Since the method uses more data (case reserves in addition to paid losses) than the paid development method, the incurred
development patterns may be less variable than paid patterns. However, selection of the incurred loss pattern typically requires analysis of all of the same factors described above. In addition, the



inclusion of case reserves can lead to distortions if changes in case reserving practices have taken place, and the use of case incurred losses may not eliminate the issues associated with
estimating the incurred loss pattern subsequent to the most mature point available.

The loss ratio method multiplies
earned premiums by an expected loss ratio to produce ultimate loss estimates for each accident or policy year. This method may be useful for immature accident or policy periods or if loss development patterns are inconsistent, losses emerge very
slowly, or there is relatively little loss history from which to estimate future losses. The selection of the expected loss ratio typically requires analysis of loss ratios from earlier accident or policy years or pricing studies and analysis of
inflationary trends, frequency trends, rate changes, underwriting changes and other applicable factors.

The
Bornhuetter-Ferguson method using paid loss is a combination of the paid development method and the loss ratio method. This method normally determines expected loss ratios similar to the approach used to estimate the expected loss ratio for the loss
ratio method and typically requires analysis of the same factors described above. This method assumes that future losses will develop at the expected loss ratio level. The percent of paid loss to ultimate loss implied from the paid development
method is used to determine what percentage of ultimate loss is yet to be paid. The use of the pattern from the paid development method typically requires consideration of the same factors listed in the description of the paid development method.
The estimate of losses yet to be paid is added to current paid losses to estimate the ultimate loss for each year. For long-tail lines, this method will react very slowly if actual ultimate loss ratios are different from expectations due to changes
not accounted for by the expected loss ratio calculation.

The Bornhuetter-Ferguson method using incurred loss is similar
to the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method using paid loss except that it uses case incurred losses. The use of case incurred losses instead of paid losses can result in development patterns that are less variable than paid patterns. However, the inclusion
of case reserves can lead to distortions if changes in case reserving have taken place, and the method typically requires analysis of the same factors that need to be reviewed for the loss ratio and incurred development methods.

The frequency times severity method multiplies a projected number of ultimate claims by an estimated ultimate average loss for
each accident or policy year to produce ultimate loss estimates. Since projections of the ultimate number of claims are often less variable than projections of ultimate loss, this method can provide more reliable results for reserve groups where
loss development patterns are inconsistent or too variable to be relied on exclusively. In addition, this method can more directly account for changes in coverage that affect the number and size of claims. However, this method can be difficult to
apply to situations where very large claims or a substantial number of unusual claims result in volatile average claim sizes. Projecting the ultimate number of claims may require analysis of several factors, including the rate at which policyholders
report claims to CNA, the impact of judicial decisions, the impact of underwriting changes and other factors. Estimating the ultimate average loss may require analysis of the impact of large losses and claim cost trends based on changes in the cost
of repairing or replacing property, changes in the cost of medical care, changes in the cost of wage replacement, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors.

Stochastic modeling produces a range of possible outcomes based on varying assumptions related to the particular reserve group
being modeled. For some reserve groups, CNA uses models which rely on historical development patterns at an aggregate level, while other reserve groups are modeled using individual claim variability assumptions supplied by the claims department. In
either case, multiple simulations using varying assumptions are run and the results are analyzed to produce a range of potential outcomes. The results will typically include a mean and percentiles of the possible reserve distribution which aid in
the selection of a point estimate.

For many exposures, especially those that can be considered long-tail, a particular
accident or policy year may not have a sufficient volume of paid losses to produce a statistically reliable estimate of ultimate losses. In such a case, CNA’s actuaries typically assign more weight to the incurred development method than to the
paid development method. As claims continue to settle and the volume of paid loss increases, the actuaries may assign additional weight to the paid development method. For most of CNA’s products, even the incurred losses for accident or policy
years that are early in the claim settlement process will not be of sufficient volume to produce a reliable estimate of ultimate losses. In these cases, CNA may not assign much if any weight to the paid and incurred development methods. CNA may use
the loss ratio, Bornhuetter-Ferguson and/or frequency times severity methods. For short-tail



exposures, the paid and incurred development methods can often be relied on sooner primarily because CNA’s history includes a sufficient number of years to cover the entire period over which
paid and incurred losses are expected to change. However, CNA may also use the loss ratio, Bornhuetter-Ferguson and/or frequency times severity methods for short-tail exposures.

For other more complex reserve groups where the above methods may not produce reliable indications, CNA uses additional
methods tailored to the characteristics of the specific situation.

Periodic Reserve Reviews

The reserve analyses performed by CNA’s actuaries result in point estimates. Each quarter, the results of the detailed
reserve reviews are summarized and discussed with CNA’s senior management to determine the best estimate of reserves. CNA’s senior management considers many factors in making this decision. CNA’s recorded reserves reflect its best
estimate as of a particular point in time based upon known facts and circumstances, consideration of the factors cited above and its judgment. The carried reserve differs from the actuarial point estimate as discussed further below.

Currently, CNA’s recorded reserves are modestly higher than the actuarial point estimate. For Property and Casualty
Operations, the difference between CNA’s reserves and the actuarial point estimate is primarily driven by uncertainty with respect to immature accident years, claim cost inflation, changes in claims handling, changes to the tort environment
which may adversely affect claim costs and the effects from the economy. For CNA’s legacy A&EP liabilities, the difference between CNA’s reserves and the actuarial point estimate is primarily driven by the potential tail volatility of

run-off

exposures.

The key assumptions fundamental to the reserving process are often
different for various reserve groups and accident or policy years. Some of these assumptions are explicit assumptions that are required of a particular method, but most of the assumptions are implicit and cannot be precisely quantified. An example
of an explicit assumption is the pattern employed in the paid development method. However, the assumed pattern is itself based on several implicit assumptions such as the impact of inflation on medical costs and the rate at which claim professionals
close claims. As a result, the effect on reserve estimates of a particular change in assumptions typically cannot be specifically quantified, and changes in these assumptions cannot be tracked over time.

CNA’s recorded reserves are management’s best estimate. In order to provide an indication of the variability
associated with CNA’s net reserves, the following discussion provides a sensitivity analysis that shows the approximate estimated impact of variations in significant factors affecting CNA’s reserve estimates for particular types of
business. These significant factors are the ones that CNA believes could most likely materially affect the reserves. This discussion covers the major types of business for which CNA believes a material deviation to its reserves is reasonably
possible. There can be no assurance that actual experience will be consistent with the current assumptions or with the variation indicated by the discussion. In addition, there can be no assurance that other factors and assumptions will not have a
material impact on CNA’s reserves.

The three areas for which CNA believes a significant deviation to its net
reserves is reasonably possible are (i) professional liability, management liability and surety products; (ii) workers’ compensation and (iii) general liability.

Professional liability, management liability and surety products include professional liability coverages provided to various
professional firms, including architects, real estate agents, small and

mid-sized

accounting firms, law firms and other professional firms. They also include D&O, employment practices, fiduciary, fidelity
and surety coverages, as well as insurance products serving the health care delivery system. The most significant factor affecting reserve estimates for these liability coverages is claim severity. Claim severity is driven by the cost of medical
care, the cost of wage replacement, legal fees, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors. Underwriting and claim handling decisions such as the classes of business written and individual claim settlement decisions can also affect
claim severity. If the estimated claim severity increases by 9%, CNA estimates that net reserves would increase by approximately $450 million. If the estimated claim severity decreases by 3%, CNA estimates that net reserves would decrease by
approximately $150 million. CNA’s net reserves for these products were approximately $5.0 billion as of December 31, 2017.



For workers’ compensation, since many years will pass from the time the
business is written until all claim payments have been made, the most significant factor affecting workers’ compensation reserve estimate is claim cost inflation on claim payments. Workers’ compensation claim cost inflation is driven by
the cost of medical care, the cost of wage replacement, expected claimant lifetimes, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors. If estimated workers’ compensation claim cost inflation increases by 100 basis points for the entire
period over which claim payments will be made, CNA estimates that its net reserves would increase by approximately $350 million. If estimated workers’ compensation claim cost inflation decreases by 100 basis points for the entire period
over which claim payments will be made, CNA estimates that its net reserves would decrease by approximately $350 million. Net reserves for workers’ compensation were approximately $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2017.

For general liability, the most significant factor affecting reserve estimates is claim severity. Claim severity is driven by
changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property, the cost of medical care, the cost of wage replacement, judicial decisions, legislation and other factors. If the estimated claim severity for general liability increases by 6%, CNA estimates
that its net reserves would increase by approximately $200 million. If the estimated claim severity for general liability decreases by 3%, CNA estimates that its net reserves would decrease by approximately $100 million. Net reserves for
general liability were approximately $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2017.

Given the factors described above,
it is not possible to quantify precisely the ultimate exposure represented by claims and related litigation. As a result, CNA regularly reviews the adequacy of its reserves and reassesses its reserve estimates as historical loss experience develops,
additional claims are reported and settled and additional information becomes available in subsequent periods. In reviewing CNA’s reserve estimates, CNA makes adjustments in the period that the need for such adjustments is determined. These
reviews have resulted in CNA’s identification of information and trends that have caused CNA to change its reserves in prior periods and could lead to CNA’s identification of a need for additional material increases or decreases in claim
and claim adjustment expense reserves, which could materially affect our results of operations and equity and CNA’s business and insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings positively or negatively. See Note 8 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 for additional information about reserve development.

Long Term Care Policyholder Reserves

CNA’s Other Insurance Operations includes its

run-off

long term care business as
well as structured settlement obligations not funded by annuities related to certain property and casualty claimants. Long term care policies provide benefits for nursing homes, assisted living facilities and home health care subject to various
daily and lifetime caps. Generally, policyholders must continue to make periodic premium payments to keep the policy in force and CNA has the ability to increase policy premiums, subject to state regulatory approval.

CNA maintains both claim and claim adjustment expense reserves as well as future policy benefit reserves for policyholder
benefits for its long term care business. Claim and claim adjustment expense reserves consist of estimated reserves for long term care policyholders that are currently receiving benefits, including claims that have been incurred but are not yet
reported. In developing the claim and claim adjustment expense reserve estimates for CNA’s long term care policies, its actuaries perform a detailed claim experience study on an annual basis. The study reviews the sufficiency of existing
reserves for policyholders currently on claim and includes an evaluation of expected benefit utilization and claim duration. CNA’s recorded claim and claim adjustment expense reserves reflect CNA management’s best estimate after
incorporating the results of the most recent study. In addition, claim and claim adjustment expense reserves are also maintained for the structured settlement obligations.

Future policy benefit reserves represent the active life reserves related to CNA’s long term care policies and are the
present value of expected future benefit payments and expenses less expected future premium. The determination of these reserves is fundamental to CNA’s financial results and requires management to make estimates and assumptions about expected
investment and policyholder experience over the life of the contract. The assumptions used to determine the active life reserves were unlocked as of December 31, 2015 in connection with the recognition of a premium deficiency. Since many of
these contracts may be in force for several decades, these assumptions are subject to significant estimation risk.

The
actuarial assumptions that management believes are subject to the most variability are morbidity, persistency, discount rate and anticipated future premium rate increases. Persistency can be affected by policy lapses, benefit reductions and death.
Discount rate is influenced by the investment yield on assets supporting long term care reserves which is subject to interest rate and market volatility and may also be affected by changes to the Internal Revenue Code. There is limited historical
company and industry data available to CNA for long term care morbidity and mortality, as only a portion of the policies written to date are in claims paying status. As a result of this variability, CNA’s long term care reserves may be subject
to material increases if actual experience develops adversely to its expectations.

Annually, management assesses the
adequacy of its long term care future policy benefit reserves by performing a GPV to determine if there is a premium deficiency. Management also uses the GPV process to evaluate the adequacy of the claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for
structured settlement obligations. Under the GPV, management estimates required reserves using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the assessment without provisions for adverse deviation. The GPV required reserves are then compared to the
recorded reserves. If the GPV required reserves are greater than the existing recorded reserves, the existing assumptions are unlocked and future policy benefit reserves are increased to the greater amount. Any such increase is reflected in
CNA’s results of



operations in the period in which the need for such adjustment is determined, and could materially adversely affect our results of operations and equity and CNA’s business and insurer
financial strength and corporate debt ratings. Periodically, CNA engages independent third parties to assess the appropriateness of its best estimate assumptions and the associated GPV required reserves. The most recent assessment by an independent
third party was performed in 2017.

The December 31, 2017 GPV indicated recorded reserves included a margin of
approximately $246 million. A summary of the changes in the estimated reserve margin is presented in the table below:

The decrease in the margin in 2017 was driven by the reduction in the U.S federal corporate
income tax rate enacted on December 22, 2017 which reduced the tax equivalent yield on the tax exempt municipal bonds in the investment portfolio supporting the long term care liabilities. A continuation of the low interest rate environment
also drove a reduction in the discount rate assumptions. These unfavorable drivers were mostly offset by favorable changes to the underlying morbidity assumptions, both frequency and severity, higher than expected rate increases on active rate
action programs and favorable changes to the underlying expense assumptions.

The annual long term care claim experience
study resulted in a release of $42 million from claim reserves driven by favorable frequency and severity relative to expectations.



The table below summarizes the estimated pretax impact on CNA’s results of
operations from various hypothetical revisions to CNA’s active life reserve assumptions. The annual GPV process involves updating all assumptions to the then current best estimate, and historically all significant assumptions have been revised
each year. In the hypothetical revisions table below, CNA has assumed that revisions to such assumptions would occur in each policy type, age and duration within each policy group and would occur absent any changes, mitigating or otherwise, in the
other assumptions. Although such hypothetical revisions are not currently required or anticipated, CNA believes they could occur based on past variances in experience and its expectations of the ranges of future experience that could reasonably
occur. Any required increase in the recorded reserves resulting from the hypothetical revision in the table below would first reduce the margin in CNA’s carried reserves before it would affect results of operations. Any actual adjustment would
be dependent on the specific policies affected and, therefore, may differ from the estimate summarized below. The estimated impacts to results of operations in the table below are after consideration of the existing margin.

As reflected in the long term care active life reserve - change in estimated reserve margin
table on the preceding page, the reduction in the U.S federal corporate income tax rate adversely affected the value of the tax benefit received on tax exempt municipal investments and thus the rate at which CNA discounts its long term care active
life reserves. Any future reduction in income tax rates could further adversely affect CNA’s GPV discount rates.

CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE

Group North American
Property Treaty

CNA purchases corporate catastrophe

excess-of-loss

treaty reinsurance covering its U.S. states and territories and Canadian property exposures underwritten in its North American and

non-Lloyd’s

European companies. The treaty has a term of January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018. The 2018 treaty provides coverage for the accumulation of losses from catastrophe occurrences above
CNA’s per occurrence retention of $250 million up to $1.0 billion, with 10%

co-participation

on the first $650 million above the retention and 20%

co-participation

on the top $100 million layer. Losses stemming from terrorism events are covered unless they are due to a nuclear, biological or chemical attack. All layers of the treaty provide for one
full reinstatement.

Group Workers Compensation Treaty

CNA also purchases corporate Workers Compensation catastrophe

excess-of-loss

treaty reinsurance for the period January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 providing $275 million of coverage for the accumulation of covered
losses related to natural catastrophes above CNA’s retention of $25 million. The treaty provides $475 million of coverage for the accumulation of covered losses related to terrorism events above CNA’s retention of
$25 million. Of the $475 million in terrorism coverage, $200 million is provided for nuclear, biological, chemical and radiation events. One full reinstatement is available for the first $275 million above the retention,
regardless of the covered peril. CNA purchases a targeted facultative facility to address exposure accumulations in specific peak terrorism zones.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP
requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.



The Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes have been prepared
in accordance with GAAP, applied on a consistent basis. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. In general, our estimates are based on historical experience, evaluation of
current trends, information from third party professionals and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the known facts and circumstances.

We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our Consolidated Financial
Statements as their application places the most significant demands on our judgment. Due to the inherent uncertainties involved with these types of judgments, actual results could differ significantly from estimates, which may have a material
adverse impact on our results of operations and/or equity and CNA’s insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings.

Insurance Reserves

Insurance reserves are established for both short and long-duration insurance contracts. Short-duration contracts are
primarily related to property and casualty insurance policies where the reserving process is based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss, including amounts for known and unknown claims. Long-duration contracts are primarily related to long
term care policies and are estimated using actuarial estimates about morbidity and persistency as well as assumptions about expected investment returns and future premium rate increases. The reserve for unearned premiums on property and casualty
contracts represents the portion of premiums written related to the unexpired terms of coverage. The reserving process is discussed in further detail in the Insurance Reserves section of this MD&A.

Reinsurance and Other Receivables

Exposure exists with respect to the collectibility of ceded property and casualty and life reinsurance to the extent that any
reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations or disputes the liabilities CNA has ceded under reinsurance agreements. An allowance for doubtful accounts on reinsurance receivables is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from
reinsurers, reinsurer solvency, industry experience and current economic conditions. Further information on CNA’s reinsurance receivables is included in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

Additionally, exposure exists with respect to the collectibility of amounts due from customers on other receivables. An
allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due, currently as well as in the future, management’s experience and current economic conditions.

If actual experience differs from the estimates made by management in determining the allowances for doubtful accounts on
reinsurance and other receivables, net receivables as reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets may not be collected. Therefore, our results of operations and/or equity could be materially adversely affected.

Valuation of Investments and Impairment of Securities

We classify fixed maturity securities and equity securities as either

available-for-sale

or trading which are both carried at fair value on the balance sheet. Fair value represents the price that would be received in a sale of an asset in an orderly transaction between market
participants on the measurement date, the determination of which requires us to make a significant number of assumptions and judgments. Securities with the greatest level of subjectivity around valuation are those that rely on inputs that are
significant to the estimated fair value and that are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. These unobservable inputs are based on assumptions consistent with what we believe
other market participants would use to price such securities. Further information on fair value measurements is included in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

CNA’s investment portfolio is subject to market declines below amortized cost that may be other-than-temporary and
therefore result in the recognition of impairment losses in earnings. Factors considered in the determination of whether or not a decline is other-than-temporary include a current intention or need to sell the security or an indication that a credit
loss exists. Significant judgment exists regarding the evaluation of the financial condition and



expected near-term and long term prospects of the issuer, the relevant industry conditions and trends, and whether CNA expects to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized
cost basis of the security. Further information on CNA’s process for evaluating impairments is included in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

Long Term Care Policies

Future policy benefit reserves for CNA’s long term care policies are based on certain assumptions including morbidity,
persistency, inclusive of mortality, discount rates and future premium rate increases. The adequacy of the reserves is contingent upon actual experience and CNA’s future expectations related to these key assumptions. If actual or CNA’s
expected future experience differs from these assumptions, the reserves may not be adequate, requiring CNA to add to reserves.

A prolonged period during which interest rates remain at levels lower than those anticipated in CNA’s reserving discount
rate assumption could result in shortfalls in investment income on assets supporting CNA’s obligations under long term care policies, which may also require an increase to CNA’s reserves. In addition, CNA may not receive regulatory
approval for the premium rate increases it requests.

These changes to CNA’s reserves could materially adversely
impact our results of operations and equity. The reserving process is discussed in further detail in the Insurance Reserves section of this MD&A.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We review our long-lived assets for impairment when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
not be recoverable. We use a probability-weighted cash flow analysis to test property and equipment for impairment based on relevant market data. If an asset is determined to be impaired, a loss is recognized to reduce the carrying amount to the
fair value of the asset. Management’s cash flow assumptions are an inherent part of our asset impairment evaluation and the use of different assumptions could produce results that differ from the reported amounts.

Income Taxes

Deferred
income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return bases of assets and liabilities. Any resulting future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely
than not, and a valuation allowance is established for any portion of a deferred tax asset that management believes may not be realized. The assessment of the need for a valuation allowance requires management to make estimates and assumptions about
future earnings, reversal of existing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies. If actual experience differs from these estimates and assumptions, the recorded deferred tax asset may not be fully realized, resulting in an increase
to income tax expense in our results of operations. In addition, the ability to record deferred tax assets in the future could be limited resulting in a higher effective tax rate in that future period.

We have not established deferred tax liabilities for certain of our foreign earnings as we intend to indefinitely reinvest
those earnings to finance foreign activities. However, if these earnings become subject to U.S. federal tax, any required provision could have a material impact on our financial results.

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE

For a discussion of accounting standards updates that have been adopted or will be adopted in the future, please read Note 1
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this Report as well as some statements in other SEC filings and
periodic press releases and some oral statements made by us and our subsidiaries and our and their officials during presentations may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995 (the “Act”). Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, any



statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact and may project, indicate or imply future results, events, performance or achievements. Such statements may contain the
words “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. In addition,
any statement concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects, and possible actions taken by us or our subsidiaries are also forward-looking statements as
defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are inherently subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected.

Developments in any of the risks or uncertainties
facing us or our subsidiaries, including those described under Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Report and in our other filings with the SEC, could cause our results to differ materially from results that have been or may be anticipated or projected.
Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update these
statements to reflect any change in our expectations or beliefs or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any forward-looking statement is based.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

We are a large diversified holding company. As such, we and our subsidiaries have significant amounts of financial instruments
that involve market risk. Our measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair value of our financial instruments. Changes in the trading portfolio are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Market risk
exposure is presented for each class of financial instrument held by us at December 31, assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described below. We believe that the various rates of adverse market movements represent a
measure of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions. The estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected actual loss, even
under adverse conditions, because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ. In addition, since our investment portfolio is subject to change based on our portfolio management strategy as well as in response to changes in the market, these
estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results which may occur.

Exposure to market risk is managed and
monitored by senior management. Senior management approves our overall investment strategy and has responsibility to ensure that the investment positions are consistent with that strategy with an acceptable level of risk. We may manage risk by
buying or selling instruments or entering into offsetting positions.

Interest Rate Risk – We have exposure to
interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk by utilizing instruments such as interest rate swaps, commitments to purchase securities, options,
futures and forwards. We monitor our sensitivity to interest rate changes by revaluing financial assets and liabilities using a variety of different interest rates. The Company uses duration and convexity at the security level to estimate the change
in fair value that would result from a change in each security’s yield. Duration measures the price sensitivity of an asset to changes in the yield rate. Convexity measures how the duration of the asset changes with interest rates. The duration
and convexity analysis takes into account the unique characteristics (e.g., call and put options and prepayment expectations) of each security, in determining the hypothetical change in fair value. The analysis is performed at the security level and
is aggregated up to the asset category level.

The evaluation is performed by applying an instantaneous change in the
yield rates by varying magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in rates would have on the recorded market value of our investments and the resulting effect on shareholders’ equity. The analysis presents the
sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices which we believe are reasonably possible over a one year period.

The sensitivity analysis estimates the change in the fair value of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities that were
held on December 31, 2017 and 2016 due to an instantaneous change in the yield of the security at the end of the period of 100 basis points, with all other variables held constant.



The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in
advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Accordingly, the analysis may not be indicative of, is not intended to provide, and does not provide a precise forecast of the
effect of changes of market interest rates on our earnings or shareholders’ equity. Further, the computations do not contemplate any actions we could undertake in response to changes in interest rates.

Our debt is primarily denominated in U.S. Dollars and has been primarily issued at fixed rates, therefore, interest expense
would not be impacted by interest rate shifts. The impact of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on fixed rate debt would result in a decrease in market value of $630 million and $544 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016.
The impact of a 100 basis point decrease would result in an increase in market value of $694 million and $605 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016. Consolidated Container has entered into interest rate swaps for a notional amount of
$500 million to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in LIBOR on a portion of its variable rate debt. These swaps effectively fix the interest rate on the hedged portion of the term loan at approximately 2.1% plus an applicable margin. At
December 31, 2017, the impact of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on variable rate debt, net of the effects of the swaps, would increase interest expense by approximately $5 million on an annual basis.

Equity Price Risk – We have exposure to equity price risk as a result of our investment in equity securities and equity
derivatives. Equity price risk results from changes in the level or volatility of equity prices which affect the value of equity securities or instruments that derive their value from such securities or indexes. Equity price risk was measured
assuming an instantaneous 25% decrease in the underlying reference price or index from its level at December 31, 2017 and 2016, with all other variables held constant. A model was developed to analyze the observed changes in the value of
limited partnerships held by the Company over a multiple year period along with the corresponding changes in various equity indices. The result of the model allowed us to estimate the change in value of limited partnerships when equity markets
decline by 25%.

Foreign Exchange Rate Risk – Foreign exchange rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in
foreign currency exchange rates will impact the value of financial instruments. We have foreign exchange rate exposure when we buy or sell foreign currencies or financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency, which is reduced through the
use of forward contracts. The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 20% decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar from their levels at December 31, 2017 and 2016, with all other variables held constant.

Commodity Price Risk – We have exposure to price risk as a result of our investments in commodities. Commodity price risk
results from changes in the level or volatility of commodity prices that impact instruments which derive their value from such commodities. Commodity price risk was measured assuming an instantaneous decrease of 20% from their levels at
December 31, 2017 and 2016.

We have exposure to price risk as a result of Consolidated Container’s purchases of
certain raw materials, such as high-density polyethylene, polycarbonate, polypropylene and polyethylene terephthalate resins in connection with the production of its products. The purchase prices of these raw materials are determined based on
prevailing market conditions. While Consolidated Container’s operations are affected by fluctuations in resin prices, its net income over time is generally unaffected by these changes because industry practice and many Consolidated Container
contractual arrangements permit or require Consolidated Container to pass through these cost changes to its customers. In the future, however, Consolidated Container may not always be able to pass through these changes in raw material costs in a
timely manner or at all due to competitive pressures.

Credit Risk – We are exposed to credit risk relating to the
risk of loss resulting from the nonperformance by a customer of its contractual obligations. Although nearly all of the Company’s customers pay for its services on a timely basis, the Company actively monitors the credit exposure to its
customers. Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries may perform credit reviews of customers and may require customers to provide cash collateral, post a letter of credit, prepay for services or provide other credit enhancements.

rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices) on the basis of those entered into for trading purposes and other than trading purposes.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Exchange Act Rules

13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f))

for us. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of
Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.

There are inherent
limitations to the effectiveness of any control system, however well designed, including the possibility of human error and the possible circumvention or overriding of controls. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that
there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Management must make judgments with respect to the relative cost and expected benefits of any specific control measure. The design of a control
system also is based in part upon assumptions and judgments made by management about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that a control will be effective under all potential future conditions. As a result, even an
effective system of internal control over financial reporting can provide no more than reasonable assurance with respect to the fair presentation of financial statements and the processes under which they were prepared.

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017. In
making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)

. Based on this assessment, our management believes
that, as of December 31, 2017, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.

Our independent
registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued an audit report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The report of Deloitte & Touche LLP follows this Report.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the shareholders and Board of Directors of Loews Corporation

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Loews Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”)
as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, of the Company and our report dated February 15, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial
statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in
accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the shareholders and Board of Directors of Loews Corporation

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Loews Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”)
as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes and the
schedules listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 15, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and
are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also
included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Loews Corporation and Subsidiaries

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of presentation

– Loews Corporation is a holding company. Its subsidiaries are engaged in the following
lines of business: commercial property and casualty insurance (CNA Financial Corporation (“CNA”), a 89% owned subsidiary); the operation of offshore oil and gas drilling rigs (Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (“Diamond
Offshore”), a 53% owned subsidiary); transportation and storage of natural gas and natural gas liquids (Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP (“Boardwalk Pipeline”), a 51% owned subsidiary); the operation of a chain of hotels (Loews Hotels
Holding Corporation (“Loews Hotels & Co”), a wholly owned subsidiary); and the manufacture of rigid plastic packaging solutions (Consolidated Container Company LLC (“Consolidated Container”), a 99% owned subsidiary).
Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “Company,” “Loews” and “Registrant” as used herein mean Loews Corporation excluding its subsidiaries and the term “Net income (loss) attributable to Loews
Corporation” as used herein means Net income (loss) attributable to Loews Corporation shareholders.

Principles of
consolidation

– The Consolidated Financial Statements include all subsidiaries and intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The equity method of accounting is used for investments in associated companies in which the
Company generally has an interest of 20% to 50%.

Accounting estimates

– The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements
and the related notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Investments

– The Company classifies
its fixed maturity securities and equity securities as either

available-for-sale

or trading, and as such, they are carried at fair value. Short term investments are
carried at fair value. Changes in fair value of trading securities are reported within Net investment income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Changes in fair value related to

available-for-sale

securities are reported as a component of Other comprehensive income. Losses may be recognized within the Consolidated Statements of Income when a
decline in value is determined by the Company to be other-than-temporary.

The cost of fixed maturity securities
classified as

available-for-sale

is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, which are included in Net investment income on the Consolidated
Statements of Income. The amortization of premium and accretion of discount for fixed maturity securities takes into consideration call and maturity dates that produce the lowest yield. In 2015, the Company changed its accounting principle as
previously the amortization of premiums was to maturity. This change in estimate, effected by a change in accounting principle was adopted in the fourth quarter of 2015 and decreased Net investment income by $39 million in the Consolidated
Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease to Net investment income included a $22 million cumulative adjustment relating to prior periods. The total adjustment decreased basic and diluted net income per share
by $0.06 for the year ended December 31, 2015.

For asset-backed securities included in fixed maturity securities,
the Company recognizes income using an effective yield based on anticipated prepayments and the estimated economic life of the securities. When estimates of prepayments change, the effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments to date
and anticipated future payments.

To the extent that unrealized gains on fixed income securities supporting long term care
products and structured settlements not funded by annuities would result in a premium deficiency if those gains were realized, a related increase in Insurance reserves is recorded, net of tax and noncontrolling interests, as a reduction of net
unrealized gains through Other comprehensive income (“Shadow Adjustments”). Shadow Adjustments increased $355 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) and decreased $87 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) for
the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, net unrealized gains on investments included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) were correspondingly reduced by Shadow Adjustments of
$1.3 billion and $909 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests).



The Company’s carrying value of investments in limited partnerships is its
share of the net asset value of each partnership, as determined by the general partner. Certain partnerships for which results are not available on a timely basis are reported on a lag, primarily three months or less. These investments are accounted
for under the equity method and changes in net asset values are recorded within Net investment income on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Investments in derivative securities are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported as a component of
Investment gains (losses), Income (loss) from trading portfolio, or Other comprehensive income (loss), depending on their hedge designation. A derivative is typically defined as an instrument whose value is “derived” from an underlying
instrument, index or rate, has a notional amount, requires little or no initial investment and can be net settled. Derivatives include, but are not limited to, the following types of investments: interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and
floors, put and call options, warrants, futures, forwards, commitments to purchase securities, credit default swaps and combinations of the foregoing. Derivatives embedded within

non-derivative

instruments
(such as call options embedded in convertible bonds) must be split from the host instrument when the embedded derivative is not clearly and closely related to the host instrument.

A security is impaired if the fair value of the security is less than its cost adjusted for accretion, amortization and
previously recorded other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) losses, otherwise defined as an unrealized loss. When a security is impaired, the impairment is evaluated to determine whether it is temporary or other-than-temporary.

Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether an OTTI loss has occurred for a security. CNA follows a
consistent and systematic process for determining and recording an OTTI loss including the evaluation of securities in an unrealized loss position on at least a quarterly basis.

CNA’s assessment of whether an OTTI loss has occurred incorporates both quantitative and qualitative information. Fixed
maturity securities that CNA intends to sell, or it more likely than not will be required to sell before recovery of amortized cost, are considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired and the entire difference between the amortized cost basis and
fair value of the security is recognized as an OTTI loss in earnings. The remaining fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position are evaluated to determine if a credit loss exists. The factors considered include: (i) the financial
condition and near term and long term prospects of the issuer, (ii) whether the debtor is current on interest and principal payments, (iii) credit ratings of the securities and (iv) general market conditions and industry or sector
specific outlook. CNA also considers results and analysis of cash flow modeling for asset-backed securities, and when appropriate, other fixed maturity securities.

The focus of the analysis for asset-backed securities is on assessing the sufficiency and quality of underlying collateral and
timing of cash flows based on scenario tests. If the present value of the modeled expected cash flows equals or exceeds the amortized cost of a security, no credit loss is judged to exist and the asset-backed security is deemed to be temporarily
impaired. If the present value of the expected cash flows is significantly less than amortized cost, the security is judged to be other-than-temporarily impaired for credit reasons and that shortfall, referred to as the credit component, is
recognized as an OTTI loss in earnings. The difference between the adjusted amortized cost basis and fair value, referred to as the

non-credit

component, is recognized as OTTI in Other comprehensive income. In
subsequent reporting periods, a change in intent to sell or further credit impairment on a security whose fair value has not deteriorated will cause the

non-credit

component originally recorded as OTTI in
Other comprehensive income to be recognized as an OTTI loss in earnings.

CNA performs the discounted cash flow analysis
using stressed scenarios to determine future expectations regarding recoverability. Significant assumptions enter into these cash flow projections including delinquency rates, probable risk of default, loss severity upon a default, over
collateralization and interest coverage triggers and credit support from lower level tranches.

CNA applies the same
impairment model as described above for the majority of its

non-redeemable

preferred stock securities on the basis that these securities possess characteristics similar to debt securities. For all other equity
securities, in determining whether the security is other-than-temporarily impaired, CNA considers a number of factors including, but not limited to: (i) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized
cost, (ii) the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, (iii) the intent and ability of CNA to



retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value and (iv) general market conditions and industry or sector specific outlook.

Joint venture investments

– The Company had approximately 20% to 50% interests in operating joint ventures related
to hotel properties that are accounted for under the equity method. The Company’s investment in these entities was $237 million and $217 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and reported in Other assets on the
Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Equity income for these investments was $81 million, $41 million and $43 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 and reported in Other operating expenses on the
Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income. Some of these investments are variable interest entities (“VIE”) as defined in the accounting guidance because the entities will require additional funding from each equity owner throughout
the development and construction phase and are accounted for under the equity method since the Company is not the primary beneficiary. The maximum exposure to loss for the VIE investments is $273 million, consisting of the amount of the
investment and debt guarantees.

The following tables present summarized financial information for these joint ventures:

Hedging

– The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging
instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Company also formally assesses (both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis) whether the derivatives
that are used in hedging transactions have been highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. When it is determined that
a derivative for which hedge accounting has been designated is not (or ceases to be) highly effective, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. See Note 3 for additional information on the Company’s use of derivatives.

Securities lending activities

– The Company lends securities for the purpose of enhancing income or to finance
positions to unrelated parties who have been designated as primary dealers by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Borrowers of these securities must deposit and maintain collateral with the Company of no less than 100% of the fair value of the
securities loaned. U.S. Government securities and cash are accepted as collateral. The Company maintains effective control over loaned securities and, therefore, continues to report such securities as investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Securities lending is typically done on a matched-book basis where the collateral is invested to substantially match the
term of the loan. This matching of terms tends to limit risk. In accordance with the Company’s lending agreements, securities on loan are returned immediately to the Company upon notice. Collateral is not reflected as an asset of the Company.
There was no collateral held at December 31, 2017 and 2016.

Revenue recognition

– Premiums on property
and casualty insurance contracts are recognized in proportion to the underlying risk insured and are principally earned ratably over the duration of the policies. Premiums on long term care contracts are earned ratably over the policy year in which
they are due. The reserve for unearned premiums represents the portion of premiums written relating to the unexpired terms of coverage.

Insurance receivables include balances due currently or in the future, including amounts due from insureds related to losses
under high deductible policies, and are presented at unpaid balances, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Amounts are considered past due based on policy payment terms. The allowance is determined based on



periodic evaluations of aged receivables, management’s experience and current economic conditions. Insurance receivables and any related allowance are written off after collection efforts
are exhausted or a negotiated settlement is reached.

Property and casualty contracts that are retrospectively rated
contain provisions that result in an adjustment to the initial policy premium depending on the contract provisions and loss experience of the insured during the experience period. For such contracts, CNA estimates the amount of ultimate premiums
that it may earn upon completion of the experience period and recognizes either an asset or a liability for the difference between the initial policy premium and the estimated ultimate premium. CNA adjusts such estimated ultimate premium amounts
during the course of the experience period based on actual results to date. The resulting adjustment is recorded as either a reduction of or an increase to the earned premiums for the period.

Contract drilling revenue from dayrate drilling contracts is recognized as services are performed. In connection with such
drilling contracts, Diamond Offshore may receive fees (either

lump-sum

or dayrate) for the mobilization of equipment. These fees are earned as services are performed over the initial term of the related
drilling contracts. Absent a contract, mobilization costs are recognized currently. From time to time, Diamond Offshore may receive fees from its customers for capital improvements to their rigs. Diamond Offshore defers such fees received and
recognizes these fees into revenue on a straight-line basis over the period of the related drilling contract. Diamond Offshore capitalizes the costs of such capital improvements and depreciates them over the estimated useful life of the improvement.

Revenues from transportation and storage services are recognized in the period the service is provided based on
contractual terms and the related transported and stored volumes. The majority of Boardwalk Pipeline’s operating subsidiaries are subject to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) regulations and, accordingly, certain revenues
collected may be subject to possible refunds to its customers. An estimated refund liability is recorded considering regulatory proceedings, advice of counsel and estimated total exposure.

Claim and claim adjustment expense reserves

– Claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, except reserves for
structured settlements not associated with asbestos and environmental pollution (“A&EP”), workers’ compensation lifetime claims and long term care claims, are not discounted and are based on (i) case basis estimates for
losses reported on direct business, adjusted in the aggregate for ultimate loss expectations; (ii) estimates of incurred but not reported losses; (iii) estimates of losses on assumed reinsurance; (iv) estimates of future expenses to
be incurred in the settlement of claims; (v) estimates of salvage and subrogation recoveries and (vi) estimates of amounts due from insureds related to losses under high deductible policies. Management considers current conditions and
trends as well as past CNA and industry experience in establishing these estimates. The effects of inflation, which can be significant, are implicitly considered in the reserving process and are part of the recorded reserve balance. Ceded claim and
claim adjustment expense reserves are reported as a component of Receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Claim
and claim adjustment expense reserves are presented net of anticipated amounts due from insureds related to losses under deductible policies of $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. A significant portion of these amounts are
supported by collateral. CNA also has an allowance for uncollectible deductible amounts, which is presented as a component of the allowance for doubtful accounts included in Receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Structured settlements have been negotiated for certain property and casualty insurance claims. Structured settlements are
agreements to provide fixed periodic payments to claimants. CNA’s obligations for structured settlements not funded by annuities are included in claim and claim adjustment expense reserves and carried at present values determined using interest
rates ranging from 5.5% to 8.0% at December 31, 2017 and 2016. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the discounted reserves for unfunded structured settlements were $527 million and $544 million, net of discount of $798 million
and $841 million. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the amount of interest recognized on the discounted reserves of unfunded structured settlements was $41 million, $42 million and $42 million. This
interest accretion is presented as a component of Insurance claims and policyholders’ benefits on the Consolidated Statements of Income but is excluded from the disclosure of prior year development.



Workers’ compensation lifetime claim reserves are calculated using mortality
assumptions determined through statutory regulation and economic factors. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, workers’ compensation lifetime claim reserves are discounted at a 3.5% interest rate. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the
discounted reserves for workers’ compensation lifetime claim reserves were $346 million and $371 million, net of discount of $190 million and $202 million. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the
amount of interest accretion recognized on the discounted reserves of workers’ compensation lifetime claim reserves was $19 million, $17 million and $20 million. This interest accretion is presented as a component of Insurance
claims and policyholders’ benefits on the Consolidated Statements of Income, but is excluded from the Company’s disclosure of prior year development.

Long term care claim reserves are calculated using mortality and morbidity assumptions based on CNA and industry experience.
Long term care claim reserves are discounted at an interest rate of 6.0% at December 31, 2017 and interest rates ranging from 4.5% to 6.8% at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, such discounted reserves totaled
$2.4 billion and $2.2 billion, net of discount of $446 million and $529 million.

Future policy
benefit reserves

– Future policy benefit reserves represent the active life reserves related to CNA’s long term care policies and are computed using the net level premium method, which incorporates actuarial assumptions as to
morbidity, persistency, inclusive of mortality, discount rate, future premium rate adjustments and expenses. Expense assumptions primarily relate to claim adjudication. Actuarial assumptions generally vary by plan, age at issue policy duration and
gender. The initial assumptions are determined at issuance, including a margin for adverse deviation, and are locked in throughout the life of the contract unless a premium deficiency develops. If a premium deficiency emerges, the assumptions are
unlocked and deferred acquisition costs, if any, and the future policy benefit reserves are adjusted. The December 31, 2015 gross premium valuation (“GPV”) indicated a premium deficiency of $296 million. The indicated premium
deficiency necessitated a charge to income that was effected by the write off of the entire long term care deferred acquisition cost asset of $289 million and an increase to active life reserves of $7 million. The GPV as of
December 31, 2017 and 2016 indicated the carried reserves were sufficient, therefore there was no unlocking of assumptions. Interest rates for long term care active life reserves range from 6.6% to 7.0% as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.

Guaranty fund and other insurance-related assessments

– Liabilities for guaranty fund and other
insurance-related assessments are accrued when an assessment is probable, when it can be reasonably estimated and when the event obligating the entity to pay an imposed or probable assessment has occurred. Liabilities for guaranty funds and other
insurance-related assessments are not discounted and are included as part of Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the liability balances were $121 million and $125 million.

Reinsurance

– Reinsurance accounting allows for contractual cash flows to be reflected as premiums and losses. To
qualify for reinsurance accounting, reinsurance agreements must include risk transfer. To meet risk transfer requirements, a reinsurance contract must include both insurance risk, consisting of underwriting and timing risk, and a reasonable
possibility of a significant loss for the assuming entity.

Reinsurance receivables related to paid losses are presented
at unpaid balances. Reinsurance receivables related to unpaid losses are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefit reserves. Reinsurance receivables are reported net of an allowance
for doubtful accounts on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The cost of reinsurance is primarily accounted for over the life of the underlying reinsured policies using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the underlying policies or
over the reinsurance contract period. The ceding of insurance does not discharge the primary liability of CNA.

CNA has
established an allowance for doubtful accounts on reinsurance receivables which relates to both amounts already billed on ceded paid losses as well as ceded reserves that will be billed when losses are paid in the future. The allowance for doubtful
accounts on reinsurance receivables is estimated on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from reinsurers, reinsurer solvency, industry experience and current economic conditions. Reinsurer financial strength ratings are updated and
reviewed on an annual basis or sooner if CNA becomes aware of significant changes related to a reinsurer. Because billed receivables generally approximate 3% or less of total reinsurance receivables, the age of the reinsurance receivables related to
paid losses is not a significant input into the



allowance analysis. Changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts on reinsurance receivables are presented as a component of Insurance claims and policyholders’ benefits on the Consolidated
Statements of Income.

Amounts are considered past due based on the reinsurance contract terms. Reinsurance receivables
related to paid losses and any related allowance are written off after collection efforts have been exhausted or a negotiated settlement is reached with the reinsurer. Reinsurance receivables from insolvent insurers related to paid losses are
written off when the settlement due from the estate can be reasonably estimated. At the time reinsurance receivables related to paid losses are written off, any required adjustment to reinsurance receivables related to unpaid losses is recorded as a
component of Insurance claims and policyholders’ benefits on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Reinsurance
contracts that do not effectively transfer the economic risk of loss on the underlying policies are recorded using the deposit method of accounting, which requires that premium paid or received by the ceding company or assuming company be accounted
for as a deposit asset or liability. CNA had $8 million and $3 million recorded as deposit assets at December 31, 2017 and 2016, and $4 million and $6 million recorded as deposit liabilities as of December 31, 2017 and
2016. Income on reinsurance contracts accounted for under the deposit method is recognized using an effective yield based on the anticipated timing of payments and the remaining life of the contract. When the anticipated timing of payments changes,
the effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments to date and the estimated timing of future payments. The deposit asset or liability is adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been applied since the
inception of the contract.

A loss portfolio transfer is a retroactive reinsurance contract. If the cumulative claim and
allocated claim adjustment expenses ceded under a loss portfolio transfer exceed the consideration paid, the resulting gain from such excess is deferred and amortized into earnings in future periods in proportion to actual recoveries under the loss
portfolio transfer. In any period in which there is a gain position and a revised estimate of claim and allocated claim adjustment expenses, a portion of the deferred gain is cumulatively recognized in earnings as if the revised estimate was
available at the inception date of the loss portfolio transfer.

Deferred acquisition costs

– Deferrable
acquisition costs include commissions, premium taxes and certain underwriting and policy issuance costs which are incremental direct costs of successful contract acquisitions. Acquisition costs related to property and casualty business are deferred
and amortized ratably over the period the related premiums are earned. Deferred acquisition costs are presented net of ceding commissions and other ceded acquisition costs.

CNA evaluates deferred acquisition costs for recoverability. Anticipated investment income is considered in the determination
of the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs. Adjustments, if necessary, are recorded in current period results of operations.

Deferred acquisition costs related to long term care contracts issued prior to January 1, 2004 include costs which vary
with and are primarily related to the acquisition of business. As noted under Future policy benefit reserves, all of the long term care deferred acquisition costs of $289 million were written off as of December 31, 2015 in recognition of a
premium deficiency.

Goodwill and other intangible assets

– Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price
over fair value of net assets of acquired entities. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or when certain triggering events require additional tests. Subsequent reversal of a goodwill impairment charge is not permitted.

Other intangible assets are reported within Other assets. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated
useful lives. Indefinite-lived other intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or when certain triggering events require such tests. See Note 7 for additional information on the Company’s goodwill and other intangible assets.

Property, plant and equipment

– Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. Depreciation is computed principally by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the various classes of properties. Leaseholds and leasehold improvements are depreciated or amortized over the terms of the related
leases (including optional renewal periods where appropriate) or the estimated lives of improvements, if less than the lease term.



The principal service lives used in computing provisions for depreciation are as follows:

Years

Pipeline equipment

30 to 50

Offshore drilling equipment

15 to 30

Other

3 to 40

Impairment of long-lived assets

–Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment
when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets and intangibles with finite lives, under certain circumstances, are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value. Assets
to be disposed of and assets not expected to provide any future service potential to the Company are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.

Income taxes

– The Company and its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated tax return. Deferred income taxes are
recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return bases of assets and liabilities, based on enacted tax rates and other provisions of the tax law. The effect of a change in tax laws or rates on deferred tax assets
and liabilities is recognized in income in the period in which such change is enacted. Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not, and a valuation allowance is established for any
portion of a deferred tax asset that management believes may not be realized.

The Company recognizes uncertain tax
positions that it has taken or expects to take on a tax return. The tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having
full knowledge of all relevant information. See Note 10 for additional information on the provision for income taxes.

Pension and postretirement benefits

– The Company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of its defined
benefit plans in Other assets or Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in funded status related to prior service costs and credits and actuarial gains and losses are recognized in the year in which the changes occur through
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The Company measures its benefit plan assets and obligations at December 31. Annual service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of prior service costs and credits and
amortization of actuarial gains and losses are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Stock-based
compensation

– The Company records compensation expense upon issuance, modification or cancellation of all share-based payment awards granted, primarily on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, generally three to four
years. Stock Appreciation Rights (“SARs”) are valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive. These assumptions include the term
that the awards are expected to be outstanding, an estimate of the volatility of the underlying stock price, applicable risk-free interest rates and the dividend yield of the Company’s stock. Restricted Stock Units are valued using the
grant-date fair value of the Company’s stock.

Net income per share

– Companies with complex capital
structures are required to present basic and diluted net income per share. Basic net income per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stock by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
for the period. Diluted net income per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock.

For each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, approximately 0.9 million, 0.4 million and
0.3 million potential shares attributable to issuances and exercises under the Loews Corporation 2016 Incentive Compensation Plan and the prior plan were included in the calculation of diluted net income per share. For those same periods,
approximately 0.4 million, 3.7 million and 4.8 million shares attributable to employee stock-based compensation awards were not included in the calculation of diluted net income per share because the effect would have been
antidilutive.



Foreign currency

– Foreign currency translation gains and losses are
reflected in Shareholders’ equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The Company’s foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheet accounts are translated at the exchange rates in effect at each reporting date and
income statement accounts are translated at the average exchange rates during the reporting period. Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) of $26 million, $(21) million and $(8) million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and
2015 were included in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Regulatory accounting

– The majority of
Boardwalk Pipeline’s operating subsidiaries are regulated by FERC. GAAP for regulated entities requires Texas Gas Transmission, LLC (“Texas Gas”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Boardwalk Pipeline, to report certain assets and
liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the manner in which independent third party regulators establish rates. Effective April 1, 2016, Gulf South Pipeline, LP (“Gulf South”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Boardwalk
Pipeline, implemented a fuel tracker pursuant to a FERC rate case settlement, for which Gulf South applies regulatory accounting. Accordingly, certain costs and benefits are capitalized as regulatory assets and liabilities in order to provide for
recovery from or refund to customers in future periods. Other than as described for Texas Gas and Gulf South, regulatory accounting is not applicable to Boardwalk Pipeline’s other FERC regulated entities or operations.

Supplementary cash flow information

– Cash payments made for interest on long term debt, net of capitalized
interest, amounted to $533 million, $511 million and $513 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Cash payments for federal, foreign, state and local income taxes amounted to $166 million,
$114 million and $110 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Investing activities include $87 million of previously accrued capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2017 and exclude
$18 million and $3 million of accrued capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.

Accounting changes –

In March of 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued
Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”)

2016-09,

“Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.” The updated accounting guidance
simplifies the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including income tax consequences and classification on the statement of cash flows. As of January 1, 2017, the Company adopted the updated accounting guidance and began
recognizing excess tax benefits or deficiencies on vesting or settlement of awards as an income tax benefit or expense within net income and classifying the related cash flows within operating activities. The change impacted the amount and timing of
income tax expense recognition as well as the calculation of diluted earnings per share. The accounting change did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

Recently issued ASUs –

In May of 2014, the FASB issued ASU

2014-09,

“Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).” The core principle of the new accounting guidance is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects
the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new accounting guidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized and requires enhanced
disclosures about revenue. The guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and may be adopted either retrospectively or on a modified basis, with a cumulative effect adjustment to the
opening balance sheet at the date of adoption. The Company expects to adopt this updated guidance using the modified retrospective method. The adoption of the revenue standard will result in additional disclosures to enable users of financial
statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. This will include additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding contracts with customers, including
the nature of the related performance obligations, the contract asset and liability balances for customer contracts, including significant changes to these balances and significant judgments made in applying the guidance.

The standard excludes from its scope the accounting for insurance contracts, financial instruments and certain other
agreements that are subject to other guidance in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, which limits the impact of this change in accounting for the Company. Upon adoption, the Company expects the impact to be related primarily to revenue on
CNA’s warranty products and services, which will be recognized more slowly under the new guidance than under the current revenue recognition pattern. At adoption, the Company anticipates a cumulative effect adjustment that will decrease
Retained earnings by approximately $58 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests). In addition, Other revenues and Other operating expenses on the Company’s Consolidated



Statements of Income will increase significantly for those contracts for which CNA has concluded it is a principal, as the retail sellers’

mark-up

will now be reflected as revenue and commission expense. The estimated annual

gross-up

of other revenues and other operating expenses will be approximately $500 million. The related

gross-up

effect on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at adoption will be an increase of Other assets and Other liabilities of approximately $1.7 billion. Based on the Company’s assessment, the impact of
adoption of the updated guidance will not have a material effect on its results of operations or financial position.

In
January of 2016, the FASB issued ASU

2016-01,

“Financial Instruments

–

Overall (Subtopic

825-10):

Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities.” The updated accounting guidance requires changes to the reporting model for financial instruments. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company expects the
primary change to be the requirement for CNA’s equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value
recognized in net income. The Company will recognize a cumulative effect adjustment to Retained earnings and AOCI for the amount of unrealized investment gains and losses, after tax and noncontrolling interests, related to

available-for-sale

equity securities at the date of adoption. At adoption, the Company estimates this new guidance will result in an increase to Retained earnings and a
decrease to AOCI of $25 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests). Subsequent to adoption, changes in the fair value of CNA’s equity securities will be reported as Investment gains (losses) on the Company’s Consolidated
Statements of Income, which will introduce additional volatility to the Company’s results of operations.

In February
of 2016, the FASB issued ASU

2016-02,

“Leases (Topic 842).” The updated guidance requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for most operating leases. In addition, the updated
guidance requires that lessors separate lease and nonlease components in a contract in accordance with the new revenue guidance in ASU

2014-09.

The updated guidance is effective for interim and annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the effect the guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.

In June of 2016, the FASB issued ASU

2016-13,

“Financial Instruments –
Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” The updated accounting guidance requires changes to the recognition of credit losses on financial instruments not accounted for at fair value through net income.
The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the effect the guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements, and expects the primary changes to be
the use of the expected credit loss model for the mortgage loan portfolio and reinsurance receivables and the presentation of credit losses within the

available-for-sale

fixed maturities portfolio through an allowance method rather than as a direct write-down. The expected credit loss model will require a financial asset to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. Under the allowance method for

available-for-sale

debt securities the Company will record reversals of credit losses if the estimate of credit losses declines.

In October of 2016, the FASB issued ASU

2016-16,

“Income Taxes (Topic 740):
Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory.” The updated guidance amends the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. This guidance is effective for interim and annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company will adopt this updated guidance using the modified retrospective approach with a cumulative effect adjustment that will decrease Retained earnings by approximately
$10 million (after tax and

non-controlling

interests) with an offset to a deferred income tax liability.

Note 2. Acquisitions and Divestitures

Loews Corporation

On May 22, 2017, the Company acquired CCC Acquisition Holdings, Inc. for $1.2 billion, subject to post-closing
adjustments. CCC Acquisition Holdings, Inc., through its wholly owned subsidiary, Consolidated Container, is a rigid plastic packaging and recycled resins manufacturer that provides packaging solutions to end markets such as beverage, food and
household chemicals through a network of manufacturing locations across North America. The results of Consolidated Container are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements since the acquisition date in the Corporate segment. For the period
since the acquisition date, Consolidated Container’s revenues were $498



million and net income was not significant. For the year ended December 31, 2016, Consolidated Container reported total revenues of $788 million.

The acquisition was funded with approximately $620 million of Parent Company cash and debt financing proceeds at
Consolidated Container of $600 million, as discussed in Note 11. The following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated
fair value as of the acquisition date and is subject to change within the measurement period. The primary areas that are not yet finalized relate to working capital at closing and determination of tax bases of net assets acquired.

Customer relationships were valued using an income approach, which values the intangible asset
at the present value of the related incremental after tax cash flows. The customer relationships intangible asset will be amortized over a useful life of 21 years. The trade name was valued using an income approach, which values the intangible asset
based on an estimate of cost savings, or a relief from royalty. The trade name will be amortized over a useful life of 10 years. Goodwill includes value associated with the assembled workforce and Consolidated Container’s future growth and
profitability. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of the acquisition did not result in a step up of tax basis and approximately $94 million of goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. See Note 7 for additional information on
goodwill and intangible assets as of December 31, 2017.

Loews Hotels & Co

In 2017, Loews Hotels & Co received proceeds of $31 million for the sale of two hotels, in which Loews
Hotels & Co had joint venture interests. Loews Hotels & Co paid approximately $84 million to acquire a hotel in 2016 and approximately $330 million to acquire two hotels in 2015. These acquisitions were funded with a
combination of cash and property-level debt.

Based on current facts and circumstances, the Company believes the unrealized losses presented
in the December 31, 2017 securities in a gross unrealized loss position table above are not indicative of the ultimate collectibility of the current amortized cost of the securities, but rather are attributable to changes in interest rates,
credit spreads and other factors. The Company has no current intent to sell securities with unrealized losses, nor is it more likely than not that it will be required to sell prior to recovery of amortized cost; accordingly, the Company has
determined that there are no additional OTTI losses to be recorded at December 31, 2017.

The following table
presents the activity related to the pretax credit loss component reflected in Retained earnings on fixed maturity securities still held at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 for which a portion of an OTTI loss was recognized in Other
comprehensive income.

Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because certain
securities may be called or prepaid. Securities not due at a single date are allocated based on weighted average life.

Limited Partnerships

The carrying value of limited partnerships as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 was approximately $3.3 billion and
$3.2 billion, which includes undistributed earnings of $903 million and $820 million. Limited partnerships comprising 71.6% of the total carrying value are reported on a current basis through December 31, 2017 with no reporting
lag, 13.2% of the total carrying value are reported on a one month lag and the remainder are reported on more than a one month lag. The number of limited partnerships held and the strategies employed provide diversification to the limited
partnership portfolio and the overall invested asset portfolio.

Limited partnerships comprising 78.8% and 76.6% of the
carrying value as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 employ hedge fund strategies. Limited partnerships comprising 18.1% and 19.8% of the carrying value at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were invested in private debt and equity and the remainder
were primarily invested in real estate strategies. Hedge fund strategies include both long and short positions in fixed income, equity and derivative instruments. These hedge fund strategies may seek to generate gains from mispriced or undervalued
securities, price differentials between securities, distressed investments, sector rotation or various arbitrage disciplines. Within hedge fund strategies, approximately 64.5% were equity related, 20.7% pursued a multi-strategy approach, 11.1% were
focused on distressed investments and 3.7% were fixed income related as of December 31, 2017.

The ten largest
limited partnership positions held totaled $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. Based on the most recent information available regarding the Company’s percentage ownership of the individual limited partnerships, the carrying
value reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets represents approximately 2.9% and 3.5% of the aggregate partnership equity at December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related income reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Income represents
approximately 3.0%, 4.0% and 2.8% of the changes in aggregate partnership equity for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

While the Company generally does not invest in highly leveraged partnerships, there are risks inherent in limited partnership
investments which may result in losses due to short-selling, derivatives or other speculative investment practices. The use of leverage increases volatility generated by the underlying investment strategies.

The Company’s limited partnership investments contain withdrawal provisions that generally limit liquidity for a period
of thirty days up to one year and in some cases do not permit withdrawals until the termination of the partnership. Typically, withdrawals require advance written notice of up to 90 days.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company may use derivatives in the normal course of business, primarily in an attempt to reduce exposure to market risk
(principally interest rate risk, credit risk, equity price risk, commodity price risk and foreign currency risk) stemming from various assets and liabilities. The principal objective under such strategies is to achieve the desired reduction in
economic risk, even if the position does not receive hedge accounting treatment.

The Company may enter into interest rate
swaps, futures and forward commitments to purchase securities to manage interest rate risk. Credit derivatives such as credit default swaps may be entered into to modify the credit risk inherent in certain investments. Forward contracts, futures,
swaps and options may be used to manage foreign currency and commodity price risk.

In addition to the derivatives used
for risk management purposes described above, the Company may also use derivatives for purposes of income enhancement. Income enhancement transactions include but are not limited to interest rate swaps, call options, put options, credit default
swaps, index futures and foreign currency forwards. See Note 4 for information regarding the fair value of derivative instruments.

Investment Commitments

As of December 31, 2017, the Company had committed approximately $384 million to future capital calls from various
third party limited partnership investments in exchange for an ownership interest in the related partnerships.

The
Company invests in various privately placed debt securities, including bank loans, as part of its overall investment strategy and has committed to additional future purchases, sales and funding. Purchases and sales of privately placed debt
securities are recorded once funded. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had commitments to purchase or fund additional amounts of $165 million and sell $108 million under the terms of such securities.

Investments on Deposit

Securities with carrying values of approximately $2.6 billion and $2.3 billion were deposited by CNA’s
insurance subsidiaries under requirements of regulatory authorities and others as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.

Cash and securities with carrying values of approximately $471 million and $514 million were deposited with
financial institutions as collateral for letters of credit as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. In addition, cash and securities were deposited in trusts with financial institutions to secure reinsurance and other obligations with various third
parties. The carrying values of these deposits were approximately $587 million and $261 million as of December 
31, 2017 and 2016.

Note 4. Fair Value

Fair value is the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. The following fair value hierarchy is used in selecting inputs, with the highest priority given to Level 1, as these are the most transparent or reliable:

●

Level 1 – Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.

●

Level 2 – Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or
similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets.



●

Level 3 – Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are
not observable.

Prices may fall within Level 1, 2 or 3 depending upon the methodology and inputs
used to estimate fair value for each specific security. In general, the Company seeks to price securities using third party pricing services. Securities not priced by pricing services are submitted to independent brokers for valuation and, if those
are not available, internally developed pricing models are used to value assets using a methodology and inputs the Company believes market participants would use to value the assets. Prices obtained from third-party pricing services or brokers are
not adjusted by the Company.

The Company performs control procedures over information obtained from pricing services and
brokers to ensure prices received represent a reasonable estimate of fair value and to confirm representations regarding whether inputs are observable or unobservable. Procedures may include: (i) the review of pricing service methodologies or
broker pricing qualifications, (ii) back-testing, where past fair value estimates are compared to actual transactions executed in the market on similar dates, (iii) exception reporting, where period-over-period changes in price are
reviewed and challenged with the pricing service or broker based on exception criteria, (iv) detailed analysis, where the Company performs an independent analysis of the inputs and assumptions used to price individual securities and
(v) pricing validation, where prices received are compared to prices independently estimated by the Company.

Assets
and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized in the following tables. Corporate bonds and other includes obligations of the U.S. Treasury, government-sponsored enterprises and foreign governments and redeemable

Securities may be transferred in or out of levels within the fair value hierarchy
based on the availability of observable market information and quoted prices used to determine the fair value of the security. The availability of observable market information and quoted prices varies based on market conditions and trading volume.
During the year ended December 31, 2017 there were $10 million of transfers from Level 1 to Level 2 and no transfers from Level 2 to Level 1. During the year ended December 31, 2016, there were no transfers between
Level 1 and Level 2. The Company’s policy is to recognize transfers between levels at the beginning of quarterly reporting periods.

Valuation Methodologies and Inputs

The following section describes the valuation methodologies and relevant inputs used to measure different financial
instruments at fair value, including an indication of the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the instruments are generally classified.

Fixed Maturity Securities

Level 1 securities include highly liquid and exchange traded bonds and redeemable preferred stock, valued using quoted
market prices. Level 2 securities include most other fixed maturity securities as the significant inputs are observable in the marketplace. All classes of Level 2 fixed maturity securities are valued using a methodology based on
information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets, a discounted cash flow methodology or a combination of both when necessary. Common inputs for all classes of fixed maturity securities include prices from
recently executed transactions of similar securities, marketplace quotes, benchmark yields, spreads off benchmark yields, interest rates and U.S. Treasury or swap curves. Specifically for asset-backed securities, key inputs include prepayment and
default projections based on past performance of the underlying collateral and current market data. Fixed maturity securities are primarily assigned to Level 3 in cases where broker/dealer quotes are significant inputs to the valuation and
there is a lack of transparency as to whether these quotes are based on information that is observable in the marketplace. Level 3 securities also include private placement debt securities whose fair value is determined using internal models
with inputs that are not market observable.

Equity Securities

Level 1 equity securities include publicly traded securities valued using quoted market prices. Level 2 securities
are primarily

non-redeemable

preferred stocks and common stocks valued using pricing for similar securities, recently executed transactions and other pricing models utilizing market observable inputs.
Level 3 securities are primarily priced using broker/dealer quotes and internal models with inputs that are not market observable.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Exchange traded derivatives are valued using quoted market prices and are classified within Level 1 of the fair value
hierarchy. Level 2 derivatives primarily include currency forwards valued using observable market forward rates.

Over-the-counter

derivatives, principally interest
rate swaps, total return swaps, commodity swaps, equity warrants and options, are valued using inputs including broker/dealer quotes and are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy, depending on the amount of
transparency as to whether these quotes are based on information that is observable in the marketplace.

Short Term and Other Invested
Assets

Securities that are actively traded or have quoted prices are classified as Level 1. These securities
include money market funds, treasury bills and exchange traded

open-end

funds valued using quoted market prices. Level 2 primarily includes commercial paper, for which all inputs are market observable.
Fixed maturity securities purchased within one year of maturity are classified consistent with fixed maturity securities discussed above. Short term investments as presented in the tables above differ from the amounts presented in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets because certain short term investments, such as time deposits, are not measured at fair value.



Life Settlement Contracts

Historically, the fair value of life settlement contracts was determined as the present value of the anticipated death
benefits less anticipated premium payments based on contract terms that are distinct for each insured, as well as CNA’s own assumptions for mortality, premium expense and the rate of return that a buyer would require on the contracts. As of
December 31, 2016 CNA reached an agreement on terms to sell the portfolio and the purchase and sale agreement related to the portfolio was executed on March 7, 2017. At December 31, 2016, the valuation of the life settlement contracts
was based on the terms of the sale of the contract to a third party. Despite the sale, the contracts were classified as Level 3 as there is not an active market for life settlement contracts.

Significant Unobservable Inputs

The following tables present quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs utilized by the Company in the
fair value measurement of Level 3 assets. Valuations for assets and liabilities not presented in the tables below are primarily based on broker/dealer quotes for which there is a lack of transparency as to inputs used to develop the valuations.
The quantitative detail of unobservable inputs from these broker quotes is neither provided nor reasonably available to the Company. The valuation of life settlement contracts was based on the terms of the sale of the contracts to a third party;
therefore the contracts are not included in the tables below.

Financial Assets and Liabilities Not Measured at Fair Value

The carrying amount, estimated fair value and the level of the fair value hierarchy of the Company’s financial assets and
liabilities which are not measured at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are presented in the following tables. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of short term debt and long term debt exclude capital lease obligations. The
carrying amounts reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash and short term investments not carried at fair value and certain other assets and liabilities approximate fair value due to the short term nature of these items.

The following methods and assumptions were used in estimating the fair value of these
financial assets and liabilities.

The fair values of mortgage loans, included in Other invested assets, were based on the
present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the current interest rate for similar financial instruments, adjusted for specific loan risk.

Fair value of debt was based on observable market prices when available. When observable market prices were not available, the
fair value of debt was based on observable market prices of comparable instruments adjusted for differences between the observed instruments and the instruments being valued or is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on current
incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.

Capitalized interest related to the construction and upgrade of qualifying assets amounted to

Diamond Offshore

Purchase of Assets

In 2016, Diamond Offshore took delivery of one ultra-deepwater semisubmersible rig. The net book value of this newly
constructed rig was $774 million at December 31, 2016.



Sale of Assets

In 2016, Diamond Offshore entered into a

ten-year

agreement with a subsidiary of GE
Oil & Gas (“GE”) to provide services with respect to certain blowout preventer and related well control equipment on four drillships. Such services include management of maintenance, certification and reliability with respect to
such equipment. In connection with the contractual services agreement with GE, Diamond Offshore completed four sale and leaseback transactions with a GE affiliate during 2016 with respect to the well control equipment on its four drillships and
received an aggregate of $210 million in proceeds, which was less than the carrying value of the equipment. The resulting difference was recorded as prepaid rent with no gain or loss recognized on the transactions, and will be amortized over
the terms of the operating leases. Future commitments under the operating leases and contractual services agreements are estimated to aggregate approximately $550 million over the remaining term of the agreements.

For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, Diamond Offshore recognized $62 million and $34 million in
aggregate expense related to the well control equipment leases and contractual services agreement.

Asset Impairments

During 2017, in response to continued depressed market conditions for the offshore contract drilling industry, Diamond
Offshore’s expectations that a market recovery is not likely to occur in the near term, as well as decisions by management to market certain rigs for sale, Diamond Offshore evaluated ten of its drilling rigs with indications that their carrying
values may not be recoverable. Based on its analyses, Diamond Offshore determined that the carrying values of three rigs were impaired, consisting of one ultra-deepwater semisubmersible, one deepwater semisubmersible and one

jack-up

rig.

Diamond Offshore estimated the fair value of two of the impaired rigs
using an income approach, in which the fair value was estimated based on a calculation of the rig’s discounted future net cash flows over its remaining economic life, which utilized significant unobservable inputs, including assumptions related
to estimated dayrate revenue, rig utilization, estimated reactivation and regulatory survey costs, as well as estimated proceeds that may be received on ultimate disposition of the rig. The fair value of the other impaired rig was estimated using a
market approach, which required Diamond Offshore to estimate the value that would be received for the rig in the principal or most advantageous market for that rig in an orderly transaction between market participants. This estimate was primarily
based on an indicative bid to purchase the rig, as well as our evaluation of other market data points; however, the rig has not been sold. These fair value estimates were representative of Level 3 fair value measurements due to the significant
level of estimation involved and the lack of transparency as to the inputs used. During the year ended December 31, 2017, Diamond Offshore recorded asset impairment charges in the aggregate of $100 million ($32 million after tax and
noncontrolling interests).

Diamond Offshore recorded aggregate asset impairment charges of $672 million
($263 million after tax and noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2016. See Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company’s Annual Report on Form

10-K

for the
year ended December 31, 2016 for further discussion of Diamond Offshore’s 2016 asset impairments. Diamond Offshore recorded aggregate asset impairment charges of $861 million ($341 million after tax and noncontrolling interests)
for the year ended December 31, 2015. See Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company’s Annual Report on Form

10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2015 for further discussion
of Diamond Offshore’s 2015 asset impairments. The asset impairment charges recorded during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are reported within Other operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Boardwalk Pipeline

Sale of Assets

During 2017, Boardwalk Pipeline sold a processing plant and related assets for approximately $64 million, including
customary adjustments. The sale resulted in a loss of $47 million ($15 million after tax and noncontrolling interests) and is reported within Other operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

necessary to resolve all outstanding claims, including claims that are incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) as of the reporting date. CNA’s reserve projections are based primarily on detailed analysis of the facts in each case,
CNA’s experience with similar cases and various historical development patterns. Consideration is given to such historical patterns as claim reserving trends and settlement practices, loss payments, pending levels of unpaid claims and product
mix, as well as court decisions, economic conditions including inflation and public attitudes. All of these factors can affect the estimation of claim and claim adjustment expense reserves.



Establishing claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, including claim and
claim adjustment expense reserves for catastrophic events that have occurred, is an estimation process. Many factors can ultimately affect the final settlement of a claim and, therefore, the necessary reserve. Changes in the law, results of
litigation, medical costs, the cost of repair materials and labor rates can affect ultimate claim costs. In addition, time can be a critical part of reserving determinations since the longer the span between the incidence of a loss and the payment
or settlement of the claim, the more variable the ultimate settlement amount can be. Accordingly, short-tail claims, such as property damage claims, tend to be more reasonably estimable than long-tail claims, such as workers’ compensation,
general liability and professional liability claims. Adjustments to prior year reserve estimates, if necessary, are reflected in the results of operations in the period that the need for such adjustments is determined. There can be no assurance that
CNA’s ultimate cost for insurance losses will not exceed current estimates.

Catastrophes are an inherent risk of the
property and casualty insurance business and have contributed to material

period-to-period

fluctuations in CNA’s results of operations and/or equity. CNA reported
catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, of $380 million, $165 million and $141 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Net catastrophe losses for the year ended December 31, 2017 included
$256 million related to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. Catastrophe-related reinsurance reinstatement premium was $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The remaining net catastrophe losses in 2017 resulted primarily from
the California wildfires and U.S. weather-related events. Net catastrophe losses in 2016 related primarily to U.S. weather-related events and the Fort McMurray wildfires. Net catastrophe losses in 2015 related primarily to U.S. weather-related
events.

reflected in the table above.



Reserving Methodology

In developing claim and claim adjustment expense (“loss” or “losses”) reserve estimates, CNA’s
actuaries perform detailed reserve analyses that are staggered throughout the year. Every reserve group is reviewed at least once during the year. The analyses generally review losses gross of ceded reinsurance and apply the ceded reinsurance terms
to the gross estimates to establish estimates net of reinsurance. In addition to the detailed analyses, CNA reviews actual loss emergence for all products each quarter. In developing the loss reserve estimates for property and casualty contracts,
CNA generally projects ultimate losses using several common actuarial methods as listed below. CNA reviews the various indications from the various methods and applies judgment to select an actuarial point estimate. The indicated required reserve is
the difference between the selected ultimate loss and the

inception-to-date

paid losses. The difference between the selected ultimate loss and the case incurred or
reported loss is IBNR. IBNR includes a provision for development on known cases as well as a provision for late reported incurred claims. Further, CNA does not establish case reserves for allocated loss adjustment expenses (“ALAE”),
therefore ALAE reserves are included in its estimate of IBNR. The most frequently utilized methods to project ultimate losses include the following:

•

Paid development

: The paid development method estimates ultimate losses by reviewing paid loss patterns
and applying them to accident years with further expected changes in paid losses.

•

Incurred development

: The incurred development method is similar to the paid development method, but it
uses case incurred losses instead of paid losses.

•

Loss ratio

: The loss ratio method multiplies premiums by an expected loss ratio to produce ultimate
loss estimates for each accident year.

•

Bornhuetter-Ferguson using premiums and paid loss

: The Bornhuetter-Ferguson using premiums and paid
loss method is a combination of the paid development approach and the loss ratio approach. This method normally determines expected loss ratios similar to the approach used to estimate the expected loss ratio for the loss ratio method.

•

Bornhuetter-Ferguson using premiums and incurred loss

: The Bornhuetter-Ferguson using premiums and
incurred loss method is similar to the Bornhuetter-Ferguson using premiums and paid loss method except that it uses case incurred losses.

•

Frequency times severity

: The frequency times severity method multiplies a projected number of ultimate
claims by an estimated ultimate average loss for each accident year to produce ultimate loss estimates.

•

Stochastic modeling

: The stochastic modeling produces a range of possible outcomes based on varying
assumptions related to the particular product being modeled.

For many exposures, especially those that
can be considered long-tail, a particular accident or policy year may not have a sufficient volume of paid losses to produce a statistically reliable estimate of ultimate losses. In such a case, CNA’s actuaries typically assign more weight to
the incurred development method than to the paid development method. As claims continue to settle and the volume of paid loss increases, the actuaries may assign additional weight to the paid development method. For most of CNA’s products, even
the incurred losses for accident or policy years that are early in the claim settlement process will not be of sufficient volume to produce a reliable estimate of ultimate losses. In these cases, CNA may not assign any weight to the paid and
incurred development methods. CNA may use the loss ratio, Bornhuetter-Ferguson and frequency times severity methods. For short-tail exposures, the paid and incurred development methods can often be relied on sooner, primarily because CNA’s
history includes a sufficient number of years to cover the entire period over which paid and incurred losses are expected to change. However, CNA may also use the loss ratio, Bornhuetter-Ferguson and frequency times severity methods for short-tail
exposures. For other more complex reserve groups where the above methods may not produce reliable indications, CNA uses additional methods tailored to the characteristics of the specific situation.



Future Policy Benefit Reserves

Reserves for policyholder benefits for Other Insurance Operations, which primarily includes long term care, are based on
actuarial assumptions which include estimates of morbidity, persistency, inclusive of mortality, discount rates, future premium rate increases and expenses over the life of the contracts. Under GAAP, the best estimates of the actuarial assumptions
at the date the contract was issued are

locked-in

throughout the life of the contract unless a premium deficiency develops, which occurred in 2015. As a result, CNA updated the assumptions to represent
management’s best estimates at the time of the premium deficiency and these revised assumptions are

locked-in

unless another premium deficiency is identified.

Certain claim liabilities are more difficult to estimate and have differing methodologies and considerations which are
described below.

Mass Tort and A&EP Reserves

CNA’s mass tort and A&EP reserving methodologies are similar as both are based on detailed account reviews of large
accounts with estimates based on ultimate payments considering the applicable law and coverage litigation. These reserves are subject to greater inherent variability than is typical of the remainder of CNA’s reserves due to, among other things,
a general lack of sufficiently detailed data, expansion of the population being held responsible for these exposures and significant unresolved legal issues such as the existence of coverage and the definition of an occurrence.

Property and Casualty Reserve Reviews

CNA’s actuarial reserve analyses result in point estimates. Each quarter, the results of detailed reserve reviews are
summarized and discussed with CNA’s senior management to determine management’s best estimate of reserves. CNA’s senior management considers many factors in making this decision. The factors include, but are not limited to, the
historical pattern and volatility of the actuarial indications, the sensitivity of the actuarial indications to changes in paid and incurred loss patterns, the consistency of claims handling processes, the consistency of case reserving practices,
changes in CNA’s pricing and underwriting, pricing and underwriting trends in the insurance market and legal, judicial, social and economic trends. CNA’s recorded reserves reflect its best estimate as of a particular point in time based
upon known facts, consideration of the factors cited above and its judgment. The carried reserve differs from the actuarial point estimate as the result of CNA’s consideration of the factors noted above as well as the potential volatility of
the projections associated with the specific product being analyzed and other factors affecting claims costs that may not be quantifiable through traditional actuarial analysis.

Development Tables

The
loss reserve development tables presented herein illustrate the change over time of reserves established for claim and allocated claim adjustment expenses arising from short duration insurance contracts for certain lines of business within
CNA’s Property and Casualty Operations. Not all lines of business are presented based on their context to CNA’s overall loss reserves, calendar year reserve development, or calendar year net earned premiums. Insurance contracts are
considered to be short duration contracts when the contracts are not expected to remain in force for an extended period of time. The Cumulative Net Incurred Claim and Allocated Claim Adjustment Expenses tables, reading across, show the cumulative
net incurred claim and allocated claim adjustment expenses relating to each accident year at the end of the stated calendar year. Changes in the cumulative amount across time are the result of CNA’s expanded awareness of additional facts and
circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims. The Cumulative Net Paid Claim and Allocated Claim Adjustment Expenses tables, reading across, show the cumulative amount paid for claims in each accident year as of the end of the stated calendar
year. The Net Strengthening or (Releases) of Prior Accident Year Reserves tables, reading across, show the net increase or decrease in the cumulative net incurred accident year claim and allocated claim adjustment expenses during each stated
calendar year and indicates whether the reserves for that accident year were strengthened or released.

The information in
the tables is reported on a net basis after reinsurance and does not include the effects of discounting. The information contained in the years preceding calendar year 2016 is unaudited. To the extent CNA enters into a commutation, the transaction
is reported on a prospective basis. To the extent that CNA enters into a



disposition, the effects of the disposition are reported on a retrospective basis by removing the balances associated with it.

The amounts reported for the cumulative number of reported claims include direct and assumed open and closed claims by
accident year at the claimant level. The number excludes claim counts for claims within a policy deductible where the insured is responsible for payment of losses in the deductible layer. Claim count data for certain assumed reinsurance contracts is
unavailable.

In the loss reserve development tables, IBNR includes reserves for incurred but not reported losses and
expected development on case reserves.

Net Prior Year Development

Changes in estimates of claim and claim adjustment expense reserves and premium accruals, net of reinsurance, for prior years
are defined as net prior year development. These changes can be favorable or unfavorable. Favorable net prior year development of $302 million, $316 million and $218 million was recorded for Property and Casualty Operations for the
years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.



Favorable net prior year development of $89 million, $43 million and
$50 million was recorded for Other Insurance Operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. The favorable net prior year development for the year ended December 31, 2017 was driven by lower than expected claim
severity.

Premium development can occur in the Property and Casualty Operations when there is a change in exposure on
auditable policies or when premium accruals differ from processed premium. Audits on policies usually occur in a period after the expiration date of the policy.

The following table and discussion presents detail of the net prior year claim and claim adjustment expense reserve
development in CNA’s Property and Casualty Operations:

Unfavorable development in medical professional liability was primarily due to continued higher than expected frequency in
aging services and higher than expected severity for hospitals in recent accident years. This was partially offset by favorable development in life sciences and hospitals in prior accident years as well as favorable development related to
unallocated claim adjustment expenses.

Favorable development in other professional liability and management liability was
primarily due to favorable settlements on closed claims and a lower frequency of large losses for accident years 2011 through 2015 for professional and management liability, lower than expected claim frequency in accident years 2012 through 2015 for
professional liability and lower than expected severity in accident years 2014 through 2015 for professional liability.

Favorable development in surety coverages was primarily due to lower than expected frequency of large losses in accident years
2015 and prior.

Favorable development for commercial auto was primarily due to lower than expected severity in accident
years 2013 through 2016, as well as a large favorable recovery on a claim in accident year 2012.

Favorable development
for workers’ compensation was primarily related to decreases in frequency and severity in recent accident years, partially attributable to California reforms impacting medical costs. This was partially offset by unfavorable development related
to an adverse arbitration ruling on reinsurance recoverables from older accident years as well as the recognition of loss estimates associated with favorable premium development.

Unfavorable development for other coverages was primarily due to higher than expected severity in accident year 2016 and
higher than expected large claim frequency in the Hardy Political Risks portfolio relating largely to accident year 2016. This unfavorable development was largely offset by favorable development due to better than expected frequency in accident
years 2014 through 2015, better than expected emergence in Canadian

run-off

business in accident years 2014 and prior, several favorable settlements relating to large claims in the Europe Professional
Indemnity portfolio and lower than expected large loss frequency in the Europe Financial Institutions portfolio.




Favorable development for medical professional liability was primarily due to lower than expected severities for individual
health care professionals, allied facilities and hospitals in accident years 2011 and prior and better than expected severity in medical products liability in accident years 2010 through 2015. This was partially offset by unfavorable development in
accident years 2012 and 2013 related to higher than expected large loss emergence in hospitals and higher than expected frequency and severity in accident years 2014 and 2015 in the aging services business.

Favorable development in other professional liability and management liability was primarily due to favorable settlements on
closed claims and lower than expected frequency of claims in accident years 2010 through 2014 related to professional services and financial institutions. This was partially offset by unfavorable development related to a specific financial
institutions claim in accident year 2014, higher management liability severities in accident year 2015 and deterioration on credit crises-related claims in accident year 2009.

Favorable development in surety coverages was primarily due to lower than expected frequency of large losses in accident years
2014 and prior.

Favorable development for commercial auto was primarily due to favorable settlements on claims in
accident years 2010 through 2014 and lower than expected severities in accident years 2012 through 2015.

Favorable
development for general liability was primarily due to better than expected claim settlements in accident years 2012 through 2014 and better than expected severity on umbrella claims in accident years 2010 through 2013. This was partially offset by
unfavorable development related to an increase in reported claims prior to the closing of the three year window set forth by the Minnesota Child Victims Act in accident years 2006 and prior.

Unfavorable development for workers’ compensation was primarily due to higher than expected severity for Defense Base Act
contractors that largely resulted from a reduction of expected future recoveries from the U.S. Department of Labor under the War Hazard Act. Further unfavorable development was due to the impact of recent Florida court rulings for accident years
2008 through 2015. These were partially offset by favorable development related to lower than expected frequencies related to the ongoing Middle Market and Small Business results for accident years 2009 through 2014.

Favorable development for other coverages was due to better than expected claim frequency and claim severity in accident years
2010 through 2015, better than expected loss frequency in accident years 2013 through 2015, better than expected severity on the December 2015 United Kingdom floods, better than expected attritional losses and large loss experience on accident years
2013 through 2015 for Hardy business and favorable settlements on claims in accident years 2013 and prior related to CNA’s Canadian package business. Additional favorable development was due to a commutation of exposures in marine

run-off

classes on CNA’s Europe business and lower than expected frequency of large losses related to CNA’s Europe business in accident years 2013 and 2015. This was partially offset by unfavorable
development related to higher than expected severity from a fourth quarter 2015 catastrophe event.


Overall, favorable development for medical professional liability was related to lower than expected severity in accident
years 2012 and prior. Unfavorable development was recorded related to increased claim frequency and severity in the aging services business in accident years 2013 and 2014.

Favorable development in other professional liability and management liability related to better than expected large loss
emergence in financial institutions primarily in accident years 2011 through 2014. Additional favorable development related to lower than expected severity for professional services in accident years 2011 and prior. Unfavorable development was
recorded related to increased frequency of large claims on public company management liability in accident years 2012 through 2014.



Favorable development for surety coverages was primarily due to lower than
expected frequency of large losses in accident years 2013 and prior.

Favorable development for commercial auto was
primarily due to lower than expected severity in accident years 2009 through 2014.

Favorable development for general
liability was primarily due to favorable settlements on claims in accident years 2010 through 2013.

Unfavorable
development for workers’ compensation was primarily due to higher than expected severity related to Defense Base Act contractors in accident years 2008 through 2014.

Favorable development for other coverages was due to better than expected claim frequency in accident year 2014, better than
expected claim emergence from 2012 and 2014 catastrophe events, better than expected large loss emergence in accident years 2012 and prior and better than expected individual large loss emergence and favorable settlements on large claims in accident
years 2013 and 2014. This was partially offset by unfavorable development due to higher than expected large losses in financial institutions and political risk, primarily in accident year 2014.

Due to the nature of the Surety business, average annual percentage payout of ultimate net incurred claim and
allocated claim adjustment expenses has been calculated using only the payouts of mature accident years presented in the loss reserve development tables.

A&EP Reserves

In 2010, Continental Casualty Company (“CCC”) together with several of CNA’s insurance subsidiaries completed a
transaction with National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., under which substantially all of CNA’s legacy A&EP liabilities were ceded to NICO (“loss portfolio transfer” or
“LPT”). At the effective date of the transaction, CNA ceded approximately $1.6 billion of net A&EP claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserves to NICO under a retroactive reinsurance agreement with an aggregate limit of
$4.0 billion. The $1.6 billion of claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserves ceded to NICO was net of $1.2 billion of ceded claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserves under existing third party reinsurance
contracts. The NICO LPT aggregate reinsurance limit also covers credit risk on the existing third party reinsurance related to these liabilities. CNA paid NICO a reinsurance premium of $2.0 billion and transferred to NICO billed third party
reinsurance receivables related to A&EP claims with a net book value of $215 million, resulting in total consideration of $2.2 billion.

Subsequent to the effective date of the LPT, CNA recognized adverse prior year development on its A&EP reserves which
resulted in additional amounts ceded under the LPT. As a result, the cumulative amounts ceded under the LPT exceeded the $2.2 billion consideration paid, resulting in the NICO LPT moving into a gain position, requiring retroactive reinsurance
accounting. Under retroactive reinsurance accounting, this gain is deferred and



only recognized in earnings in proportion to actual paid recoveries under the LPT. Over the life of the contract, there is no economic impact as long as any additional losses incurred are within
the limit of the LPT. In a period in which CNA recognizes a change in the estimate of A&EP reserves that increases the amounts ceded under the LPT, the proportion of actual paid recoveries to total ceded losses is affected and the change in the
deferred gain is recognized in earnings as if the revised estimate of ceded losses was available at the effective date of the LPT. The effect of the deferred retroactive reinsurance benefit is recorded in Insurance claims and policyholders’
benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

The following table presents the impact of the loss portfolio transfer on the
Consolidated Statements of Income.

Based upon CNA’s annual A&EP reserve review, net unfavorable prior year development
of $60 million, $200 million and $150 million was recognized before consideration of cessions to the LPT for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. The 2017 unfavorable development was driven by modestly higher
anticipated payouts on claims from known sources of asbestos exposure. The 2016 unfavorable development was driven by an increase in anticipated future expenses associated with determination of coverage, higher anticipated payouts associated with a
limited number of historical accounts having significant asbestos exposures and higher than expected severity on pollution claims. The 2015 unfavorable development was recorded to reflect a decrease in anticipated future reinsurance recoveries
related to asbestos claims and higher than expected severity on pollution claims. While the unfavorable development was ceded to NICO under the LPT, CNA’s reported earnings in the periods were negatively affected due to the application of
retroactive reinsurance accounting.

As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the cumulative amounts ceded under the LPT
were $2.9 billion and $2.8 billion. The unrecognized deferred retroactive reinsurance benefit was $326 million and $334 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.

NICO established a collateral trust account as security for its obligations to CNA. The fair value of the collateral trust
account was $3.1 billion and $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. In addition, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. guaranteed the payment obligations of NICO up to the aggregate reinsurance limit as well as certain of NICO’s
performance obligations under the trust agreement. NICO is responsible for claims handling and billing and collection from third-party reinsurers related to CNA’s A&EP claims.

Note 9. Leases

Leases primarily cover office facilities, machinery and computer equipment. Hotel properties, in some instances, are
constructed on leased land. Rent expense amounted to $113 million, $97 million and $85 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. The table below presents the future minimum lease payments to be made under

Note 10. Income Taxes

The Company and its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. The Company has entered into a
separate tax allocation agreement with CNA, a majority-owned subsidiary in which its ownership exceeds 80%. The agreement provides that the Company will: (i) pay to CNA the amount, if any, by which the Company’s consolidated federal income
tax is reduced by virtue of inclusion of CNA in the Company’s return or (ii) be paid by CNA an amount, if any, equal to the federal income tax that would have been payable by CNA if it had filed a separate consolidated return. The
agreement may be canceled by either of the parties upon thirty days written notice.

For 2015 through 2017, the Internal
Revenue Service (“IRS”) has accepted the Company into the Compliance Assurance Process (“CAP”), which is a voluntary program for large corporations. Under CAP, the IRS conducts a real-time audit and works contemporaneously with
the Company to resolve any issues prior to the filing of the tax return. The Company believes this approach should reduce

tax-related

uncertainties, if any. Although the outcome of tax audits is always
uncertain, the Company believes that any adjustments resulting from audits will not have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The Company and/or its subsidiaries also file income tax returns in various
state, local and foreign jurisdictions. These returns, with few exceptions, are no longer subject to examination by the various taxing authorities before 2013.

Diamond Offshore, which is not included in the Company’s consolidated federal income tax return, files income tax returns
in the U.S. federal and various state and foreign jurisdictions. Tax years that remain subject to examination by these jurisdictions include years 2009 to 2016.

On December 22, 2017, H.R.1, “An Act to Provide for Reconciliation Pursuant to Titles II and V of the Concurrent
Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2018,” previously known as “The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” was signed into law (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act amended the Internal Revenue Code in several areas that had a direct and
immediate effect on the Company’s results of operations and statement of financial position as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 including, among other things, a reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to
21% effective January 1, 2018, eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) and changing how existing AMT credits can be realized, and a

one-time

mandatory deemed repatriation of
accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017, inclusive of the utilization of certain tax attributes offset by a provisional liability for uncertain tax positions related to such attributes. The Tax Act is subject to
further clarification by the issuance of future technical guidance by the U.S. Department of Treasury and/or future technical correction legislation.

The Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”) which allows
companies to report the income tax effects of the Tax Act as a provisional amount based on a reasonable estimate, which would be subject to adjustment during a reasonable measurement period, not to exceed twelve months, until the accounting and
analysis under ASC 740 is complete. Due to the timing of the enactment of the Tax Act, there continues to be a significant amount of uncertainty as to the appropriate application of a number of the underlying provisions, pending further guidance and
clarification from the relevant authorities. The Company will continue to monitor developments in this area and adjust its provisional estimates throughout the year in 2018, as and if necessary, as additional guidance and clarification becomes
available.

The Company recorded a

one-time

non-cash

provisional $200 million increase to net income (net of noncontrolling interests) for the year ended December 31, 2017 related to the Tax Act. This increase includes a $268 million
income tax benefit due to the adjustment of net deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% partially offset by a $78 million charge mostly related to the

one-time

mandatory repatriation of previously deferred earnings of certain of Diamond Offshore’s

non-U.S.

subsidiaries, inclusive of the utilization of certain tax
attributes offset by a provisional liability for uncertain tax positions related to such attributes. The Company is still in the process of evaluating the estimate as it relates to the tax effect of: (i) the amount of deferred tax assets and
liabilities subject to the income tax rate change from 35% to 21%, including the calculation of the mandatory deemed repatriation aspect of the Tax Act and the state tax effect of adjustments made to federal temporary differences, (ii) the
ability to more likely than not realize the benefit of deferred tax assets, including net operating losses and foreign tax credits, (iii) the effect of

re-computing

CNA’s insurance reserves and the
transition adjustment from existing law, the effects of which will have no impact on the effective tax rate and (iv) the special accounting method provisions for recognizing income for



U.S. federal income tax purposes no later than financial accounting purposes and the transition adjustment from existing law, which will also have no impact on the effective tax rate.

Any adjustments to these provisional amounts will be reported as a component of Income tax (expense) benefit in the reporting
period in which such adjustments are determined, which will be no later than the fourth quarter of 2018.

The Company currently intends to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. Except
to the extent of the U.S. tax provided under the Tax Act or other required U.S. tax provision, the Company has not provided tax on any withholding or other tax that may be applicable should a future distribution be made from any unremitted earnings.
It is not practical to estimate this potential liability.

In 2016, the $20 million in reductions for tax positions related to a prior year, is
primarily from the devaluation of the Egyptian pound. At December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, $102 million, $36 million and $49 million of unrecognized tax benefits related to Diamond Offshore would affect the effective tax rate if
recognized.

The Company recognizes interest accrued related to: (i) unrecognized tax benefits in Interest expense
and (ii) tax refund claims in Other revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company recognizes penalties in Income tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Interest amounts recorded by the Company were insignificant
for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. The Company recorded income tax benefit of $2 million and $23 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and income tax expense of $2 million for the year
ended December 31, 2015 related to penalties.

Federal net operating loss carryforwards of $51 million expire between 2033
and 2037. Net operating loss carryforwards in foreign tax jurisdictions of $42 million expire between 2021 and 2027 and $76 million can be carried forward indefinitely. Federal tax credit carryforwards of $171 million can be utilized
to offset future current tax liabilities or will ultimately be refundable no later than 2021. Foreign tax credit carryforwards of $28 million will expire in 2019 and 2024 to 2027.

Although realization of deferred tax assets is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the recognized
deferred tax assets will be realized through recoupment of ordinary and capital taxes paid in prior carryback years and through future earnings, reversal of existing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies. As of
December 31, 2017, Diamond Offshore recorded a valuation allowance of $169 million related to net operating losses of $111 million, foreign tax credits of $27 million, and other deferred tax assets of $31 million.

At December 31, 2017, the aggregate long term debt maturing in each of the next five
years is approximately as follows: $280 million in 2018, $449 million in 2019, $556 million in 2020, $846 million in 2021, $955 million in 2022 and $8.6 billion thereafter. Long term debt is generally redeemable in
whole or in part at the greater of the principal amount or the net present value of remaining scheduled payments discounted at the specified treasury rate plus a margin.

CNA Financial

CNA is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago (“FHLBC”). FHLBC membership provides participants with
access to additional sources of liquidity through various programs and services. As a requirement of membership in the FHLBC, CNA held $5 million of FHLBC stock as of December 31, 2017, giving it access to approximately $111 million
of additional liquidity. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, CNA had no outstanding borrowings from the FHLBC.

In the
third quarter of 2017, CNA completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.5% senior notes due August 15, 2027 and used a portion of the net proceeds to redeem the entire $350 million outstanding
principal amount of its 7.4% senior notes due November 15, 2019. The redemption of the $350 million senior notes resulted in a loss of $42 million ($24 million after tax and noncontrolling interests) and is included in Interest
expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2017.

CNA has a five-year
$250 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks which may be used for general corporate purposes. At CNA’s election, the commitments under the credit agreement may be increased from time to time up to an
additional aggregate amount of $100 million. As of December 31, 2017, there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreements and CNA was in compliance with all covenants.

Diamond Offshore

In the third quarter of 2017, Diamond Offshore completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of
its 7.9% senior notes due August 15, 2025 and used the net proceeds together with cash on hand to redeem the entire $500 million outstanding principal amount of its 5.9% senior notes due May 1, 2019. The redemption of this debt
resulted in a loss of $35 million ($11 million after tax and noncontrolling interests) and is included in Interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Diamond Offshore has a $1.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in October of 2020, except
for $40 million of commitments that mature in March of 2019 and $60 million of commitments that mature in October of 2019. In addition, Diamond Offshore also has the option to increase the revolving commitments under the revolving credit
facility by up to an additional $500 million from time to time, upon receipt of additional commitments from new or existing lenders, and to request one additional

one-year

extension of the maturity date.
Up to $250 million of the facility may be used for the issuance of performance or other standby letters of credit and up to $100 million may be used for swingline loans. As of December 31, 2017, there were no outstanding borrowings
under the credit agreement and Diamond Offshore was in compliance with all covenants.



Boardwalk Pipeline

In the first quarter of 2017, Boardwalk Pipeline completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of
its 4.5% senior notes due July 15, 2027 and used the net proceeds to repay the entire $275 million outstanding principal amount of its 6.3% senior notes due August 15, 2017 and to fund growth capital expenditures.

In the first quarter of 2017, Boardwalk Pipeline retired at maturity the $300 million outstanding aggregate principal
amount of its 5.5% senior notes.

Boardwalk Pipeline has a revolving credit facility having aggregate lending commitments
of $1.5 billion. During the third quarter of 2017, Boardwalk Pipeline extended the maturity date of the revolving credit facility by one year to May 26, 2022. As of December 31, 2017, there were borrowings of $385 million under
the credit agreement and Boardwalk Pipeline was in compliance with all covenants.

Boardwalk Pipeline has a subordinated
loan agreement with a subsidiary of the Company under which it can borrow up to $300 million until December 31, 2018. Boardwalk Pipeline had no outstanding borrowings under the subordinated loan agreement.

Consolidated Container

In the second quarter of 2017, Consolidated Container entered into a credit agreement providing for a $605 million term
loan and a five year $125 million asset based lending facility (“ABL facility”) in conjunction with the acquisition discussed in Note 2. The term loan is a variable rate facility which bears interest at a floating rate equal to the
London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus an applicable margin of 3.5%, subject to a 1.0% floor. Consolidated Container entered into interest rate swaps for a notional amount of $500 million to hedge its cash flow exposure to the
variable rate debt by fixing the interest rate on the hedged portion of the term loan. As of December 31, 2017, the term loan had a weighted average effective interest rate of 5.5%, including the effects of the interest rate swaps. The term
loan matures on May 22, 2024 and requires annual principal amortization of 1.0% of the original loan amount beginning December 31, 2017. Consolidated Container recorded approximately $19 million of debt issuance costs, which will be
amortized over the terms of the facilities. As of December 31, 2017, Consolidated Container had no outstanding borrowings under its ABL facility. In February of 2018, Consolidated Container repriced its term loan to bear interest at a floating
rate equal to LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 3.0%, subject to a 1.0% floor.

Common Stock Dividends

Dividends of $0.25 per share on the Company’s common stock were declared and paid in 2017, 2016 and 2015.

There are no restrictions on the Company’s retained earnings or net income with regard to payment of dividends. However,
as a holding company, Loews relies upon invested cash balances and distributions from its subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to declare and pay any dividends to holders of its common stock. The ability of the Company’s subsidiaries to
pay dividends is subject to, among other things, the availability of sufficient earnings and funds in such subsidiaries, compliance with covenants in their respective credit agreements and applicable state laws, including in the case of the
insurance subsidiaries of CNA, laws and rules governing the payment of dividends by regulated insurance companies. See Note 13 for a discussion of the regulatory restrictions on CNA’s availability to pay dividends.

Treasury Stock

The
Company repurchased 4.8 million, 3.4 million and 33.3 million shares of its common stock at aggregate costs of $237 million, $134 million and $1.3 billion during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. As
of December 31, 2017, 4.4 million shares were retired. The remaining 0.4 million shares will be retired in 2018. Upon retirement, treasury stock was eliminated through a reduction to common stock, APIC and retained earnings.

Note 13. Statutory Accounting Practices

CNA’s insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in various jurisdictions. These subsidiaries prepare statutory financial
statements in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the respective jurisdictions’ insurance regulators. Domestic prescribed statutory accounting practices are set forth in a variety of publications of the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) as well as state laws, regulations and general administrative rules. These statutory accounting principles vary in certain respects from GAAP. In converting from statutory accounting
principles to GAAP, the more significant adjustments include deferral of policy acquisition costs and the inclusion of net unrealized holding gains or losses in shareholders’ equity relating to certain fixed maturity securities.

CNA has a prescribed practice as it relates to the accounting under Statement of Statutory Accounting Principles No. 62R
(“SSAP No. 62R”),

Property and Casualty Reinsurance

, paragraphs 67 and 68 in conjunction with the 2010 loss portfolio transfer with NICO which is further discussed in Note 8. The prescribed practice allows CNA to aggregate all third
party A&EP reinsurance balances administered by NICO in Schedule F and to utilize the LPT as collateral for the underlying third-party reinsurance balances for purposes of calculating the statutory reinsurance penalty. This prescribed practice
increased statutory capital and surplus by $63 million and $67 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016.

The
2015 long term care premium deficiency discussed in Note 1 was recorded on a GAAP basis. There was no premium deficiency for statutory accounting purposes. Statutory accounting principles requires the use of prescribed discount rates in calculating
the reserves for long term care future policy benefits which are lower than the discount rates used on a GAAP basis and results in higher carried reserves relative to GAAP reserves.



The payment of dividends by CNA’s insurance subsidiaries without prior
approval of the insurance department of each subsidiary’s domiciliary jurisdiction is generally limited by formula. Dividends in excess of these amounts are subject to prior approval by the respective insurance regulator.

Dividends from CCC are subject to the insurance holding company laws of the State of Illinois, the domiciliary state of CCC.
Under these laws, ordinary dividends, or dividends that do not require prior approval by the Illinois Department of Insurance (the “Department”) are determined based on the greater of the prior year’s statutory net income or 10% of
statutory surplus as of the end of the prior year, as well as timing and amount of dividends paid in the preceding 12 months. Additionally, ordinary dividends may only be paid from earned surplus, which is calculated by removing unrealized gains
from unassigned surplus. As of December 31, 2017, CCC is in a positive earned surplus position. The maximum allowable dividend CCC could pay during 2018 that would not be subject to the Department’s prior approval is $1.1 billion,
less dividends paid during the preceding 12 months measured at that point in time. CCC paid dividends of $955 million in 2017. The actual level of dividends paid in any year is determined after an assessment of available dividend capacity,
holding company liquidity and cash needs as well as the impact the dividends will have on the statutory surplus of the applicable insurance company.

Combined statutory capital and surplus and statutory net income for the Combined Continental Casualty Companies are presented
in the table below, determined in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by insurance and/or other regulatory authorities.

(a)

Information derived from the statutory-basis financial statements to be filed with insurance regulators.

CNA’s domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements. RBC is a method
developed by the NAIC to determine the minimum amount of statutory capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile. The formula for determining the amount of RBC
specifies various factors, weighted based on the perceived degree of risk, which are applied to certain financial balances and financial activity. The adequacy of a company’s actual capital is evaluated by a comparison to the RBC results, as
determined by the formula. Companies below minimum RBC requirements are classified within certain levels, each of which requires specified corrective action.

The statutory capital and surplus presented above for CCC was approximately 264% and 270% of company action level RBC at
December 31, 2017 and 2016. Company action level RBC is the level of RBC which triggers a heightened level of regulatory supervision. The statutory capital and surplus of CCC’s foreign insurance subsidiaries, which is not significant to
the overall statutory capital and surplus, also met or exceeded their respective regulatory and other capital requirements.

Note 14. Benefit Plans

Pension Plans – The Company and its subsidiaries have several

non-contributory

defined benefit plans for eligible employees. Benefits for certain plans are determined annually based on a specified percentage of annual earnings (based on the participant’s age or years of service) and a specified interest rate (which is
established annually for all participants) applied to accrued balances. The benefits for another plan which covers salaried employees are based on formulas which include, among others, years of service and average pay. The Company and its
subsidiaries’ funding policy is to make contributions in accordance with applicable governmental regulatory requirements.

Other Postretirement Benefit Plans – The Company and its subsidiaries have several postretirement benefit plans covering
eligible employees and retirees. Participants generally become eligible after reaching age 55 with required years of service. Actual requirements for coverage vary by plan. Benefits for retirees who were covered by



bargaining units vary by each unit and contract. Benefits for certain retirees are in the form of a Company health care account.

Benefits for retirees reaching age 65 are generally integrated with Medicare. Other retirees, based on plan provisions, must
use Medicare as their primary coverage, with the Company and its subsidiaries reimbursing a portion of the unpaid amount; or are reimbursed for the Medicare Part B premium or have no Company coverage. The benefits provided by the Company and its
subsidiaries are basically health and, for certain retirees, life insurance type benefits.

The Company and its
subsidiaries fund certain of these benefit plans, and accrue postretirement benefits during the active service of those employees who would become eligible for such benefits when they retire. The Company and its subsidiaries use December 31 as
the measurement date for their plans.

In determining the discount rate assumption, we utilize current market and liability
information, including a discounted cash flow analysis of our pension and postretirement obligations. In particular, the basis for our discount rate selection was the yield on indices of highly rated fixed income debt securities with durations
comparable to that of our plan liabilities. The yield curve was applied to expected future retirement plan payments to adjust the discount rate to reflect the cash flow characteristics of the plans. The yield curves and indices evaluated in the
selection of the discount rate are comprised of high quality corporate bonds that are rated AA by an accepted rating agency.

The expected long term rate of return for plan assets is determined based on widely-accepted capital market principles, long
term return analysis for global fixed income and equity markets as well as the active total return oriented portfolio management style. Long term trends are evaluated relative to market factors such as inflation, interest rates and fiscal and
monetary policies, in order to assess the capital market assumptions as applied to the plan. Consideration of diversification needs and rebalancing is maintained.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts
reported for the health care plans. An increase or decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate of 1% in each year would not have a significant impact on the service and interest cost as of December 31, 2017. An increase of 1% in each
year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2017 by $2 million and a decrease of 1% in each year would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2017 by
$2 million.

In 2016, the CNA Retirement Plan paid $88 million to settle its obligation to certain
retirees through the purchase of a group annuity contract from a third party insurance company. The transaction reduced the plan’s projected benefit obligation by $86 million.

In 2015, CNA eliminated future benefit accruals associated with the CNA Retirement Plan effective June 30, 2015. This
amendment resulted in a $55 million curtailment which is a decrease in the plan benefit obligation liability and a reduction of the unrecognized actuarial losses included in AOCI.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was
$3.2 billion and $3.1 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016.

The Company and its subsidiaries employ a
total return approach whereby a mix of equity and fixed maturity securities are used to maximize the long term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk and to manage cash flows according to plan requirements. The target allocation of plan
assets is 40% to 60% invested in equity securities and limited partnerships, with the remainder primarily invested in fixed maturity securities. The intent of this strategy is to minimize expenses by generating investment returns that exceed the
growth of the plan liabilities over the long run. Risk tolerance is established after careful consideration of the plan liabilities, plan funded status and corporate financial conditions. The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of
fixed maturity, equity and short term securities. Alternative investments, including limited partnerships, are used to enhance risk adjusted long term returns while improving portfolio diversification. At December 31, 2017, the Company and its
subsidiaries had committed $107 million to future capital calls from various third party limited partnership investments in exchange for an ownership interest in the related partnerships. Investment risk is monitored through annual liability
measurements, periodic asset/liability studies and quarterly investment portfolio reviews.

at fair value, which represents the plans’ shares of the net asset value of each partnership, as determined by the general partner. Limited partnerships comprising 86% of the carrying value as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 employ hedge
fund strategies that generate returns through investing in marketable securities in the public fixed income and equity markets and the remainder were primarily invested in private debt and equity. Within hedge fund strategies, approximately 62% were
equity related, 32% pursued a multi-strategy approach and 6% were focused on distressed investments at December 31, 2017.

For a discussion of the valuation methodologies used to measure fixed maturity securities, equities and short term
investments, see Note 4.

There were no Level 3 assets at December 31, 2017 and 2016.

Savings Plans – The Company and its subsidiaries have several contributory savings plans which allow employees to make
regular contributions based upon a percentage of their salaries. Matching contributions are made up to specified percentages of employees’ contributions. The contributions by the Company and its subsidiaries to these plans amounted to
$105 million, $107 million and $115 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

Stock-based Compensation – In 2016, shareholders approved the Loews Corporation 2016 Incentive Compensation Plan (the
“2016 Loews Plan”) which replaced a previously existing plan. The aggregate number of shares of Loews common stock authorized under the 2016 Loews Plan is 6,000,000 shares, plus up to 3,000,000 shares that may be forfeited under the prior
plan. The maximum number of shares of Loews common stock with respect to which awards may be granted to any individual in any calendar year is 500,000 shares. In accordance with the 2016 Loews Plan and the prior plan, the Company’s stock-based
compensation consists of the following:

SARs:

SARs were granted under the prior plan. The exercise price per share may
not be less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Generally, SARs vest ratably over a four-year period and expire in ten years.

Time-based Restricted Stock Units:

Time-based restricted stock units (“RSUs”) were granted under the 2016 Loews Plan and
represent the right to receive one share of the Company’s common stock for each vested RSU. Generally, RSUs vest 50% on the second anniversary of the grant date and 50% on the third anniversary of the grant date.

Performance-based Restricted Stock Units:

Performance-based RSUs (“PSUs”) were granted under the 2016 Loews Plan and
represent the right to receive one share of the Company’s common stock for each vested PSU, subject to the achievement of specified performance goals by the Company. Generally, performance-based RSUs vest, if performance goals are satisfied,
50% on the second anniversary of the grant date and 50% on the third anniversary of the grant date.

In 2017, the Company
granted an aggregate of 274,500 RSUs and PSUs at a weighted average grant-date fair value of $45.91 per unit. 17,033 RSUs were forfeited during the year. 4,266,050 SARs were outstanding at December 31, 2017 with a weighted average exercise
price of $40.05.



The Company recognized compensation expense that decreased net income by
$33 million, $32 million and $14 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Several of the Company’s subsidiaries also maintain their own stock-based compensation plans. Such amounts include the
Company’s share of expense related to its subsidiaries’ plans.

Note 15. Reinsurance

CNA cedes insurance to reinsurers to limit its maximum loss, provide greater diversification of risk, minimize exposures on
larger risks and to exit certain lines of business. The ceding of insurance does not discharge the primary liability of CNA. A credit exposure exists with respect to reinsurance ceded to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet its
obligations. A collectability exposure also exists to the extent that the reinsurer disputes the liabilities assumed under reinsurance agreements. Property and casualty reinsurance coverages are tailored to the specific risk characteristics of each
product line and CNA’s retained amount varies by type of coverage. Reinsurance contracts are purchased to protect specific lines of business such as property and workers’ compensation. Corporate catastrophe reinsurance is also purchased
for property and workers’ compensation exposure. Currently most reinsurance contracts are purchased on an excess of loss basis. CNA also utilizes facultative reinsurance in certain lines. In addition, CNA assumes reinsurance, primarily through
Hardy and as a member of various reinsurance pools and associations.

The following table presents the amounts receivable
from reinsurers:

CNA has established an allowance for doubtful accounts on reinsurance receivables related to
credit risk. CNA reviews the allowance quarterly and adjusts the allowance as necessary to reflect changes in estimates of uncollectible balances. The allowance may also be reduced by write-offs of reinsurance receivable balances.

CNA attempts to mitigate its credit risk related to reinsurance by entering into reinsurance arrangements with reinsurers that
have credit ratings above certain levels and by obtaining collateral. On a limited basis, CNA may enter into reinsurance agreements with reinsurers that are not rated, primarily captive reinsurers. The primary methods of obtaining collateral are
through reinsurance trusts, letters of credit and funds withheld balances. Such collateral was approximately $2.9 billion and $3.0 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016.

CNA’s largest recoverables from a single reinsurer, including ceded unearned premium reserves as of December 31,
2017 were approximately $2.1 billion from a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Insurance Group, $395 million from the Gateway Rivers Insurance Company and $230 million from subsidiaries of Wilton Re. These amounts are substantially
collateralized. The recoverable from the Berkshire Hathaway Insurance Group includes amounts related to third party reinsurance for which NICO has assumed the credit risk under the terms of the loss portfolio transfer as discussed in Note 8.

affiliated with the

non-insurance

company policyholders, therefore this program provides a means for the policyholders to self-insure this property risk. CNA receives and retains a ceding commission.

Long term care premiums are from long duration contracts; property and casualty premiums are from short duration contracts.

Insurance claims and policyholders’ benefits reported on the Consolidated Statements of Income are net of
reinsurance recoveries of $3.1 billion, $3.0 billion and $2.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, including $2.5 billion, $2.6 billion and $2.3 billion related to the significant third
party captive program discussed above.

Note 17. Legal Proceedings

CNA Financial

In
September of 2016, a class action lawsuit was filed against CCC, Continental Assurance Company (“CAC”) (a former subsidiary of CCC), CNA, the Investment Committee of the CNA 401(k) Plus Plan (“Plan”), The Northern Trust Company
and John Does

1-10

(collectively “Defendants”) related to the Plan. The complaint alleges that Defendants breached fiduciary duties to the Plan and caused prohibited transactions in violation of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 when the Plan’s Fixed Income Fund’s annuity contract with CAC was canceled. The plaintiff alleges he and a proposed class of the Plan participants who had invested in the Fixed Income Fund
suffered lower returns in their Plan investments as a consequence of these alleged violations and seeks relief on behalf of the putative class. The Plan trustees have provided notice to their fiduciary coverage insurance carriers.

Through mediation, the plaintiff, Defendants and the Plan’s fiduciary insurance carriers reached an agreement in
principle to settle this matter. Upon completion of a definitive settlement agreement, plaintiff and Defendants will propose a class settlement for court approval. Based on the agreement in principle, management has recorded its best estimate of
CNA’s probable loss and the Company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of this matter will have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements.

Other Litigation

The
Company and its subsidiaries are from time to time parties to other litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. While it is difficult to predict the outcome or effect of any litigation, management does not believe that the outcome of any
such pending litigation will materially affect the Company’s results of operations or equity.



Note 18.

Commitments and Contingencies

CNA Guarantees

In the
course of selling business entities and assets to third parties, CNA agreed to guarantee the performance of certain obligations of previously owned subsidiaries and to indemnify purchasers for losses arising out of breaches of representation and
warranties with respect to the business entities or assets sold, including, in certain cases, losses arising from undisclosed liabilities or certain named litigation. Such guarantee and indemnification agreements in effect for sales of business
entities, assets and third party loans may include provisions that survive indefinitely. As of December 31, 2017, the aggregate amount related to quantifiable guarantees was $375 million and the aggregate amount related to quantifiable
indemnification agreements was $252 million. In certain cases, should CNA be required to make payments under any such guarantee, it would have the right to seek reimbursement from an affiliate of a previously owned subsidiary.

In addition, CNA has agreed to provide indemnification to third party purchasers for certain losses associated with sold
business entities or assets that are not limited by a contractual monetary amount. As of December 31, 2017, CNA had outstanding unlimited indemnifications in connection with the sales of certain of its business entities or assets that included
tax liabilities arising prior to a purchaser’s ownership of an entity or asset, defects in title at the time of sale, employee claims arising prior to closing and in some cases losses arising from certain litigation and undisclosed liabilities.
Certain provisions of the indemnification agreements survive indefinitely while others survive until the applicable statutes of limitation expire, or until the agreed upon contract terms expire.

CNA also provided guarantees, if the primary obligor fails to perform, to holders of structured settlement annuities provided
by a previously owned subsidiary. As of December 31, 2017, the potential amount of future payments CNA could be required to pay under these guarantees was approximately $1.8 billion, which will be paid over the lifetime of the annuitants.
CNA does not believe any payment is likely under these guarantees, as CNA is the beneficiary of a trust that must be maintained at a level that approximates the discounted reserves for these annuities.

CNA Small Business Premium Rate Adjustment

In 2016 and 2017, CNA identified rating errors related to its multi-peril package product and workers’ compensation
policies within its Small Business unit and determined that it would voluntarily issue premium refunds along with interest on affected policies. After the rating errors were identified, written and earned premium have been reported net of any impact
from the premium rate adjustments. For the year ended December 31, 2017, CNA recognized $36 million of adverse premium development and also increased interest expense by $7 million for interest due to policyholders on the premium rate
adjustments. For the year ended December 31, 2016 CNA recorded a charge which reduced earned premium by $16 million.

The policyholder refunds for the multi-peril package product were issued in the third quarter of 2017. The policyholder
refunds for workers’ compensation policies are expected to be refunded in 2018. The estimated refund liability, including interest, for the workers’ compensation policies as of December 31, 2017 was $60 million. Any fines or
penalties related to the foregoing are reasonably possible, but are not expected to be material to the Company’s financial statements.



Note 1

9. Segments

The Company has five reportable segments comprised of four individual operating subsidiaries, CNA, Diamond Offshore, Boardwalk
Pipeline and Loews Hotels & Co; and the Corporate segment. The operations of Consolidated Container since the acquisition date are included in the Corporate segment. Each of the operating subsidiaries is headed by a chief executive officer
who is responsible for the operation of its business and has the duties and authority commensurate with that position.

CNA’s business is the sale of property and casualty insurance coverage primarily through a network of independent agents,
brokers and managing general underwriters. CNA’s operations also include its long term care business that is in

run-off,

certain corporate expenses, including interest on CNA’s corporate debt, and
certain property and casualty businesses in

run-off,

including CNA Re and A&EP.

Diamond Offshore provides contract drilling services to the energy industry around the world with a fleet of 17 offshore
drilling rigs consisting of four drillships and seven ultra-deepwater, four deepwater and two

mid-water

semisubmersible rigs.

Boardwalk Pipeline is engaged in the interstate transportation and storage of natural gas and NGLs. This segment consists of
interstate natural gas pipeline systems originating in the Gulf Coast region, Oklahoma and Arkansas, and extending north and east through the midwestern states of Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, natural gas storage facilities in
four states and NGL pipelines and storage facilities in Louisiana and Texas, with approximately 14,335 miles of pipeline.

Loews Hotels & Co operates a chain of 24 hotels, 22 of which are in the United States and two of which are in Canada.

The Corporate segment consists of investment income from the Parent Company’s cash and investments, interest
expense, other unallocated expenses and the results of Consolidated Container since the acquisition date. Purchase accounting adjustments have been pushed down to the appropriate subsidiary.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in
Note 1.

In the following tables certain financial measures are presented to provide information used by management to
monitor the Company’s operating performance. These schedules present the reportable segments of the Company and their contribution to the consolidated financial statements. Amounts presented will not necessarily be the same as those in the
individual financial statements of the Company’s subsidiaries due to adjustments for purchase accounting, income taxes and noncontrolling interests.
