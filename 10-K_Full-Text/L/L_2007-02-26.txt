                  of
                  Lorillard, Inc., arising out of or related to tobacco or otherwise
                  arising
                  out of the past, present or future business of Lorillard, Inc.
                  or its
                  subsidiaries or predecessors, or claims arising out of or related

                  sale of any businesses previously sold by Lorillard, Inc. or its
                  subsidiaries or predecessors, in each case, whether grounded in
                  tort,
                  contract, statute or otherwise, whether pending or asserted in
                  the
                  future;

·

all
                  net income or net losses arising from the assets and liabilities
                  that are
                  reflected in the Carolina Group and all net proceeds from any disposition
                  of those assets, in each case, after deductions to reflect dividends
                  paid
                  to holders of Carolina Group stock or credited to the Loews Group
                  in

Carolina
                  Group Tracking Stock -
                  (Continued)

The
        Loews
        Group consists of all of our assets and liabilities other than the 62.3%
        economic interest in the Carolina Group represented by the outstanding Carolina
        Group stock, and includes as an asset the notional intergroup debt of the
        Carolina Group referred to above.

The
        creation of the Carolina Group and the issuance of Carolina Group stock does
        not
        change our ownership of Lorillard, Inc. or Lorillard, Inc.’s status as a
        separate legal entity. The Carolina Group and the Loews Group are notional
        groups that are intended to reflect the performance of the defined sets of
        assets and liabilities of each

group.
        The Carolina Group and the Loews Group are not separate legal entities and
        the

attribution
        of our assets and liabilities to the Loews Group or the Carolina Group does
        not
        affect title to the assets or responsibility for the liabilities so attributed.

Each
        outstanding share of Carolina Group Stock has 3/10 of a vote per share. Holders
        of our common stock and of Carolina Group stock are shareholders of Loews
        Corporation and are subject to the risks related to an equity investment
        in
        us.

CNA
        FINANCIAL CORPORATION

CNA
        Financial Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “CNA”) was incorporated
        in 1967 and is an insurance holding company. CNA’s property and casualty
        insurance operations are conducted by Continental Casualty Company (“CCC”),
        incorporated in 1897, and its affiliates, and The Continental Insurance Company
        (“CIC”), organized in 1853, and its affiliates. CIC became a subsidiary of CNA
        in 1995 as a result of the acquisition of The Continental Corporation
        (“Continental”). CNA accounted for 57.96%, 61.59% and 65.16% of our consolidated
        total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
        respectively.

CNA
        serves a wide variety of customers, including small, medium and large
        businesses, associations, professionals, and groups and individuals with
        a broad
        range of insurance and risk management products and services.

CNA’s
        insurance products primarily include property and casualty coverages. CNA
        services include risk management, information services, warranty and claims
        administration. CNA products and services are marketed through independent
        agents, brokers, managing general agents and direct sales.

CNA’s
        core business, property and casualty insurance operations, is reported in
        two
        business segments: Standard Lines and Specialty Lines. CNA’s non-core operations
        are managed in two segments: Life and Group Non-Core and Other Insurance.
        These
        segments are managed separately because of differences in their product lines
        and markets.

Standard
        Lines

Standard
        Lines works with an independent agency distribution system and network of
        brokers to market a broad range of property and casualty insurance products
        and
        services to small, middle-market and large businesses domestically and abroad.
        The Standard Lines operating model focuses on underwriting performance,
        relationships with selected distribution sources and understanding customer
        needs.

Standard
        Lines includes Property, Casualty and CNA Global.

Property:

Property
        provides standard and excess property coverage, as well as marine coverage
        and
        boiler and machinery to a wide range of businesses.

Casualty:

Casualty
        provides standard casualty insurance products such as workers’ compensation,
        general and product liability and commercial auto coverage through traditional
        products to a wide range of businesses. Most insurance programs are provided
        on
        a guaranteed cost basis; however, Casualty has the capability to offer
        specialized, loss-sensitive insurance programs to those customers viewed
        as
        higher risk and less predictable in exposure.

Excess
        & Surplus (“E&S”)

:
        E&S
        is included in Casualty. E&S provides specialized insurance and other
        financial products for selected commercial risks on both an individual customer
        and program basis. Customers insured by E&S are generally viewed as higher
        risk and less predictable in exposure than those covered by standard insurance
        markets. E&S’s products are distributed throughout the United States through
        specialist producers, program agents and Property and Casualty’s agents and
        brokers.

        centralized claim center designed to efficiently handle property damage and
        medical only claims and 18 claim office locations around the country handling
        the more complex claims. Also, Standard Lines provides total risk management
        services relating to claim and information services to the large commercial

        segment
        are offered. Products within US Specialty Lines are distributed through brokers,

        of independent agencies. CNA owns approximately 63% of CNA Surety.

Warranty:

Warranty
        provides vehicle warranty service contracts that protect individuals and
        businesses from the financial burden associated with mechanical breakdown,
        or
        maintenance.

Life
        and Group Non-Core

The
        Life
        and Group Non-Core segment primarily includes the results of the life and
        group
        lines of business that have either been sold or placed in run-off. CNA sold
        its
        individual life business on April 30, 2004 and its specialty medical business
        on
        January 6, 2005. The segment includes operating results for these businesses
        in
        periods prior to the sales, the realized gain/loss from the sales and the
        effects of the shared corporate overhead expenses which continue to be allocated
        to the segment. CNA continues to service its existing individual long term
        care
        commitments, its payout annuity business and its pension deposit business.

Trade
                  ratios reflect the results of CNA’s property and casualty insurance
                  subsidiaries. Trade ratios are industry measures of property and
                  casualty
                  underwriting results. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio
                  is the
                  percentage of net incurred claim and claim adjustment expenses
                  and the
                  expenses incurred related to uncollectible reinsurance receivables
                  to net
                  earned premiums. The primary difference in this ratio between accounting
                  principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and
                  statutory accounting practices (“SAP”) is related to the treatment of
                  active life reserves (“ALR”) related to long term care insurance products
                  written in property and casualty insurance subsidiaries. For GAAP,
                  ALR is
                  classified as claim and claim adjustment expense reserves whereas
                  for SAP,
                  ALR is classified as unearned premium reserves. The expense ratio,
                  using
                  amounts determined in accordance with GAAP, is the percentage of
                  underwriting and acquisition expenses (including the amortization
                  of
                  deferred acquisition expenses) to net earned premiums. The expense
                  ratio,
                  using amounts determined in accordance with SAP, is the percentage
                  of
                  acquisition and underwriting expenses (with no deferral of acquisition
                  expenses) to net written premiums. The dividend ratio, using amounts
                  determined in accordance with GAAP, is the ratio of dividends incurred
                  to
                  net earned premiums. The dividend ratio, using amounts determined
                  in
                  accordance with SAP, is the ratio of dividends paid to net earned
                  premiums. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment
                  expense, expense and dividend
                  ratios.

Other
                  data is determined in accordance with SAP. Life and group statutory
                  capital and surplus as a percent of total liabilities is determined
                  after
                  excluding separate account liabilities and reclassifying the statutorily
                  required Asset Valuation Reserve to
                  surplus.

(c)

Surplus
                  includes the property and casualty companies’ equity ownership of the life
                  company’s capital and surplus.

The
        following table displays the distribution of gross written premiums for CNA’s

                  premiums.

Approximately
        7.1%, 6.1% and 5.0% of CNA’s gross written premiums were derived from outside of
        the United States for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Premiums
        from any individual foreign country excluding the United Kingdom were not
        significant.

Property
        and Casualty Claim and Claim Adjustment Expenses

The
        following loss reserve development table illustrates the change over time
        of
        reserves established for property and casualty claim and claim adjustment
        expenses at the end of the preceding ten calendar years for CNA’s property and
        casualty insurance operations. The table excludes CNA’s life subsidiaries, and
        as such, the carried reserves will not agree to the Consolidated Financial
        Statements included under Item 8. The first section shows the reserves as
        originally reported at the end of the stated year. The second section, reading
        down, shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years
        with
        respect to the originally reported reserve liability. The third section,
        reading
        down, shows re-estimates of the originally recorded reserves as of the end
        of
        each successive year, which is the result of CNA’s property and casualty
        insurance subsidiaries’ expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances
        that pertain to the unsettled claims. The last section compares the latest
        re-estimated reserves to the reserves originally established, and indicates
        whether the original reserves were adequate or inadequate to cover the estimated
        costs of unsettled claims.

The

        and,
        therefore, ending balances should not be added since the amount at the end

        each calendar year includes activity for both the current and prior years.
        Additionally, the development amounts in the table below are the amounts

Effective
                    January 1, 2001, CNA established a new life insurance company,
                    CNA Group
                    Life Assurance Company (“CNAGLA”). Further, on January 1, 2001
                    approximately $1,055.0 of reserves were transferred from CCC
                    to
                    CNAGLA.

(c)

Effective
                    October 31, 2002, CNA sold CNA Reinsurance Company Limited (“CNA Re
                    U.K.”). As a result of the sale, net reserves were reduced by
                    approximately $1,316.0.

        adjustment expense reserves and reserve development set forth in Item 7,
        Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of

Other

Competition:

The
        property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive both as to
        rate
        and service. CNA’s consolidated property and casualty subsidiaries compete not
        only with other stock insurance companies, but also with mutual insurance
        companies, reinsurance companies and other entities for both producers and
        customers. CNA must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve
        its
        insurance products and services.

Rates
        among insurers vary according to the types of insurers and methods of operation.
        CNA competes for business not only on the basis of rate, but also on the
        basis
        of availability of coverage desired by customers, ratings and quality of
        service, including claim adjustment services.

There
        are
        approximately 2,400 individual companies that sell property and casualty
        insurance in the United States. CNA’s consolidated property and casualty
        subsidiaries ranked as the 13th largest property and casualty insurance
        organization and CNA is the seventh largest commercial insurance writer in
        the
        United States based upon 2005 statutory net written premiums.

Regulation:

The
        insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and
        supervision throughout the United States. Each state has established supervisory
        agencies with broad administrative powers relative to licensing insurers
        and
        agents, approving policy forms, establishing reserve requirements, fixing
        minimum interest rates for accumulation of surrender values and maximum interest
        rates of policy loans, prescribing the form and content of statutory financial
        reports and regulating solvency and the type and amount of investments
        permitted. Such regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations,
        which
        require that rates not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.
        In
        addition to regulation of dividends by insurance subsidiaries, intercompany
        transfers of assets may be subject to prior notice or approval by the state
        insurance regulators, depending on the size of such transfers and payments
        in
        relation to the financial position of the insurance affiliates making the
        transfer or payment.

Insurers
        are also required by the states to provide coverage to insureds who would
        not
        otherwise be considered eligible by the insurers. Each state dictates the
        types
        of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary
        risks. CNA’s share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a
        function of its respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance
        in
        each state.

Further,
        insurance companies are subject to state guaranty fund and other
        insurance-related assessments. Guaranty fund and other insurance-related
        assessments are levied by the state departments of insurance to cover claims
        of
        insolvent insurers.

Reform
        of
        the U.S. tort liability system is another issue facing the insurance industry.
        Over the last decade, many states have passed some type of reform. In recent
        years, for example, significant state general tort reforms have been enacted
        in
        Georgia, Ohio, Mississippi and South Carolina. Specific state legislation
        addressing state asbestos reform has been passed in Ohio, Georgia, Florida
        and
        Texas. A few more states will be considering such legislation in the coming
        year. Although these states’ legislatures have begun to address their litigious
        environments, some reforms are being challenged in the courts and it will
        take
        some time before they are finalized. Even though there has been some tort
        reform
        success, new causes of action and theories of damages continue to be proposed
        in
        state court actions or by legislatures. As a result of this unpredictability
        in
        the law, insurance underwriting and rating is expected to continue to be
        difficult in commercial lines, professional liability and some specialty
        coverages.

CNA
                  Financial Corporation -
                  (Continued)

Although
        the federal government and its regulatory agencies do not directly regulate
        the
        business of insurance, federal legislative and regulatory initiatives can
        impact
        the insurance industry in a variety of ways. These initiatives and legislation
        include tort reform proposals; proposals addressing natural catastrophe
        exposures, terrorism risk mechanisms; and various tax proposals affecting
        insurance companies. In 1999, Congress passed the Financial Services
        Modernization or “Gramm-Leach-Bliley” Act (“GLB Act”), which repealed portions
        of the Glass-Steagall Act and enabled closer relationships between banks
        and
        insurers. Although “functional regulation” was preserved by the GLB Act for
        state oversight of insurance, additional financial services modernization
        legislation could include provisions for an alternate federal system of
        regulation for insurance companies.

In
        addition, CNA’s domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk-based
        capital requirements. Risk-based capital is a method developed by the National
        Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) to determine the minimum amount
        of statutory capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its
        overall
        business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile. The formula
        for determining the amount of risk-based capital specifies various factors,
        weighted based on the perceived degree of risk, which are applied to certain
        financial balances and financial activity. The adequacy of a company’s actual
        capital is evaluated by a comparison to the risk-based capital results, as
        determined by the formula. Companies below minimum risk-based capital
        requirements are classified within certain levels, each of which requires
        specified corrective action. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, all of CNA’s
        domestic insurance subsidiaries exceeded the minimum risk-based capital
        requirements.

Subsidiaries
        with insurance operations outside the United States are also subject to
        regulation in the countries in which they operate. CNA has operations in
        the
        United Kingdom, Canada and other countries.

LORILLARD,
        INC.

Lorillard,
        Inc. (“Lorillard”) is engaged, through its subsidiaries, in the production and
        sale of cigarettes. The principal cigarette brand names of Lorillard are
        Newport, Kent, True, Maverick and Old Gold. Lorillard’s largest selling brand is
        Newport, the second largest selling cigarette brand in the United States
        and the
        largest selling brand in the menthol segment of the U.S. cigarette market
        in
        2006. Newport accounted for approximately 91.8% of Lorillard’s sales volume in
        2006.

Substantially
        all of Lorillard’s sales are in the United States, Puerto Rico and certain U.S.
        territories. Lorillard’s major trademarks outside of the United States were sold
        in 1977. Lorillard accounted for 21.54%, 22.70% and 22.22% of our consolidated
        total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
        respectively.

Legislation
        and Regulation:

Lorillard’s
        business operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local
        laws
        and regulations governing, among other things, publication of health warnings
        on
        cigarette packaging, advertising and sales of tobacco products, restrictions
        on
        smoking in public places and fire safety standards. New legislation and
        regulations are proposed and reports are published by government sponsored
        committees and others recommending additional regulation of tobacco
        products.

Lorillard
        cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these proposals, reports and
        recommendations. If they are enacted, certain of these proposals could have
        a
        material adverse effect on Lorillard’s business and our financial position or
        results of operations in the future.

Federal
        Regulation:

The
        Federal Comprehensive Smoking Education Act, which became effective in 1985,
        requires that cigarette packaging and advertising display one of the following
        four warning statements, on a rotating basis:

(1)
        “SURGEON GENERAL’S WARNING: Smoking Causes Lung Cancer, Heart Disease,
        Emphysema, And May Complicate Pregnancy.”

(2)
        “SURGEON GENERAL’S WARNING: Quitting Smoking Now Greatly Reduces Serious Risks
        to Your Health.”

(3)
        “SURGEON GENERAL’S WARNING: Smoking By Pregnant Women May Result in Fetal
        Injury, Premature Birth, and Low Birth Weight.”

(4)
        “SURGEON GENERAL’S WARNING: Cigarette Smoke Contains Carbon Monoxide.”

This
        law
        also requires that each person who manufactures, packages or imports cigarettes
        shall annually provide to the Secretary of Health and Human Services a list
        of
        the ingredients added to tobacco in the manufacture of cigarettes. This list
        of
        ingredients may be submitted in a manner that does not identify the company
        that
        uses the ingredients or the brand of cigarettes that contain the
        ingredients.

In
        addition, bills have been introduced in Congress, including those that would:

·

prohibit
                  all tobacco advertising and
                  promotion;

·

require
                  new health warnings on cigarette packages and
                  advertising;

·

authorize
                  the establishment of various anti-smoking education
                  programs;

·

provide
                  that current federal law should not be construed to relieve any
                  person of
                  liability under common or state
                  law;

·

permit
                  state and local governments to restrict the sale and distribution
                  of
                  cigarettes;

·

direct
                  the placement of advertising of tobacco products;

·

provide
                  that cigarette advertising not be deductible as a business
                  expense;

·

prohibit
                  the mailing of unsolicited samples of cigarettes and otherwise
                  to restrict
                  the sale or distribution of cigarettes in retail stores, by mail
                  or over
                  the internet;

·

impose
                  an additional, or increase existing, excise taxes on
                  cigarettes;

·

require
                    that cigarettes be manufactured in a manner that will cause them,
                    under
                    certain circumstances, to be self-extinguishing;
                    and

·

subject
                  cigarettes to regulation in various ways by the U.S. Department
                  of Health
                  and Human Services or other regulatory
                  agencies.

In
        1996,
        the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) published regulations that would
        have extensively regulated the distribution, marketing and advertising of
        cigarettes, including the imposition of a wide range of labeling, reporting,
        record keeping, manufacturing and other requirements. Challenges to the FDA’s
        assertion of jurisdiction over cigarettes made by Lorillard and other
        manufacturers were upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in March of 2000 when
        that
        Court ruled that Congress did not give the FDA authority to regulate tobacco
        products under the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.

Since
        the
        Supreme Court decision, various proposals and recommendations have been made
        for
        additional federal and state legislation to regulate cigarette manufacturers,
        including a bill introduced by Congress in February 2007. Congressional
        advocates of FDA regulation proposed legislation that would give the FDA
        regulatory authority over the manufacture, sale, distribution and labeling
        of
        tobacco products to protect public health. The legislation would allow the
        FDA
        to reinstate its prior regulations or adopt new or additional
        regulations.

In
        February of 2001, a committee of the Institute of Medicine, a private,
        non-profit organization which advises the federal government on medical issues,
        convened and issued a report recommending that Congress enact legislation.
        The
        committee suggested enabling a suitable agency to regulate tobacco-related
        products that purport to reduce exposure to tobacco toxicants or reduce risk
        of
        disease, and implement other policies designed to reduce the harm from tobacco
        use. The report recommended regulation of all tobacco products, including
        potentially reduced exposure products, known as PREPs.

In
        2002,
        certain public health groups petitioned the FDA to assert jurisdiction over
        several PREP type products that have been introduced into the marketplace.
        These
        groups assert that claims made by manufacturers of these products allow the
        FDA
        to regulate the manufacture, advertising and sale of these products as drugs
        or
        medical devices under the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. The agency has received
        comments on these petitions but has taken no action.

In
        late
        2002 Philip Morris U.S.A., the largest U.S. manufacturer of cigarettes, filed
        a
        request for rulemaking petition with the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”)
        seeking changes in the existing FTC regulatory scheme for measuring and
        reporting tar and nicotine to the federal government and for inclusion in
        cigarette advertising. The agency has received comments on these petitions
        but
        has taken no action.

Environmental
        tobacco smoke:

Various
        publications and studies by governmental entities have reported that
        environmental tobacco smoke (“ETS”) presents health risks. In addition, public
        health organizations have issued statements on the adverse health effects
        of
        ETS, and scientific papers have been published that address the health problems
        associated with ETS exposure. Various cities and municipalities have restricted
        public smoking in recent years, and these restrictions have been based at
        least
        in part on the publications regarding the health risks believed to be associated
        with ETS exposure.

The
        governmental entities that have published these reports have included the
        Surgeon General of the United States, first in 1986 and again in 2006. The
        report, for instance, concluded that there is no risk-free level of exposure
        to
        ETS; see “Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, Lorillard, Inc.” of this
        Report for a discussion of the report issued in 2006 by the United States
        Surgeon General. In 2000, the Department of Health and Human Services listed
        ETS
        as a known human carcinogen. In 1993, the United States Environmental Protection
        Agency concluded that ETS is a human lung carcinogen in adults and causes
        respiratory effects in children.

                  1. Business

Lorillard,
                  Inc. - (Continued)

Agencies
        of state governments also have issued publications regarding ETS, including
        reports by California entities that were published in 1997, 1999 and 2006.
        In
        the 2006 study, the California Air Resources Board determined that ETS is
        a
        toxic air contaminant. Based on these or other findings, public health concerns
        regarding ETS could lead to the imposition of additional restriction on public
        smoking, including bans.

State
        and Local Regulation:

Many
        state, local and municipal governments and agencies, as well as private
        businesses, have adopted legislation, regulations or policies which prohibit
        or
        restrict, or are intended to discourage, smoking, including legislation,
        regulations or policies prohibiting or restricting smoking in various places
        such as public buildings and facilities, stores, restaurants and bars and
        on
        airline flights and in the workplace. This trend has increased significantly
        since the release of the EPA’s report regarding ETS in 1993.

Two
        states, Massachusetts and Texas, have enacted legislation requiring each
        manufacturer of cigarettes sold in those states to submit an annual report
        identifying for each brand sold certain “added constituents,” and providing
        nicotine yield ratings and other information for certain brands. Neither
        law
        allows for the public release of trade secret information.

A
        New
        York law requires cigarettes sold in that state to meet a mandated standard
        for
        ignition propensity, which became effective in June of 2004. Lorillard developed
        proprietary technology to comply with the standards and was compliant by
        the
        effective date. Since the passage of the New York law, an additional five
        states
        have passed similar laws utilizing the same technical standards. The effective
        dates of these laws range from May of 2006 to January 2008.

Other
        similar laws and regulations have been enacted or considered by other state
        and
        local governments. Lorillard cannot predict the impact which these regulations
        may have on Lorillard’s business, though if enacted, they could have a material
        adverse effect on Lorillard’s business and our financial position or results of
        operations in the future.

Excise
        Taxes and Assessments:

Cigarettes
        are subject to substantial federal, state and local excise taxes in the United
        States and, in general, such taxes have been increasing. The federal excise
        tax
        on cigarettes is $19.50 per thousand cigarettes (or $0.39 per pack of 20
        cigarettes). State excise taxes, which are levied upon and paid by the
        distributors, are also in effect in the fifty states, the District of Columbia
        and many municipalities. Increases in state excise taxes on cigarette sales
        in
        2006 ranged from $0.05 per pack to $1.00 per pack in six states and two
        municipalities. The average state excise tax increased to $0.96 per pack
        (of 20
        cigarettes) in 2006 from $0.92 in 2005. Proposals for additional increases
        in
        federal, state and local excise taxes continue to be considered. The combined
        state and municipal taxes range from $0.07 to $3.66 per pack of cigarettes.

A
        federal
        law enacted in October 2004 repealed the federal supply management program
        for
        tobacco growers and compensated tobacco quota holders and growers with payments
        to be funded by an assessment on tobacco manufacturers and importers. Cigarette
        manufacturers and importers are responsible for paying 96.3% of a $10.14
        billion
        payment to tobacco quota holders and growers over a ten-year period. The
        law
        provides that payments will be based on shipments for domestic
        consumption.

Advertising
        and Marketing:

Lorillard
        advertises its products to adult smokers in magazines, newspapers, direct
        mail
        and point-of-sale display materials. In addition, Lorillard promotes its
        cigarette brands to adult smokers through distribution of store coupons,
        retail
        price promotions, and personal contact with distributors and retailers. Although
        Lorillard’s sales are made primarily to wholesale distributors rather than
        retailers, Lorillard’s sales personnel monitor retail and wholesale inventories,
        work with retailers on displays and signs, and enter into promotional
        arrangements with retailers regularly.

Lorillard
        allocates its marketing expenditures among brands on the basis of marketplace
        opportunity and profitable return. In particular, Lorillard focuses its
        marketing efforts on the premium segment of the U.S. cigarette industry,
        with a
        specific focus on Newport.

Advertising
        of tobacco products through television and radio has been prohibited since
        1971.
        In addition, on November 23, 1998, Lorillard and the three other largest
        cigarette manufacturers entered into a Master Settlement Agreement (“MSA”) with
        46 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and
        certain
        other U.S. territories to settle certain health care cost recovery and other
        claims. These manufacturers had previously settled similar claims

brought
        by the four remaining states which together with the MSA are generally referred
        to as the “State

Lorillard,
                  Inc. - (Continued)

Settlement
        Agreements.” Under the State Settlement Agreements, the participating cigarette
        manufacturers agreed to severe restrictions on their advertising and promotion
        activities. Among other things, the MSA:

·

prohibits
                  the targeting of youth in the advertising, promotion or marketing
                  of
                  tobacco products;

·

bans
                  the use of cartoon characters in all tobacco advertising and
                  promotion;

·

limits
                  each tobacco manufacturer to one event sponsorship during any twelve-month

                  proof that the intended gift recipient is an
                  adult.

Many
        states, cities and counties have enacted legislation or regulations further
        restricting tobacco advertising. There may be additional local, state and
        federal legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to the advertising
        and
        promotion of cigarettes in the future. Lorillard cannot predict the impact
        of
        such initiatives on its marketing and sales efforts.

Lorillard
        funds a Youth Smoking Prevention Program, which is designed to discourage
        youth
        from smoking by promoting parental involvement and assisting parents in
        discussing the issue of smoking with their children. Lorillard is also a
        founding and principal member of the Coalition for Responsible Tobacco Retailing
        which through its “We Card” program trains retailers in how to prevent the
        purchase of cigarettes by underage persons. In addition, Lorillard has adopted
        guidelines established by the National Association of Attorneys General to
        restrict advertising in magazines with large readership among people under
        the
        age of 18.

Distribution
        Methods:

Lorillard
        sells its products primarily to distributors, who in turn service retail
        outlets; chain store organizations; and government agencies, including the
        U.S.
        Armed Forces. Upon completion of the manufacturing process, Lorillard ships
        cigarettes to public distribution warehouse facilities for rapid order
        fulfillment to wholesalers and other direct buying customers. Lorillard retains
        a portion of its manufactured cigarettes at its Greensboro central distribution
        center and Greensboro cold-storage facility for future finished goods
        replenishment.

As
        of
        December 31, 2006, Lorillard had approximately 633 direct buying customers
        servicing more than 400,000 retail accounts. Lorillard does not sell cigarettes
        directly to consumers. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, sales made by Lorillard
        to
        McLane Company, Inc., comprised 23%, 21% and 20%, respectively, of Lorillard’s
        revenues. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of 2006, 2005 or
        sales. Lorillard does not have any backlog orders.

Most
        of
        Lorillard’s customers buy cigarettes on a next-day-delivery basis. Approximately
        90% of Lorillard’s customers purchase cigarettes using electronic funds
        transfer, which provides immediate payment to Lorillard.

Raw
        Materials and Manufacturing:

In
        its
        production of cigarettes, Lorillard uses domestic and foreign grown burley
        and
        flue-cured leaf tobaccos, as well as aromatic tobaccos grown primarily in
        Turkey
        and other Near Eastern countries. A domestic supplier manufactures all of
        Lorillard’s reconstituted tobacco.

Lorillard
        purchases more than 90% of its domestic leaf tobacco from Alliance One
        International, Inc. Lorillard directs Alliance One in the purchase of tobacco
        according to Lorillard’s specifications for quality, grade, yield, particle
        size, moisture content, and other characteristics. Alliance One purchases
        and
        processes the whole leaf and then dries and packages it for shipment to and
        storage at Lorillard’s Danville, Virginia facility. If Alliance One becomes
        unwilling or

unable
        to
        supply leaf tobacco to Lorillard, Lorillard believes that it can readily
        obtain
        high-quality leaf tobacco from well-established, alternative industry
        sources.

Due
        to
        the varying size and quality of annual crops and other economic factors,
        tobacco
        prices have historically fluctuated. In 2004, a federal law eliminated
        historical U.S. price supports that accompanied production controls which
        inflated the market price of U.S. tobacco. Lorillard believes the elimination
        of
        production controls and price supports has favorably impacted the cost of
        U.S.
        tobacco.

Lorillard
        stores its tobacco in 29 storage warehouses on its 130-acre Danville, Virginia
        facility. To protect against loss, amounts of all types and grades of tobacco
        are stored in separate warehouses. Because of the aging requirements for
        tobacco, Lorillard maintains large quantities of leaf tobacco at all times.
        Lorillard believes its current tobacco supplies are adequately balanced for
        its
        present production requirements. If necessary, Lorillard can purchase aged
        tobacco in the open market to supplement existing inventories.

Lorillard
        produces cigarettes at its Greensboro, North Carolina manufacturing plant,
        which
        has a production capacity of approximately 185 million cigarettes per day
        and
        approximately 43 billion cigarettes per year. Through various automated systems
        and sensors, Lorillard actively monitors all phases of production to promote
        quality and compliance with applicable regulations.

Prices:

Lorillard
        believes that the volume of U.S. cigarette sales is sensitive to price changes.
        Changes in pricing by Lorillard or other cigarette manufacturers could have
        an
        adverse impact on Lorillard’s volume of units sold and consequently on
        Lorillard’s profits and earnings. Lorillard makes independent pricing decisions
        based on a number of factors. Lorillard cannot predict the potential adverse
        impact of price changes on the following:

·

industry
                  volume or Lorillard volume,

·

the
                  mix between premium and discount
                  sales,

·

Lorillard’s
                  market share or

·

Lorillard’s
                  profits and earnings.

In
        addition, Lorillard and other cigarette manufacturers engage in significant
        promotional activities. These sales promotion costs are accounted for as
        a
        reduction in net sales revenue and therefore impact average prices.

Properties:

Lorillard’s
        manufacturing facility is located on approximately 80 acres in Greensboro,
        North
        Carolina. This 942,600 square-foot plant contains modern high-speed cigarette
        manufacturing machinery. The Greensboro facility also includes a warehouse
        with
        shipping and receiving areas totaling 54,800 square feet. In addition, Lorillard
        owns tobacco receiving and storage facilities totaling approximately 1,400,000
        square feet in Danville, Virginia. Lorillard’s executive offices are located in
        a 130,000 square-foot, four-story office building in Greensboro. Its 93,800
        square-foot research facility is also located in Greensboro.

Lorillard’s
        principal properties are owned in fee. With minor exceptions, Lorillard owns
        all
        of the machinery it uses. Lorillard believes that its properties and machinery
        are in generally good condition. Lorillard leases sales offices in major
        cities
        throughout the United States, a cold-storage facility in Greensboro and
        warehousing space in 21 public distributing warehouses located throughout
        the
        United States.

Competition:

The
        domestic U.S. market for cigarettes is highly competitive. Competition is
        primarily based on a brand’s price, including level of discounting and other
        promotional activities, positioning, consumer loyalty, retail display, quality
        and taste. Lorillard’s principal competitors are the two other major U.S.
        cigarette manufacturers, Philip Morris (“PM”) and Reynolds American Inc.
        (“RAI”).

Lorillard
        believes its ability to compete even more effectively has been restrained
        by the
        Philip Morris Retail Leaders program and the combination of RJ Reynolds Tobacco
        Company (“RJR”) and Brown & Williamson (“B&W”) in 2004. The terms of
        Philip Morris’ merchandising contracts may effectively limit Lorillard from
        obtaining visible space in the

retail
        store to effectively promote its brands. As a result, in a large number of
        retail locations, Lorillard either has a severely limited or no opportunity
        to
        competitively support its promotion programs which limits its sales
        potential.

Lorillard’s
        9.7% market share of the 2006 U.S. domestic cigarette industry was third
        highest
        overall. Philip Morris and RAI accounted for approximately 49.2% and 27.9%,
        respectively, of wholesale shipments in 2006. Among the three major
        manufacturers, Lorillard ranked third behind Philip Morris and RAI with a
        12.7%
        share of the premium segment in 2006.

BOARDWALK
        PIPELINE PARTNERS, LP

Boardwalk
        Pipeline Partners, LP (“Boardwalk Pipeline”) is engaged in the interstate
        transportation and storage of natural gas. Boardwalk Pipeline accounted for
        3.45%, 3.57% and 1.74% of our consolidated total revenue for the years ended
        December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

In
        November of 2005, Boardwalk Pipeline completed an initial public offering
        of
        15,000,000 common units representing a 14.5% limited partnership interest.
        We
        owned 53,256,122 common and 33,093,878 subordinated units representing an
        aggregate 83.5% limited partner interest, and a wholly owned subsidiary of
        ours
        became the general partner of Boardwalk Pipeline and owns a 2.0% general
        partnership interest and all of Boardwalk Pipeline’s incentive distribution
        rights, which entitle the general partner to an increasing percentage of
        the
        cash that is distributed by Boardwalk Pipeline in excess of $0.4025 per unit
        per
        quarter.

In
        the
        fourth quarter of 2006, Boardwalk Pipeline sold an additional 6,900,000 common
        units at a price of $29.65 per unit in a public offering and received net
        proceeds of $195.2 million. In addition, we contributed $4.2 million to maintain
        our 2.0% general partner interest. As a result, as of December 31, 2006,
        we own
        80.2% of Boardwalk Pipeline.

Boardwalk
        Pipeline owns and operates two interstate natural gas pipeline systems, with
        approximately 13,400 miles of pipeline, directly serving customers in 11
        states
        and indirectly serving customers throughout the northeastern and southeastern
        United States through numerous interconnections with unaffiliated pipelines.
        In
        2006, its pipeline systems transported approximately 1,340 billion cubic
        feet
        (“Bcf”) of gas. Average daily throughput on its pipeline systems during 2006 was
        approximately 3.7 Bcf. Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas storage facilities are
        comprised of 11 underground storage fields located in four states with aggregate
        working gas capacity of approximately 146.0 Bcf.

Boardwalk
        Pipeline conducts all of its operation through two subsidiaries:

·

Texas
                  Gas Transmission, LLC (“Texas Gas”) operates approximately 5,900 miles of
                  natural gas pipeline located in Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi,
                  Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, and Illinois having a peak-day
                  delivery capacity of approximately 3.2 Bcf per day, and nine natural
                  gas
                  storage fields located in Indiana and Kentucky with aggregate designated
                  working gas capacity of approximately 63.0
                  Bcf.

·

Gulf
                  South Pipeline, LP (“Gulf South”) operates approximately 7,500 miles of
                  natural gas pipeline, located in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi,
                  Alabama
                  and Florida having a peak-day delivery capacity of approximately
                  3.5 Bcf
                  per day, and two natural gas storage fields located in Louisiana
                  and
                  Mississippi with aggregate designated working gas capacity of
                  approximately 83.0 Bcf.

Boardwalk
        Pipeline transports and stores natural gas for a broad mix of customers,
        including local distribution companies (“LDC”s), municipalities, interstate and
        intrastate pipelines, direct industrial users, electric power generation
        plants,
        marketers and producers.

Seasonality:

Boardwalk Pipeline’s revenues are seasonal in nature and are affected by
        weather and natural gas price volatility. Weather impacts natural gas demand
        for
        power generation and heating purposes, which in turn influences the value
        of
        transportation and storage across its pipeline systems. Colder than normal
        winters or warmer than normal summers typically result in increased pipeline
        transportation revenues. Natural gas prices are also volatile, influencing
        drilling and production which can affect revenues from Boardwalk Pipeline’s
        storage and parking and lending (“PAL”)

services.
        Peak demand for natural gas occurs during the winter months, caused by the
        heating load. During 2006, approximately 56.8% of Boardwalk’s total operating
        revenues were realized in the first and fourth calendar quarters.

Regulation:

The
        Federal Energy Regulatory Commission

(the
        “FERC”) regulates pipelines under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (“NGA”) and the
        Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. FERC regulates, among other things, the rates
        and charges for the transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate
        commerce, the extension, enlargement or abandonment of jurisdictional
        facilities, and the financial accounting of certain regulated pipeline
        companies. These rates are designed based on certain assumptions to allow
        Boardwalk Pipeline the opportunity to recover its costs and earn a reasonable
        return on equity, however, there is no assurance that Boardwalk Pipeline
        will
        recover these costs from its customers. Gulf South is permitted to charge
        market-based storage rates pursuant to authority granted by the FERC. Boardwalk
        Pipeline is also regulated by the United States Department of Transportation
        (“DOT”) under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended by Title
        I
        of the Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, which regulates safety requirements in
        the
        design, construction, operation and maintenance of interstate natural gas
        pipelines.

Where
        required, Texas Gas and Gulf South hold certificates of public convenience
        and
        necessity issued by the FERC covering their facilities, activities and services.
        The FERC also prescribes accounting treatment for items for regulatory purposes
        and may periodically audit the books and records of Texas Gas and Gulf
        South.

The
        maximum rates that may be charged by Boardwalk Pipeline for gas transportation
        and, in the case of Texas Gas, for storage services, are established through
        FERC ratemaking process. Key determinants in the rate-making process are
        the
        costs of providing service, the allowed rate of return on capital investments,
        volume throughput assumptions, the allocation of costs and the rate design.
        The
        allowed rate of return must be approved by the FERC in each rate case. Texas
        Gas
        filed a rate case in 2005 which was settled in the second quarter of 2006.
        Texas
        Gas has no obligation to file a new rate case and is prohibited from placing
        new
        rates into effect prior to November 1, 2010. Gulf South has no obligation
        to
        file a new rate case.

Boardwalk
          Pipeline’s operations are also subject to extensive federal, state and local
          laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment. These laws
          include, for example:

·

the
                  Clean Air Act, and analogous state laws which impose obligations
                  related
                  to air emissions;

·

the
                  Water Pollution Control Act, commonly referred to as the Clean
                  Water Act,
                  and analogous state laws which regulate discharge of wastewaters
                  from our
                  facilities into state and federal waters;

·

the
                  Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
                  Act
                  commonly referred to as CERCLA, or the Superfund law, and analogous
                  state
                  laws which regulate the cleanup of hazardous substances; and

·

the
                  Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and analogous state laws
                  which
                  impose requirements for the handling and discharge of solid and
                  hazardous
                  waste.

Competition:

Boardwalk Pipeline competes with numerous intrastate and interstate pipelines
        throughout its service territory to provide transportation and storage services
        for its customers. Competition is particularly strong in the Midwest and
        Gulf
        Coast states where Boardwalk Pipeline competes with numerous existing pipelines
        and several new pipeline projects that are under way, including the proposed
        Rockies Express Pipeline that would transport natural gas from northern Colorado
        to eastern Ohio; the Heartland Gas Pipeline currently being constructed in
        Indiana; the proposed Mid-Continent Express pipeline that would transport
        gas
        from Texas to Alabama; and the proposed Southeast Header Supply System that
        would transport gas from Perryville, Louisiana to markets in Florida. The
        principal elements of competition among pipelines are rates, terms of service,
        access to supply and flexibility and reliability of service. In addition,
        regulators’ continuing efforts to increase competition in the natural gas
        industry have increased the natural gas transportation options of Boardwalk
        Pipeline’s traditional customers. As a result, segmentation and capacity release
        have created an active secondary market which increasingly competes with
        its
        pipeline services, particularly on its Texas Gas system.

Boardwalk
        Pipeline’s business is, in part, dependent on the volumes of natural gas
        consumed in the United States. Boardwalk Pipeline’s competitors attempt to
        either attract new supply to their pipelines or attach new load to
        their

pipelines,
        including those that are currently connected to markets served by Boardwalk
        Pipeline. Boardwalk Pipeline competes with these entities to maintain current
        business levels and to serve new demand and markets. In addition, natural
        gas
        competes with other forms of energy available to its customers, including
        electricity, coal and fuel oils.

Expansion
        Projects:

Boardwalk
        Pipeline has constructed a 20.5 mile segment of 42-inch pipeline from Carthage,
        Texas to Keatchie, Louisiana which was placed in service in December of 2006.
        The current capacity of this loop is 120.0 MMcf per day.

Boardwalk
        Pipeline is pursuing a pipeline expansion project consisting of 242 miles
        of
        42-inch pipeline from DeSoto Parish in western Louisiana to near Harrisville,
        Mississippi and approximately 110,000 horsepower of new compression. The
        expansion would add approximately 1.7 Bcf per day of new transmission capacity
        to the Gulf South pipeline system. The natural gas to be transported on this
        expansion will originate primarily from the Barnett Shale and Bossier Sands
        producing regions of East Texas. The expansion will transport natural gas
        to new
        interstate pipeline interconnects in the Perryville, Louisiana area and existing
        pipeline interconnects with other pipelines east of the Mississippi River.
        This
        project is supported by binding precedent agreements with customers who have
        contracted, on a long-term basis (with a weighted average term of approximately
        7 years), for 1.3 Bcf per day from Carthage, Texas with an option for an
        additional 100.0 MMcf per day. On September 1, 2006, Boardwalk Pipeline filed
        a
        certificate application relating to this project with the FERC. Boardwalk
        Pipeline expects this project to be in service during the fall of 2007.

Boardwalk
        Pipeline is pursuing construction of a new interstate pipeline that will
        begin
        near Sherman, Texas and proceed to the Perryville, Louisiana area. The project
        will be owned by a new subsidiary, which is referred to as Gulf Crossing
        Pipeline, and will consist of approximately 355 miles of 42-inch pipeline
        having
        capacity of up to approximately 1.6 Bcf per day. Additionally, Gulf Crossing
        Pipeline will enter into: (i) an operating lease for at least 1.1 Bcf per
        day of
        capacity on the Gulf South system (including on the Southeast Expansion and
        a
        portion of the East Texas and Mississippi Expansion) to make deliveries to
        an
        interconnect with Transcontinental Pipe Line Company (“Transco”) in Choctaw
        County, Alabama and (ii) an operating lease with a third-party intrastate
        pipeline which will bring certain gas supplies to its system. This project
        is
        supported by binding agreements with customers who have contracted for 1.1
        Bcf
        per day of capacity under firm contracts having terms of 5 to 10 years (with
        a
        weighted-average term of approximately 9.8 years), and options with certain
        of
        these customers for an additional 350.0 MMcf per day of capacity. Boardwalk
        Pipeline anticipates making the required filings with the FERC by July of
        and for the project to be in service during the fourth quarter of 2008.
        Boardwalk Pipeline is in negotiations with one of the foundation shippers
        supporting this project concerning the purchase of 49.0% of the equity of
        Gulf
        Crossing Pipeline.

Boardwalk
        Pipeline is pursuing a pipeline expansion extending the Gulf South pipeline
        system from near Harrisville, Mississippi to an interconnect with Transco
        in
        Choctaw County, Alabama which will enhance its ability to deliver gas to
        the
        Northeast through other pipeline interconnects. This expansion will consist
        of
        approximately 112 miles of 42-inch pipeline having initial capacity of
        approximately 1.2 Bcf per day expandable to as much as 2.0 Bcf per day to
        accommodate volumes expected to come from the Gulf Crossing leased capacity
        discussed above. In addition, Gulf South has executed an operating lease
        with
        Destin Pipeline Company to access markets in Florida. This project is supported
        by binding agreements with customers who have contracted for 660.0 MMcf per
        day
        of capacity under firm contracts having terms of 5 to 10 years (with a
        weighted-average term of 9.2 years), as well as the capacity leased to Gulf
        Crossing discussed above. The certificate filing was made with the FERC in
        December of 2006 and the project is anticipated to be in service during first
        quarter of 2008.

Boardwalk
        Pipeline is pursuing the construction of two laterals connected to its Texas
        Gas
        pipeline system to transport gas from the Fayetteville Shale area in Arkansas
        to
        markets directly and indirectly served by Texas Gas. The Fayetteville Lateral,
        consisting of approximately 165 miles of 36-inch pipeline is anticipated
        to have
        an initial design capacity of 800.0 MMcf per day and a maximum design capacity
        of 1.1 Bcf per day. This lateral will originate in Conway County, Arkansas
        and
        proceed southeast through the Bald Knob, Arkansas area to an interconnect
        with
        Texas Gas’s pipeline in Coahoma County, Mississippi. The Greenville Lateral,
        consisting of approximately 95 miles of pipeline with an initial design capacity
        of 750.0 MMcf per day, will originate at Texas Gas’s mainline near Greenville,
        Mississippi and proceed east to the Kosciusko, Mississippi area. The Greenville
        Lateral will allow customers to access additional markets primarily in the
        Midwest, Northeast and Southeast, including the Henry Hub. Construction of
        both
        laterals is supported by a binding precedent agreement with Southwestern
        Energy
        Services Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Southwestern Energy Company.
        The
        proposed extensions are subject to FERC approval. In December of 2006, the
        FERC
        granted Texas Gas’s request to initiate the pre-filing process for this project
        and Boardwalk Pipeline anticipates

        the required certificate filings with the FERC in June of 2007. Boardwalk
        Pipeline expects the project to be in service during the first quarter of
        2009.

The
        total
        cost of the pipeline expansion projects discussed above is expected to be
        approximately $3.3 billion (before taking into account equity that would
        be
        contributed by the purchaser of a 49.0% interest in Gulf Crossing referred
        to
        above). Boardwalk Pipeline constantly seeks to optimize these projects to
        reduce
        the overall cost. However the actual cost to complete these projects may
        exceed
        Boardwalk Pipeline’s current estimate as a result of, among other things, higher
        labor and material costs due to the large number of pipeline projects under
        way
        throughout the industry or Boardwalk Pipeline’s need to expand pipeline capacity
        if it contracts for additional volumes. For a further discussion of the risks

In
        December of 2006, the FERC issued a certificate approving Texas Gas’s Phase II
        storage expansion project which will expand the working gas capacity in its
        western Kentucky storage complex by approximately 9.0 Bcf. This project is
        supported by binding commitments from customers to contract on a long-term
        basis
        for the full additional capacity at Texas Gas’s maximum applicable rate.
        Boardwalk Pipeline expects this project to cost approximately $40.7 million
        and
        to be in service by November of 2007. In December of 2006, Texas Gas commenced
        an open season related to a potential third expansion of its storage facilities.
        Texas Gas has signed one precedent agreement for 2.0 Bcf of capacity. The
        ultimate size of the Phase III storage expansion will be determined, in part,
        by
        the open season. The Phase III storage expansion is subject to the FERC
        approvals, including potential market-based rate authority for the new
        additional storage capacity being created. Phase I of this project which
        expanded working gas capacity by approximately 8.0 Bcf was completed and
        in
        service in November of 2005.

Boardwalk
        Pipeline is currently developing an additional storage cavern near
        Napoleonville, Louisiana. During mining operations, certain issues have arisen
        causing the mining of the cavern to be suspended. Boardwalk Pipeline is
        continuing to conduct operational integrity tests on the caverns. The tests
        are
        on-going but have been delayed due to lack of equipment availability needed
        to
        complete the testing. If the test results are favorable, Boardwalk Pipeline
        expects the storage facilities to be in service perhaps as early as 2008
        with
        working gas capacity of 2.0 Bcf, reduced from 6.0 Bcf as originally designed.
        If
        the test results are not favorable, Boardwalk Pipeline will consider the
        options
        it has available, including developing a new cavern or the sale or abandonment
        of the project.

Boardwalk
        Pipeline and Texas Gas are headquartered in approximately 108,000 square
        feet of
        office space in Owensboro, Kentucky in a building that is owned by Texas
        Gas.
        Gulf South has its headquarters in approximately 55,000 square feet of leased
        office space located in Houston, Texas. Due to recent expansion activities,
        and
        the expiration in May of 2007 of the lease for Gulf South’s current office
        space, Gulf South has signed a new ten-year lease for approximately 74,000
        square feet of office space in a new location in Houston, Texas. Gulf South
        will
        begin moving in the new headquarters in April of 2007. Boardwalk Pipeline’s
        operating subsidiaries own their respective pipeline systems in fee. A
        substantial portion of these systems is constructed and maintained on property
        owned by others pursuant to rights-of-way, easements, permits, licenses or
        consents.

DIAMOND
        OFFSHORE DRILLING, INC.

Diamond
        Offshore Drilling Inc. (“Diamond Offshore”), is engaged, through its
        subsidiaries, in the business of owning and operating drilling rigs that
        are
        used in the drilling of offshore oil and gas wells on a contract basis for
        companies engaged in exploration and production of hydrocarbons. Diamond
        Offshore owns 44 offshore rigs and also has two premium jack-up rigs currently
        under construction. Diamond Offshore accounted for 11.74%, 8.07% and 5.49%
        of
        our consolidated total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005
        and
        2004, respectively.

Diamond
        Offshore owns and operates 30 semisubmersible rigs. Semisubmersible rigs
        consist
        of an upper working and living deck resting on vertical columns connected
        to
        lower hull members. Such rigs operate in a “semi-submerged” position, remaining
        afloat, off bottom, in a position in which the lower hull is approximately
        feet to 90 feet below the water line and the upper deck protrudes well above
        the
        surface. Semisubmersible rigs are typically anchored in position and remain
        stable for drilling in the semi-submerged floating position due in part to
        their
        wave transparency characteristics at the water line. Semisubmersible rigs
        can
        also be held in position through the use of a computer controlled thruster
        (“dynamic-positioning”) system to maintain the rig’s position over a drillsite.
        Three semisubmersible rigs in Diamond Offshore’s fleet have this
        capability.

Diamond
        Offshore owns and operates nine high-specification semisubmersible rigs.
        These
        high specification semisubmersible rigs have high-capacity deck loads and
        are
        generally capable of working in water depths of 4,000 feet or greater or
        in
        harsh environments and have other advanced features, as compared to intermediate
        semisubmersible rigs. As of January 29, 2007, seven of the nine
        high-specification semisubmersible rigs were located in the U.S. Gulf of
        Mexico
        (“GOM”), while the remaining two high-specification semisubmersible rigs were
        located offshore Brazil and Malaysia.

Diamond
        Offshore owns and operates 21 intermediate semisubmersible rigs which generally
        work in maximum water depths up to 4,000 feet and many have diverse capabilities
        that enable them to provide both shallow and deep water service in the U.S.
        and
        in other markets outside the U.S. As of January 29, 2007, Diamond Offshore
        had
        19 intermediate semisubmersible rigs, drilling in various offshore locations
        around the world. Five of these intermediate semisubmersible rigs were located
        in the GOM; three were located offshore Mexico or in the Mexican GOM; four
        were
        located in the North Sea, two were located offshore Australia, two were located
        offshore Brazil and one was located offshore each of New Zealand, Vietnam
        and
        Egypt.

In
        2006,
        Diamond Offshore began a major upgrade of the

Ocean
        Monarch

,
        a
        Victory-class semisubmersible that it acquired in August 2005 for $20.0 million.
        The modernized rig is being designed to operate in up to 10,000 feet of water
        in
        a moored configuration for an estimated cost of approximately $300.0 million.
        Through December 31, 2006, Diamond Offshore had spent $33.9 million related
        to
        this project. The

Ocean
        Monarch

is
        expected to be ready for deepwater service in the fourth quarter of
        2008.

In
        addition, the shipyard portion of the upgrade of the

Ocean
        Endeavor

has been
        completed. The rig is currently undergoing sea trials and commissioning.
        The
        unit will remain in Singapore until the arrival of a heavy-lift vessel,
        anticipated late in the first quarter of 2007, which will return the rig
        to the
        GOM. The

Ocean
        Endeavor

is
        expected to commence drilling operations in the GOM in mid-2007. Diamond
        Offshore estimates that the total cost of the upgrade will be approximately
        $253.0 million of which $208.4 million had been spent through December 31,
        2006.

Diamond
        Offshore owns and operates 13 jack-up drilling rigs. Jack-up rigs are mobile,
        self-elevating drilling platforms equipped with legs that are lowered to
        the
        ocean floor until a foundation is established to support the drilling platform.
        The rig hull includes the drilling rig, jacking system, crew quarters, loading
        and unloading facilities, storage areas for bulk and liquid materials, heliport
        and other related equipment. Diamond Offshore’s jack-up rigs are used for
        drilling in water depths from 20 feet to 350 feet. The water depth limit
        of a
        particular rig is principally determined by the length of the rig’s legs. A
        jack-up rig is towed to the drillsite with its hull riding in the sea, as
        a
        vessel, with its legs retracted. Once over a drillsite, the legs are lowered
        until they rest on the seabed and jacking continues until the hull is elevated
        above the surface of the water. After completion of drilling operations,
        the
        hull is lowered until it rests in the water and then the legs are retracted
        for
        relocation to another drillsite.

As
        of
        January 29, 2007, nine of Diamond Offshore’s jack-up rigs were located in the
        GOM. Six of those rigs are independent-leg cantilevered units, two are
        mat-supported cantilevered units, and one is a mat-supported slot unit. Of
        Diamond Offshore’s four remaining jack-up rigs, three are internationally based
        and are independent-leg cantilevered rigs; one was located offshore Indonesia,
        one was located offshore Africa and the other rig was located offshore Qatar.
        Diamond Offshore’s remaining jack-up rig was located in the Mexican GOM and is
        also an independent-leg cantilever unit.

In
        the
        second quarter of 2005, Diamond Offshore entered into agreements to construct
        two high-performance, premium jack-up rigs. The two new drilling units, the

Ocean
        Scepter

and
        the

Ocean
        Shield,

are
        being
        constructed in

Brownsville,
        Texas and Singapore, respectively, at an aggregate expected cost of
        approximately $320.0 million,

including
        drill pipe and capitalized interest, of which $176.1 million had been spent
        through December 31, 2006. Each newbuild jack-up rig will be equipped with
        a
        70-foot cantilever package, capable of drilling depths of up to 35,000 feet
        and
        have a hook load capacity of two million pounds. Diamond Offshore expects
        delivery of both of these units during the first quarter of 2008.

Diamond
        Offshore has one drillship, the

Ocean
        Clipper,

which
        was located offshore Brazil as of January 29, 2007. Drillships, which are
        typically self-propelled, are positioned over a drillsite through the use
        of
        either an anchoring system or a dynamic-positioning system similar to those
        used
        on certain semisubmersible rigs. Deep water drillships compete in many of
        the
        same markets as do high-specification semisubmersible rigs.

Markets:

The
        principal markets for Diamond Offshore’s contract drilling services are the
        following:

Diamond
        Offshore actively markets its rigs worldwide. From time to time Diamond
        Offshore’s fleet operates in various other markets throughout the world as the
        market demands.

Diamond
        Offshore believes its presence in multiple markets is valuable in many respects.
        For example, Diamond Offshore believes that its experience with safety and
        other
        regulatory matters in the U.K. has been beneficial in Australia and in the
        Gulf
        of Mexico, while production experience gained through Brazilian and North
        Sea
        operations has potential application worldwide. Additionally, Diamond Offshore
        believes its performance for a customer in one market segment or area enables
        it
        to better understand that customer’s needs and better serve that customer in
        different market segments or other geographic locations.

Diamond
        Offshore’s contracts to provide offshore drilling services vary in their terms
        and provisions. Diamond Offshore typically obtains its contracts through
        competitive bidding, although it is not unusual for Diamond Offshore to be
        awarded drilling contracts without competitive bidding. Drilling contracts
        generally provide for a basic drilling rate on a fixed dayrate basis regardless
        of whether or not such drilling results in a productive well. Drilling contracts
        may also provide for lower rates during periods when the rig is being moved
        or
        when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns,
        adverse weather conditions or other conditions beyond the control of Diamond
        Offshore. Under dayrate contracts, Diamond Offshore generally pays the operating
        expenses of the rig, including wages and the cost of incidental supplies.
        Historically, dayrate contracts have accounted for a substantial portion
        of
        Diamond Offshore’s revenues. In addition, from time to time, Diamond Offshore’s
        dayrate contracts may also provide for the ability to earn an incentive bonus
        from its customers based upon performance.

A
        dayrate
        drilling contract generally extends over a period of time covering either
        the
        drilling of a single well or a group of wells, which Diamond Offshore refers
        to
        as a well-to-well contract, or a fixed term, which Diamond Offshore refers
        to as
        a term contract, and may be terminated by the customer in the event the drilling
        unit is destroyed or lost or if drilling operations are suspended for a period
        of time as a result of a breakdown of equipment or, in some cases, due to
        other
        events beyond the control of either party to the contract. In addition, certain
        of Diamond Offshore’s contracts permit the customer to terminate the contract
        early by giving notice, and in some circumstances may require the payment
        of an
        early termination fee by the customer. The contract term in many instances
        may
        also be extended by the customer exercising options for the drilling of
        additional wells or for an additional length of time, generally at competitive
        market rates and mutually agreeable terms at the time of the
        extension.

Customers:

Diamond Offshore provides offshore drilling services to a customer base
        that includes major and independent oil and gas companies and government-owned
        oil companies. Several customers have accounted for 10.0% or more of Diamond
        Offshore’s annual consolidated revenues, although the specific customers may
        vary from year to year. During 2006, Diamond Offshore performed services
        for 51
        different customers with Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (which acquired
        Kerr-McGee Oil & Gas Corporation, or Kerr-McGee, in mid-2006) and Petroleo
        Brasileiro S.A., (“Petrobas”) accounting for 10.6% and 10.4% of Diamond
        Offshore’s annual consolidation revenues, repectively. During 2005, Diamond
        Offshore performed services for 53 different customers with Petrobras and
        Kerr
        McGee, accounting for 10.7% and 10.3% of Diamond Offshore’s annual total
        consolidated revenues, respectively. During 2004, Diamond Offshore performed

Competition

:

The
        offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive and is influenced
        by a
        number of factors, including current and anticipated prices of oil and natural
        gas, expenditures by oil and gas companies for exploration and development
        of
        oil and natural gas and the availability of drilling rigs.

Governmental
        Regulation

:
        Diamond
        Offshore’s operations are subject to numerous international, U.S., state and
        local laws and regulations that relate directly or indirectly to Diamond
        Offshore’s operations, including regulations controlling the discharge of
        materials into the environment, requiring removal and clean-up under some
        circumstances, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment.

Operations
        Outside the United States

:
        Diamond
        Offshore’s operations outside the United States accounted for approximately
        43.0%, 45.0% and 56.0% of Diamond Offshore’s total consolidated revenues for the

Loews
                  Hotels Holding Corporation -
                  (Continued)

The
        hotels owned by Loews Hotels are subject to mortgage indebtedness totaling
        approximately $236.0 million at December 31, 2006 with interest rates ranging
        from 4.5% to 6.3%, and maturing between 2007 and 2028. In addition, certain
        hotels are held under leases which are subject to formula derived rental
        increases, with rentals aggregating approximately $6.4 million for the year
        ended December 31, 2006.

Competition
        from other hotels and lodging facilities is vigorous in all areas in which
        Loews
        Hotels operates. The demand for hotel rooms in many areas is seasonal and
        dependent on general and local economic conditions. Loews Hotels properties
        also
        compete with facilities offering similar services in locations other than
        those
        in which its hotels are located. Competition among luxury hotels is based
        primarily on location and service. Competition among resort and commercial
        hotels is based on price as well as location and service. Because of the
        competitive nature of the industry, hotels must continually make expenditures
        for updating, refurnishing and repairs and maintenance, in order to prevent
        competitive obsolescence.

BULOVA
        CORPORATION

Bulova
        Corporation (“Bulova”) is engaged in the distribution and sale of watches and
        clocks for consumer use. Bulova accounted for 1.17%, 1.16% and 1.16% of our
        consolidated total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and
        2004,
        respectively.

Bulova’s
        principal watch brands are Bulova, Caravelle, Wittnauer and Accutron. Clocks
        are
        principally sold under the Bulova brand name. All watches and substantially
        all
        clocks are purchased from foreign suppliers. Bulova’s principal markets are the
        United States, Canada and Mexico. Bulova’s product breakdown includes luxury
        watch lines represented by Wittnauer and Accutron, a mid-priced watch line
        represented by Bulova, and a lower-priced watch line represented by
        Caravelle.

        uses
        for quality control and sourcing purposes. Bulova leases a 31,000 square

Item
        1A.  RISK FACTORS.

Our
        business faces many risks. We have described below some of the more significant
        risks which we and our subsidiaries face. There may be additional risks that
        we
        do not yet know of or that we do not currently perceive to be significant
        that
        may also impact our business or the business of our subsidiaries.

Each
        of
        the risks and uncertainties described below could lead to events or
        circumstances that have a material adverse effect on our business, results
        of
        operations, cash flows, financial condition or equity and/or the business,
        results of operations, financial condition or equity of one or more of our
        subsidiaries. In addition, the risks and uncertainties described below relating
        to our Carolina Group stock and our Lorillard subsidiary could lead to a
        material loss in the value of the Carolina Group stock.

You
        should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information included in
        this
        Report and any subsequent reports we may file with the SEC or make available
        to
        the public before investing in any securities issued by us. Our subsidiaries,
        CNA Financial Corporation, Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and Boardwalk
        Pipeline Partners, LP, are public companies and file reports with the SEC.
        You
        are also cautioned to carefully review and consider the information contained
        in
        the reports filed by those subsidiaries before investing in any of their
        securities.

We
        are a holding company and derive substantially all of our cash flow from
        our
        subsidiaries.

We
        rely
        upon our invested cash balances and distributions from our subsidiaries to
        generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations and to declare and pay
        any
        dividends to holders of our common stock and Carolina Group stock. Our
        subsidiaries are separate and independent legal entities and have no obligation,
        contingent or otherwise, to make funds available to us, whether in the form
        of
        loans, dividends or otherwise. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends
        to us is also subject to, among other things, the availability of sufficient
        funds in such subsidiaries, applicable state laws, including in the case
        of the
        insurance subsidiaries of CNA, laws and rules governing the payment of dividends
        by regulated insurance companies. Claims of creditors of our subsidiaries
        will
        generally have priority as to the assets of such subsidiaries over our claims
        and our creditors and shareholders.

In
        prior years, we have restated our financial results and identified material
        weaknesses in our internal control over financial
        reporting.

In
        May of
        2005, we restated our financial results for prior years to correct CNA’s
        accounting for several reinsurance contracts, primarily with a former affiliate,
        and to correct CNA’s equity accounting for that affiliate. In February of 2006,
        we restated our financial results for prior years to correct the accounting
        for
        discontinued operations acquired by CNA in its merger with The Continental
        Corporation in 1995. In addition, in March of 2006, we restated our financial
        results for prior years to correct classification errors within our Consolidated
        Statements of Cash Flows.

As
        a
        result of the foregoing restatements, we identified material weaknesses in
        our
        internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 and 2005,
        respectively. We also determined that our internal control over financial
        reporting as of such dates was not effective. Our system of internal control
        over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
        to our management, Audit Committee and Board of Directors regarding the
        reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation
        of our published financial statements. Pursuant to Section 404 of the
        Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the implementing rules of the Securities
        and
        Exchange Commission,


Item
                  1A. Risk Factors

the
        periodic reports we file with the SEC include information on our system of
        disclosure controls and procedures, as well as our overall internal control
        over
        financial reporting.

While
        we
        have remediated the referenced material weaknesses, if we fail to maintain
        effective internal control over financial reporting, we could be scrutinized
        by
        regulators in a manner that extends beyond the SEC’s requests for information
        relating to the restatements (as further described in the CNA risk factor
        titled

CNA
        is responding to subpoenas, interrogatories and inquiries relating to insurance
        brokers and agents, contingent commissions and bidding practices, and certain
        finite-risk insurance products

below).
        We could also be scrutinized by securities analysts and investors. As a result
        of this scrutiny, we could suffer a loss of public confidence in our financial
        reporting capabilities and thereby face adverse effects on our business and
        the
        market price of our securities.

Risks
        Related to an Investment in Our Carolina Group Stock

We
        cannot be certain that we will continue to pay dividends on our Carolina
        Group
        stock.

Determinations
        as to the future dividends on Carolina Group stock primarily will depend
        on the
        dividends paid to us by our subsidiaries, our capital requirements and other
        factors that our board of directors considers relevant. The amount of dividends
        that legally could be paid on Carolina Group stock if the Carolina Group
        were a
        separate Delaware corporation may be greater than the amount actually available
        for the payment of dividends under Delaware law and our charter. Furthermore,
        our ability to pay dividends on Carolina Group stock may be reduced by dividends
        that we pay on our common stock.

Our
        board
        of directors reserves the right to declare and pay dividends on Carolina
        Group
        stock, and could, in its sole discretion, declare and pay dividends, or refrain
        from declaring and paying dividends, on Carolina Group stock. Our board of
        directors may take such actions regardless of the amounts available for the
        payment of dividends on Carolina Group stock, the amount of prior dividends
        declared on Carolina Group stock, the voting or liquidation rights of Carolina
        Group stock, or any other factor.

The
        independence of the board of directors of Lorillard, Inc. and the board of
        directors of its wholly owned subsidiary, Lorillard Tobacco Company, may
        affect
        Lorillard’s payment of dividends to us and thereby inhibit our ability or
        willingness to pay dividends and make other distributions on our Carolina
        Group
        stock.

Our
        ability and willingness to pay dividends and make other distributions on
        Carolina Group stock, including dividends and distributions following a
        disposition of substantially all of the assets attributed to the Carolina
        Group,
        will depend on a number of factors, including whether the independent board
        of
        directors of Lorillard Tobacco Company causes Lorillard Tobacco Company to
        declare and pay dividends to its parent, Lorillard, Inc. and whether, in
        turn,
        the independent board of directors of Lorillard, Inc. causes Lorillard, Inc.
        to
        declare and pay dividends to us. In the event that Lorillard Tobacco Company
        or
        Lorillard, Inc. does not distribute its earnings, we are unlikely to pay
        dividends on Carolina Group stock. To the extent Lorillard, Inc. does not
        distribute net proceeds following the sale of substantially all of the assets
        attributed to the Carolina Group, we will not be required to apply the net
        proceeds to pay dividends to holders of Carolina Group stock or redeem shares
        of
        Carolina Group stock.

We
        expect
        that the boards of directors of each of Lorillard, Inc. and Lorillard Tobacco
        Company will continue to function independently of us and will direct the
        operations and management of the assets and businesses of those corporations,
        respectively. None of the individuals currently serving as directors of
        Lorillard, Inc. or Lorillard Tobacco Company are officers, directors or
        employees of Loews Corporation. Notwithstanding our right, as sole shareholder,
        to elect and remove directors of Lorillard, Inc., we have no present intention
        to remove any person currently serving as a director of Lorillard, Inc.
        Moreover, we expect that in the event of any future vacancies on the board
        of
        directors of Lorillard, Inc., we will nominate individuals who are not officers,
        directors or employees of Loews Corporation to fill such vacancies.

We
        have allocated to the Carolina Group any liabilities or expenses that we
        incur
        as a result of tobacco-related litigation.

The
        Carolina Group has been allocated any and all liabilities, costs and expenses
        of
        us and Lorillard, Inc. and the subsidiaries and predecessors of Lorillard,
        Inc.,
        arising out of or related to tobacco or otherwise arising out of the
        past,


Item
                  1A. Risk Factors

present
        or future business of Lorillard, Inc. or its subsidiaries or predecessors,
        or
        claims arising out of or related to the sale of any businesses previously
        sold
        by Lorillard, Inc. or its subsidiaries or predecessors, in each case, whether
        grounded in tort, contract, statute or otherwise, whether pending or asserted
        in
        the future.

Accordingly,
        we and/or Lorillard may make decisions with respect to litigation and settlement
        strategies designed to obtain our dismissal or release from tobacco-related
        litigation or liabilities. Such decisions and strategies could result, for
        example, in limitations on payment of dividends by Lorillard to us or an
        increase in Lorillard’s exposure in such litigation.

The
        Engle Agreement may affect Lorillard’s payment of dividends to us and thereby
        inhibit our ability or willingness to pay dividends on our Carolina Group
        stock.

Under
        the

Engle

Agreement if Lorillard, Inc. does not maintain a balance sheet net worth
        of at
        least $921.2 million, the stay pursuant to the agreement would terminate.
        Because dividends from Lorillard, Inc. to us are deducted from the balance
        sheet
        net worth of Lorillard, Inc., the

Engle

Agreement may affect the payment of dividends by Lorillard, Inc. to us. For
        a
        description of the

Engle

Agreement, please read MD&A under Item 7 and Note 20 of the Notes to
        Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.

Holders
        of our common stock and Carolina Group stock are shareholders of one company
        and, therefore, financial impacts on one group could affect the other group.

Holders
        of our common stock and holders of Carolina Group stock are all common
        shareholders of Loews Corporation and are subject to risks associated with
        an
        investment in a single company. Financial effects arising from one group
        that
        affect our consolidated results of operations or financial condition could,
        if
        significant, affect the market price of the class of common shares relating
        to
        the other group. In addition, if we or any of our subsidiaries were to incur
        significant indebtedness on behalf of one group, including indebtedness incurred
        or assumed in connection with an acquisition or investment, it could affect
        the
        credit rating of us and our subsidiaries taken as a whole. This, in turn,
        could
        increase our borrowing costs. Net losses of either group and dividends or
        distributions on shares of any class of common or preferred stock will reduce
        the funds legally available for payment of future dividends on Carolina Group
        stock.

The
        complex nature of the terms of our Carolina Group stock, or confusion in
        the
        marketplace about what a tracking stock is, could materially adversely affect
        the market price of Carolina Group stock.

Tracking
        stocks like Carolina Group stock are more complex than traditional common
        stock
        and are not directly or entirely comparable to common stock of stand-alone
        companies or companies that have been spun off by their parent companies.
        The
        complex nature of the terms of Carolina Group stock, and the potential
        difficulties investors may have in understanding these terms, may materially
        adversely affect the market price of Carolina Group stock. Examples of these
        terms include:

·

the
                    discretion of our board of directors to make determinations that
                    may
                    affect Carolina Group stock and our common stock differently;

·

our
                    redemption and/or exchange rights under particular circumstances;
                    and

·

the
                    disparate voting rights of Carolina Group stock and our common
                    stock.

Confusion
        in the marketplace about what a tracking stock is and what it is intended
        to
        represent, and/or investors’ reluctance to invest in tracking stocks, could
        materially adversely affect the market price of Carolina Group stock.

Holders
        of our common stock and Carolina Group stock generally vote together as a
        single
        class.

Holders
        of Carolina Group stock generally do not have the right to vote separately
        as a
        class. Holders of Carolina Group stock have the right to vote as a separate
        class only to the extent required by Delaware law. We have not held, and
        do not
        plan to hold, separate meetings for holders of Carolina Group
        stock.


Item
                  1A. Risk Factors

Holders
        of our common stock will have significantly greater voting power than holders
        of
        our Carolina Group stock with respect to any matter as to which all of our
        common shares vote together as one class.

Each
        share of our common stock has one vote. Each share of Carolina Group stock
        is
        entitled to 3/10 of a vote, which is disproportionately less than the economic
        interest represented by each share of Carolina Group stock. When a vote is
        taken
        on any matter as to which all of our common shares are voting together as
        one
        class, holders of our common stock will have significantly greater voting
        power
        than holders of Carolina Group stock. As of February 9, 2007, holders of
        our
        common stock controlled approximately 94.4% of our combined voting power
        and
        holders of Carolina Group stock controlled approximately 5.6% of our combined
        voting power. The voting power of Carolina Group stock is subject to adjustment
        for stock splits, stock dividends and combinations with respect to either
        class
        of stock.

Holders
        of our Carolina Group stock may have interests different from holders of
        our
        common stock.

The
        existence of separate classes of our common stock could give rise to occasions
        when the interests of the holders of our common stock and Carolina Group
        stock
        diverge or conflict or appear to diverge or conflict. Subject to its fiduciary
        duties, our board of directors could, in its sole discretion, from time to
        time,
        make determinations or implement policies that disproportionately affect
        the
        groups or the different classes of stock. Our board of directors is not required
        to select the option that would result in the highest value for the holders
        of
        Carolina Group stock. Examples include determinations by our board of directors
        to:

·

pay
                    or omit the payment of dividends on our common stock or Carolina
                    Group
                    stock;

·

redeem
                    shares of Carolina Group stock;

·

approve
                    dispositions of our assets attributed to either
                    group;

·

reallocate
                    funds or assets between groups and determine the amount and type
                    of
                    consideration paid therefore;

·

allocate
                    business opportunities, resources and personnel;

·

allocate
                    the proceeds of issuances of Carolina Group stock either to the
                    Loews
                    Group, with a corresponding reduction in the intergroup interest,
                    if and
                    to the extent there is an intergroup interest, or to the combined
                    attributed net assets of the Carolina
                    Group;

·

formulate
                    public policy positions for us;

·

establish
                    relationships between the groups;

·

make
                    financial decisions with respect to one group that could be considered
                    to
                    be detrimental to the other group;
                    and

·

settle
                    or otherwise seek to resolve actual or potential litigation against
                    us in
                    ways that might adversely affect Lorillard.

Any
        such
        decisions by our board of directors could have or be perceived to have a
        negative effect on the Carolina Group and could have a negative effect on
        the
        market price of Carolina Group stock.

If
        our Carolina Group stock is not treated as a class of our common stock, several
        adverse federal income tax consequences will result.

It
        is
        possible that the issuance of Carolina Group stock could be characterized
        as
        property other than our stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such
        characterization could require us to recognize taxable gain with respect
        to the
        issuance of Carolina Group stock and the Carolina Group would be responsible
        for
        any tax liability attributable thereto. In addition, we would likely no longer
        be able to file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return with the Carolina
        Group. These tax liabilities, if they arise, would likely have a material
        adverse effect on us and the Carolina Group.


Item
                  1A. Risk Factors

Changes
        in the tax law or in the interpretation of current tax law may result in
        redemption of the Carolina Group stock or cessation of the issuance of shares
        of
        Carolina Group stock.

If
        there
        are adverse tax consequences to us or the Carolina Group resulting from the
        issuance of Carolina Group stock, it is possible that we would not issue
        shares
        of Carolina Group stock even if we would otherwise choose to do so. This
        possibility could affect the value of Carolina Group stock then outstanding.
        Furthermore, we are entitled to redeem Carolina Group stock for either
        (1) cash in an amount equal to 105% of the average market price per share
        of Carolina Group stock or (2) our common stock having a value equal to
        100% of the ratio of the average market price per share of Carolina Group
        stock
        to the average market price per share of our common stock, if, based upon
        the
        opinion of tax counsel, there are adverse federal income tax law developments
        related to Carolina Group stock. In each case, the average market price would
        be
        determined over a specified 20 trading day period.

Our
        board of directors may, at any time until the 90th day after the disposition
        of
        80% of the assets attributed to the Carolina Group, redeem shares of our
        Carolina Group stock.

Our
        board
        of directors may, at any time until the 90th day after the disposition of
        80% of
        the assets attributed to the Carolina Group, redeem all outstanding shares
        of
        Carolina Group stock for either (1) cash in an amount equal to 120% of the
        average market price per share of Carolina Group stock or (2) our common
        stock having a value equal to 115% of the ratio of the average market price
        per
        share of Carolina Group stock to the average market price per share of our
        common stock. In each case, the average market price would be determined
        over a
        specific 20 trading day period. A decision to redeem the Carolina Group stock
        could be made at a time when either or both of our common stock and Carolina
        Group stock may be considered to be overvalued or undervalued. In addition,
        a
        redemption would preclude holders of Carolina Group stock from retaining
        their
        investment in a security intended to reflect separately the economic performance
        of the Carolina Group. It would also give holders of shares of converted
        Carolina Group stock an amount of consideration that may be less than the
        amount
        of consideration a third-party buyer pays or would pay for all or substantially
        all of the net assets attributed to the Carolina Group.

If
        we choose to redeem our Carolina Group stock for cash, holders of Carolina
        Group
        stock may have taxable gain or taxable income.

We
        may,
        under certain circumstances, redeem Carolina Group stock for cash. If we
        choose
        to do so, holders of Carolina Group stock would generally be subject to tax
        on
        the excess, if any, of the total consideration they receive for their Carolina
        Group stock over their adjusted basis in their Carolina Group stock.

Our
        board of directors does not owe a separate duty to holders of Carolina Group
        stock.

Principles
        of Delaware law established in cases involving differing treatment of two
        classes of capital stock or two groups of holders of the same class of capital
        stock provide that a board of directors owes an equal duty to all shareholders
        regardless of class or series, and does not have separate or additional duties
        to either group of shareholders. Thus, holders of Carolina Group stock who
        believe that a determination by our board of directors has a disparate impact
        on
        their class of stock may not be able to obtain a remedy for such a claim.

Our
        board of directors may change the Carolina Group policy statement without
        shareholder approval.

In
        connection with the initial issuance of Carolina Group stock, our board of
        directors adopted the Carolina Group policy statement to govern the relationship
        between the Loews Group and the Carolina Group. Our board of directors may
        modify, suspend or rescind the policies set forth in the Carolina Group policy
        statement or make additions or exceptions to them, in the sole discretion
        of our
        board of directors, without approval of our shareholders. Our board of directors
        may also adopt additional policies, depending upon the circumstances. Any
        changes to our policies could have a negative effect on the holders of Carolina
        Group stock.

Our
        directors’ and officers’ disproportionate ownership of our common stock compared
        to our Carolina Group stock may give rise to conflicts of interest.

Our
        directors and officers own shares of our common stock and have been awarded
        stock options with respect to shares of our common stock. As of February
        9, 2007
        our directors and executive officers beneficially owned


Item
                  1A. Risk Factors

approximately
        38.2 million shares of our common stock and no shares of Carolina Group stock,
        which represents approximately 6.6% of our combined voting power. Accordingly,
        our directors and officers could have an economic incentive to favor the
        Loews
        Group over the Carolina Group.

Because
        it is possible for an acquiror to obtain control of us by purchasing shares
        of
        our common stock without purchasing any shares of our Carolina Group stock,
        holders of Carolina Group stock may not share in any takeover premium.

Because
        holders of our common stock have significantly greater voting power than
        holders
        of Carolina Group stock, a potential acquiror could acquire control of us
        by
        acquiring shares of our common stock without purchasing any shares of Carolina
        Group stock. As a result, holders of Carolina Group stock might not share
        in any
        takeover premium and Carolina Group stock may have a lower market price than
        it
        would have if there were a greater likelihood that holders of Carolina Group
        stock would share in any takeover premium.

Holders
        of our Carolina Group stock may receive less consideration upon a sale of
        the
        assets attributed to the Carolina Group than if the Carolina Group were a
        separate company.

Assuming
        the assets attributed to the Carolina Group represent less than substantially
        all of our assets as a whole, our board of directors could, in its sole
        discretion and without shareholder approval, approve sales and other
        dispositions of any amount of our assets attributed to the Carolina Group
        because the Delaware General Corporation Law requires shareholder approval
        only
        for a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets
        of the
        entire company. Similarly, the boards of directors of Lorillard, Inc. or
        its
        subsidiaries could decide to sell or otherwise dispose of the operating and
        other assets reflected in the financial statements of the Carolina Group
        without
        the approval of holders of Carolina Group stock.

If
        80% or
        more of the assets attributed to the Carolina Group are sold, we may take
        one of
        the following actions, and if we receive any net proceeds from the sale and
        determine not to retain all of such proceeds as tobacco contingency reserves,
        we
        must take one of the following actions:

·

pay
                  a special dividend to holders of Carolina Group stock in an amount
                  equal
                  to their pro rata share of the net proceeds (subject to reduction
                  for
                  repayment of notional debt, amounts not distributed from Lorillard
                  to us
                  and the creation by us of reserves for tobacco-related contingent
                  liabilities and future costs) from the disposition in the form
                  of cash
                  and/or securities (other than our common
                  stock);

·

redeem
                  shares of Carolina Group stock for cash and/or securities (other
                  than our
                  common stock) in an amount equal to the pro rata share of the net
                  proceeds
                  (subject to reduction for repayment of notional debt) from the
                  disposition
                  of all of the assets attributable to the Carolina
                  Group;

·

redeem
                  shares of Carolina Group stock for shares of our common stock at
                  a 15%
                  premium based on the respective market values of Carolina Group
                  stock and
                  our common stock during the 20 consecutive trading days ending
                  on the 5th
                  trading day prior to announcement of the sale; or

·

take
                  some combination of the actions described
                  above.

Our
          board
          of directors has the discretion to choose from the foregoing options. The
          value
          of the consideration paid to holders of Carolina Group stock in the different
          scenarios described above could be significantly different. Our board of
          directors would not be required to select the option that would result
          in the
          distribution with the highest value to the holders of Carolina Group
          stock.

If,
        on
        the 91st day following the sale of 80% or more of the assets attributed to
        the
        Carolina Group, we have not redeemed all of the outstanding shares of Carolina
        Group stock and Lorillard subsequently distributes to us any previously
        undistributed portion of the net proceeds and/or we subsequently release
        any
        amount of net proceeds previously retained by us as a reserve for
        tobacco-related contingent liabilities or future costs, we will distribute
        the
        pro rata share of such amounts to holders of Carolina Group stock. At any
        time
        after:

·

Lorillard
                  has distributed to us all previously undistributed portions of
                  the net
                  proceeds;


Item
                  1A. Risk Factors

·

no
                    amounts remain in reserve in respect of tobacco-related contingent
                    liabilities and future costs; and

·

the
                    only asset remaining in the Carolina Group is cash and/or cash
                    equivalents,

then
          we
          may redeem all of the outstanding shares of Carolina Group stock for cash
          in an
          amount equal to the greater of (1) the pro rata share of the remaining
          assets of
          the Carolina Group and (2) $0.001 per share of Carolina Group
          stock.

If
          the
          Carolina Group were a separate, independent company and its shares were
          acquired
          by another person, some of the costs of that sale, including corporate
          level
          taxes, might not be payable in connection with that acquisition. As a result,
          shareholders of a separate, independent company might receive an amount
          greater
          than the net proceeds that would be received by the holders of Carolina
          Group
          stock. In addition, we cannot assure that the net proceeds per share of
          Carolina
          Group stock received by its holder in connection with any redemption following
          a
          sale of Carolina Group assets will be equal to or greater than the market
          value
          per share of Carolina Group stock prior to or after announcement of a sale
          of
          assets reflected in the Carolina Group. Nor can we assure that, where
          consideration is based on the market value of Carolina Group stock, the
          market
          value will be equal to or greater than the net proceeds per share of Carolina
          Group stock.

We
          may cause a mandatory exchange of our Carolina Group stock.

We
          may
          exchange all outstanding shares of Carolina Group stock for shares of one
          or
          more of our qualifying subsidiaries. Such an exchange would result in the
          qualifying subsidiary or subsidiaries becoming a separate public company
          and the
          holders of Carolina Group stock owning shares directly in that subsidiary
          or
          those subsidiaries. If we choose to exchange shares of Carolina Group stock
          in
          this manner, the market value of the common stock received in that exchange
          could be less than the market value of Carolina Group stock exchanged.

If
          we are liquidated, amounts distributed to holders of our Carolina Group
          stock
          may not reflect the value of the assets attributed to the Carolina Group.

In
          the
          event we are liquidated, we would determine the liquidation rights of the
          holders of Carolina Group stock in accordance with the market capitalization
          of
          the outstanding shares of the Loews Group and the Carolina Group at a specified
          time prior to the time of liquidation. However, the relative market
          capitalization of the outstanding shares of each group may not correctly
          reflect
          the value of the net assets remaining and attributed to the groups after
          satisfaction of outstanding liabilities. Accordingly, the holders of Carolina
          Group stock could receive less consideration upon liquidation than they
          would if
          the groups were separate entities.

Risks
          Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, CNA Financial
          Corporation

If
          CNA determines that loss reserves are insufficient to cover its estimated
          ultimate unpaid liability for claims, CNA may need to increase its loss
          reserves.

CNA
          maintains loss reserves to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability
          for
          claims and claim adjustment expenses for reported and unreported claims
          and for
          future policy benefits. Reserves represent CNA management’s best estimate at a
          given point in time. Insurance reserves are not an exact calculation of
          liability but instead are complex estimates derived by CNA, generally utilizing
          a variety of reserve estimation techniques, from numerous assumptions and
          expectations about future events, many of which are highly uncertain, such
          as
          estimates of claims severity, frequency of claims, mortality, morbidity,
          expected interest rates, inflation, claims handling and case reserving
          policies
          and procedures, underwriting and pricing policies, changes in the legal
          and
          regulatory environment and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured
          event and the time of its ultimate settlement. Many of these uncertainties
          are
          not precisely quantifiable and require significant management judgment.
          As
          trends in underlying claims develop, particularly in so-called “long tail” or
          long duration coverages, CNA is sometimes required to add to our reserves.
          This
          is called unfavorable development and results in a charge to our earnings
          in the
          amount of the added reserves, recorded in the period the change in estimate
          is
          made. These charges can be substantial and can have a material adverse
          effect on
          our results of operations and equity. Please read additional information
          on
          CNA’s reserves included in MD&A under Item 7 and Note 9 of the Notes to
          Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.


Item
                  1A. Risk Factors

CNA
          is
          subject to uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage
          issues
          that arise as industry practices and legal, judicial, social, and other
          environmental conditions change. These issues have had, and may continue
          to
          have, a negative effect on CNA’s business by either extending coverage beyond
          the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of
          claims,
          resulting in further increases in CNA’s reserves which can have a material
          adverse effect on our results of operations and equity. The effects of
          these and
          other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard
          to
          predict. Examples of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues
          include:

·

increases
                    in the number and size of claims relating to injuries from medical
                    products;

·

the
                    effects of accounting and financial reporting scandals and other
                    major
                    corporate governance failures, which have resulted in an increase
                    in the
                    number and size of claims, including director and officer and
                    errors and
                    omissions insurance claims;

·

class
                    action litigation relating to claims handling and other
                    practices;

·

construction
                    defect claims, including claims for a broad range of additional
                    insured
                    endorsements on policies;

·

clergy
                    abuse claims, including passage of legislation to reopen or extend
                    various
                    statutes of limitations; and

·

mass
                    tort claims, including bodily injury claims related to silica,
                    welding
                    rods, benzene, lead and various other chemical exposure
                    claims.

In
          light
          of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and
          making
          the assumptions necessary to establish reserve levels, CNA reviews and
          changes
          its reserve estimates in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops
          and further claims are reported and settled. In addition, CNA periodically
          undergoes state regulatory financial examinations, including review and
          analysis
          of its reserves. If estimated reserves are insufficient for any reason,
          the
          required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against CNA’s
          earnings for the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient.
          These charges can be substantial and can materially adversely affect our
          results
          of operations and equity.

Loss
          reserves for asbestos, environmental pollution and mass torts are especially
          difficult to estimate and may result in more frequent and larger additions
          to
          these reserves.

CNA’s
          experience has been that establishing reserves for casualty coverages relating
          to APMT claim and claim adjustment expenses is subject to uncertainties
          that are
          greater than those presented by other claims. Estimating the ultimate cost
          of
          both reported and unreported asbestos, environmental pollution and mass
          tort
          claims is subject to a higher degree of variability due to a number of
          additional factors, including among others:

·

coverage
                    issues, including whether certain costs are covered under the
                    policies and
                    whether policy limits apply;

·

inconsistent
                    court decisions and developing legal
                    theories;

·

increasingly
                    aggressive tactics of plaintiffs’
lawyers;

·

the
                    risks and lack of predictability inherent in major
                    litigation;

·

changes
                    in the volume of asbestos, environmental pollution and mass tort
                    claims
                    which cannot now be anticipated;

·

continued
                    increases in mass tort claims relating to silica and silica-containing
                    products;

·

the
                    impact of the exhaustion of primary limits and the resulting
                    increase in
                    claims on any umbrella or excess policies CNA has
                    issued;

·

the
                    number and outcome of direct actions against
                    CNA;


Item
                  1A. Risk Factors

·

CNA’s
                    ability to recover reinsurance for these claims;
                    and

·

changes
                    in the legal and legislative environment in which CNA
                    operates.

As
          a
          result of this higher degree of variability, CNA has necessarily supplemented
          traditional actuarial methods and techniques with additional estimating
          techniques and methodologies, many of which involve significant judgment
          on the
          part of management. Consequently, CNA may periodically need to record changes
          in
          its claim and claim adjustment expense reserves in the future in these
          areas in
          amounts that may be material. The sections below provide more details involving
          the specific factors affecting CNA’s estimation of reserves for casualty
          coverages relating to environmental pollution and asbestos. Please read
          information on APMT included in MD&A under Item 7 and Note 9 of the Notes to
          Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

Environmental
          pollution claims.

The
          estimation of reserves for environmental pollution claims is complicated
          by the
          assertion by many policyholders of claims for defense costs and indemnification.
          CNA and others in the insurance industry are disputing coverage for many
          such
          claims. Key coverage issues in these claims include:

·

whether
                    cleanup costs are considered damages under the policies (and
                    accordingly
                    whether CNA would be liable for these
                    costs);

·

the
                    trigger of coverage, and the allocation of liability among triggered
                    policies;

·

the
                    applicability of pollution exclusions and owned property
                    exclusions;

·

the
                    potential for joint and several liability;
                    and

·

the
                    definition of an occurrence.

To
          date,
          courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues, thus adding
          to
          the uncertainty of the outcome of many of these claims.

Further,
          the scope of federal and state statutes and regulations determining liability
          and insurance coverage for environmental pollution liabilities have been
          the
          subject of extensive litigation. In many cases, courts have expanded the
          scope
          of coverage and liability for cleanup costs beyond the original intent
          of CNA’s
          insurance policies. In addition, the standards for cleanup in environmental
          pollution matters are unclear, the number of sites potentially subject
          to
          cleanup under applicable laws is unknown and the impact of various proposals to
          reform existing statutes and regulations is difficult to predict.

Asbestos
          claims.

The
          estimation of reserves for asbestos claims is particularly difficult for
          many of
          the same reasons discussed above for environmental pollution claims, as
          well
          as:

·

inconsistency
                      of court decisions and jury attitudes, as well as future court
                      decisions;

·

specific
                      policy provisions;

·

allocation
                      of liability among insurers and
                      insureds;

·

missing
                      policies and proof of coverage;

·

the
                      proliferation of bankruptcy proceedings and attendant
                      uncertainties;

·

novel
                      theories asserted by policyholders and their legal
                      counsel;

·

the
                      targeting of a broader range of businesses and entities as
                      defendants;


Item
                  1A. Risk Factors

·

uncertainties
                    in predicting the number of future claims and which other insureds
                    may be
                    targeted in the future;

·

volatility
                    in claim numbers and settlement
                    demands;

·

increases
                    in the number of non-impaired claimants and the extent to which
                    they can
                    be precluded from making claims;

·

the
                    efforts by insureds to obtain coverage that is not subject to
                    aggregate
                    limits;

·

the
                    long latency period between asbestos exposure and disease manifestation,
                    as well as the resulting potential for involvement of multiple
                    policy
                    periods for individual claims;

·

medical
                    inflation trends;

·

the
                    mix of asbestos-related diseases presented;
                    and

·

the
                    ability to recover
                    reinsurance.

In
        addition, a number of CNA’s insureds have asserted that their claims against CNA
        for insurance are not subject to aggregate limits on coverage. If these insureds
        are successful in this regard, CNA’s potential liability for their claims would
        be unlimited. Some of these insureds contend that their asbestos claims fall
        within the so-called “non-products” liability coverage within their policies,
        rather than the products liability coverage, and that this “non-products”
liability coverage is not subject to any aggregate limit. It is difficult
        to
        predict the extent to which these claims will succeed and, as a result, the
        ultimate size of these claims.

Catastrophe
        losses are unpredictable.

Catastrophe
        losses are an inevitable part of CNA’s business. Various events can cause
        catastrophe losses, including hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail,
        explosions, severe winter weather and fires, and their frequency and severity
        are inherently unpredictable. In addition, longer-term natural catastrophe
        trends may be changing and new types of catastrophe losses may be
        developing

due
        to
        climate change, a phenomenon that has been associated with extreme weather
        events linked to rising temperatures, and includes effects on global weather
        patterns, greenhouse gases, sea, land and air temperatures, sea levels, rain,
        and snow. For example, in 2005, CNA experienced substantial losses from
        Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma and in 2004, CNA experienced substantial
        losses from Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne. The extent of CNA’s
        losses from catastrophes is a function of both the total amount of its insured
        exposures in the affected areas and the severity of the events themselves.
        In
        addition, as in the case of catastrophe losses generally, it can take a long
        time for the ultimate cost to CNA to be finally determined. As its claim
        experience develops on a particular catastrophe, CNA may be required to adjust
        reserves, or take additional unfavorable development, to reflect its revised
        estimates of the total cost of claims. CNA believes that it could incur
        significant catastrophe losses in the future. Please read information on
        catastrophe losses included in the MD&A under Item 7 and Note 9 of the Notes
        to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

CNA’s
        key assumptions used to determine reserves and deferred acquisition costs
        for
        its long term care product offerings could vary
        significantly.

CNA’s
        reserves and deferred acquisition costs for its long term care product offerings
        are based on certain key assumptions including morbidity, which is the frequency
        and severity of illness, sickness and diseases contracted, policy persistency,
        which is the percentage of policies remaining in force, interest rates, and/or
        future health care cost trends. If actual experience differs from these
        assumptions, the deferred acquisition costs may not be fully recovered and
        the
        reserves may not be adequate, requiring CNA to add to reserves, or take
        unfavorable development.


Item
                  1A. Risk Factors

High
        levels of retained overhead expenses associated with business lines in run-off
        negatively impact CNA’s operating results.

During
        the past few years, CNA ceased offering certain insurance products relating
        principally to its life, group and reinsurance segments. Many of these business
        lines were sold, others have been placed in run-off and, as a result, revenue
        will progressively decrease. CNA’s results of operations have been materially,
        adversely affected by the high levels of retained overhead expenses associated
        with these run-off operations, and will continue to be so affected if CNA
        is not
        successful in eliminating or reducing these costs.

CNA’s
        premium writings and profitability are affected by the availability and cost
        of
        reinsurance.

CNA
        purchases reinsurance to help manage its exposure to risk. Under CNA’s
        reinsurance arrangements, another insurer assumes a specified portion of
        CNA’s
        claim and claim adjustment expenses in exchange for a specified portion of
        policy premiums. Market conditions determine the availability and cost of
        the
        reinsurance protection CNA purchases, which affects the level of CNA’s business
        and profitability, as well as the level and types of risk CNA retains. If
        CNA is
        unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance at a cost CNA deems acceptable, CNA
        may
        be unwilling to bear the increased risk and would reduce the level of CNA’s
        underwriting commitments. Please read information on Reinsurance included
        in
        MD&A under Item 7 and Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
        Statements included under Item 8.

CNA
        may not be able to collect amounts owed to it by
        reinsurers.

CNA
        has
        significant amounts recoverable from reinsurers which are reported as
        receivables in the balance sheets and estimated in a manner consistent with
        claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves.
        The ceding of insurance does not, however, discharge CNA’s primary liability for
        claims. As a result, CNA is subject to credit risk relating to its ability
        to
        recover amounts due from reinsurers. Certain of CNA’s reinsurance carriers have
        experienced deteriorating financial conditions or have been downgraded by
        rating
        agencies. In addition, reinsurers could dispute amounts which CNA believes
        are
        due to it. If CNA is not able to collect the amounts due to it from reinsurers,
        its claims expenses will be higher. Please read information on reinsurance
        included in the MD&A under Item 7 and Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated
        Financial Statements included under Item 8.

Rating
        agencies may downgrade their ratings for CNA in the future, and thereby
        adversely affect CNA’s ability to write insurance at competitive rates or at
        all.

Ratings
        are an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position
        of
        insurance companies. CNA’s insurance company subsidiaries, as well as its public
        debt, are rated by four major rating agencies, namely, A.M. Best Company,
        Inc.,
        Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and
        Fitch, Inc. Ratings reflect the rating agency’s opinions of an insurance
        company’s financial strength, capital adequacy, operating performance, strategic
        position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and debtholders.
        Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security,
        and
        may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization. Each
        agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s
        rating.

Due
        to
        the intense competitive environment in which CNA operates, the uncertainty
        in
        determining reserves and the potential for CNA to take material unfavorable
        development in the future, and possible changes in the methodology or criteria
        applied by the rating agencies, the rating agencies may take action to further
        lower CNA’s ratings in the future. If CNA’s property and casualty insurance
        financial strength ratings were downgraded below current levels, its business
        and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The severity
        of the impact on our business is dependent on the level of downgrade and,
        for
        certain products, which rating agency takes the rating action. Among the
        adverse
        effects in the event of such downgrades would be the inability to obtain
        a
        material volume of business from certain major insurance brokers, the inability
        to sell a material volume of our insurance products to certain markets, and
        the
        required collateralization of certain future payment obligations or
        reserves.

In
        addition, CNA believes that a lowering of our debt ratings by certain of
        the
        rating agencies could result in an adverse impact on CNA’s ratings, independent
        of any change in CNA’s circumstances. CNA has entered into several settlement
        agreements and assumed reinsurance contracts that require collateralization
        of
        future payment obligations and assumed reserves if its ratings or other specific
        criteria fall below certain thresholds. The ratings triggers are
        generally

CNA
        is subject to capital adequacy requirements and, if it does not meet these
        requirements, regulatory agencies may restrict or prohibit CNA from operating
        its business.

Insurance
        companies such as CNA are subject to risk-based capital standards set by
        state
        regulators to help identify companies that merit further regulatory attention.
        These standards apply specified risk factors to various asset, premium and
        reserve components of CNA’s statutory capital and surplus reported in CNA’s
        statutory basis of accounting financial statements. Current rules require
        companies to maintain statutory capital and surplus at a specified minimum
        level
        determined using the risk-based capital formula. If CNA does not meet these
        minimum requirements, state regulators may restrict or prohibit CNA from
        operating its business. If CNA is required to record a charge against earnings
        in connection with a change in estimates or circumstances, CNA may violate
        these
        minimum capital adequacy requirements unless it is able to raise sufficient
        additional capital. Examples of events leading CNA to record a charge against
        earnings include impairment of its investments or unexpectedly poor claims
        experience.

CNA’s
        insurance subsidiaries, upon whom CNA depends for dividends in order to fund
        its
        working capital needs, are limited by state regulators in their ability to
        pay
        dividends.

CNA
        Financial Corporation is a holding company and is dependent upon dividends,
        loans and other sources of cash from its subsidiaries in order to meet its
        obligations. Dividend payments, however, must be approved by the subsidiaries’
domiciliary state departments of insurance and are generally limited to amounts
        determined by formula, which varies by state. The formula for the majority
        of
        the states is the greater of 10% of the prior year statutory surplus or the
        prior year statutory net income, less the aggregate of all dividends paid
        during
        the twelve months prior to the date of payment. Some states, however, have
        an
        additional stipulation that dividends cannot exceed the prior year’s earned
        surplus. If CNA is restricted, by regulatory rule or otherwise, from paying
        or
        receiving inter-company dividends, CNA may not be able to fund its working
        capital needs and debt service requirements from available cash. As a result,
        CNA would need to look to other sources of capital, which may be more expensive
        or may not be available at all.

CNA
        is responding to subpoenas, interrogatories and inquiries relating to insurance
        brokers and agents, contingent commissions and bidding practices, and certain
        finite-risk insurance products.

Along
        with other companies in the industry, CNA has received subpoenas,
        interrogatories and inquiries from: (i) California, Connecticut, Delaware,
        Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North
        Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, West Virginia and the Canadian
        Council of Insurance Regulators concerning investigations into practices
        including contingent compensation arrangements, fictitious quotes, and tying
        arrangements; (ii) the SEC, the New York State Attorney General, the United
        States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, the Connecticut Attorney
        General, the Connecticut Department of Insurance, the Delaware Department
        of
        Insurance, the Georgia Office of Insurance and Safety Fire Commissioner and
        the
        California Department of Insurance concerning reinsurance products and finite
        insurance products purchased and sold by CNA; (iii) the Massachusetts Attorney
        General and the Connecticut Attorney General concerning investigations into
        anti-competitive practices; and (iv) the New York State Attorney General
        concerning declinations of attorney malpractice insurance. CNA continues
        to
        respond to these subpoenas, interrogatories and inquiries to the extent they
        are
        still open.

Subsequent
        to receipt of the SEC subpoena, CNA produced documents and provided additional
        information at the SEC’s request. In addition, the SEC and representatives of
        the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York
        conducted interviews with several of CNA’s current and former executives
        relating to the restatement of its financial results for 2004, including
        CNA’s
        relationship with and accounting for transactions with an affiliate that
        were
        the basis for the restatement. The SEC also requested information relating
        to
        our restatement in 2006 of prior period results.

It is
        possible that CNA’s analyses of, or accounting treatment for, finite reinsurance
        contracts or discontinued operations could be questioned or disputed by
        regulatory authorities. As a result, further restatements of CNA’s financial
        results are possible.


Item
                  1A. Risk Factors

CNA’s
        investment portfolio, which is a key component of its overall profitability,
        may
        suffer reduced returns or losses,

especially
        with respect to its equity in various limited partnership net assets which
        are
        often subject to greater leverage and volatility

.

Investment
        returns are an important part of CNA’s overall profitability. General economic
        conditions, stock market conditions, fluctuations in interest rates, and
        many
        other factors beyond CNA’s control can adversely affect the returns and the
        overall value of its equity investments and its ability to control the timing
        of
        the realization of investment income. In addition, any defaults in the payments
        due to CNA for its investments, especially with respect to liquid corporate
        and
        municipal bonds, could reduce CNA’s investment income and realized investment
        gains or could cause CNA to incur investment losses. Further, CNA invests
        a
        portion of its assets in equity investments, primarily through limited
        partnerships, which are subject to greater volatility than its fixed income
        investments. In some cases, these limited partnerships use leverage and are
        thereby subject to even greater volatility. Although limited partnership
        investments generally provide higher expected return, they present greater
        risk
        and are more illiquid than CNA’s fixed income investments. As a result of these
        factors, CNA may not realize an adequate return on its investments, may incur
        losses on sales of its investments and may be required to write down the
        value
        of its investments.

CNA
        may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty
        business.

The
        property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods
        characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive
        underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods
        of
        relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards
        and relatively high premium rates.

Risks
        Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, Lorillard, Inc.

Lorillard
        is a defendant in approximately 2,840 tobacco-related lawsuits, which are
        extremely costly to defend, and which could result in substantial judgments
        against Lorillard.

Numerous
        legal actions, proceedings and claims arising out of the sale, distribution,
        manufacture, development, advertising, marketing and claimed health effects
        of
        cigarettes are pending against Lorillard, and it is likely that similar claims
        will continue to be filed for the foreseeable future. Settlements and victories
        by plaintiffs in highly publicized cases against Lorillard and other tobacco
        companies, together with acknowledgments by Lorillard and other tobacco
        companies regarding the health effects of smoking, may stimulate further
        claims.
        In addition, adverse outcomes in pending cases could have adverse effects
        on the
        ability of Lorillard to prevail in smoking and health litigation.

Approximately
        2,840 tobacco-related cases are pending against Lorillard in the United States.
        Punitive damages, often in amounts ranging into the billions of dollars,
        are
        specifically pleaded in a number of cases in addition to compensatory and
        other
        damages. It is possible that the outcome of these cases, individually or
        in the
        aggregate, could result in bankruptcy. It is also possible that Lorillard
        may be
        unable to post a surety bond in an amount sufficient to stay execution of
        a
        judgment in jurisdictions that require such bond pending an appeal on the
        merits
        of the case. Even if Lorillard is successful in defending some or all of
        these
        actions, these types of cases are very expensive to defend. A material increase
        in the number of pending claims could significantly increase defense
        costs.

Further,
        adverse decisions in actions against tobacco companies other than Lorillard
        could have an adverse impact on the industry, including Lorillard. For example,
        in 2006 the Oregon Supreme Court affirmed the verdict in

Williams
        v. Philip Morris USA, Inc

.,
        in
        which plaintiff was awarded approximately $525,000 in compensatory damages
        and
        $79.5 million in punitive damages, a ratio of more than 150:1. The Oregon
        Supreme Court had determined that the ratio of punitive to compensatory damages
        was not inconsistent with U.S. Supreme Court precedents in this area. In
        February of 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court vacated that decision on other grounds
        and returned

Williams

to the
        Oregon Supreme Court for further consideration. Lorillard is not a party
        to

Williams

.
        Please
        read information included in MD&A under Item 7 and Note 20 of the Notes to
        Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.

A
        substantial judgment has been rendered against Lorillard in the Scott
        litigation.

In
        June
        of 2004, the court entered a final judgment in favor of the plaintiffs in

Scott v. The American Tobacco Company, et al.

(District Court, Orleans
        Parish, Louisiana, filed May 24, 1996), a class action on behalf of certain
        cigarette smokers resident in the State of Louisiana. The jury awarded
        plaintiffs approximately $591.0 million to fund


Item
                  1A. Risk Factors

cessation
        programs for Louisiana smokers. The court’s final judgment also reflected its
        award of prejudgment interest. During February of 2007, the Louisiana Court
        of
        Appeal issued a ruling that, among other things, reduced the amount of the
        award
        by approximately $312.0 million; struck the award of prejudgment interest,
        which
        totaled approximately $440.0 million as of December 31, 2006; and ruled that
        the
        only class members who are eligible to participate in the smoking cessation
        program are those who began smoking by September 1, 1988, and whose claims
        accrued by September 1, 1988. The Louisiana Court of Appeal has returned
        the
        case to the trial court for further proceedings. Lorillard’s share of any
        judgment has not been determined. It is possible that the parties will seek
        further review of this decision. For additional information on the

Scott

case, please read Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
        Statements included in Item 8 of this report.

The
        verdict returned in the federal government

’s
        reimbursement case, while not final, could impose significant financial burdens
        on Lorillard and adversely affect future sales and
        profits.

During
        August of 2006, a final judgment and remedial order was entered in

United
        States of America v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., et al.

(U.S.
        District Court, District of Columbia, filed September 22, 1999). Lorillard
        is
        one of the defendants in the case. Although the verdict did not award monetary
        damages to the plaintiff, the final judgment and remedial order granted
        equitable relief and imposes a number of requirements on the defendants.
        Such
        requirements include, but are not limited to, corrective statements by
        defendants related to the health effects of smoking. The remedial order also
        would place certain prohibitions on the manner in which defendants market
        their
        cigarette products and would eliminate any use of “lights” or similar product
        descriptors. It is likely that the remedial order, including the prohibitions
        on
        the use of the descriptors relating to low tar cigarettes, will negatively
        affect Lorillard’s future sales and profits. Defendants, including Lorillard,
        have noticed appeals from the final judgment and the remedial order. Plaintiff
        also has noticed an appeal from the final judgment. Defendants have received
        a
        stay of the judgment and remedial order from the District of Columbia Court
        of
        Appeal that will remain in effect while the appeal is proceeding. As a result
        of
        the government’s appeal, it is possible that certain of the government’s claims
        or damages could be reinstated. While trial was underway, the District of
        Columbia Court of Appeals ruled that plaintiff may not seek disgorgement
        of
        profits, but this appeal was interlocutory in nature and could be reconsidered
        in the present appeal. Prior to trial, the government had estimated that
        it was
        entitled to approximately $280.0 billion from the defendants for its
        disgorgement of profits claim. In addition, the government sought during
        trial
        more than $10.0 billion for the creation of nationwide smoking cessation,
        public
        education and counter-marketing programs. In its 2006 verdict, the trial
        court
        declined to award such relief. It is possible that these claims could be
        reinstated on appeal. Please read Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
        Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for detailed information regarding
        tobacco litigation.

Lorillard
        is a defendant in a case that has been certified as a nationwide class action
        and that could result in a substantial verdict.

Schwab
        v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., et al.

(U.S.
        District Court, Eastern District, New York, filed May 11, 2004), has been
        certified by a federal judge as a nationwide class action on behalf of
        individuals who purchased “lights” cigarettes. Plaintiffs’ claims in

Schwab

are
        based on defendants’ alleged RICO violations in the manufacture, marketing and
        sale of “lights” cigarettes. Plaintiffs have estimated damages to the class to
        be in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Any damages awarded to the plaintiffs
        based on defendants’ violation of the RICO statute would be trebled. The federal
        court of appeals has agreed to review the class certification order, and
        it has
        stayed all activity before the trial court until the appeal is concluded.
        Please
        read Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
        Item
        8 of this Report for detailed information regarding tobacco
        litigation.

The
        Florida Supreme Court’s approval of an order vacating a $16.3 billion judgment
        against Lorillard in the Engle litigation is not
        final.

Engle
        v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., et al.

(Circuit Court, Dade County, Florida,
        filed May 5, 1994) was certified as a class action on behalf of Florida
        residents, and survivors of Florida residents, who were injured or died from
        medical conditions allegedly caused by addiction to cigarettes. During 2000,
        a
        jury awarded the certified class approximately $16.3 billion in punitive
        damages
        against Lorillard. This award was part of a verdict against other major tobacco
        companies that totaled $145.0 billion in punitive damages. The verdict bears
        interest at the rate of 10.0% per year. During 2006, the Florida Supreme
        Court
        affirmed the 2003 holding of an intermediate appellate court that the $145.0
        billion punitive damages award must be vacated. The Florida Supreme Court
        also
        determined that the case could not


Item
                  1A. Risk Factors

proceed
        further as a class action and decertified the class. The Florida Supreme
        Court
        has formally concluded its consideration of

Engle

, but the time for
        plaintiffs to seek review of the case by the U.S. Supreme Court has not
        expired.

In
        the
        event that the circuit court’s $16.3 billion punitive damages judgment against
        Lorillard is reinstated and ultimately upheld, the amount of that judgment
        would
        significantly exceed the assets of Lorillard. Even if the circuit court’s $16.3
        billion punitive damages judgment were reduced, the reduced amount of the
        final
        judgment might ultimately exceed the assets of Lorillard and result in a
        liquidation or bankruptcy of Lorillard. For additional information on the

Engle

case,
        please read Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included
        in Item 8 of this report.

The
        Florida Supreme Court’s ruling in Engle could encourage additional litigation
        against cigarette manufacturers, including Lorillard.

The
        ruling by the Florida Supreme Court in

Engle

permits
        members of the decertified class to file individual claims, including claims
        for
        punitive damages. The opportunity for filing such cases concludes during
        January
        of 2008. The Florida Supreme Court held that these individual plaintiffs
        are
        entitled to rely on some of the jury’s findings in favor of the plaintiffs in
        the first phase of the

Engle

trial on
        a number of issues including, among other things, that smoking cigarettes
        causes
        a number of diseases; that cigarettes are addictive or dependence-producing;
        and
        that the defendants, including Lorillard, were negligent, breached express
        and
        implied warranties, placed cigarettes on the market that were defective and
        unreasonably dangerous, and concealed or conspired to conceal the risks of
        smoking. The Supreme Court further held that these first phase jury findings
        will be binding on the

Engle

defendants, including Lorillard, in any such future case filed by a member
        of
        the former class. It is possible that a significant number of additional
        individual lawsuits will be filed against cigarette manufacturers, including
        Lorillard, by former class members. It is not possible to estimate the number
        or
        ultimate outcome of lawsuits that could be filed as a result of this decision.
        In the aggregate, these claims may have a material adverse effect on our
        financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. For additional
        information on the

Engle

case,
        please read Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included
        in Item 8 of this report.

The
        United States Surgeon General has issued a report regarding the risks of
        cigarette smoking to non-smokers that could result in additional litigation
        against cigarette manufacturers, additional restrictions placed on the use
        of
        cigarettes, and additional regulations placed on the manufacture or sale
        of
        cigarettes.

In
        a
        report entitled “The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco
        Smoke: A Report of the Surgeon General, 2006,” the United States Surgeon General
        summarized conclusions from previous Surgeon General’s reports concerning the
        health effects of exposure to second-hand smoke by non-smokers. According
        to
        this report, scientific evidence now supports six major conclusions:

·

Second-hand
                  smoke causes premature death and disease in children and in adults
                  who do
                  not smoke.

·

Children
                  exposed to second-hand smoke are at an increased risk for sudden
                  infant
                  death syndrome (SIDS), acute respiratory infections and ear
                  problems.

·

Exposure
                  of adults to second-hand smoke has immediate adverse effects on
                  the
                  cardiovascular system and causes heart disease and lung
                  cancer.

·

The
                  scientific evidence indicates that there is no risk-free level
                  of exposure
                  to second-hand smoke.

·

Many
                  millions of Americans, both children and adults, are exposed to
                  second-hand smoke in their homes and
                  workplaces.

·

Eliminating
                  smoking in indoor spaces fully protects non-smokers from exposure
                  to
                  second-hand smoke. Separating smokers from non-smokers, cleaning
                  the air,
                  and ventilating buildings cannot eliminate exposures of non-smokers
                  to
                  second-hand smoke.

This
        report could form the basis of additional litigation against cigarette
        manufacturers, including Lorillard. The report could be used to support existing
        litigation against Lorillard or other cigarette manufacturers. It also is
        possible that the


Item
                  1A. Risk Factors

Surgeon
        General’s report could result in additional restrictions placed on cigarette
        smoking or in additional regulations placed on the manufacture or sale of
        cigarettes. It is possible that such additional restrictions or regulations
        could result in a decrease in cigarette sales in the United States, including
        sales of Lorillard brands. These developments may have a material adverse
        effect
        on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

Lorillard
        has substantial payment obligations under litigation settlement agreements
        which
        will materially adversely affect its cash flows and operating income in future
        periods.

Lorillard
        and other manufacturers of tobacco products are parties to the State Settlement
        Agreements with the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth
        of
        Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories, which settled the asserted and
        unasserted health care cost recovery and certain other claims of those states
        and territories.

Under
        the
        State Settlement Agreements, Lorillard is obligated to pay approximately
        $925.0
        million to $975.0 million in 2007, primarily based on 2006 estimated industry
        volume. Annual payments under the State Settlement Agreements are required
        to be
        paid in perpetuity and are based, among other things, on Lorillard’s domestic
        market share and unit volume of domestic shipments in the year preceding
        the
        year in which payment is due. Please read Note 20 to the Notes to Consolidated
        Financial Statements included in Item 8 for additional information regarding
        the
        State Settlement Agreements.

Concerns
        that mentholated cigarettes may pose greater health risks could adversely
        affect
        Lorillard.

Some
        plaintiffs and other sources, including among others, the Center for Disease
        Control and Prevention, have claimed that mentholated cigarettes may pose
        greater health risks than non-mentholated cigarettes. If such claims were
        to be
        substantiated, Lorillard, as the leading manufacturer of mentholated cigarettes
        in the United States, could face increased exposure to tobacco-related
        litigation. Even if those claims are not substantiated, increased concerns
        about
        the health impact of mentholated cigarettes could adversely affect Lorillard’s
        sales, including sales of Newport.

Lorillard
        is subject to important limitations on advertising and marketing cigarettes
        that
        could harm its competitive position.

Television
        and radio advertisements of tobacco products have been prohibited since 1971.
        Under the State Settlement Agreements, Lorillard generally cannot use billboard
        advertising, cartoon characters, sponsorship of concerts, non-tobacco
        merchandise bearing its brand names and various other advertising and marketing
        techniques. In addition, the Master Settlement Agreement prohibits the targeting
        of youth in advertising, promotion or marketing of tobacco products.
        Accordingly, Lorillard has determined not to advertise its cigarettes in
        magazines with large readership among people under the age of 18. Additional
        restrictions may be imposed or agreed to in the future. These limitations
        may
        make it difficult to maintain the value of an existing brand if sales or
        market
        share decline for any reason. Moreover, these limitations significantly impair
        the ability of cigarette manufacturers, including Lorillard, to launch new
        premium brands.

Sales
        of cigarettes are subject to substantial federal, state and local excise
        taxes.

In
        1999,
        federal excise taxes were $0.24 per pack and state excise taxes ranged from
        $0.03 to $1.00 per pack.

In

2006,
        the federal excise tax was $0.39 per pack and combined state and local excise
        taxes ranged from $0.07 to $3.66 per pack. During 2006, excise tax increases
        ranging from $0.05 to $1.00 per pack of 20 cigarettes were implemented in
        six
        states and two municipalities. Proposals continue to be made to increase
        federal, state and local tobacco excise taxes. Lorillard believes that increases
        in excise and similar taxes have had an adverse impact on sales of cigarettes
        and that future increases, the extent of which cannot be predicted, could
        result
        in further volume declines for the cigarette industry, including Lorillard,
        and
        an increased sales shift toward lower priced discount cigarettes rather than
        premium brands.

Lorillard
        is dependent on the U.S. cigarette business, which we expect to continue
        to
        contract.

Lorillard’s
        U.S. cigarette business is currently its only significant business. The U.S.
        cigarette market has generally been contracting and we expect it to continue
        to
        contract. Lorillard does not have foreign cigarette sales that could offset
        these effects, as it sold the international rights to substantially all of
        its
        brands, including Newport, in 1977. As a result of price increases, restrictions
        on advertising and promotions, increases in regulation and excise taxes,
        health
        concerns, a

decline
        in the social acceptability of smoking, increased pressure from anti-tobacco
        groups and other factors, U.S. cigarette shipments have decreased at a compound
        annual rate of approximately 2.6% over the period 1997 through 2006, as measured
        by Management Science Associates. Domestic U.S. cigarette industry shipments
        decreased by 2.4% during 2006, as compared to 2005, and 3.2% for 2005, as
        compared to 2004, according to information provided by Management Science
        Associates.

Lorillard
        derives most of its revenue from the sales of one product in the premium
        market.

Lorillard’s
        largest selling brand, Newport, accounted for approximately

93.3

%
        of
        Lorillard’s sales revenue in 2006. Newport is positioned in the premium segment
        of the U.S. cigarette market. Lorillard’s principal strategic plan revolves
        around the advertising and promotion of its Newport brand. Lorillard cannot
        ensure that it will continue to successfully implement its strategic plan
        with
        respect to Newport or that implementation of its strategic plan will result
        in
        the maintenance or growth of the Newport brand.

The
        use of significant amounts of promotion expenses and sales incentives in
        response to competitive actions and market price sensitivity may have a material
        adverse impact on Lorillard.

The
        cigarette market over recent years has been very price competitive due to
        the
        impact of, among other things, higher state and local excise taxes and the
        market share of deep discount brands. In response to these and other competitor
        actions and pricing pressures, Lorillard has engaged in significant use of
        promotional expenses and sales incentives. The cost of these measures could
        have
        a material adverse impact on Lorillard. Lorillard regularly reviews the results
        of its promotional spending activities and adjusts its promotional spending
        programs in an effort to maintain its competitive position. Accordingly,
        unit
        sales volume and sales promotion costs in any period are not necessarily
        indicative of sales and costs that may be realized in subsequent
        periods.

Several
        of Lorillard’s competitors have developed alternative cigarette products.

Certain
        of the major cigarette makers are marketing alternative cigarette products.
        For
        example, Philip Morris has developed an alternative cigarette called Accord
        in
        which the tobacco is heated rather than burned. Reynolds American has developed
        an alternative cigarette called Eclipse in which the tobacco is primarily
        heated, with only a small amount of tobacco burned. Vector Tobacco Inc. is
        marketing a cigarette offered in several packings with declining levels of
        nicotine, called Quest. Philip Morris and Reynolds American have indicated
        that
        these products may deliver fewer smoke components as compared to conventional
        cigarettes. Lorillard has not marketed similar alternative cigarettes. Should
        such alternative cigarette products gain a significant share of the U.S.
        cigarette market, Lorillard may be at a competitive disadvantage.

Lorillard
        may not be able to develop, produce or commercialize competitive new products
        and technologies required by regulatory changes or changes in consumer
        preferences.

Consumer
        health concerns and changes in regulations are likely to require Lorillard
        to
        introduce new products or make substantial changes to existing products.
        For
        example, six states have enacted legislation requiring cigarette manufacturers
        to reduce the ignition propensity of their products. Lorillard believes that
        there may be increasing pressure from public health authorities to develop
        a
        conventional cigarette or an alternative cigarette that provides a demonstrable
        reduced risk of adverse health effects. Lorillard may not be able to develop
        a
        reduced risk product that is acceptable to consumers. In addition, the costs
        associated with developing any such new products and technologies could be
        substantial.

The
        availability of counterfeit cigarettes could adversely affect Lorillard’s sales.

Sales
        of
        counterfeit cigarettes in the United States, including counterfeits of
        Lorillard’s Newport brand, could adversely impact sales by the manufacturers of
        the brands that are counterfeited and potentially damage the value and
        reputation of those brands. The availability of counterfeit Newport cigarettes
        could have a material adverse effect on Lorillard’s sales volumes, revenue and
        profits.


Item
                  1A. Risk Factors

Lorillard
        relies on a single manufacturing facility for the production of its cigarettes.

Lorillard
        produces all of its cigarettes at its Greensboro, North Carolina manufacturing
        facility. If Lorillard’s manufacturing plant is damaged, destroyed or
        incapacitated or Lorillard is otherwise unable to operate its manufacturing
        facility, Lorillard may be unable to produce cigarettes and may be unable
        to
        meet customer demand.

Lorillard
        relies on a small number of suppliers for certain of its tobacco
        leaf.

Lorillard
        purchases more than 90% of its domestic leaf tobacco from one supplier, Alliance
        One International, Inc. In addition, Lorillard purchases all of its
        reconstituted tobacco from one supplier, which is an affiliate of Reynolds
        American, Inc., a major competitor of Lorillard. If either of these suppliers
        becomes unwilling or unable to supply Lorillard and Lorillard is unable to
        find
        an alternative supplier on a timely basis, Lorillard’s operations could be
        disrupted resulting in lower production levels and reduced sales.

’s
        expansion projects may not be completed or completed on materially different
        terms or timing than initially anticipated. If completed, the expansion project
        may not achieve the intended benefits.

Boardwalk
        Pipeline has announced significant proposed expansion projects and may consider
        additional expansion projects in the future. Boardwalk Pipeline anticipates
        that
        it will be required to seek additional financing in the future to fund current
        and future expansion projects and may not be able to secure such financing
        on
        favorable terms, or at all. In addition, Boardwalk Pipeline may not be able
        to
        complete the expansion projects on time as a result of weather conditions,
        delays in obtaining or failure to obtain regulatory approvals, delays in
        obtaining key materials, labor difficulties and land owner opposition,
        difficulties with partners or potential partners or other factors beyond
        its
        control. If Boardwalk Pipeline does not meet designated schedules for approval
        and construction of its expansion projects, certain of its customers may
        have
        the right to terminate their precedent agreements relating to the expansion
        projects. Certain customers may also have the right to receive liquidated
        damages. Even if expansion projects are completed, the total cost of the
        expansion projects may be higher than anticipated and the performance of
        Boardwalk Pipeline’s business following the expansion projects may not meet
        expectations. Further, Boardwalk Pipeline may not be able to timely and
        effectively integrate the expansion projects into operations, such integration
        may result in unforeseen operating difficulties or unanticipated costs and
        the
        expansion projects might divert the attention of management from other business
        concerns. Any of these or other factors could adversely affect Boardwalk
        Pipeline’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the expansion
        projects and thus have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
        condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Boardwalk
        Pipeline’s natural gas transportation and storage operations are subject to FERC
        rate-making policies.

Action
        by
        the FERC on currently pending matters as well as matters arising in the future
        could adversely affect Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to establish rates, or to
        charge rates that would cover future increases in Boardwalk Pipeline’s costs, or
        even to continue to collect rates that cover current costs. Boardwalk Pipeline
        cannot make assurances that it will be able to recover all of its costs through
        existing or future rates. An adverse determination in any future rate proceeding
        brought by or against Texas Gas or Gulf South could have a material adverse
        effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
        flows.

On
        July
        20, 2004, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
        Circuit (“D.C. Circuit”) issued its opinion in

BP West Coast Products, LLC
        v. FERC (“BP West Coast”)

and vacated the portion of the FERC’s decision
        applying the FERC’s

Lakehead

policy to determine an allowance for
        income taxes in the regulated cost of service. In its

Lakehead

decision, the FERC allowed an oil pipeline limited partnership
        to include
        in its cost of service an income tax allowance to the extent that its
        unitholders were corporations subject to income tax. The D.C. Circuit emphasized
        that a regulated pipeline’s cost of service should include only “appropriate
        cost[s]” and compared income taxes paid by owners of equity interests in a
        pipeline to the costs of bookkeeping paid by such owners, indicating the
        court’s
        belief that such costs paid by an entity other than the regulated entity
        would
        not be recoverable in the rates of the pipeline. In May and June 2005, the
        FERC
        issued a statement of general policy and an order on remand of

BP West
        Coast

, respectively, in which the FERC stated it will permit pipelines to
        include in cost-of-service a tax allowance to reflect actual or potential
        tax
        liability on their public utility income attributable to all partnership
        or
        limited liability company interests, if the

                  1A. Risk Factors

ultimate
        owner of the interest has an actual or potential income tax liability on
        such
        income. Whether a pipeline’s owners have such actual or potential income tax
        liability will be reviewed by the FERC on a case-by-case basis. Although
        the new
        policy is generally favorable for pipelines that are organized as pass-through
        entities, it still entails risk due to the case-by-case review requirement.
        In
        December 2005, the FERC issued a case-specific review of the income tax
        allowance issue in the

SFPP, L.P.

proceeding. The FERC ruled favorably
        to SFPP, L.P. on all income tax issues and set forth guidelines regarding
        the
        type of evidence necessary for the pipeline to determine its income tax
        allowance. The FERC’s

BP West Coast

remand decision, the new tax
        allowance policy, and the December 2005 order have been appealed to the D.C.
        Circuit. As a result, the ultimate outcome of these proceedings is not certain
        and could result in changes to the FERC’s treatment of income tax allowances in
        cost of service. If the FERC were to change its tax allowance policies in
        the
        future, or if current policy was reversed or changed on appeal by a court,
        such
        changes could materially and adversely impact the rates Boardwalk Pipeline
        is
        permitted to charge as future rates are approved for its interstate
        transportation services.

Boardwalk
        Pipeline’s operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen
        interruptions for which Boardwalk Pipeline may not be adequately insured.

There
        are
        a variety of operating risks inherent in Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas
        transportation and storage operations, such as leaks, explosions and mechanical
        problems, all of which could cause substantial financial losses. Any of these
        or
        other similar occurrences could result in the disruption of Boardwalk Pipeline’s
        operations, substantial repair costs, personal injury or loss of human life,
        significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of Boardwalk
        Pipeline’s operations and substantial revenue losses. The location of pipelines
        near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers
        and industrial sites, could significantly increase the level of damages
        resulting from these risks.

Boardwalk
        Pipeline currently possesses property, business interruption and general
        liability insurance, but proceeds from such insurance coverage may not be
        adequate for all liabilities or expenses incurred or revenues lost. Moreover,
        such insurance may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable
        costs on commercially reasonable costs and terms.

Because
        of the natural decline in gas production from existing wells, Boardwalk
        Pipeline’s success depends on its ability to obtain access to new sources of
        natural gas.

For
        the
        years 2003 to 2005, gas production from the Gulf Coast region, which supplies
        the majority of Boardwalk Pipeline’s throughput, has declined an average of
        approximately 11.0% per year according to the Energy Information Administration
        (the “EIA”). A large part of this decline was due to the effects of Hurricanes
        Katrina and Rita in 2005. Boardwalk Pipeline cannot give any assurance regarding
        the gas production industry’s ability to find new sources of domestic supply.
        Production from existing wells and gas supply basins connected to Boardwalk
        Pipeline’s systems will naturally decline further over time. The amount of
        natural gas reserves underlying these wells may also be less than Boardwalk
        Pipeline anticipates, or the rate at which production from these reserves
        declines may be greater than Boardwalk Pipeline anticipates. Accordingly,
        to
        maintain or increase throughput levels on its pipelines, Boardwalk Pipeline
        must
        continually obtain access to new supplies of natural gas. The primary factors
        affecting Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to obtain new sources of natural gas to
        its pipelines include: (1) the level of successful drilling activity near
        Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipelines; (2) Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to compete for
        these supplies; (3) the successful completion of new liquefied natural gas
        (“LNG”) facilities near Boardwalk Pipeline’s facilities; and (4) Boardwalk
        Pipeline’s gas quality requirements.

The
        level
        of drilling activity is dependent on a number of factors beyond Boardwalk
        Pipeline’s control. The primary factor that impacts drilling decisions is the
        price of oil and natural gas. A sustained decline in natural gas prices could
        result in a decrease in exploration and development activities in the fields
        served or to be served by Boardwalk Pipeline, which would lead to reduced
        throughput levels on its pipelines. Other factors that impact production
        decisions include producers’ capital budget limitations, the ability of
        producers to obtain necessary drilling and other governmental permits, the
        availability and cost of drilling rigs and other drilling equipment, and
        regulatory changes. Because of these factors, even if new natural gas reserves
        were discovered in areas served by Boardwalk Pipeline, producers may choose
        not
        to develop those reserves or may connect them to different pipelines.


Item
                  1A. Risk Factors

Imported
        LNG is expected to be a significant component of future natural gas supply
        to
        the United States. Much of this increase in LNG supply is expected to be
        imported through new LNG facilities to be developed over the next decade.
        Boardwalk Pipeline cannot predict which, if any, of these projects will be
        constructed. If a significant number of these new projects fail to be developed
        with their announced capacity, or there are significant delays in such
        development, or if they are built in locations where they are not connected
        to
        Boardwalk Pipeline’s systems or they do not influence sources of supply on its
        systems, Boardwalk Pipeline may not realize expected increases in future
        natural
        gas supply available for transportation through its systems.

If
        Boardwalk Pipeline is not able to obtain new supplies of natural gas to replace
        the natural decline in volumes from existing supply basins, or if the expected
        increase in natural gas supply through imported LNG is not realized, throughput
        on its pipeline systems would decline.

Successful
        development of LNG import terminals in the eastern or northeastern United
        States
        could reduce the demand for Boardwalk Pipeline’s services.

Development
        of new, or expansion of existing, LNG facilities on the East Coast could
        reduce
        the need for customers in the northeastern United States to transport natural
        gas from the Gulf Coast and other supply basins connected to the Boardwalk
        Pipeline’s systems. This could reduce the amount of gas transported by Boardwalk
        Pipeline for delivery off-system to other interstate pipelines serving the
        northeast. If Boardwalk Pipeline is not able to replace these volumes with
        volumes to other markets or other regions, throughput on its pipeline systems
        will decline.

Boardwalk
        Pipeline may not be able to maintain or replace expiring gas transportation
        and
        storage contracts at favorable rates.

Boardwalk
        Pipeline’s primary exposure to market risk occurs at the time existing
        transportation contracts expire and are subject to renegotiation. As of December
        31, 2006, approximately 14.0% of the firm contract load on the Boardwalk
        Pipeline systems was due to expire on or before December 31, 2007. Upon
        expiration, Boardwalk Pipeline may not be able to extend contracts with existing
        customers or obtain replacement contracts at favorable rates or on a long-term
        basis. A key determinant of the value that customers can realize from firm
        transportation on a pipeline is the basis differential, which can be affected
        by, among other things, the availability of supply, available capacity, storage
        inventories, weather and general market demand in the respective
        areas.

The
        extension or replacement of existing contracts depends on a number of factors
        beyond Boardwalk Pipeline’s control, including:

·

existing
                    and new competition to deliver natural gas to Boardwalk Pipeline’s
                    markets;

·

the
                    growth in demand for natural gas in Boardwalk Pipeline’s markets;

·

whether
                    the market will continue to support long-term contracts;

·

the
                    reduction of current basis differentials-market price spreads
                    between two
                    points across the Boardwalk Pipeline
                    systems;

·

whether
                    Boardwalk Pipeline’s strategy continues to be successful;
                    and

·

the
                    effects of state regulation on customer contracting practices.

The
        northeastern terminus of the Texas Gas pipeline system is in Lebanon, Ohio,
        where it connects with other interstate natural gas pipelines delivering
        natural
        gas to East Coast and Midwest metropolitan areas and other indirect markets.
        Pipeline capacity into Lebanon is approximately 48.0% greater than pipeline
        capacity leaving that point, creating a bottleneck for supply into areas
        of high
        demand. Approximately 21.0% of Boardwalk Pipeline’s long-term contracts with
        firm deliveries to Lebanon expire by the end of 2007. While demand for natural
        gas from Boardwalk Pipeline’s Lebanon, Ohio terminus and other interconnects in
        that region has remained strong in the past, there can be no assurance regarding
        continued demand for gas from the Gulf Coast region, including East Texas,
        in
        the face of other

sources
        of natural gas for various indirect markets, including pipelines from Canada,
        a
        new proposed pipeline from the Rockies, and new LNG facilities proposed to
        be
        constructed along the East Coast.

Boardwalk
        Pipeline depends on certain key customers for a significant portion of its
        revenues.

Boardwalk
        Pipeline relies on a limited number of customers for a significant portion
        of
        its revenues. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, ProLiance
        Energy, LLC and Atmos Energy accounted for approximately 18.4%, 20.1% and
        32.3%
        of Boardwalk Pipeline’s total operating revenues. Boardwalk Pipeline may be
        unable to negotiate extensions or replacements of these contracts and those
        with
        other key customers on favorable terms as a result of competition,
        creditworthiness or for other reasons.

Boardwalk
        Pipeline is exposed to credit risk relating to nonperformance by its customers.

Boardwalk
        Pipeline is exposed to credit risk from the nonperformance by its customers
        of
        their contractual obligations, in large part relating to volumes owed by
        customers for imbalances or gas loaned to them, generally under parking and
        lending services and no-notice services. If any significant customer of
        Boardwalk Pipeline should have credit or financial problems resulting in
        a delay
        or failure to repay the gas they owe Boardwalk Pipeline, it could have a
        material adverse effect on Boardwalk Pipeline’s financial condition, results of
        operation and cash flows. Please read information on credit risk included

Boardwalk
        Pipeline depends on third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected
        to
        its pipelines.

Boardwalk
        Pipeline depends upon third-party pipelines and other facilities that provide
        delivery options to and from its pipelines. For example, Gulf South’s pipeline
        system can deliver approximately 500.0 Mcf per day to a major pipeline
        connection with Texas Eastern at Kosciusko, Mississippi. If this or any other
        pipeline connection were to become unavailable for current or future volumes
        of
        natural gas due to repairs, damage to the facility, lack of capacity or any
        other reason, Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to continue shipping natural gas to
        end markets could be restricted. Any temporary or permanent interruption
        at any
        key pipeline interconnect could cause a material reduction in volumes
        transported on or stored at facilities of Boardwalk Pipeline.

Significant
        changes in natural gas prices could affect supply and demand, and reduce
        system
        throughput.

Higher
        natural gas prices could result in a decline in the demand for natural gas
        and,
        therefore, in the throughput on the Boardwalk Pipeline systems. In addition,
        reduced price volatility could reduce the revenues generated by Boardwalk
        Pipeline’s parking and lending and interruptible storage services. In general
        terms, the price of natural gas fluctuates in response to changes in supply,
        changes in demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors
        that
        are beyond Boardwalk Pipeline’s control. These factors include:

·

worldwide
                  economic conditions;

·

weather
                  conditions and seasonal trends;

·

                  on the shippers who have contracted for capacity on Boardwalk Pipeline’s
                  planned expansion projects;

        industry, which is significantly affected by volatile oil and gas
        prices.

Diamond
        Offshore’s business depends on the level of activity in offshore oil and gas
        exploration, development and production in markets worldwide. Oil and gas
        prices, market expectations of potential changes in these prices and a variety
        of political and economic factors significantly affect this level of activity.
        However, higher commodity prices do not necessarily translate into increased
        drilling activity since Diamond Offshore’s customers’ expectations of future
        commodity prices typically drive demand for Diamond Offshore’s rigs. Oil and gas
        prices are extremely volatile and are affected by numerous factors beyond
        Diamond Offshore’s control, including:

Diamond
        Offshore’s industry is cyclical.

Diamond
        Offshore’s industry has historically been cyclical. There have been periods of
        high demand, short rig supply and high dayrates (such as Diamond Offshore
        is
        currently experiencing in the markets in which it operates), followed by
        periods
        of lower demand, excess rig supply and low dayrates. Periods of excess rig
        supply intensify the competition in the industry and often result in rigs
        being
        idle for long periods of time.

Current
        oil and natural gas prices are significantly above historical averages, which
        has resulted in higher utilization and dayrates earned by Diamond Offshore’s
        drilling units, generally beginning in the third quarter of 2004. However,
        Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance that the current industry cycle
        of
        high demand, short rig supply and higher dayrates will continue. Diamond
        Offshore may be required to idle rigs or to enter into lower rate contracts
        in
        response to market conditions in the future.


Item
                  1A. Risk Factors

Prolonged
        periods of low utilization and dayrates could also result in the recognition
        of
        impairment charges on certain of Diamond Offshore’s drilling rigs if future cash
        flow estimates, based upon information available to management at the time,
        indicate that the carrying value of these rigs may not be
        recoverable.

The
        terms of some of Diamond Offshore’s drilling contracts may limit its ability to
        benefit from increasing dayrates in a rising market.

The
        duration of offshore drilling contracts is generally determined by market
        demand
        and the respective management strategies of the offshore drilling contractor
        and
        its customers. In periods of rising demand for offshore rigs, contractors
        typically prefer well-to-well contracts that allow contractors to profit
        from
        increasing dayrates. In contrast, during these periods customers with reasonably
        definite drilling programs typically prefer longer term contracts to maintain
        dayrate prices at a consistent level. Conversely, in periods of decreasing
        demand for offshore rigs, contractors generally prefer longer term contracts
        to
        preserve dayrates at existing levels and ensure utilization, while customers
        prefer well-to-well contracts that allow them to obtain the benefit of lower
        dayrates.

To
        the
        extent possible, Diamond Offshore seeks to have a foundation of long-term
        contracts with a reasonable balance of single-well, well-to-well and short-term
        contracts to minimize the downside impact of a decline in the market while
        still
        participating in the benefit of increasing dayrates in a rising market. However,
        Diamond Offshore cannot be sure that it will be able to achieve or maintain
        such
        a balance from time to time. Diamond Offshore’s inability to fully benefit from
        increasing dayrates in a rising market due to the long-term nature of its
        contracts, may adversely impact its profitability.

The
        majority of Diamond Offshore’s contracts for its drilling units are fixed
        dayrate contracts, and increases in Diamond Offshore’s operating costs could
        adversely affect the profitability of those
        contracts.

Diamond
        Offshore’s contracts for its drilling units provide for the payment of a fixed
        dayrate per rig operating day, although some contracts do provide for a limited
        escalation in dayrate due to increased operating costs incurred. Many of
        Diamond
        Offshore’s operating costs, such as labor costs, are unpredictable and fluctuate
        based on events beyond Diamond Offshore’s control. The gross margin that Diamond
        Offshore realizes on these fixed dayrate contracts will fluctuate based on
        variations in Diamond Offshore’s operating costs over the terms of the
        contracts. In addition, for contracts with dayrate clauses, Diamond Offshore
        may
        be unable to recover increased or unforeseen costs from its
        customers.

Diamond
        Offshore’s drilling contracts may be terminated due to events beyond Diamond
        Offshore’s control.

Diamond
        Offshore’s customers may terminate some of their drilling contracts if the
        drilling unit is destroyed or lost or if drilling operations are suspended
        for a
        specified period of time as a result of a breakdown of major equipment or,
        in
        some cases, due to other events beyond the control of either party. In addition,
        some of Diamond Offshore’s drilling contracts permit the customer to terminate
        the contract after specified notice periods by tendering contractually specified
        termination amounts. These termination payments may not fully compensate
        Diamond
        Offshore for the loss of a contract. In addition, the early termination of
        a
        contract may result in a rig being idle for an extended period of time. During
        depressed market conditions, Diamond Offshore’s customers may also seek
        renegotiation of firm drilling contracts to reduce their
        obligations.

Rig
        conversions, upgrades or newbuilds may be subject to delays and cost
        overruns.

From
        time
        to time, Diamond Offshore may undertake to add new capacity through conversions
        or upgrades to rigs or through new construction. Diamond Offshore has entered
        into agreements to upgrade two of its drilling units to ultra-deepwater
        capability at an estimated aggregate cost of $553.0 million. The shipyard
        portion of the upgrade of one rig has been completed, and Diamond Offshore
        expects that the unit will return to the Gulf of Mexico in mid-2007. Diamond
        Offshore expects delivery of its other semisubmersible unit during the fourth
        quarter of 2008. Diamond Offshore also has entered into agreements to construct
        two new jack-up drilling units with delivery expected in the first quarter
        of
        2008 at an aggregate cost of approximately $320.0 million, including drillpipe
        and capitalized interest. These projects and other projects of this type
        are
        subject to risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction
        project resulting from numerous factors, including the
        following:


Item
                  1A. Risk Factors

·

shortages
                  of equipment, materials or skilled labor;

·

                  stoppages;

·

unscheduled
                  delays in the delivery of ordered materials and
                  equipment;

·

unanticipated
                  cost increases;

·

weather
                  interferences;

·

difficulties
                  in obtaining necessary permits or in meeting permit
                  conditions;

·

design
                  and engineering problems;

·

shipyard
                  failures; and

·

failure
                  or delay of third party service providers and labor disputes.

Failure
        to complete a rig upgrade or new construction on time, or failure to complete
        a
        rig conversion or new construction in accordance with its design specifications
        may, in some circumstances, result in the delay, renegotiation or cancellation
        of a drilling contract.

Diamond
        Offshore’s business involves numerous operating hazards and Diamond Offshore is
        not fully insured against all of them.

Diamond
        Offshore’s operations are subject to the usual hazards inherent in drilling for
        oil and gas offshore, such as blowouts, reservoir damage, loss of production,
        loss of well control, punchthroughs, craterings and natural disasters such
        as
        hurricanes or fires. The occurrence of these events could result in the
        suspension of drilling operations, damage to or destruction of the equipment
        involved and injury or death to rig personnel, damage to producing or
        potentially productive oil and gas formations and environmental damage.
        Operations also may be suspended because of machinery breakdowns, abnormal
        drilling conditions, failure of subcontractors to perform or supply goods
        or
        services or personnel shortages. In addition, offshore drilling operators
        are
        subject to perils peculiar to marine operations, including capsizing, grounding,
        collision and loss or damage from severe weather. Damage to the environment
        could also result from our operations, particularly through oil spillage
        or
        extensive uncontrolled fires. Diamond Offshore may also be subject to damage
        claims by oil and gas companies

or other
        parties

.

Pollution
        and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable, and Diamond Offshore
        does not typically retain loss-of-hire insurance policies to cover its rigs.
        Diamond Offshore’s insurance policies and contractual rights to indemnity may
        not adequately cover its losses, or may have exclusions of coverage for some
        losses. Diamond Offshore does not have insurance coverage or rights to indemnity
        for all risks, including, among other things, war risk

,
        liability

risk
        for
        certain amounts of excess coverage

and
        certain physical damage risk. If a significant accident or other event

occurs
        and is not fully covered by insurance or contractual indemnity, it could
        adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
        There can be no assurance that Diamond Offshore will continue to carry the
        insurance it currently maintains or that those parties with contractual
        obligations to indemnify Diamond Offshore will necessarily be financially
        able
        to indemnify it against all these risks. In addition, no assurance can be
        made
        that Diamond Offshore will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the
        future
        at rates it considers to be reasonable or that it will be able to obtain
        insurance against some risks.

Diamond
        Offshore significantly increased its insurance deductibles and has elected
        to
        self-insure

for
        a portion of its liability exposure and

for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the
        U.S.
        Gulf of Mexico.

Because
        the amount of insurance coverage available to Diamond Offshore has been
        significantly limited and the cost for such coverage has increased
        substantially, Diamond Offshore has elected to self-insure for a portion
        of its
        liability exposure and for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by
        named
        windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Although Diamond Offshore continues
        to
        carry physical damage insurance for certain other losses, Diamond Offshore
        significantly increased its deductibles to offset or mitigate premium increases.
        Diamond Offshore’s deductible for physical damage insurance is currently $150.0
        million per occurrence (or lower for some rigs if they are declared a
        constructive total loss). Diamond Offshore

continues to
        carry liability insurance with coverages similar to prior years, except that
        Diamond Offshore elected to self-insure for a portion of its excess liability
        coverage related to named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Diamond
        Offshore’s deductible for liability coverage generally has increased to $5.0
        million per occurrence, but its deductibles arising in connection with certain
        liabilities relating to named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico have
        increased to $10.0 million per occurrence, with no annual aggregate deductible.
        To the extent that Diamond Offshore incurs certain liabilities related to
        named
        windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in excess


Item
                  1A. Risk Factors

of
        $75.0
        million, Diamond Offshore is self-insured for up to a maximum retention of
        $17.5
        million per occurrence in addition to these deductibles. These changes result
        in
        a higher risk of losses that are not covered by third party insurance contracts.
        If named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico cause significant damage to
        Diamond Offshore’s rigs or equipment or to the property of others for which it
        may be liable

,

it could have a material adverse effect on our
        financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Diamond
        Offshore’s international operations involve additional risks not associated with
        domestic operations.

Diamond
        Offshore operates in various regions throughout the world that may expose
        it to
        political and other uncertainties, including risks of:

·

terrorist
                    acts, war and civil disturbances;

·

piracy;

·

kidnapping
                    of personnel;

·

expropriation
                    of property or equipment;

·

foreign
                    and domestic monetary policy;

·

the
                    inability to repatriate income or
                    capital;

·

regulatory
                    or financial requirements to comply with foreign bureaucratic
                    actions;
                    and

·

changing
                    taxation policies.

In
          addition, international contract drilling operations are subject to various
          laws
          and regulations in countries in which Diamond Offshore operates, including
          laws
          and regulations relating to:

·

the
                    equipping and operation of drilling
                    units;

·

repatriation
                    of foreign earnings;

·

oil
                    and gas exploration and
                    development;

·

taxation
                    of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel;
                    and

·

use
                    and compensation of local employees and suppliers by foreign
                    contractors.

No
        prediction can be made as to what governmental regulations may be enacted
        in the
        future that could adversely affect the international drilling industry. The
        actions of foreign governments, including initiatives by OPEC, may adversely
        affect Diamond Offshore’s ability to compete.

Diamond

Offshore

’s
        drilling contracts in the Mexican GOM expose it to greater risks than they
        normally assume.

As
        of the
        date of this report, Diamond Offshore has three intermediate semisubmersible
        rigs and one jack-up rig drilling offshore Mexico under contract with PEMEX,
        the
        national oil company of Mexico, and has two additional intermediate
        semisubmersibles contracted to begin working for PEMEX in the third quarter
        of
        2007. The terms of these contracts expose Diamond Offshore to greater risks
        than
        they normally assume, such as exposure to greater environmental liability,
        and
        can be terminated by PEMEX on short-term notice, contractually or by statute,
        subject to certain conditions. While Diamond Offshore believes that the
        financial terms of these contracts and its operating safeguards in place
        mitigate these risks, Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance that the
        increased risk exposure will not have a negative impact on our future operations
        or financial results.


Item
                  1A. Risk Factors

Fluctuations
        in exchange rates and nonconvertibility of currencies could result in
        losses.

Due
        to
        Diamond Offshore’s international operations, Diamond Offshore may experience
        currency exchange losses where revenues are received and expenses are paid
        in
        nonconvertible currencies or where it does not hedge an exposure to a foreign
        currency. Diamond Offshore may also incur losses as a result of an inability
        to
        collect revenues because of a shortage of convertible currency available
        to the
        country of operation, controls over currency exchange or controls over the
        repatriation of income or capital. Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance
        that financial hedging arrangements will effectively hedge any foreign currency
        fluctuation losses that may arise.

        Insurance Extension Act of 2005 (“TRIEA”) extended, until December 31, 2007, the
        program established by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002. Under this
        program, insurers are required to offer terrorism insurance and the federal
        government will share the risk of loss by commercial property and casualty
        insurers arising from future terrorist attacks. TRIEA does not provide complete
        protection for future losses derived from acts of terrorism. Please read
        information on TRIEA included in the MD&A under Item 7.

Diamond
        Offshore and Boardwalk Pipeline.

The
        continued threat of terrorism and the impact of retaliatory military and
        other
        action by the United States and its allies might lead to increased political,
        economic and financial market instability and volatility in prices for oil
        and
        natural gas, which could affect the market for DiamondOffshore’s oil and gas
        offshore drilling services and Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas transportation,
        gathering and storage services. In addition, it has been reported that
        terrorists might target domestic energy facilities. While Diamond Offshore
        and
        Boardwalk Pipeline take steps that they believe are appropriate to increase
        the
        security of their energy assets, there is no assurance that they can completely
        secure their assets, completely protect them against a terrorist attack or
        obtain adequate insurance coverage for terrorist acts at reasonable rates.

Loews
        Hotels.

The
        travel and tourism industry went into a steep decline in the periods following
        the 2001 World Trade Center event which had a negative impact on the occupancy
        levels and average room rates at Loews Hotels. Future terrorist attacks could
        similarly lead to reductions in business travel and tourism which could harm
        Loews Hotels.

Certain
        of our subsidiaries face significant risks related to the impact of hurricanes
        and other natural disasters.

In
        addition to CNA’s exposure to catastrophe losses discussed above, the businesses
        operated by several of our other subsidiaries are exposed to significant
        harm
        from the effects of natural disasters, particularly hurricanes and related
        flooding and other damage. While much of the damage caused by natural disasters
        is covered by insurance, we cannot be sure that such coverage will be available
        or be adequate in all cases. These risks include the following:

Boardwalk
        Pipeline.

A
        substantial portion of the Gulf South pipeline assets and a smaller portion
        of
        the Texas Gas pipeline assets are located in the Gulf Coast region of the
        United
        States and, as such, are exposed to the impact of hurricanes, such as Hurricanes
        Katrina and Rita which struck that region in 2005. Boardwalk Pipeline
        experienced a variety of damage from those storms, including damage to its
        physical facilities and rights of way,

loss
        of
        customers,

such
        as
        the City of New Orleans, damaged or destroyed by the storm and loss of natural
        gas supply from facilities of suppliers damaged or destroyed by the storm.
        In
        addition, Boardwalk Pipeline could be required to relocate some of its pipeline
        facilities, possibly at its expense, as the Gulf Coast region is
        reconstructed.


Item
                  1A. Risk Factors

Diamond
        Offshore.

Diamond
        Offshore operates its offshore rig fleet in waters that can be severely impacted
        by hurricanes and other natural disasters, including the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
        In
        late August 2005, one of Diamond Offshore’s jack-up drilling rigs, the

Ocean
        Warwick

,
        was
        seriously damaged during Hurricane Katrina and other rigs in Diamond’s fleet and
        its warehouse in New Iberia, Louisiana sustained lesser damage in Hurricanes
        Katrina or Rita, or in some cases both storms. In addition to damaging or
        destroying rig equipment, some or all of which may be covered by insurance,
        catastrophes of this kind result in additional operating expenses for Diamond,
        including the cost of reconnaissance aircraft, rig crew over-time and employee
        assistance, hurricane relief supplies, temporary housing and office space
        and
        the rental of mooring equipment and others which may not be covered by
        insurance.

Loews
        Hotels.

Hotels
        operated by Loews Hotels are exposed to damage, business interruption and
        reductions in travel and tourism in markets affected by significant natural
        disasters such as hurricanes. For example, Loews Hotels’ properties located in
        Florida and

New
        Orleans suffered significant damage from hurricanes and related flooding
        during
        the past two years.

Certain
        of our subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal, state and local
        governmental regulations.

The
        businesses operated by certain of our subsidiaries are impacted by current
        and
        potential federal, state and local governmental regulations which imposes
        or
        might impose a variety of restrictions and compliance obligations on those
        companies. Governmental regulations can also change materially in ways that
        could adversely affect those companies. Risks faced by our subsidiaries related
        to governmental regulation include the following:

CNA.

The
        insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and
        supervision throughout the United States. Most insurance regulations are
        designed to protect the interests of CNA’s policyholders rather than its
        investors. Each state in which CNA does business has established supervisory
        agencies that regulate the manner in which CNA does business. Their regulations
        relate to, among other things:

·

standards
                    of solvency, including risk-based capital
                    measurements;

·

restrictions
                    on the nature, quality and concentration of
                    investments;

·

restrictions
                    on CNA’s ability to withdraw from unprofitable lines of
                    insurance;

·

the
                    required use of certain methods of accounting and
                    reporting;

·

the
                    establishment of reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other
                    purposes;

·

potential
                    assessments for funds necessary to settle covered claims against
                    impaired,
                    insolvent or failed insurance
                    companies;

·

licensing
                    of insurers and agents;

·

approval
                    of policy forms; and

·

limitations
                    on the ability of CNA’s insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to
                    us.

Regulatory
        powers also extend to premium rate regulations which require that rates not
        be
        excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. CNA also is required by
        the
        states to provide coverage to persons who would not otherwise be considered
        eligible by the insurers. Each state dictates the types of insurance and
        the
        level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks. CNA’s share
        of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of its
        respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each
        state.

Lorillard

.
        A wide variety of federal and state laws and local regulations limit the
        advertising, sale and use of cigarettes, and these laws have proliferated
        in
        recent years. If the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) is granted
        authority to regulate tobacco products, as has been proposed for many years,
        Lorillard believes such regulation would


Item
                  1A. Risk Factors

provide
        Philip Morris, as the largest tobacco company in the country, with a competitive
        advantage. Lorillard believes that FDA regulations could:

·

require
                    larger and more severe health warnings on packs and cartons;

·

ban
                    the use of descriptors on tobacco products, such as “low-tar” and “light”;

·

require
                    the disclosure of ingredients and additives to consumers;

·

require
                    pre-market approval by the FDA for claims made with respect to
                    reduced
                    risk or reduced exposure products;

·

allow
                    the FDA to require the reduction or elimination of nicotine or
                    any other
                    compound in cigarettes;

·

allow
                    the FDA to mandate the use of reduced risk technologies in conventional
                    cigarettes;

·

place
                    more severe restrictions on the advertising, marketing and sales
                    of
                    cigarettes;

·

permit
                    state regulation of labeling and advertising and eliminate the
                    existing
                    federal preemption of such regulation; and

·

grant
                    the FDA the authority to impose broad additional restrictions.

In
          addition, some states have enacted or proposed regulations, including with
          respect to mandatory disclosure of ingredients, including flavorings, some
          of
          which are trade secrets. State and local laws or rules that prohibit or
          restrict
          smoking in public places and workplaces continue to be enacted and proposed.
          Lorillard cannot predict the ultimate impact of these laws or regulatory
          proposals, but believes they will continue to reduce sales and increase
          costs.
          Extensive and inconsistent regulation by multiple states could prove to
          be
          particularly disruptive to Lorillard’s business.

Boardwalk
          Pipeline

.

Boardwalk
          Pipeline’s natural gas transportation, gathering and storage operations are
          subject to extensive regulation by the FERC and the United States Department
          of
          Transportation, among other federal and state authorities. In addition
          to the
          FERC rules and regulations related to the rates Boardwalk Pipeline can
          charge
          for its services, the FERC’s regulatory authority also extends to:

·

operating
                    terms and conditions of service;

·

the
                    types of services Boardwalk Pipeline may offer to its customers;

·

construction
                    of new facilities;

·

acquisition,
                    extension or abandonment of services or facilities;

·

accounts
                    and records; and

·

relationships
                    with affiliated companies involved in all aspects of the natural
                    gas and
                    electricity businesses.

The
          FERC
          action in any of these areas or modifications of its current regulations
          can
          adversely impact Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to compete for business, the costs
          incurred in its operations, the construction of new facilities or Boardwalk
          Pipeline’s ability to recover the full cost of operating its pipelines. Another
          example is the time the FERC takes to approve the construction of new
          facilities, which could give Boardwalk Pipeline’s non-regulated competitors time
          to offer alternative projects or raise the costs of Boardwalk Pipeline’s
          projects to the point where they are no longer economical.

The
          United States Department of Transportation Office of Pipeline Safety has
          issued
          a final rule requiring pipeline operators to develop integrity management
          programs to comprehensively evaluate certain areas along their pipelines
          and


Item
                  1A. Risk Factors

take
        additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in what the rule
        refers
        to as high consequence areas (“HCAs”) where a leak or rupture could potentially
        do the most harm.

Diamond
        Offshore.

Diamond
        Offshore’s operations are affected from time to time in varying degrees by
        governmental laws and regulations. The drilling industry is dependent on
        demand
        for services from the oil and gas exploration industry and, accordingly,
        is
        affected by changing tax and other laws relating to the energy business
        generally. Diamond Offshore may be required to make significant capital
        expenditures to comply with governmental laws and regulations. It is also
        possible that these laws and regulations may in the future add significantly
        to
        Diamond Offshore’s operating costs or may significantly limit drilling
        activity.

The
        businesses operated by our subsidiaries face intense
        competition.

Each
        of
        the businesses operated by our subsidiaries faces intense competition in
        its
        industry and will be harmed materially if it is unable to compete effectively.
        Certain of the competitive risks faced by those companies include:

CNA

.
        All
        aspects of the insurance industry are highly competitive and CNA must
        continuously allocate resources to refine and improve its insurance products
        and
        services. Insurers compete on the basis of factors including products, price,
        services, ratings and financial strength. CNA may lose business to competitors
        offering competitive insurance products at lower prices. CNA competes with
        a
        large number of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities for
        both
        distributors and customers. In addition, the Graham-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999
        has
        encouraged growth in the number, size and financial strength of CNA’s potential
        competitors by removing barriers that previously prohibited holding companies
        from simultaneously owning commercial banks, insurers and securities
        firms.

Lorillard

.
        The
        cigarette market is highly concentrated, as Lorillard’s two major competitors,
        Philip Morris USA and Reynolds American, Inc., had a combined market share
        of
        approximately 77.1% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Reynolds American
        owns
        the third and fourth leading menthol brands, Kool and Salem, which had a
        combined share of the menthol segment of approximately 18.3% for the year
        ended
        December 31, 2006. This concentration of U.S. market share could make it
        more
        difficult for Lorillard to compete for shelf space in retail outlets, access
        to
        which is already exacerbated by the restrictive marketing programs of these
        larger competitors, and could impact price competition among menthol
        brands.

In
        addition to competing with major cigarette makers, Lorillard competes with
        a
        significant number of smaller competitors, many of which are not subject
        to the
        same payment obligations under the State Settlement Agreements as Lorillard
        and
        thereby enjoy competitive cost and pricing advantages. As a result of their
        cost
        and pricing advantages, the smaller manufacturers have developed meaningful
        market share, principally in the deep discount cigarette segment. Lorillard’s
        focus on the premium market and its obligations under the State Settlement
        Agreements make it very difficult to compete successfully in the deep discount
        market.

Diamond
        Offshore.

The
        offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive with numerous industry
        participants, none of which at the present time has a dominant market share.
        Some of Diamond Offshore’s competitors may have greater financial or other
        resources than Diamond Offshore. Drilling contracts are traditionally awarded
        on
        a competitive bid basis. Intense price competition is often the primary factor
        in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job, although rig
        availability and location, a drilling contractor’s safety record and the quality
        and technical capability of service and equipment may also be considered.
        Mergers among oil and natural gas exploration and production companies have
        reduced the number of available customers.

Diamond
        Offshore’s industry has historically been cyclical. There have been periods of
        high demand, short rig supply and high dayrates (such as we are currently
        experiencing), followed by periods of lower demand, excess rig supply and
        lower
        dayrates. Periods of excess rig supply intensify the competition in the industry
        and often result in rigs being idle for long periods of time.

Although
        oil and natural gas prices are currently significantly above historical
        averages, resulting in higher utilization and dayrates earned by Diamond
        Offshore’s drilling units, generally beginning in the third quarter of 2004,
        Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance that the current industry cycle
        of
        high demand, short rig supply and higher dayrates will continue. Diamond
        Offshore may be required to idle rigs or to enter into lower rate contracts
        in
        response to market conditions in the future.


Item
                  1A. Risk Factors

Significant
        new rig construction and upgrades of existing drilling units could also
        intensify price competition. Diamond Offshore believes that there are currently
        100 jack-up rigs and floaters (semisubmersible rigs and drillships) on order
        and
        scheduled for delivery between 2007 and 2010. Improvements in dayrates and
        expectations of sustained improvements in rig utilization rates and dayrates
        may
        result in the construction of additional new rigs. These increases in rig
        supply
        could result in depressed rig utilization and greater price competition from
        both existing competitors, as well as new entrants into the offshore drilling
        market. As of the date of this report, not all of the rigs currently under
        construction have contracted for future work, which may further intensify
        price
        competition as scheduled delivery dates occur. In addition, competing
        contractors are able to adjust localized supply and demand imbalances by
        moving
        rigs from areas of low utilization and dayrates to areas of greater activity
        and
        relatively higher dayrates.

Boardwalk
        Pipeline.

Boardwalk Pipeline competes primarily with other interstate and intrastate
        pipelines in the transportation and storage of natural gas. Natural gas also
        competes with other forms of energy available to Boardwalk Pipeline’s customers,
        including electricity, coal and fuel oils. The principal elements of competition
        among pipelines are rates, terms of service, access to gas supplies, flexibility
        and reliability. The FERC’s policies promoting competition in gas markets are
        having the effect of increasing the gas transportation options for Boardwalk
        Pipeline’s traditional customer base. Increased competition could reduce the
        volumes of gas transported by Boardwalk Pipeline’s systems or, in cases where
        Boardwalk Pipeline does not have long-term fixed rate contracts, could force
        Boardwalk Pipeline to lower its transportation or storage rates. Competition
        could intensify the negative impact of factors that significantly decrease
        demand for natural gas in the markets served by Boardwalk Pipeline’s systems,
        such as competing or alternative forms of energy, a recession or other adverse
        economic conditions, weather, higher fuel costs and taxes or other governmental
        or regulatory actions that directly or indirectly increase the cost or limit
        the
        use of natural gas. Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to renew or replace existing
        contracts at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows
        could
        be adversely affected by the activities of its competitors. Boardwalk Pipeline
        also competes against a number of intrastate pipelines which have significant
        regulatory advantages over its and other interstate pipelines because of
        the
        absence of FERC regulation. In view of potential rate increases, construction
        and service flexibility available to intrastate pipelines, Boardwalk Pipeline
        may lose customers and throughput to intrastate competitors.

We
        and our subsidiaries are subject to litigation.

We
        and
        our subsidiaries are subject to litigation in the normal course of business.
        Litigation is costly and time consuming to defend and could result in a material
        expense. Please read information on litigation included in the MD&A under
        Item 7 and Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included
        under Item 8. Certain of the litigation risks faced by us and our subsidiaries
        are as follows:

CNA.

CNA
        faces substantial risks of litigation and arbitration beyond ordinary course
        claims and APMT matters, which may contain assertions in excess of amounts
        covered by reserves that CNA has established. These matters may be difficult
        to
        assess or quantify and may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts
        that include punitive or treble damages. Accordingly, unfavorable results
        in
        these proceedings could have a material adverse impact on our results of
        operations.

Lorillard.

As
        discussed in more detail above, Lorillard is a defendant in a large number
        of
        tobacco-related cases and other litigation, in some instances seeking damages
        from Lorillard ranging into the billions of dollars. We are a defendant in
        certain of these cases as well.

We
        and our subsidiaries are each dependent on a small number of key executives
        and
        other key personnel to operate our businesses successfully.

Our
        success and the success of our operating subsidiaries substantially depends
        upon
        each company’s ability to attract and retain high quality executives and other
        qualified employees. In many instances, there may be only a limited number
        of
        available qualified executives in the business lines in which we and our
        subsidiaries compete and the loss of one or more key employees or the inability
        to attract and retain other talented personnel could impede the successful
        implementation of our and our subsidiaries’ business strategies. For example,
        Lorillard is currently experiencing difficulty in identifying and hiring
        qualified personnel in some areas of its business, due primarily to the health
        and social issues associated with the tobacco industry. In addition, Diamond
        Offshore has experienced and continues to experience upward pressure on salaries
        and wages and increased competition for skilled workers as a result of
        the


Item
                  1A. Risk Factors

strengthening
        offshore drilling market. Diamond Offshore has also sustained the loss of
        experienced personnel to competitors. In response to these market conditions,
        Diamond Offshore has implemented retention programs, including increases
        in
        compensation.

Certain
        of our subsidiaries face significant risks related to compliance with
        environmental laws.

Certain
        of our subsidiaries have extensive obligations and/or financial exposure
        related
        to compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws or. Laws and
        regulations protecting the environment have become increasingly stringent

        recent years, and may in some cases impose “strict liability,” rendering a
        person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault
        on
        the part of that person. These laws and regulations may expose us and our
        subsidiaries to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others
        or
        for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they
        were
        performed. For example:

·

as
                    discussed in more detail above, many of CNA’s policyholders have made
                    claims for defense costs and indemnification in connection with
                    environmental pollution matters;

·

as
                    an operator of mobile offshore drilling units in navigable U.S.
                    waters and
                    some offshore areas, Diamond Offshore may be liable for, among
                    other
                    things, damages and costs incurred in connection with oil spills
                    related
                    to those operations, including for conduct of or conditions caused
                    by
                    others or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable
                    laws at the
                    time they were performed;

·

the
                    risk of substantial environmental costs and liabilities is inherent
                    in
                    natural gas transportation, gathering and storage, including
                    with respect
                    to, among other things, the handling and discharge of solid and
                    hazardous
                    waste from Boardwalk’s facilities, compliance with clean air standards and
                    the abandonment and reclamation of Boardwalk’s facilities, sites and other
                    properties; and

Bulova
                    no longer manufactures time pieces; however, it has substantial
                    ongoing
                    clean-up obligations and will continue to incur substantial costs,
                    which
                    could exceed Bulova’s current estimates, related to contaminated
                    properties that were previously operated by Bulova as manufacturing
                    sites.

of
        these
        cases. The Company is a defendant in four of the pending cases. Information

The
        pending product liability cases are composed of the following types of
        cases:

Conventional
        product liability cases are brought by individuals who allege cancer or other
        health effects caused by smoking cigarettes, by using smokeless tobacco
        products, by addiction to tobacco, or by exposure to environmental tobacco
        smoke. Approximately 1,285 cases are pending, including approximately 200
        cases
        against Lorillard. The 1,285 cases include approximately 1,000 cases pending
        in
        a single West Virginia court that have been consolidated for
        trial.


Item
                  3. Legal Proceedings

Tobacco
                  Related - (Continued)

Lorillard
        is a defendant in approximately 75 of the 1,000 consolidated West Virginia
        cases. The Company is a defendant in two of the conventional product liability
        cases.

Class
        action cases are purported to be brought on behalf of large numbers of
        individuals for damages allegedly caused by smoking. Ten of these cases are
        pending against Lorillard. One of these cases,

Schwab v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., et al.

,
        is on
        behalf of a purported nationwide class composed of purchasers of light
        cigarettes. The Company is a defendant in two of the class action cases.
        Lorillard is not a defendant in approximately 35 additional lights class
        action
        cases that are pending against other cigarette manufacturers. Reference is
        made
        to Exhibit 99.01 to this Report for a list of pending Class Action Cases
        in
        which Lorillard is a party.

Reimbursement
        cases are brought by or on behalf of entities who seek reimbursement of expenses
        incurred in providing health care to individuals who allegedly were injured
        by
        smoking. Plaintiffs in these cases have included the U.S. federal government,
        U.S. state and local governments, foreign governmental entities, hospitals
        or
        hospital districts, American Indian tribes, labor unions, private companies,
        and
        private citizens. Lorillard is a defendant in four of the six Reimbursement
        cases pending against cigarette manufacturers in the United States. The Company
        is not a defendant in any of the Reimbursement cases pending in the U.S.
        Lorillard and the Company are defendants in an additional case pending in
        Israel. Reference is made to Exhibit 99.01 to this Report for a list of pending
        Reimbursement Cases in which Lorillard is a party.

Included
        in this category is the suit filed by the federal government,

United States of America v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., et al.

,
        that
        sought disgorgement and injunctive relief.

During
        August of 2006, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia entered a final
        judgment and remedial order following trial of this matter. Although the
        verdict
        did not award monetary damages to the plaintiff, the final judgment and remedial
        order granted equitable relief and imposes a number of requirements on the
        defendants. Such requirements include, but are not limited to, corrective
        statements by defendants related to the health effects of smoking. The remedial
        order also would place certain prohibitions on the manner in which defendants
        market their cigarette products and would eliminate any use of “lights” or
        similar product descriptors. It is likely that the remedial order, including
        the
        prohibitions on the use of the descriptors relating to low tar cigarettes,
        will
        negatively affect Lorillard’s future sales and profits. The parties have noticed
        appeals from this judgment. It is possible that the appellate court could
        reconsider its order from

February
        of 2005 that barred the government from seeking disgorgement of profits.

Lorillard
        is one of the defendants in the case. The Company is not a party to this
        action.

Flight
        Attendant cases are brought by non-smoking flight attendants alleging injury
        from exposure to environmental smoke in the cabins of aircraft. Plaintiffs
        in
        these cases may not seek punitive damages for injuries that arose prior to
        January 15, 1997. Lorillard is a defendant in each of the approximately 2,625
        pending Flight Attendant cases.

Excluding
        the flight attendant and the consolidated West Virginia suits, approximately


product
        liability cases are pending against cigarette manufacturers in U.S. courts.
        Lorillard is a defendant in approximately 140 of the


cases.
        The Company, which is not a defendant in any of the flight attendant or the
        consolidated West Virginia matters, is a defendant in four of the
        actions.

Other
        tobacco-related litigation includes Tobacco Related Anti-Trust Cases. Reference
        is made to Exhibit 99.01 to this Report for a list of pending Tobacco Related
        Anti-Trust Cases in which Lorillard is a party.

MANAGEMENT’S
        REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our
        management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
        control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f)
        and
        15d-15(f)) for us. Our internal control system was designed to provide
        reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the
        preparation and fair presentation of published financial
        statements.

There
        are
        inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any control system, however
        well
        designed, including the possibility of human error and the possible
        circumvention or overriding of controls. Further, the design of a control
        system
        must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
        of
        controls must be considered relative to their costs. Management must make
        judgments with respect to the relative cost and expected benefits of any
        specific control measure. The design of a control system also is based in
        part
        upon assumptions and judgments made by management about the likelihood of
        future
        events, and there can be no assurance that a control will be effective under
        all
        potential future conditions. As a result, even an effective system of internal
        control over financial reporting can provide no more than reasonable assurance
        with respect to the fair presentation of financial statements and the processes
        under which they were prepared.

Our
        management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
        reporting as of December 31, 2006. In making this assessment, management
        used
        the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
        Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in

Internal
        Control - Integrated Framework

.
        Based
        on this assessment, our management believes that, as of December 31, 2006,
        our
        internal control over financial reporting was effective.

Deloitte
        & Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited
        our financial statements included in this report, has issued a report on
        our
        assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. The report of
        Deloitte & Touche LLP follows this report.


REPORT
        OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
        the
        Board of Directors and Shareholders of Loews Corporation:

We
        have
        audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying Management’s Annual
        Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Loews Corporation
        and
        subsidiaries (the “Company”) maintained effective internal control over
        financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established
        in

Internal
        Control—Integrated Framework

issued
        by
        the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The
        Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
        over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
        control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
        on
        management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
        internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
        conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
        Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
        we plan
        and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
        internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
        respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
        over
        financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating
        the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
        such
        other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
        that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
        company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or
        under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal
        financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
        by the
        company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide
        reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
        the
        preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
        generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
        financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
        to
        the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
        reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
        provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
        to
        permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
        accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
        are
        being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
        of
        the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
        timely
        detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
        assets that could have a material effect on the financial
        statements.

Because
        of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting,
        including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of
        controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented
        or
        detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
        effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future
        periods
        are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of
        changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
        or
        procedures may deteriorate.

In
        our
        opinion, management’s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal
        control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 is fairly stated,
        in
        all material respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal
        Control-Integrated Framework

issued
        by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
        Also in
        our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
        internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based
        on the
        criteria established in

Internal
        Control-Integrated Framework

issued
        by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
        Commission.

We
        have
        also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
        Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s consolidated financial statements
        and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended December 31,
        and our report dated February 22, 2007, expressed an unqualified opinion
        on
        those consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules
        and
        includes an explanatory paragraph concerning a change in the method of
        accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in
        2006.

REPORT
        OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
        the
        Board of Directors and Shareholders of Loews Corporation:

We
        have
        audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Loews Corporation
        and
        its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the
        related consolidated statements of income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows
        for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006. Our audits
        also included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item
        15.
        These financial statements and financial statement schedules are the
        responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
        opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedules based
        on
        our audits.

We
        conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
        Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”). Those standards require
        that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
        the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
        examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
        in
        the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
        principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
        evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
        our
        audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
        our
        opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
        respects, the financial position of Loews Corporation and its subsidiaries
        as of
        December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their
        cash
        flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006,
        in
        conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
        of
        America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when
        considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken
        as a
        whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
        therein.

As
        discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
        changed its method of accounting for defined benefit pension and other
        postretirement plans in 2006.

We
        have
        also audited, in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the effectiveness
        of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
        2006, based on the criteria established in

Internal
        Control-Integrated Framework

issued
        by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and
        our
        report dated February 22, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s
        assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
        reporting and an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
        internal control over financial reporting.

Reflects
                    Loews Corporation’s sales of 15 million shares of Carolina Group stock in
                    each of August and May of 2006 and 10 million shares in November
                    of 2005.
                    Net income per share of Carolina Group stock was not impacted
                    by these
                    sales.

Net
          income attributable to Loews common stock for the year ended 2006 amounted
          to
          $2,074.9 million, or $3.75 per share, compared to $960.3 million, or $1.72
          per
          share, in the prior year. The results for the year ended December 31, 2005
          included catastrophe losses at CNA of $304.8 million (after tax and minority
          interest) including the impact from Hurricanes Wilma, Katrina, Rita, Dennis
          and
          Ophelia and a benefit of $136.5 million related to a federal income tax
          settlement due primarily to net refund interest and the release of federal
          income tax reserves at CNA. The increase in net income was primarily due
          to
          improved results at CNA and Diamond Offshore, partially offset by a decrease
          in
          the share of Carolina Group earnings attributable to Loews common stock,
          due to
          the sale of additional Carolina Group stock in August and May of
          2006.

Net
          income attributable to Loews common stock includes net investment gains
          of $68.6
          million (after tax and minority interest) compared to net investment losses
          of
          $10.3 million (after tax and minority interest) in the prior year.

Net
          income attributable to Carolina Group stock for the year ended 2006 was
          $416.4
          million, or $4.46 per Carolina

Group
          share, compared to $251.3 million, or $3.62 per Carolina Group share in

income
          attributable to Carolina Group stock was

due
          to an
          increase in Lorillard Inc. net income driven by higher effective unit prices
          reflecting lower sales promotion expenses (accounted for as a reduction
          to net
          sales), increased unit sales and reflects an increase in the number of
          Carolina
          Group shares outstanding.

Classes
          of Common Stock

Our
          issuance of Carolina Group stock has resulted in a two class common stock
          structure for us. Carolina Group stock, commonly called a tracking stock,
          is
          intended to reflect the economic performance of a defined group of our
          assets
          and liabilities referred to as the Carolina Group. The principal assets
          and
          liabilities attributed to the Carolina Group are:

·

our
                    100% stock ownership interest in Lorillard,
                    Inc.;

·

notional,
                    intergroup debt owed by the Carolina Group to the Loews Group
                    ($1.2
                    billion outstanding at December 31, 2006), bearing interest at
                    the annual
                    rate of 8.0% and, subject to optional prepayment, due December
                    31, 2021;
                    and

·

any
                    and all liabilities, costs and expenses arising out of or related
                    to
                    tobacco or tobacco-related
                    businesses.

As
          of
          December 31, 2006, the outstanding Carolina Group stock represents a 62.34%
          economic interest in the performance of the Carolina Group. The Loews Group
          consists of all of our assets and liabilities other than the 62.34% economic
          interest represented by the outstanding Carolina Group stock, and includes
          as an
          asset the notional, intergroup debt of the Carolina Group.

The
          existence of separate classes of common stock could give rise to occasions
          where
          the interests of the holders of Loews common stock and Carolina Group stock
          diverge or conflict or appear to diverge or conflict. Subject to its fiduciary
          duties, our board of directors could, in its sole discretion, occasionally
          make
          determinations or implement policies that disproportionately affect the
          groups
          or the different classes of stock. For example, our board of directors
          may
          decide to reallocate assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash flows
          between groups, without the consent of shareholders. The board of directors
          would not be required to select the option that would result in the highest
          value for holders of Carolina Group stock.

As
          a
          result of the flexibility provided to our board of directors, it might
          be
          difficult for investors to assess the future prospects of the Carolina
          Group
          based on the Carolina Group’s past performance.

The
          creation of the Carolina Group and the issuance of Carolina Group stock
          does not
          change our ownership of Lorillard, Inc. or Lorillard, Inc.’s status as a
          separate legal entity. The Carolina Group and the Loews Group are notional
          groups that are intended to reflect the performance of the defined sets
          of
          assets and liabilities of each such group as described above. The Carolina
          Group
          and the Loews Group are not separate legal entities and the attribution
          of our
          assets and liabilities to the Loews Group or the Carolina Group does not
          affect
          title to the assets or responsibility for the liabilities.

Holders
          of our common stock and of Carolina Group stock are shareholders of Loews
          Corporation and are subject to the risks related to an equity investment
          in
          us.

Parent
          Company Structure

We
          are a
          holding company and derive substantially all of our cash flow from our
          subsidiaries, principally Lorillard, Boardwalk Pipeline and Diamond Offshore.
          We
          rely upon our invested cash balances and distributions from our subsidiaries
          to
          generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations and to declare and
          pay any
          dividends to our stockholders. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends
          is subject to, among other things, the availability of sufficient funds
          in such
          subsidiaries, applicable state laws, including in the case of the insurance
          subsidiaries of CNA, laws and rules governing the payment of dividends
          by
          regulated insurance companies. Claims of creditors of our subsidiaries
          will
          generally have priority as to the assets of such subsidiaries over our
          claims
          and those of our creditors and shareholders (see Liquidity and Capital
          Resources
          - CNA Financial, below).

At
          December 31, 2006, the book value per share of Loews common stock was $30.14,

CRITICAL
          ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The
          preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
          accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
          (“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
          reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related notes.
          Actual
          results could differ from those estimates.

The
          consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared
          in
          accordance with GAAP, applied on a consistent basis. We continually evaluate
          the
          accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial
          statements. In general, our estimates are based on historical experience,
          evaluation of current trends, information from third party professionals
          and
          various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the known
          facts
          and circumstances.

We
          consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to an
          understanding of our consolidated financial statements as their application
          places the most significant demands on our judgment. Due to the inherent
          uncertainties involved with this type of judgment, actual results could
          differ
          significantly from estimates and may have a material adverse impact on
          our
          results of operations and/or equity.

Insurance
          Reserves

Insurance
          reserves are established for both short and long-duration insurance contracts.
          Short-duration contracts are primarily related to property and casualty
          insurance policies where the reserving process is based on actuarial estimates
          of the amount of loss, including amounts for known and unknown claims.
          Long-duration contracts typically include traditional life insurance and
          long
          term care products and are estimated using actuarial estimates about mortality
          and morbidity, as well as assumptions about expected investment returns.
          The
          reserve for unearned premiums on property and casualty and accident and
          health
          contracts represents the portion of premiums written related to the unexpired
          terms of coverage. The inherent risks associated with the reserving process
          are
          discussed in the Reserves - Estimates and Uncertainties section
          below.

Reinsurance

Amounts
          recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with claim
          and
          claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves and
          are
          reported as receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The ceding
          of
          insurance does not discharge CNA of its primary liability under insurance
          contracts written by CNA. An exposure exists with respect to property and
          casualty and life reinsurance ceded to the extent that any reinsurer is
          unable
          to meet its obligations or disputes the liabilities assumed under reinsurance
          agreements. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded on
          the
          basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from reinsurers, reinsurer
          solvency, CNA’s past experience and current economic conditions.

Reinsurance
          accounting allows for contractual cash flows to be reflected as premiums
          and
          losses, as compared to deposit accounting, which requires cash flows to
          be
          reflected as assets and liabilities. To qualify for reinsurance accounting,
          reinsurance agreements must include risk transfer. Considerable judgment
          by
          management may be necessary to determine if risk transfer requirements
          are met.
          CNA believes it has appropriately applied reinsurance accounting principles
          in
          its evaluation of risk transfer. However, CNA’s evaluation of risk transfer and
          the resulting accounting could be challenged in connection with regulatory
          reviews or possible changes in accounting and/or financial reporting rules
          related to reinsurance, which could materially adversely affect our results
          of
          operations and/or equity. Further information on CNA’s reinsurance program is
          included in the Reinsurance section below and Note 18 of the Notes to
          Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

Tobacco
          and Other Litigation

Lorillard
          and other cigarette manufacturers continue to be confronted with substantial
          litigation. Plaintiffs in most of the cases seek unspecified amounts of
          compensatory damages and punitive damages, although some seek damages ranging
          into the billions of dollars. Plaintiffs in some of the cases seek treble
          damages, statutory damages, disgorgement of profits, equitable and injunctive
          relief, and medical monitoring, among other damages.

Critical
                    Accounting Estimates -
                    (Continued)

Lorillard
          believes that it has valid defenses to the cases pending against it. Lorillard
          also believes it has valid bases for appeal of the adverse verdicts against
          it.
          To the extent we are a defendant in any of the lawsuits, we believe that
          we are
          not a proper defendant in these matters and have moved or plan to move
          for
          dismissal of all such claims against us. While Lorillard intends to defend
          vigorously all tobacco products liability litigation, it is not possible
          to
          predict the outcome of any of this litigation. Litigation is subject to
          many
          uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these actions could be decided
          unfavorably. Lorillard may enter into discussions in an attempt to settle
          particular cases if it believes it is appropriate to do so.

Except
          for the impact of the State Settlement Agreements as described in Note
          20 of the
          Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report,
          management is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range
          of
          loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of pending litigation
          and,
          therefore, no provision has been made in the Consolidated Financial Statements
          for any unfavorable outcome. It is possible that our results of operations,
          cash
          flows and financial position could be materially adversely affected by
          an
          unfavorable outcome of certain pending or future litigation.

CNA
          is
          also involved in various legal proceedings that have arisen during the
          ordinary
          course of business. CNA evaluates the facts and circumstances of each situation,
          and when CNA determines it necessary, a liability is estimated and recorded.
          Please read Item 3 - Legal Proceedings and Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated
          Financial Statements included in Item 8.

Valuation
          of Investments and Impairment of Securities

Invested
          assets are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, market and
          credit
          risks. Due to the level of risk associated with certain invested assets
          and the
          level of uncertainty related to changes in the value of these assets, it
          is
          possible that changes in risks in the near term could have an adverse material
          impact on our results of operations or equity.

CNA’s
          investment portfolio is subject to market declines below book value that
          may be
          other-than-temporary. CNA has an Impairment Committee, which reviews the
          investment portfolio on a quarterly basis, with ongoing analysis as new
          information becomes available. Any decline that is determined to be
          other-than-temporary is recorded as an other-than-temporary impairment
          loss in
          the results of operations in the period in which the determination occurred.
          Further information on CNA’s process for evaluating impairments is included in
          Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under
          Item
          8.

Securities
          in the parent company’s investment portfolio that are not part of its cash
          management activities are classified as trading securities in order to
          reflect
          our investment philosophy. These investments are carried at fair value
          with the
          net unrealized gain or loss included in the Consolidated Statements of
          Income.

Long
          Term Care Products

Reserves
          and deferred acquisition costs for CNA’s long term care products are based on
          certain assumptions including morbidity, policy persistency and interest
          rates.
          The recoverability of deferred acquisition costs and the adequacy of the
          reserves are contingent on actual experience related to these key assumptions
          and other factors such as future health care cost trends. If actual experience
          differs from these assumptions, the deferred acquisition costs may not
          be fully
          recovered and the reserves may not be adequate, requiring CNA to add to
          reserves, or take unfavorable development. Therefore, our financial results
          could be adversely impacted.

Pension
          and Postretirement Benefit Obligations

We
          are
          required to make a significant number of assumptions in order to estimate
          the
          liabilities and costs related to our pension and postretirement benefit
          obligations to employees under our benefit plans. The assumptions that
          have the
          most impact on pension costs are the discount rate, the expected return
          on plan
          assets and the rate of compensation increases. These assumptions are evaluated
          relative to current market factors such as inflation, interest rates and
          fiscal
          and monetary policies. Changes in these assumptions can have a material
          impact
          on pension obligations and pension expense.

Critical
                    Accounting Estimates -
                    (Continued)

In
          determining the discount rate assumption, we utilized current market information
          and liability information, including a discounted cash flow analysis of
          our
          pension and postretirement obligations. In particular, the basis for our
          discount rate selection was the yield on indices of highly rated fixed
          income
          debt securities with durations comparable to that of our plan liabilities.
          The
          Moody’s Aa Corporate Bond Index is consistently used as the basis for the change
          in discount rate from the last measurement date with this measure confirmed
          by
          the yield on other broad bond indices. In addition in 2005, we supplemented
          our
          discount rate decision with a yield curve analysis. The yield curve was
          applied
          to expected future retirement plan payments to adjust the discount rate
          to
          reflect the cash flow characteristics of the plans. The yield curve is
          a
          hypothetical double A yield curve represented by a series of annualized
          discount
          rates reflecting bond issues having a rating of Aa or better by Moody’s
          Investors Service, Inc. or a rating of AA or better by Standard &
Poor’s.

          information on our pension and postretirement benefit obligations is included

RESULTS
          OF OPERATIONS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT

CNA
          Financial

Insurance
          operations are conducted by subsidiaries of CNA Financial Corporation (“CNA”).
          CNA is an 89% owned subsidiary.

CNA
          manages its property and casualty operations in two operating segments
          which
          represent CNA’s core operations: Standard Lines and Specialty Lines. The
          non-core operations are managed in the Life and Group Non-Core and Other
          Insurance segments. Standard Lines includes standard property and casualty
          coverages sold to small and middle market commercial businesses primarily
          through an independent agency distribution system, and excess and surplus
          lines,
          as well as insurance and risk management products sold to large corporations
          in
          the U.S., as well as globally. Specialty Lines includes professional, financial
          and specialty property and casualty products and services. Life and Group
          Non-Core primarily includes the results of the life and group lines of
          business
          sold or placed in run-off. Other Insurance includes the results of certain
          property and casualty lines of business placed in run-off, including CNA’s
          former assumed reinsurance business. This segment also includes the results
          related to the centralized adjusting and settlement of Asbestos, Environment
          Pollution and Mass Tort (“APMT”) claims as well as the results of CNA’s
          participation in voluntary insurance pools, which are primarily in run-off,
          and
          various other non-insurance operations.

Reserves
          - Estimates and Uncertainties

CNA
          maintains reserves to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for
          claim
          and claim adjustment expenses, including the estimated cost of the claims
          adjudication process, for claims that have been reported but not yet settled
          (“case reserves”) and claims that have been incurred but not reported (“IBNR”).
          Claim and claim adjustment expense reserves are reflected as liabilities
          and are
          included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets under the heading “Insurance
          Reserves.” Adjustments to prior year reserve estimates, if necessary, are
          reflected in the results of operations in the period that the need for
          such
          adjustments is determined. The carried case and IBNR reserves are provided
          in
          the Segment Results section of this MD&A and in Note 9 of the Notes to
          Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

The
          level
          of reserves CNA maintains represents its best estimate, as of a particular
          point
          in time, of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will
          cost
          based on its assessment of facts and circumstances known at that time.
          Reserves
          are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex estimates
          that
          CNA derives, generally utilizing a variety of actuarial reserve estimation
          techniques, from numerous assumptions and expectations about future events,
          both
          internal and external, many of which are highly uncertain.

CNA’s
          experience has been that establishing reserves for casualty coverages relating
          to asbestos, environmental pollution and mass tort (“APMT”) claim and claim
          adjustment expenses is subject to uncertainties that are greater than those
          presented by other claims. Estimating the ultimate cost of both reported
          and
          unreported APMT claims is subject to a higher degree of variability due
          to a
          number of additional factors, including among others:

·

coverage
                    issues, including whether certain costs are covered under the
                    policies and
                    whether policy limits apply;

CNA’s
                    ability to recover reinsurance for APMT
                    claims.

It
          is
          also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment
          and the impact on the future development of APMT claims. This development
          will
          be affected by future court decisions and interpretations, as well as changes
          in
          applicable legislation. It is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome
          of large
          coverage disputes until settlement negotiations near completion and significant
          legal questions are resolved or, failing settlement, until the dispute
          is
          adjudicated. This is particularly the case with policyholders in bankruptcy
          where negotiations often involve a large number of claimants and other
          parties
          and require court approval to be effective. A further uncertainty exists
          as to
          whether a national privately financed trust to replace litigation of asbestos
          claims with payments to claimants from the trust will be established and
          approved through federal legislation, and, if established and approved,
          whether
          it will contain funding requirements in excess of CNA’s carried loss
          reserves.

Traditional
          actuarial methods and techniques employed to estimate the ultimate cost
          of
          claims for more traditional property and casualty exposures are less precise
          in
          estimating claim and claim adjustment reserves for APMT, particularly in
          an
          environment of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise
          from
          industry practices and legal, judicial and social conditions. Therefore,
          these
          traditional actuarial methods and techniques are necessarily supplemented
          with
          additional estimation techniques and methodologies, many of which involve
          significant judgments that are required of CNA management. For APMT, CNA
          regularly monitors its exposures, including reviews of loss activity, regulatory
          developments and court rulings. In addition, CNA performs a comprehensive
          ground-up analysis on its exposures annually. CNA’s actuaries, in conjunction
          with its specialized claim unit, use various modeling techniques to estimate
          its
          overall exposure to known accounts. CNA uses this information and additional
          modeling techniques to develop loss distributions and claim reporting patterns
          to determine reserves for accounts that will report APMT exposure in the
          future.
          Estimating the average claim size requires analysis of the impact of large
          losses and claim cost trend based on changes in the cost of repairing or
          replacing property, changes in the cost of legal fees, judicial decisions,
          legislative changes, and other factors. Due to the inherent uncertainties
          in
          estimating reserves for APMT claim and claim adjustment expenses and the
          degree
          of variability due to, among other things, the factors described above,
          CNA may
          be required to record material changes in its claim and claim adjustment
          expense
          reserves in the future, should new information become available or other
          developments emerge. See the APMT Reserves section of this MD&A and Note 9
          of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8
          for
          additional information relating to APMT claims and reserves.

In
          addition, CNA is subject to the uncertain effects of emerging or potential
          claims and coverage issues that arise as industry practices and legal,
          judicial,
          social and other environmental conditions change. These issues have had,
          and may
          continue to have, a negative effect on CNA’s business by either extending
          coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number
          or
          size of claims. Examples of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues
          include:

·

increases
                    in the number and size of claims relating to injuries from medical
                    products;

·

the
                    effects of accounting and financial reporting scandals and other
                    major
                    corporate governance failures, which have resulted in an increase
                    in the
                    number and size of claims, including director and officer and
                    errors and
                    omissions insurance claims;

The
          impact of these and other unforeseen emerging or potential claims and coverage
          issues is difficult to predict and could materially adversely affect the
          adequacy of CNA’s claim and claim adjustment expense reserves and could lead to
          future reserve additions. See the Segment Results sections of this MD&A and
          Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under
          Item 8
          for a discussion of changes in reserve estimates and the impact on our
          results
          of operations.

Establishing
          Reserve Estimates

In
          developing claim and claim adjustment expense (“loss” or “losses”) reserve
          estimates, CNA’s actuaries perform detailed reserve analyses that are staggered
          throughout the year. The data is organized at a “product” level. A product can
          be a line of business covering a subset of insureds such as commercial
          automobile liability for small and middle market customers, it can encompass
          several lines of business provided to a specific set of customers such
          as
          dentists, or it can be a particular type of claim such as construction
          defect.
          Every product is analyzed at least once during the year, and many products
          are
          analyzed multiple times. The analyses generally review losses gross of
          ceded
          reinsurance and apply the ceded reinsurance terms to the gross estimates
          to
          establish estimates net of reinsurance. In addition to the detailed analyses,
          CNA reviews actual loss emergence for all products each quarter.

The
          detailed analyses use a variety of generally accepted actuarial methods
          and
          techniques to produce a number of estimates of ultimate loss. CNA determines
          a
          point estimate of ultimate loss by reviewing the various estimates and
          assigning
          weight to each estimate given the characteristics of the product being
          reviewed.
          The reserve estimate is the difference between the estimated ultimate loss
          and
          the losses paid to date. The difference between the estimated ultimate
          loss and
          the case incurred loss (paid loss plus case reserve) is IBNR. IBNR calculated
          as
          such includes a provision for development on known cases (supplemental
          development) as well as a provision for claims that have occurred but have
          not
          yet been reported (pure IBNR).

Most
          of
          CNA’s business can be characterized as long-tail. For long tail business, it
          will generally be several years between the time the business is written
          and the
          time when all claims are settled. CNA’s long-tail exposures include commercial
          automobile liability, workers’ compensation, general liability, medical
          malpractice, other professional liability coverages, assumed reinsurance
          run-off
          and products liability. Short-tail exposures include property, commercial
          automobile physical damage, marine and warranty. Each of CNA’s property/casualty
          segments, Standard Lines, Specialty Lines and Other Insurance, contain
          both
          long-tail and short-tail exposures.

The
          methods used to project ultimate loss for both long-tail and short-tail
          exposures include, but are not limited to, the following:

·

Paid
                    Development,

·

Incurred
                    Development,

                    of Operations

Results
                    of Operations - CNA Financial -
                    (Continued)

The
          paid
          development method estimates ultimate losses by reviewing paid loss patterns
          and
          applying them to accident years with further expected changes in paid loss.
          Selection of the paid loss pattern requires analysis of several factors
          including the impact of inflation on claims costs, the rate at which claims
          professionals make claim payments and close claims, the impact of judicial
          decisions, the impact of underwriting changes, the impact of large claim
          payments and other factors. Claim cost inflation itself requires evaluation
          of
          changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property, changes in the
          cost of
          medical care, changes in the cost of wage replacement, judicial decisions,
          legislative changes and other factors. Because this method assumes that
          losses
          are paid at a consistent rate, changes in any of these factors can impact
          the
          results. Since the method does not rely on case reserves, it is not directly
          influenced by changes in the adequacy of case reserves.

For
          many
          products, paid loss data for recent periods may be too immature or erratic
          for
          accurate predictions. This situation often exists for long-tail exposures.
          In
          addition, changes in the factors described above may result in inconsistent
          payment patterns. Finally, estimating the paid loss pattern subsequent
          to the
          most mature point available in the data analyzed often involves considerable
          uncertainty for long-tail products such as workers’ compensation.

The
          incurred development method is similar to the paid development method,
          but it
          uses case incurred losses instead of paid losses. Since the method uses
          more
          data (case reserves in addition to paid losses) than the paid development
          method, the incurred development patterns may be less variable than paid
          patterns. However, selection of the incurred loss pattern requires analysis
          of
          all of the factors above. In addition, the inclusion of case reserves can
          lead
          to distortions if changes in case reserving practices have taken place,
          and the
          use of case incurred losses may not eliminate the issues associated with
          estimating the incurred loss pattern subsequent to the most mature point
          available.

The
          loss
          ratio method multiplies premiums by an expected loss ratio to produce ultimate
          loss estimates for each accident year. This method may be useful if loss
          development patterns are inconsistent, losses emerge very slowly, or there
          is
          relatively little loss history from which to estimate future losses. The
          selection of the expected loss ratio requires analysis of loss ratios from
          earlier accident years or pricing studies and analysis of inflationary
          trends,
          frequency trends, rate changes, underwriting changes, and other applicable
          factors.

The
          Bornhuetter-Ferguson using premiums and paid loss method is a combination
          of the
          paid development approach and the loss ratio approach. The method normally
          determines expected loss ratios similar to the approach used to estimate
          the
          expected loss ratio for the loss ratio method and requires analysis of
          the same
          factors described above. The method assumes that only future losses will
          develop
          at the expected loss ratio level. The percent of paid loss to ultimate
          loss
          implied from the paid development method is used to determine what percentage
          of
          ultimate loss is yet to be paid. The use of the pattern from the paid
          development method requires consideration of all factors listed in the
          description of the paid development method. The estimate of losses yet
          to be
          paid is added to current paid losses to estimate the ultimate loss for
          each
          year. This method will react very slowly if actual ultimate loss ratios
          are
          different from expectations due to changes not accounted for by the expected
          loss ratio calculation.

The
          Bornhuetter-Ferguson using premiums and incurred loss method is similar
          to the
          Bornhuetter-Ferguson using premiums and paid loss method except that it
          uses
          case incurred losses. The use of case incurred losses instead of paid losses
          can
          result in development patterns that are less variable than paid patterns.
          However, the inclusion of case reserves can lead to distortions if changes
          in
          case reserving have taken place, and the method requires analysis of all
          the
          factors that need to be reviewed for the loss ratio and incurred development
          methods.

The
          average loss method multiplies a projected number of ultimate claims by
          an
          estimated ultimate average loss for each accident year to produce ultimate
          loss
          estimates. Since projections of the ultimate number of claims are often
          less
          variable than projections of ultimate loss, this method can provide more
          reliable results for products where loss development patterns are inconsistent
          or too variable to be relied on exclusively. In addition, this method can
          more
          directly account for changes in coverage that impact the number and size
          of
          claims. However, this method can be difficult to apply to situations where
          very
          large claims or a substantial number of unusual claims result in volatile
          average claim sizes. Projecting the ultimate number of claims requires
          analysis
          of several factors including the rate at which policyholders report claims
          to
          us, the impact of judicial decisions, the impact of underwriting changes
          and
          other factors. Estimating the ultimate average loss requires analysis of
          the
          impact of large losses and claim cost trend based on changes in the cost
          of
          repairing or replacing property, changes in the cost of medical care, changes
          in
          the cost of wage replacement, judicial decisions, legislative changes and
          other
          factors.

For
          other
          more complex products where the above methods may not produce reliable
          indications, CNA uses additional methods tailored to the characteristics
          of the
          specific situation. Such products include construction defect losses and
          APMT.

For
          construction defect losses, CNA’s actuaries organize losses by report year.
          Report year groups claims by the year in which they were reported. To estimate
          losses from claims that have not been reported, various extrapolation techniques
          are applied to the pattern of claims that have been reported to estimate
          the
          number of claims yet to be reported. This process requires analysis of
          several
          factors including the rate at which policyholders report claims to CNA,
          the
          impact of judicial decisions, the impact of underwriting changes and other
          factors. An average claim size is determined from past experience and applied
          to
          the number of unreported claims to estimate reserves for these
          claims.

For
          many
          exposures, especially those that can be considered long-tail, a particular
          accident year may not have a sufficient volume of paid losses to produce
          a
          statistically reliable estimate of ultimate losses. In such a case, CNA’s
          actuaries typically assign more weight to the incurred development method
          than
          to the paid development method. As claims continue to settle and the volume
          of
          paid loss increases, the actuaries may assign additional weight to the
          paid
          development method. For most of CNA’s products, even the incurred losses for
          accident years that are early in the claim settlement process will not
          be of
          sufficient volume to produce a reliable estimate of ultimate losses. In
          these
          cases, CNA will not assign any weight to the paid and incurred development
          methods. CNA will use loss ratio, Bornhuetter-Ferguson and average loss
          methods.
          For short-tail exposures, the paid and incurred development methods can
          often be
          relied on sooner primarily because our history includes a sufficient number
          of
          years to cover the entire period over which paid and incurred losses are
          expected to change. However, CNA may also use loss ratio, Bornhuetter-Ferguson
          and average loss methods for short-tail exposures.

          reserve analyses performed by CNA’s actuaries result in point estimates. Each
          quarter, the results of the detailed reserve reviews are summarized and
          discussed with CNA senior management to determine the best estimate of
          reserves.
          This group considers many factors in making this decision. The factors
          include,
          but are not limited to, the historical pattern and volatility of the actuarial
          indications, the sensitivity of the actuarial indications to changes in
          paid and
          incurred loss patterns, the consistency of claims handling processes, the
          consistency of case reserving practices, changes in our pricing and
          underwriting, and overall pricing and underwriting trends in the insurance
          market.

CNA’s
          recorded reserves reflect its best estimate as of a particular point in
          time
          based upon known facts, current law and our judgment. The carried reserve
          may
          differ from the actuarial point estimate as the result of CNA’s consideration of
          the factors noted above as well as the potential volatility of the projections
          associated with the specific product being analyzed and other factors impacting
          claims costs that may not be quantifiable through actuarial analysis. This
          process results in CNA management’s best estimate which is then recorded as the
          loss reserve.

Currently,
          CNA’s reserves are slightly higher than the actuarial point estimate. CNA does
          not establish a specific provision for uncertainty. For Standard and Specialty
          Lines, the difference between CNA’s reserves and the actuarial point estimate is
          due to the two most recent complete accident years. The claim data from
          these
          accident years is very immature. CNA believes it is prudent to wait until
          actual
          experience confirms that the loss reserves should be adjusted. For Other
          Insurance, the carried reserve is slightly higher than the actuarial point
          estimate. While the actuarial estimates for APMT exposures reflect current
          knowledge, CNA feels it is prudent, based on the history of developments
          in this
          area, to reflect some margin in the carried reserve until the ultimate
          outcome
          of the issues associated with these exposures is clearer.

The
          key
          assumptions fundamental to the reserving process are often different for
          various
          products and accident years. Some of these assumptions are explicit assumptions
          that are required of a particular method, but most of the assumptions are
          implicit and cannot be precisely quantified. An example of an explicit
          assumption is the pattern employed in the paid development method. However,
          the
          assumed pattern is itself based on several implicit assumptions such as
          the
          impact of inflation on medical costs and the rate at which claim professionals
          close claims. As a result, the effect on reserve estimates of a particular
          change in assumptions usually cannot be specifically quantified, and changes
          in
          these assumptions cannot be tracked over time.

                    of Operations

CNA’s
          recorded reserves are CNA management’s best estimate. In order to provide an
          indication of the variability associated with CNA’s net reserves, the following
          discussion provides a sensitivity analysis that shows the approximate estimated
          impact of variations in the most significant factor affecting CNA’s reserve
          estimates for particular types of business. These significant factors are
          the
          ones that could most likely materially impact the reserves. This discussion
          covers the major types of business for which CNA believes a material deviation
          to CNA's reserves is reasonably possible. There can be no assurance that
          actual experience will be consistent with the current assumptions or with
          the
          variation indicated by the discussion. In addition, there can be no assurance
          that other factors and assumptions will not have a material impact on CNA’s
          reserves.

Within
          Standard Lines, the two types of business for which CNA believes a material
          deviation to its net reserves is reasonably possible are workers’ compensation
          and general liability.

For
          Standard Lines workers’ compensation, since many years will pass from the time
          the business is written until all claim payments have been made, claim
          cost
          inflation on claim payments is the most significant factor affecting workers’
compensation reserve estimates. Workers’ compensation claim cost inflation is
          driven by the cost of medical care, the cost of wage replacement, expected
          claimant lifetimes, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors.
          If estimated workers’ compensation claim cost inflation increases by one point
          for the entire period over which claim payments will be made, CNA estimates
          that
          its net reserves would increase by approximately $500.0 million. If estimated
          workers’ compensation claim cost inflation decreases by one point for the entire
          period over which claim payments will be made, CNA estimates that its net
          reserves would decrease by approximately $450.0 million. CNA’s net reserves for
          Standard Lines workers’ compensation were approximately $4.4 billion at December
          31, 2006.

For
          Standard Lines general liability, the predominant method used for estimating
          reserves is the incurred development method. Changes in the cost to repair
          or
          replace property, the cost of medical care, the cost of wage replacement,
          judicial decisions, legislation and other factors all impact the pattern
          selected in this method. The pattern selected results in the incurred
          development factor that estimates future changes in case incurred loss.
          If the
          estimated incurred development factor for general liability increases by
          15.0%,
          CNA estimates that its net reserves would increase by approximately $370.0
          million. If the estimated incurred development factor for general liability
          decreases by 13.0%, CNA estimates that its net reserves would decrease
          by
          approximately $320.0 million. CNA’s net reserves for Standard Lines general
          liability were approximately $4.0 billion at December 31, 2006.

Within
          Specialty Lines, CNA believes a material deviation to its net reserves
          is
          reasonably possible for the US Specialty Lines group. This group provides
          professional liability coverages to various professional firms, including
          architects, realtors, small and mid-sized accounting firms, law firms and
          technology firms. US Specialty Lines also provide D&O, employment practices,
          fiduciary and fidelity coverages. US Specialty Lines also offers insurance
          products to serve the healthcare delivery system. The most significant
          factor
          affecting US Specialty Lines reserve estimates is claim severity. Claim
          severity
          for US Specialty Lines is driven by the cost of medical care, the cost
          of wage
          replacement, legal fees, judicial decisions, legislation and other factors.
          Underwriting and claim handling decisions such as the classes of business
          written and individual claim settlement decisions can also impact claim
          severity. If the estimated claim severity for US Specialty Lines increases
          by
          7.0%, CNA estimates that US Specialty Lines net reserves would increase
          by
          approximately $270.0 million. If the estimated claim severity for US Specialty
          Lines decreases by 3.0%, CNA estimates that US Specialty Lines net reserves
          would decrease by approximately $110.0 million. CNA’s net reserves for US
          Specialty Lines were approximately $3.9 billion at December 31,
          2006.

Within
          Other Insurance, the two types of business for which CNA believes a material
          deviation to its net reserves is reasonably possible are CNA Re and
          APMT.

For
          CNA
          Re, the predominant method used for estimating reserves is the incurred
          development method. Changes in the cost to repair or replace property,
          the cost
          of medical care, the cost of wage replacement, the rate at which ceding
          companies report claims, judicial decisions, legislation and other factors
          all
          impact the incurred development pattern for CNA Re. The pattern selected
          results
          in the incurred development factor that estimates future changes in case
          incurred loss. If the estimated incurred development factor for CNA Re
          increases
          by 21.0%, CNA estimates that its net reserves for CNA Re would increase
          by
          approximately $150.0 million. If the estimated incurred development factor
          for
          CNA Re decreases by 21.0%, CNA estimates that it’s net reserves would decrease
          by approximately $150.0 million. CNA net reserves for CNA Re were approximately
          $1.2 billion at December 31, 2006.


Item
                    7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
                    of Operations

Results
                    of Operations - CNA Financial -
                    (Continued)

For
          APMT,
          the most significant factor affecting reserve estimates is overall account
          size
          trend. Overall account size trend for APMT reflects the combined impact
          of
          economic trends (inflation), changes in the types of defendants involved,
          the
          expected mix of asbestos disease types, judicial decisions, legislation
          and
          other factors. If the estimated overall account size trend for APMT increases
          by
          4 points, CNA estimates that its APMT net reserves would increase by
          approximately $700.0 million. If the estimated overall account size trend
          for
          APMT decreases by 4 points, CNA estimates that its APMT net reserves would
          decrease by approximately $400.0 million. CNA’s net reserves for APMT were
          approximately $1.9 billion at December 31, 2006.

Given
          the
          factors described above, it is not possible to quantify precisely the ultimate
          exposure represented by claims and related litigation. As a result, CNA
          regularly reviews the adequacy of its reserves and reassesses its reserve
          estimates as historical loss experience develops, additional claims are
          reported
          and settled and additional information becomes available in subsequent
          periods.

In
          light
          of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and
          making
          the assumptions necessary to establish reserve levels, CNA reviews its
          reserve
          estimates on a regular basis and make adjustments in the period that the
          need
          for such adjustments is determined. These reviews have resulted in CNA’s
          identification of information and trends that have caused CNA to increase
          its
          reserves in prior periods and could lead to the identification of a need
          for
          additional material increases in claim and claim adjustment expense reserves,
          which could materially adversely affect CNA’s business and insurer financial
          strength and debt ratings and our results of operations and equity. See
          the
          Ratings section of this MD&A for further information regarding our financial
          strength and debt ratings.

Reinsurance

Due
          to
          significant catastrophes during 2005, the cost of CNA’s catastrophe reinsurance
          program has increased. CNA’s catastrophe reinsurance protection cost CNA
          premiums of approximately $64.0 million in 2005, including reinstatement
          premiums and cost approximately $79.0 million in 2006, which did not include
          any
          reinstatement premiums. During 2007, CNA’s catastrophe reinsurance program will
          cost $89.0 million before the impact of any reinstatement premiums.

The
          terms
          of CNA’s 2007 catastrophe programs are different than those of its 2006
          programs. The Corporate Property Catastrophe treaty provides coverage for
          the
          accumulation of losses between $300.0 million and $1.0 billion arising
          out of a
          single catastrophe occurrence in the United States, its territories and
          possessions, and Canada. CNA’s co-participation is 50.0% of the first $100.0
          million layer and 10.0% of the remaining layer. In addition, CNA previously
          purchased an aggregate property catastrophe treaty to obtain reinsurance
          protection against the aggregation of losses from multiple catastrophic
          events.
          CNA did not purchase an aggregate property catastrophe treaty for
          2007.

In
          certain circumstances, including significant deterioration of a reinsurer’s
          financial strength ratings, CNA may engage in commutation discussions with
          individual reinsurers. The outcome of such discussions may result in a lump sum
          settlement that is less than the recorded receivable, net of any applicable
          allowance for doubtful accounts. Losses arising from commutations could
          have an
          adverse material impact on our results of operations or equity.

In
          2001,
          CNA entered into a one-year corporate aggregate reinsurance treaty related
          to
          the 2001 accident year covering substantially all property and casualty
          lines of
          business in the Continental Casualty Company pool (the “CCC Cover”). The CCC
          Cover was fully utilized in 2003. In 2006, CNA commuted its CCC Cover.
          This
          commutation had no impact on the Consolidated Statements of Income for
          the year
          ended December 31, 2006.

Also
          in
          2006, CNA commuted several reinsurance treaties, including several finite
          treaties, with a European reinsurance group. This commutation resulted
          in a
          pretax loss, net of allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, of $48.0 million.
          CNA received $35.0 million of cash in connection with this significant
          commutation.

As
          of
          December 31, 2006 and 2005, there were one and thirteen ceded reinsurance
          treaties inforce, respectively, that CNA considers to be finite reinsurance.
          In
          2003, CNA discontinued purchases of such contracts. The remaining treaty
          at
          December 31, 2006 provides reinsurance protection for the 1999 accident
          year on
          specified portions of CNA’s domestic property and casualty business and is fully
          utilized. Therefore, CNA does not expect to cede any additional losses
          under
          finite reinsurance contracts in future periods nor incur interest
          costs.

Terrorism
          Insurance

CNA
          and
          the insurance industry incurred substantial losses related to the 2001
          World
          Trade Center event. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (“TRIA”)
          established a program within the Department of the Treasury under which
          insurers
          are required to offer terrorism insurance and the federal government will
          share
          the risk of loss by commercial property and casualty insurers arising from
          future terrorist attacks. Although TRIA expired on December 31, 2005, the
          Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005 (“TRIEA”) extended this program
          through December 31, 2007 with changes such as the lines of business covered,
          the deductible amount that must be paid by the insurance company and the
          aggregate industry loss prior to federal government assistance becoming
          available.

While
          TRIEA provides the property and casualty industry with an increased ability
          to
          withstand the effect of a terrorist event through 2007, given the
          unpredictability of the nature, targets, severity or frequency of potential
          terrorist events, our results of operations or equity could nevertheless
          be
          materially adversely impacted by them. CNA is attempting to mitigate this
          exposure through its underwriting practices, as well as policy terms and
          conditions (where applicable). Under the laws of certain states, CNA is
          generally prohibited from excluding terrorism exposure from its primary
          workers’
compensation policies. Further, in those states that mandate property insurance
          coverage of damage from fire following a loss, CNA is prohibited from excluding
          terrorism exposure.

Over
          the
          past several years, CNA has been underwriting its business to manage its
          terrorism exposure through strict underwriting standards, risk avoidance
          measures and conditional terrorism exclusions where permitted by law. There
          is
          substantial uncertainty as to CNA’s ability to effectively contain its terrorism
          exposure since, notwithstanding the efforts described above, CNA continues
          to
          issue forms of coverage, in particular, workers’ compensation, that are exposed
          to risk of loss from a terrorism event.

Restructuring

In
          2001,
          CNA finalized and approved a plan related to restructuring the property
          and
          casualty segments and Life and Group Non-Core segment, discontinuation
          of the
          variable life and annuity business and consolidation of real estate locations.
          During 2006, CNA reevaluated the sufficiency of the remaining accrual,
          which
          related to lease termination costs, and determined that the liability is
          no
          longer required as CNA has completed its lease obligations. As a result,
          the
          excess remaining accrual was released in 2006, resulting in income of $7.3
          million after-tax and minority interest for the year ended December 31,
          2006.

Further
          information on the restructuring plan is included in Note 15 of the Notes
          to
          Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

Segment
          Results

The
          following discusses the results of operations for CNA’s operating segments. CNA
          utilizes the net operating income financial measure to monitor its operations.
          Net operating income is calculated by excluding from net income the after-tax
          and minority interest effects of (1) net realized investment gains or losses,
          (2) income or loss from discontinued operations, and (3) cumulative effects
          of
          changes in accounting principles. In evaluating the results of the Standard
          Lines and Specialty Lines, CNA management utilizes the combined ratio,
          the loss
          ratio, the expense ratio and the dividend ratio. These ratios are calculated
          using GAAP financial results. The loss ratio is the percentage of net incurred
          claim and claim adjustment expenses to net earned premiums. The expense
          ratio is
          the percentage of insurance underwriting and acquisition expenses, including
          the
          amortization of deferred acquisition costs, to net earned premiums. The
          dividend
          ratio is the ratio of policyholders’ dividends incurred to net earned premiums.
          The combined ratio is the sum of the loss, expense and dividend
          ratios.

          and retention in the Property lines of business. Net earned premiums increased
          $3.0 million in 2006 as compared with 2005. Net earned premiums were impacted
          by
          decreased favorable premium development in 2006 as compared to 2005, as
          discussed below. CNA continues to focus on portfolio optimization.

Standard
          Lines averaged flat rates for 2006, as compared to average rate decreases
          of
          1.0% for 2005 for the contracts that renewed during those periods. Retention
          rates of 81.0% and 77.0% were achieved for those contracts that were up
          for
          renewal in each period.

Net
          results increased $635.1 million in 2006 as compared with 2005. This increase
          was attributable to increases in net operating results and net realized
          investment gains. See the Investments section of this MD&A for further
          discussion of net investment income and net realized investment
          gains.

Net
          operating results increased $595.6 million in 2006 as compared with 2005.
          This
          increase was primarily driven by significantly reduced catastrophe losses
          in
          2006, an increase in net investment income and a decrease in unfavorable
          net
          prior year development as discussed below.

The
          net operating results included catastrophe impacts of $28.0 million after-tax
          and minority interest. The 2005 net operating results included catastrophe
          impacts of $290.3 million after-tax and minority interest related to Hurricanes
          Katrina, Wilma, Rita, Dennis and Ophelia, net of reinsurance
          recoveries.

The
          combined ratio improved 18.7 points in 2006 as compared with 2005. The
          loss
          ratio improved 17.4 points due to decreased unfavorable net prior year
          development as discussed below and decreased catastrophe losses in 2006.
          The
          2006 and 2005 loss ratios included 1.3 and 11.1 points related to the impact
          of
          catastrophes.

The
          expense ratio improved 1.3 points in 2006 as compared with 2005. This
          improvement was primarily due to a decrease in the provision for insurance
          bad
          debt. In addition, the 2005 ratio included increased ceded commissions
          as a
          result of an unfavorable arbitration ruling related to two reinsurance
          treaties.
          Changes in estimates for premium taxes partially offset these favorable
          impacts.

Unfavorable
          net prior year development of $69.0 million was recorded in 2006, including
          $157.0 million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense
          reserve development and $88.0 million of favorable premium development.
          Unfavorable net prior year development of $452.0 million, including $559.0
          million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
          development and $107.0 million of favorable premium development,

          Development for 2006 and 2005 is included in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated
          Financial Statements included under Item 8.

During
          2006 and 2005, CNA commuted several significant reinsurance contracts that
          resulted in unfavorable development of $110.0 million and $285.0 million,
          which
          is included in the development above, and which was partially offset by
          the
          release of previously established allowance for uncollectible reinsurance.
          These
          commutations resulted in an unfavorable after-tax and minority interest
          impact
          of $28.0 million and $157.9 million in 2006 and 2005. Several of the commuted
          contracts contained interest crediting provisions. The interest charges
          associated with the reinsurance contracts commuted were $8.1 million and
          $31.9
          million after-tax and minority interest in 2006 and 2005. The 2005 amount
          includes the interest charges associated with the contract commuted in
          2006.
          There will be no further interest crediting charges related to these commuted
          contracts in future periods.

The
          following table summarizes the gross and net carried reserves as of December
          31,

          Compared with 2004

Net
          written premiums for Standard Lines decreased $200.0 million in 2005 as
          compared
          with 2004. This decrease was primarily driven by decreased premium writings
          in
          our casualty lines of business, increased reinstatement premium in 2005
          related
          to catastrophe losses and decreased rates as discussed further below. Net
          earned
          premiums decreased $507.0 million in 2005 as compared with 2004. This decrease
          was primarily driven by the decline in premiums written. The lower premium
          is
          consistent with CNA’s strategy of portfolio optimization. CNA’s priority is a
          diversified portfolio in profitable classes of business.

Standard
          Lines averaged rate decreases of 1.0% for 2005, as compared to average
          rate
          increases of 4.0% for 2004 for the contracts that renewed during those
          periods.
          Retention rates of 77.0% and 70.0% were achieved for those contracts that
          were
          up for renewal in each period.

Net
          results decreased $356.6 million in 2005 as compared with 2004. This decrease
          was attributable to declines in both net operating results and net realized
          investment results. See the Investments section of this MD&A for further
          discussion of net investment income and net realized investment
          results.

Net
          operating results decreased $238.9 million in 2005 as compared with 2004.
          This
          decrease was due primarily to increased unfavorable net prior year development
          of $257.3 million after-tax and minority interest including $168.8 million
          after-tax and minority interest related to significant commutations in
          2005, a
          $123.2 million after-tax and minority interest increase in catastrophe
          losses,
          the decreased earned premium as discussed above and decreased current accident
          year results. These unfavorable items were partially offset by a $271.1
          million
          increase in net investment income and a decrease in the provision for insurance
          bad debt.

Unfavorable
          net prior year development of $452.0 million was recorded in 2005, including
          $559.0 million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense
          reserve development and $107.0 million of favorable premium development.
          Unfavorable net prior year development of $18.0 million, including $115.0

          Development for 2005 and 2004 is included in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated
          Financial Statements included under Item 8.

During
          2005 and 2004, CNA commuted several significant reinsurance contracts that
          resulted in unfavorable development of $285.0 million and $5.0 million,
          which is
          included in the development above, and which was partially offset by the
          release
          of previously established allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. These
          commutations resulted in an unfavorable impact of $157.9 million after-tax
          and
          minority interest and favorable impact of $3.7 million after-tax and minority
          interest in 2005 and 2004. These contracts contained interest crediting
          provisions. The interest charges associated with the reinsurance contracts
          commuted were $42.0 million and $110.0 million in 2005 and 2004. There
          will be
          no further interest crediting charges related to these commuted contracts
          in
          future periods.

The
          impact of catastrophes was $290.3 million and $167.0 million after-tax
          and
          minority interest for 2005 and 2004, net of anticipated reinsurance recoveries.

The
          combined ratio increased 14.7 points in 2005 as compared with 2004. The
          loss
          ratio increased 16.7 points in 2005 as compared with 2004. These increases
          were
          primarily due to increased net prior year development, increased catastrophe
          losses and decreased current accident year results. Catastrophe losses
          of $470.0
          million and $260.0 million were recorded in 2005 and 2004.

The
          expense ratio improved 2.2 points in 2005 as compared with 2004. This
          improvement was primarily due to a decrease in the provision for insurance
          bad
          debt.

The
          dividend ratio increased 0.2 points in 2005 as compared with 2004. The
          ratio was impacted by favorable dividend development, partially offset
          by
          decreased participation in dividend plans and lower dividend amounts related
          to
          the current accident year.

Net
          income increased $118.1 million in 2006 as compared with 2005. This increase
          was
          attributable to increases in net operating income and realized investment
          gains.
          See the Investments section of this MD&A for further discussion of net
          investment income and net realized investment results.

Net
          operating income increased $112.6 million in 2006 as compared with 2005.
          This
          improvement was primarily driven by an increase in net investment income,
          a
          decrease in net prior year development as discussed below and reduced
          catastrophe impacts in 2006. Catastrophe impacts were $0.9 million after-tax
          and
          minority interest for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to
          $14.6
          million after-tax and minority interest for the year ended December 31,
          2005.
          Also, the 2005 results included a $53.9 million loss, after taxes and minority
          interests, in the surety line of business related to a large national
          contractor. Further information related to the large national contractor
          is
          included in Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included
          under Item 8.

The
          combined ratio improved 4.2 points in 2006 as compared with 2005. The loss
          ratio
          improved 4.8 points, due to improved current accident year impacts and
          decreased
          net prior year development as discussed below. The 2005 loss ratio was
          unfavorably impacted by surety losses of $110.0 million, before taxes and
          minority interest, related to a national contractor as discussed above.
          Partially offsetting this favorable impact was less favorable current accident
          year loss ratios across several other lines of business in 2006.

Unfavorable
          net prior year development of $15.0 million was recorded in 2006, including
          $10.0 million of favorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense
          reserve
          development and $25.0 million of unfavorable premium development. Unfavorable
          net prior year development of $54.0 million, including $47.0 million of
          unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development
          and
          $7.0 million of unfavorable premium development, was recorded in 2005.

Net
          written premiums for Specialty Lines increased $72.0 million in 2005 as
          compared
          with 2004. This increase was primarily due to improved retention across
          most
          professional liability insurance lines of business. These favorable impacts
          were
          partially offset by increased ceded premiums for certain professional liability
          lines of business and decreased premiums for the warranty business. Due
          to a
          change in 2005 in the warranty product offering, fees related to the new
          warranty product are included within other revenues. Written premiums for
          the
          warranty line of business decreased $70.0 million in 2005 as compared to
          2004.
          Net earned premiums increased $198.0 million in 2005 as compared with 2004,
          which reflects the increased premium written trend over several prior quarters
          in Specialty Lines.

Specialty
          Lines averaged rate increases of 1.0% and 9.0% in 2005 and 2004 for the
          contracts that renewed during those periods. Retention rates of 86.0% and
          83.0%
          were achieved for those contracts that were up for renewal in each
          period.

Net
          income decreased $27.5 million in 2005 as compared with 2004. This decrease
          was
          due primarily to a $38.9 million decrease in net realized investment gains
          partially offset by increased net operating income. See the Investments
          section
          of this MD&A for further discussion of net investment income and net
          realized investment results.

Net
          operating income increased $11.4 million in 2005 as compared with 2004.
          This
          increase was primarily driven by an increase in net investment income and
          increased earned premiums. These increases to operating income were partially
          offset by decreased current accident year results. Additionally, 2004 results
          were favorably impacted by the release of a previously established reinsurance
          bad debt allowance as the result of a significant commutation. Catastrophe
          impacts were $14.6 million and $10.0 million after-tax and minority interest
          for
          the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004.

The
          combined ratio increased 2.0 points in 2005 as compared with 2004. The
          loss
          ratio increased 2.0 points. The 2004 loss ratio was favorably impacted
          by the
          release of reinsurance bad debt reserve as discussed above. Additionally,
          the
          2005 loss ratio was unfavorably impacted by increased current year accident
          losses. This was driven by increased surety losses of $110.0 million related
          to
          a national contractor, before taxes and minority interest, as discussed
          in
          further detail in Note 21 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included
          under Item 8, partially offset by improved current accident year loss ratios
          in
          several professional liability lines of business.

Unfavorable
          net prior year development of $54.0 million was recorded in 2005, including
          $47.0 million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense
          reserve development and $7.0 million of unfavorable premium development.
          Unfavorable net prior year development of $30.0 million, including $58.0
          million
          of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development
          and $28.0 million of favorable premium development, was recorded in 2004.
          Further information on Specialty Lines Net Prior Year Development for 2005
          and
          2004 is included in Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included
          under Item 8.

The
          expense ratio was the same in 2005 as compared with 2004. The 2005 ratio
          was
          impacted by a change in estimate related to profit commissions in the warranty
          line of business, which was offset by the impact of the increased earned
          premium
          base.

          Compared with 2005

Net
          earned premiums for Life and Group Non-Core decreased $63.0 million in
          2006 as
          compared with 2005. The 2006 and 2005 net earned premiums relate primarily
          to
          the group and individual long term care businesses.

Net
          results increased $21.5 million in 2006 as compared with 2005, driven by
          increased net investment income. A significant portion of the increase
          in net
          investment income was offset by a corresponding increase in the policyholders’
funds reserves supported by the trading portfolio. The portion not offset
          by the
          policyholders’ funds reserves increased by $22.6 million. Also impacting net
          results was $13.6 million of income related to the resolution of contingencies
          and the absence of a $15.4 million provision recorded in 2005 for estimated
          indemnification liabilities related to the sold individual life business.
          Partially offsetting these favorable impacts were increased net realized
          investment losses and the absence of income related to agreements with
          buyers of
          sold businesses which ended as of December 31, 2005. In addition, the 2005
          net
          results included a change in estimate, which reduced a prior accrual of
          state
          premium taxes. See the Investments section of this MD&A for further
          discussion of net investment income and net realized investment
          results.

          Compared with 2004

Net
          earned premiums for Life and Group Non-Core decreased $217.0 million in
          2005 as
          compared with 2004. The premiums in 2004 include $115.0 million from the
          individual life business and $165.0 million from the specialty medical
          business.

Net
          results improved by $310.9 million in 2005 as compared with 2004. The
          improvement in net results related primarily to a $352.9 million realized
          loss
          on the sale of the individual life business in 2004. Also contributing
          to the
          improvement in net results was the reduction in 2005 of significant 2004
          items
          related to certain assumed reinsurance exposures. Additionally, 2005 results
          included $11.9 million income related to a service agreement with a purchaser
          for sold businesses. These agreements have expired. These results were
          partially
          offset by a decline in net investment income of $98.4 million. This included
          a
          decrease of approximately $64.0 million from the trading portfolio which
          was
          largely offset by a corresponding decrease in the policyholders’ funds reserves
          supported by the trading portfolio. In addition, it included the absence
          of
          favorable results from sold insurance operations. Also unfavorably impacting
          the
          2005 results was a $15.3 million provision increase for estimated
          indemnification liabilities related to the sold individual life business
          and
          unfavorable results related to the long term care business. See the Investments
          section of this MD&A for further discussion of net investment income and net
          realized investment results.

          decreased $1.7 million in 2006 as compared with 2005. Revenues in 2006
          and 2005
          included interest income related to federal income tax settlements of $4.0
          million and $121.0 million as further discussed in Note 11 of the Notes
          to
          Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. This decrease
          was
          substantially offset by increased net investment income and improved realized
          investment results. See the Investments section of this MD&A for further
          discussion of net investment income and net realized investment
          results.

Net
          results increased $26.7 million in 2006 as compared with 2005. The improvement
          was primarily driven by a decrease in unfavorable net prior year development
          as
          discussed further below. Offsetting this favorable impact was an increase
          in
          current accident year losses related to mass torts, discontinuation of
          royalty
          income related to a sold business and increased interest costs related
          to the
          issuance of $750.0 million of senior notes in August of 2006.

Unfavorable
          net prior year development of $88.0 million was recorded during 2006, including
          $86.0 million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment
          expense reserve development and $2.0 million of unfavorable premium development.
          Unfavorable net prior year development of $306.0 million was recorded in
          2005,
          including $291.0 million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated
          claim
          adjustment expense reserve development and $15.0 million of unfavorable
          premium
          development. Further information on Corporate and Other Non-Core’s Net Prior
          Year Development for 2006 and 2005 is included in Note 9 of the Notes to

          Compared with 2004

Revenues
          decreased $44.4 million in 2005 as compared with 2004. The decrease in
          revenues
          was primarily due to reduced net earned premiums in CNA Re of $134.0 million
          due
          to the exit from the assumed reinsurance business in 2003 and decreased
          net
          realized investment results. Partially offsetting these decreases was $121.0
          million of interest income related to a federal income tax settlement.
          See Note
          11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8
          for further information.

Net
          results decreased $112.0 million in 2005 as compared with 2004. The decrease
          in
          net results was primarily due to a $126.9 million after-tax and minority
          interest increase in unfavorable net prior year development related primarily
          to
          commutations and reserve strengthening, a $44.6 million decrease in net
          realized
          investment results and a decrease in the provision recorded for uncollectible
          reinsurance. Net realized investment results for the year ended December
          31,
          2005 and 2004 included a $20.1 million and $32.9 million after-tax and
          minority
          interest impairment related to a national contractor. See Note 21 of the
          Notes
          to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 for additional
          information regarding the national contractor. Partially offsetting these
          decreases was a $105.0 million after-tax and minority interest benefit
          related
          to a federal income tax settlement and release of federal income tax
          reserves.

Unfavorable
          net prior year development of $306.0 million was recorded during 2005,
          including
          $291.0 million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim
          adjustment expense reserve development and $15.0 million of unfavorable
          premium
          development. Unfavorable net prior year development of $93.0 million was
          recorded in 2004, including $84.0 million of unfavorable net prior year
          claim
          and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development and $9.0 million
          of
          unfavorable premium development. Further information on Corporate and Other
          Non-Core’s Net Prior Year Development for 2005 and 2004 is included in Note 9 of
          the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item
          8.

During
          2005 and 2004, CNA commuted several significant reinsurance contracts that
          resulted in unfavorable development of $118.0 million and $39.0 million,
          which
          is included in the development above, and which was partially offset by
          the
          release in 2004 of a previously established allowance for uncollectible
          reinsurance. These commutations resulted in unfavorable impacts of $64.8
          million
          and $4.6 million after-tax and minority interest in 2005 and 2004. These
          contracts contained interest crediting provisions and maintenance charges.
          Interest charges associated with the reinsurance contracts commuted were
          $11.9
          million and $10.0 million after-tax and minority interest in 2005 and 2004.
          There will be no further interest crediting charges or other charges related
          to
          these commuted contracts in future periods.

APMT
          Reserves

CNA’s
          property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have actual and potential
          exposures
          related to APMT claims.

Establishing
          reserves for APMT claim and claim adjustment expenses is subject to
          uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims. Traditional
          actuarial methods and techniques employed to estimate the ultimate cost
          of
          claims for more traditional property and casualty exposures are less precise
          in
          estimating claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for APMT, particularly
          in
          an environment of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that
          arise
          from industry practices and legal, judicial, and social conditions. Therefore,
          these traditional actuarial methods and

                    (Continued)

techniques
          are necessarily supplemented with additional estimating techniques and
          methodologies, many of which involve significant judgments that are required
          on
          our part. Accordingly, a high degree of uncertainty remains for CNA’s ultimate
          liability for APMT claim and claim adjustment expenses.

In
          addition to the difficulties described above, estimating the ultimate cost
          of
          both reported and unreported APMT claims is subject to a higher degree
          of
          variability due to a number of additional factors, including among others:
          the
          number and outcome of direct actions against CNA; coverage issues, including
          whether certain costs are covered under the policies and whether policy
          limits
          apply; allocation of liability among numerous parties, some of whom may
          be in
          bankruptcy proceedings, and in particular the application of “joint and several”
liability to specific insurers on a risk; inconsistent court decisions
          and
          developing legal theories; continuing aggressive tactics of plaintiffs’ lawyers;
          the risks and lack of predictability inherent in major litigation; enactment
          of
          state and federal legislation to address asbestos claims; the potential
          for
          increases and decreases in asbestos, environmental pollution and mass tort
          claims which cannot now be anticipated; the potential for increases and
          decreases in costs to defend asbestos, pollution and mass tort claims;
          the
          possibility of expanding theories of liability against CNA’s policyholders in
          environmental and mass tort matters; possible exhaustion of underlying
          umbrella
          and excess coverage; and future developments pertaining to CNA’s ability to
          recover reinsurance for asbestos, pollution and mass tort claims.

Due
          to
          the inherent uncertainties in estimating claim and claim adjustment expense
          reserves for APMT and due to the significant uncertainties described related
          to
          APMT claims, CNA’s ultimate liability for these cases, both individually and in
          aggregate, may exceed the recorded reserves. Any such potential additional
          liability, or any range of potential additional amounts, cannot be reasonably
          estimated currently, but could be material to CNA’s business, insurer financial
          strength and debt ratings and our results of operations and equity. Due
          to,
          among other things, the factors described above, it may be necessary for
          CNA to
          record material changes in its APMT claim and claim adjustment expense
          reserves
          in the future, should new information become available or other developments
          emerge.

CNA
          has
          annually performed ground up reviews of all open APMT claims to evaluate
          the
          adequacy of its APMT reserves. In performing the comprehensive ground up
          analysis, CNA considers input from its professionals with direct responsibility
          for the claims, inside and outside counsel with responsibility for its
          representation and its actuarial staff. These professionals consider, among
          many
          factors, the policyholder’s present and predicted future exposures, including
          such factors as claims volume, trial conditions, prior settlement history,
          settlement demands and defense costs; the impact of asbestos defendant
          bankruptcies on the policyholder; facts or allegations regarding the policies
          CNA issued or are alleged to have issued, including such factors as aggregate
          or
          per occurrence limits, whether the policy is primary, umbrella or excess,
          and
          the existence of policyholder retentions and/or deductibles; the policyholders’
allegations; the existence of other insurance; and reinsurance
          arrangements.

Further
          information on APMT Net Prior Year Development is included in Note 9 of
          the
          Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

In
          the
          past several years, CNA has experienced, at certain points in time, significant
          increases in claim counts for asbestos-related claims. The factors that
          led to
          these increases included, among other things, intensive advertising campaigns
          by
          lawyers for asbestos claimants, mass medical screening programs sponsored
          by
          plaintiff lawyers and the addition of new defendants such as the distributors
          and installers of products containing asbestos. In recent years, the rate

of
          new
          filings has decreased. Various challenges to mass screening claimants have
          been
          successful. Historically, the majority of asbestos bodily injury claims
          have
          been filed by persons exhibiting few, if any, disease symptoms. Studies
          have
          concluded that the percentage of unimpaired claimants to total claimants
          ranges
          between 66.0% and up to 90.0%. Some courts and some state statutes mandate
          that
          so-called “unimpaired” claimants may not recover unless at some point the
          claimant’s condition worsens to the point of impairment. Some plaintiffs
          classified as “unimpaired” continue to challenge those orders and statutes.
          Therefore, the ultimate impact of the orders and statutes on future asbestos
          claims remains uncertain.

Several
          factors are, in CNA’s view, negatively impacting asbestos claim trends.
          Plaintiff attorneys who previously sued entities that are now bankrupt
          continue
          to seek other viable targets. As a result, companies with few or no previous
          asbestos claims are becoming targets in asbestos litigation and, although
          they
          may have little or no liability, nevertheless must be defended. Additionally,
          plaintiff attorneys and trustees for future claimants are demanding that
          policy
          limits be paid lump-sum into the bankruptcy asbestos trusts prior to
          presentation of valid claims and medical proof of these claims. Various
          challenges to these practices have succeeded in litigation, and are continuing
          to be litigated. Plaintiff attorneys and trustees for future claimants
          are also
          attempting to devise claims payment procedures for bankruptcy trusts that
          would
          allow asbestos claims to be paid under lax standards for injury, exposure
          and
          causation. This also presents the potential for exhausting policy limits
          in an
          accelerated fashion. Challenges to these practices are being mounted, though
          the
          ultimate impact or success of these tactics remains uncertain.

As
          a
          result of bankruptcies and insolvencies, CNA had in the past observed an
          increase in the total number of policyholders with current asbestos claims
          as
          additional defendants are added to existing lawsuits and are named in new
          asbestos bodily injury lawsuits. During the last few years the rate of
          new
          bodily injury claims had moderated, and most recently the new claims filing
          rate
          has decreased although the number of policyholders claiming coverage for
          asbestos related claims has remained relatively constant in the past several
          years.

CNA
          has
          resolved a number of its large asbestos accounts by negotiating settlement
          agreements. Structured settlement agreements provide for payments over
          multiple
          years as set forth in each individual agreement.

In
          1985,
          47 asbestos producers and their insurers, including The Continental Insurance
          Company (“CIC”), executed the Wellington Agreement. The agreement was intended
          to resolve all issues and litigation related to coverage for asbestos exposures.
          Under this agreement, signatory insurers committed scheduled policy limits
          and
          made the limits available to pay asbestos claims based upon coverage blocks
          designated by the policyholders in 1985, subject to extension by policyholders.
          CIC was a signatory insurer to the Wellington Agreement.

CNA
          has
          also used coverage in place agreements to resolve large asbestos exposures.
          Coverage in place agreements are typically agreements between CNA and its
          policyholders identifying the policies and the terms for payment of asbestos
          related liabilities. Claims payments are contingent on presentation of
          adequate
          documentation showing exposure during the policy periods and other documentation
          supporting the demand for claims payment. Coverage in place agreements
          may have
          annual payment caps. Coverage in place agreements are evaluated based on
          claims
          filings trends and severities.

CNA
          categorizes active asbestos accounts as large or small accounts. CNA defines
          a
          large account as an active account with more than $100,000 of cumulative
          paid
          losses. CNA has made closing large accounts a significant management priority.
          Small accounts are defined as active accounts with $100,000 or less of
          cumulative paid losses. Approximately 79.6% and 81.0% of CNA’s total active
          asbestos accounts are classified as small accounts at December 31, 2006
          and
          2005.

CNA
          also
          evaluates its asbestos liabilities arising from its assumed reinsurance
          business
          and its participation in various pools, including Excess & Casualty
          Reinsurance Association (“ECRA”).

IBNR
          reserves relate to potential development on accounts that have not settled
          and
          potential future claims from unidentified policyholders.

Some
          asbestos-related defendants have asserted that their insurance policies
          are not
          subject to aggregate limits on coverage. CNA has such claims from a number
          of
          insureds. Some of these claims involve insureds facing exhaustion of products
          liability aggregate limits in their policies, who have asserted that their
          asbestos-related claims fall within so-called “non-products” liability coverage
          contained within their policies rather than products liability coverage,
          and
          that the claimed “non-products” coverage is not subject to any aggregate limit.
          It is difficult to predict the ultimate size of any of the claims for coverage
          purportedly not subject to aggregate limits or predict to what extent,
          if any,
          the attempts to assert “non-products” claims outside the products liability
          aggregate will succeed. CNA’s policies also contain other limits applicable to
          these claims and CNA has additional coverage defenses to certain claims.
          CNA has
          attempted to manage its asbestos exposure by aggressively seeking to settle
          claims on acceptable terms. There can be no assurance that any of these
          settlement efforts will be successful, or that any such claims can be settled
          on
          terms acceptable to CNA. Where CNA cannot settle a claim on acceptable
          terms,
          CNA aggressively litigates the claim. However, adverse developments with
          respect
          to such matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of
          operations and/or equity.

As
          a
          result of the uncertainties and complexities involved, reserves for asbestos
          claims cannot be estimated with traditional actuarial techniques that rely
          on
          historical accident year loss development factors. In establishing asbestos
          reserves, CNA evaluates the exposure presented by each insured. As part
          of this
          evaluation, CNA considers the available insurance coverage; limits and
          deductibles; the potential role of other insurance, particularly underlying
          coverage below any of its excess liability policies; and applicable coverage
          defenses, including asbestos exclusions. Estimation of asbestos-related
          claim
          and claim adjustment expense reserves involves a high degree of judgment
          on
          CNA’s part and consideration of many complex factors, including: inconsistency
          of court decisions, jury attitudes and future court decisions; specific
          policy
          provisions; allocation of liability among insurers and insureds; missing
          policies and proof of coverage; the proliferation of bankruptcy proceedings
          and
          attendant uncertainties; novel theories asserted by policyholders and their
          counsel; the targeting of a broader range of businesses and entities as
          defendants; the uncertainty as to which other insureds may be targeted
          in the
          future and the uncertainties inherent in predicting the number of future
          claims;
          volatility in claim numbers and settlement demands; increases in the number
          of
          non-impaired claimants and the extent to which they can be precluded from
          making
          claims; the efforts by insureds to obtain coverage not subject to aggregate
          limits; long latency period between asbestos exposure and disease manifestation
          and the resulting potential for involvement of multiple policy periods
          for
          individual claims; medical inflation trends; the mix of asbestos-related
          diseases presented and the ability to recover reinsurance.

CNA
          is
          involved in significant asbestos-related claim litigation, which is described
          in
          Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under
          Item
          8.

Environmental
          Pollution and Mass Tort

Environmental
          pollution cleanup is the subject of both federal and state regulation.
          By some
          estimates, there are thousands of potential waste sites subject to cleanup.
          The
          insurance industry is involved in extensive litigation regarding coverage
          issues. Judicial interpretations in many cases have expanded the scope
          of
          coverage and liability beyond the original intent of the policies. The
          Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of
          (“Superfund”) and comparable state statutes (“mini-Superfunds”) govern the
          cleanup and restoration of toxic waste sites and formalize the concept
          of legal
          liability for cleanup and restoration by “Potentially Responsible Parties”
(“PRPs”). Superfund and the mini-Superfunds establish mechanisms to pay for
          cleanup of waste sites if PRPs fail to do so and assign liability to PRPs.
          The
          extent of liability to be allocated to a PRP is dependent upon a variety
          of
          factors. Further, the number of waste sites subject to cleanup is unknown.
          To
          date, approximately 1,500 cleanup sites have been identified by the
          Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and included on its National Priorities
          List (“NPL”). State authorities have designated many cleanup sites as
          well.

Many
          policyholders have made claims against CNA for defense costs and indemnification
          in connection with environmental pollution matters. The vast majority of
          these
          claims relate to accident years 1989 and prior, which coincides with CNA’s
          adoption of the Simplified Commercial General Liability coverage form,
          which
          includes what is referred to in the industry as absolute pollution exclusion.
          CNA and the insurance industry are disputing coverage for many such claims.
          Key
          coverage issues include whether cleanup costs are considered damages under
          the
          policies, trigger of coverage, allocation of liability among triggered
          policies,
          applicability of pollution exclusions and owned property exclusions, the
          potential for joint and several liability and the definition of an occurrence.
          To date, courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these
          issues.

CNA
          has
          made resolution of large environmental pollution exposures a management
          priority. CNA has resolved a number of its large environmental accounts
          by
          negotiating settlement agreements. In its settlements, CNA sought to resolve
          those exposures and obtain the broadest release language to avoid future
          claims
          from the same policyholders seeking coverage for sites or claims that had
          not
          emerged at the time CNA settled with its policyholder. While the terms
          of each
          settlement agreement vary, CNA sought to obtain broad environmental releases
          that include known and unknown sites, claims and policies. The broad scope
          of
          the release provisions contained in those settlement agreements should,
          in many
          cases, prevent future exposure from settled policyholders. It remains uncertain,
          however, whether a court interpreting the language of the settlement agreements
          will adhere to the intent of the parties and uphold the broad scope of
          language
          of the agreements.

CNA
          classifies its environmental pollution accounts into several categories,
          which
          include structured settlements, coverage in place agreements and active
          accounts. Structured settlement agreements provide for payments over multiple
          years as set forth in each individual agreement.

                    (Continued)

CNA
          has
          also used coverage in place agreements to resolve pollution exposures.
          Coverage
          in place agreements are typically agreements between CNA and its policyholders
          identifying the policies and the terms for payment of pollution related
          liabilities. Claims payments are contingent on presentation of adequate
          documentation of damages during the policy periods and other documentation
          supporting the demand for claims payment. Coverage in place agreements
          may have
          annual payment caps.

CNA
          categorizes active accounts as large or small accounts in the pollution
          area.
          CNA defines a large account as an active account with more than $100,000
          cumulative paid losses. CNA has made closing large accounts a significant
          management priority. Small accounts are defined as active accounts with
          $100,000
          or less cumulative paid losses.

CNA
          also
          evaluates its environmental pollution exposures arising from its assumed
          reinsurance and our participation in various pools, including ECRA.

CNA
          carries unassigned IBNR reserves for environmental pollution. These reserves
          relate to potential development on accounts that have not settled and potential
          future claims from unidentified policyholders.

The
          tables below depict CNA’s overall pending environmental pollution accounts and
          associated reserves at December 31, 2006 and 2005.

          Compared with 2005

Revenues
          increased by $222.8 million or 6.1% and net income increased by $119.8
          million
          or 17.0% in 2006 as compared to 2005.

The
          increase in revenues in 2006, as compared to 2005, is primarily due to
          higher
          net sales of $187.1 million and higher investment income of $41.7 million,
          partially offset by a decrease in other income of $6.0 million. Net sales
          revenue increased $144.4 million due to increased unit sales volume, assuming
          prices were unchanged from the prior

year
          and
          $42.6 million due to higher effective unit prices reflecting lower sales
          promotion expenses. Other revenues in 2005 included interest of $6.0 million
          relating to a refund of income taxes paid in prior years. Effective December
          15,
          2006, Lorillard increased the list price of its Newport Brand by $5.00
          per
          thousand cigarettes ($.10 per pack of 20 cigarettes) and its Kent, True,
          Max and
          Satin Brands by $3.75 per thousand cigarettes ($.075 per pack of 20
          cigarettes).

Net
          income increased in 2006, as compared to the prior year, due primarily
          to the
          higher revenues discussed above, and an $8.3 million reduction in promotional
          expenses included in cost of sales and lower pretax charges of $13.1 million
          due
          to a federal assessment relating to the repeal of the federal supply management
          program for tobacco growers, partially offset by higher State Settlement
          Agreement costs and higher other operating expenses as described below.

Lorillard
          recorded pretax charges of $911.4 million and $876.4 million. ($560.2 million
          and $537.7 million after taxes) for 2006 and 2005, to record its obligations
          under settlement agreements entered into between the major cigarette
          manufacturers, including Lorillard, and each of the 50 states, the District
          of
          Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and certain U.S. territories
          (together, the “State Settlement Agreements”). Lorillard’s portion of ongoing
          adjusted settlement payments and related legal fees is based on its share of
          domestic cigarette shipments in the year preceding that in which the payment
          is
          due. Accordingly, Lorillard records its portion of ongoing settlement payments
          as part of cost of manufactured products sold as the related sales occur.
          The
          $35.0 million pretax increase in tobacco settlement costs in 2006, as compared
          to 2005, is due to the impact of the inflation adjustment ($24.5 million)
          and
          charges for higher gross unit sales ($22.6 million), partially offset by
          other
          adjustments ($12.1 million) under the State Settlement Agreements.

In
          April
          of 2006, Lorillard commenced a restructuring of its sales and market research
          organization and offered an early retirement program to eligible employees.
          As a
          result, in 2006 Lorillard recorded restructuring costs of $20.1 million
          in other
          operating expenses primarily for early retirement and curtailment charges
          on
          pension and other postretirement benefit plans.

Lorillard
          regularly reviews results of its promotional spending activities and adjusts
          its
          promotional spending programs in an effort to maintain its competitive
          position.
          Accordingly, unit sales volume and sales promotion costs in any particular
          period are not necessarily indicative of sales and costs that may be realized
          in
          subsequent periods.

Overall,
          domestic industry unit sales volume decreased 2.4% in 2006, as compared
          with the
          prior year. Industry sales for premium brands were 72.5% of the total market
          in
          2006, as compared to 71.1% for 2005.

Lorillard’s
          total (domestic, Puerto Rico and certain U.S. Territories) gross unit sales
          volume increased 2.6% in 2006, as compared to 2005. Domestic wholesale
          volume
          increased 2.7% in 2006, as compared to the prior year. Total and domestic
          Newport unit sales volume increased 2.9% in 2006, as compared with 2005.
          These
          results continue to be affected by on-going competitive promotions and
          the
          availability of deep discount brands.

Deep
          discount brands are produced by manufacturers that are subject to lower
          payment
          obligations under State Settlement Agreements. This cost advantage enables
          them
          to price their brands more than 50% lower than the list prices of premium
          brand
          offerings from major manufacturers. As a result of this price differential,
          deep
          discount brands have grown from an estimated share in 1998 of less than
          1.5% to
          an estimated 12.4% for 2006. Although deep discount brands have shown a
          decrease
          of 0.9% for 2006 versus 2005, these brands continue to be a significant
          competitive factor in the domestic U.S. market.

The
          costs
          of litigating and administering product liability claims, as well as other
          legal
          expenses, are included in other operating expenses. Lorillard’s outside legal
          fees and other external product liability defense costs were $57.2 million,
          $82.6 million, and $83.5 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
          Numerous
          factors affect product liability defense costs. The principal factors are
          as
          follows:

·

the
                    number and types of cases filed and
                    appealed;

·

          The
          factors that have influenced past product liability defense costs are expected
          to continue to influence future costs. Although Lorillard does not expect
          that
          product liability defense costs will increase significantly in the future,
          it is
          possible that adverse developments in the factors discussed above, as well
          as
          other circumstances beyond the control of Lorillard, could have a material
          adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash
          flows.

          Compared with 2004

Revenues
          increased by $249.5 million, or 7.4% and net income increased by $64.1
          million,
          or 10.0% in 2005 as compared to 2004.

The
          increase in revenues in 2005, as compared to the prior year, is primarily
          due to
          higher net sales of $220.0 million and higher investment and other income
          of
          $29.5 million. Net sales revenue increased by $123.0 million due to increased
          unit sales volume, assuming prices were unchanged from the prior year and
          $97.0
          million due to higher effective unit prices reflecting lower sales promotion
          expenses (accounted for as a reduction to net sales). Net investment income
          increased due primarily to higher yields on invested cash balances and
          includes
          $16.8 million from limited partnerships in 2005, as compared to $18.0 million
          in
          2004.

Net
          income increased in 2005, as compared to 2004, due primarily to the higher
          revenues discussed above and a $26.8 million reduction in promotional expenses
          included in cost of sales, partially offset by higher State Settlement
          Agreement
          costs as described above, and charges of $100.4 million pretax due to a
          federal
          assessment (including $26.4 million of charges in relation to losses by
          grower
          related entities from the sale of surplus tobacco) relating to the repeal
          of the
          federal supply management program for tobacco growers. Lorillard recorded
          pretax
          charges of $876.4 million and $845.9 million ($537.7 million and $522.6
          million
          after taxes) for 2005 and 2004, respectively, to record its obligations
          under
          the State Settlement Agreements. The $30.5 million pretax increase in tobacco
          settlement costs in 2005 is due to the impact of the inflation adjustment
          ($26.2
          million), charges for higher gross unit sales ($16.2 million) under the
          State
          Settlement Agreements and other adjustments ($21.8 million), partially
          offset by
          the elimination of Lorillard’s payment obligations under the national Tobacco
          Growers Settlement Trust ($33.7 million).

Overall,
          domestic industry unit sales volume decreased 3.2% in 2005 as compared
          with
          2004. Industry sales for premium brands were 71.1% of the total market
          in 2005
          as compared to 69.6% in 2004.

Lorillard’s
          total (domestic, Puerto Rico and certain U.S. Territories) gross unit sales
          volume increased 1.9% in 2005 as compared to 2004. Domestic wholesale volume
          increased 2.0% in 2005 as compared to 2004. Total Newport unit sales volume
          increased 2.5% in 2005 and domestic volume increased 2.6% in 2005 as compared
          with 2004.

Deep
          discount brands are produced by manufacturers that are subject to lower
          payment
          obligations under the State Settlement Agreements. Deep discount brands
          increased from an estimated market share in 1998 of less than 1.5% to an
          estimated 13.3% for 2005.

Unless
          otherwise specified, market share data in this MD&A is based on data made
          available by Management Science Associates, Inc. (“MSAI”), an independent
          third-party database management organization that collects wholesale shipment
          data from various cigarette manufacturers. MSAI divides the cigarette market
          into two price segments, the premium price segment and the discount or
          reduced
          price segment. MSAI’s information relating to unit sales volume and market share
          of certain of the smaller, primarily deep discount, cigarette manufacturers
          is
          based on estimates derived by MSAI.

Lorillard
          management continues to believe that volume and market share information
          for
          deep discount manufacturers are understated and, correspondingly, share
          information for the larger manufacturers, including Lorillard, are overstated
          by
          MSAI.

Business
          Environment

The
          tobacco industry in the United States, including Lorillard, continues to
          be
          faced with a number of issues that have impacted or may adversely impact
          the
          business, results of operations and financial condition of Lorillard and

The
                    continuing contraction of the U.S. cigarette market, in which
                    Lorillard
                    currently conducts its only significant business. As a result
                    of price
                    increases, restrictions on advertising and promotions, increases
                    in
                    regulation and excise taxes, health concerns, a decline in the
                    social
                    acceptability of smoking, increased pressure from anti-tobacco
                    groups and
                    other factors, U.S. cigarette shipments have decreased at a compound
                    annual rate of approximately 2.6% over the period 1997 through
                    according to information provided by

                    the retail
                    price of cigarettes. In 2006, the federal excise tax was $0.39
                    per pack
                    and combined state and local excise taxes ranged from $0.07 to
                    $3.66 per
                    pack. In 2006, excise tax increases ranging from $0.05 to $1.00
                    per pack
                    were implemented in six states and two municipalities. Proposals
                    continue
                    to be made to increase federal, state and local excise taxes.
                    Lorillard
                    believes that increases in excise and similar taxes have had
                    an adverse
                    impact on sales of cigarettes and that future increases, the
                    extent of
                    which cannot be predicted, could result in further volume declines
                    for the
                    cigarette industry, including Lorillard, and an increased sales
                    shift
                    toward lower priced discount cigarettes rather than premium brands.
                    In
                    addition, Lorillard and other cigarette manufacturers are required
                    to pay
                    an assessment under a federal law designed to fund payments to
                    tobacco
                    quota holders and growers.

                    restrictions on smoking. Bills have been introduced in the U.S.
                    Congress
                    to grant the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) authority to regulate
                    tobacco products. Lorillard believes that FDA regulations, if
                    enacted,
                    could among other things result in new restrictions on the manner
                    in which
                    cigarettes can be advertised and marketed, and may alter the way cigarette
                    products are developed and manufactured. Lorillard also believes
                    that any
                    such proposals, if enacted, would provide Philip Morris, as the
                    largest
                    tobacco company in the country, with a competitive
                    advantage.

Boardwalk
          Pipeline derives revenues primarily from the interstate transportation
          and
          storage of natural gas for third parties. Transportation and storage services
          are provided under firm service and interruptible service agreements.
          Transportation and storage rates and general terms and conditions of service
          are
          established by, and subject to review and revision by, the Federal Energy
          Regulatory Commission (“FERC”).


Item
                    7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
                    of Operations

Results
                    of Operations -

Boardwalk
                    Pipeline - (Continued)

Under
          firm transportation agreements, customers generally pay a fixed “capacity
          reservation” fee to reserve pipeline capacity at certain receipt and delivery
          points, plus a commodity and fuel charge paid on the volume of gas actually
          transported. Firm storage customers reserve a specific amount of storage
          capacity and generally pay a capacity reservation charge based on the amount
          of
          capacity being reserved plus an injection and/or withdrawal fee. Capacity
          reservation revenues derived from a firm service contract is consistent
          from
          year to year, but is generally higher in winter peak periods (November
          through
          March) than off-peak periods resulting in a seasonal earnings pattern where
          the
          majority of earnings are generated in the first and fourth quarters of
          a
          calendar year.

Interruptible
          transportation and storage service is typically short-term in nature and
          is
          generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have
          been
          unable to contract for firm service. Customers pay for interruptible services
          when capacity is used.

Boardwalk
          Pipeline’s parking and lending (“PAL”) service is an interruptible service
          offered to customers providing them the ability to park (inject) or borrow
          (withdraw) gas into or out of Boardwalk Pipeline’s storage facilities at a
          specific location for a specific period of time. Customers pay for PAL
          service
          in advance or on a monthly basis depending on the terms of the
          agreement.

Operating
          expenses typically do not vary significantly based upon the amount of gas
          transported with the exception of gas consumed by Gulf South’s compressor
          stations. Gulf South’s fuel recoveries are included as part of transportation
          revenues.

Revenues
          and net income for 2004 reflect operations of Gulf South from December
          29, 2004,
          the date of acquisition. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
          Statements.

          Compared with 2005

Total
          revenues increased by $47.1 million to $618.4 million in 2006, compared
          to
          $571.3 million for 2005. Storage and PAL services improved revenues by
          $38.5
          million primarily due to favorable natural gas price spreads and volatility
          in
          forward gas prices. In addition, operating revenues increased due to higher
          firm
          transportation revenues of $26.0 million, excluding fuel, primarily related
          to
          higher reservation rates and additional capacity reserved by shippers due
          to
          higher production in the East Texas region, and $5.3 million due to hurricane
          insurance recoveries in 2006 and gas lost in 2005 related to Hurricanes
          Katrina
          and Rita. These increases were partially offset by the absence of a $12.2
          million gain from the sale of storage gas related to Phase I of Boardwalk
          Pipeline’s Western Kentucky storage expansion project that occurred in 2005, a
          $10.5 million decrease in interruptible transportation services due to
          unseasonably warm weather in Boardwalk Pipeline’s market areas during the fourth
          quarter of 2006, higher interruptible revenues in the third and fourth
          quarters
          of 2005 due to supply disruptions caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita,
          a $7.1
          million decrease in fuel retained due to lower realized natural gas prices
          and
          reduced throughput, and a $5.5 million decrease in revenues for a reduction
          in
          the amortization of acquired executory contracts.

Net
          income increased by $11.1 million to $103.2 million in 2006, as compared
          to
          $92.1 million in 2005, primarily due to the increased revenues discussed
          above,
          partially offset by a $25.0 million increase in minority interest expense
          and a
          $5.5 million increase in operating expenses. Operating expenses in 2006,
          as
          compared to 2005, include a $12.6 million increase in outside services
          and
          overhead mainly due to growth in operations and regulatory compliance,
          a $10.2
          million increase in employee labor and benefits costs due primarily to
          a rate
          case settlement and a special termination benefit charge recognized as
          a result
          of an early retirement incentive program. Operating expenses also reflect
          a $3.7
          million increase in depreciation and amortization and a $2.6 million expense
          from the lease of third-party pipeline capacity. These increases were partially
          offset by a $18.2 million reduction in hurricane-related expense as compared
          to
          2005, and a $14.9 million decrease in company-used gas due to operational
          efficiencies, lower natural gas prices and reduced throughput resulting
          in
          decreased usage. Interest expense for 2006 increased by $2.0 million, primarily
          due to borrowings under a credit facility that occurred in November of
          2005 and
          senior notes issued in November of 2006.

          Compared with 2004

Total
          revenues increased by $306.2 million to $571.3 million for 2005, compared
          to
          $265.1 million for 2004.

Gas
          transportation revenues increased by $273.1 million to $526.6 million for
          2005,
          substantially all of which was attributable to Gulf South, compared to
          $253.5
          million for 2004. Revenues at Texas Gas remained essentially flat due to

          offset by new FERC rates, subject to refund, implemented on November 1,
          2005,
          the completion of the Western Kentucky area storage expansion project on
          November 1, 2005 and the associated transportation agreements, contributed
          an
          increase of approximately $2.0 million in revenues, and the leasing of
          additional capacity on a third party pipeline in Carthage, Texas on December
          1,
          2005 which contributed an increase of approximately $1.0 million in
          revenues.

Gas
          storage revenues increased by $14.4 million to $21.7 million for 2005,
          of which
          $16.3 million was attributable to Gulf South, compared to $7.3 million
          for 2004.
          Storage revenues decreased at Texas Gas by $2.0 million due to unusually
          high
          interruptible storage revenue generated in 2004 from favorable market
          conditions.

Other
          revenues increased by $17.9 million to $21.5 million for 2005, of which
          $11.1
          million was attributable to Gulf South, compared to $3.6 million for 2004.
          The
          balance of the increase was due primarily to a $12.2 million gain on the
          sale of
          storage gas related to the Western Kentucky storage expansion.

Operating
          expenses increased by $199.2 million to $353.1 million for 2005, of which
          $207.4
          million was attributable to Gulf South, compared to $153.9 million for
          2004.

Interest
          expense increased by $30.0 million to $60.1 million for the full year ended
          December 31, 2005, due to higher interest expense primarily related to
          $575.0
          million of debt incurred in 2004 to fund the Gulf South acquisition, compared
          to
          $30.1 million for 2004.

Diamond
          Offshore’s revenues vary based upon demand, which affects the number of days the
          fleet is utilized and the dayrates earned. When a rig is idle, no dayrate
          is
          earned and revenues will decrease as a result. Revenues can also be affected
          as
          a result of the acquisition or disposal of rigs, required surveys and shipyard
          upgrades. In order to improve utilization or realize higher dayrates, Diamond
          Offshore may mobilize its rigs from one market to another. However, during
          periods of unpaid mobilization, revenues may be adversely affected. As
          a
          response to changes in demand, Diamond Offshore may withdraw a rig from
          the
          market by stacking it or may reactivate a rig stacked previously, which
          may
          decrease or increase revenues, respectively.


Item
                    7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
                    of Operations

Results
                    of Operations - Diamond Offshore -
                    (Continued)

The
          two
          most significant variables affecting revenues are dayrates for rigs and
          rig
          utilization rates, each of which is a function of rig supply and demand
          in the
          marketplace. As utilization rates increase, dayrates tend to increase as
          well,
          reflecting the lower supply of available rigs, and vice versa. Demand for
          drilling services is dependent upon the level of expenditures set by oil
          and gas
          companies for offshore exploration and development as well as a variety
          of
          political and economic factors. The availability of rigs in a particular
          geographical region also affects both dayrates and utilization rates. These
          factors are not within Diamond Offshore’s control and are difficult to
          predict.

Diamond
          Offshore’s operating income is primarily affected by revenue factors, but is
          also a function of varying levels of operating expenses. Diamond
          Offshore’s

operating expenses represent all direct and indirect costs associated with
          the
          operation and maintenance of its drilling equipment. The principal components
          of
          Diamond Offshore’s operating costs are, among other things, direct and indirect
          costs of labor and benefits, repairs and maintenance, freight, regulatory
          inspections, boat and helicopter rentals and insurance. Labor and repair
          and
          maintenance costs represent the most significant components of operating
          expenses. In the current period of high, sustained utilization, maintenance
          and
          repairs costs may increase in order to maintain Diamond Offshore’s equipment in
          proper, working order. In general, Diamond Offshore’s labor costs increase
          primarily due to higher salary levels, rig staffing requirements, inflation
          and
          costs associated with labor regulations in the geographic regions in which
          Diamond Offshore’s rigs operate. Diamond Offshore has experienced and continues
          to experience upward pressure on salaries and wages as a result of the
          strengthening offshore drilling market and increased competition for skilled
          workers. In response to these market conditions, Diamond Offshore has
          implemented retention programs, including increases in compensation. Costs
          to
          repair and maintain equipment fluctuate depending upon the type of activity
          the
          drilling unit is performing, as well as the age and condition of the
          equipment.

Operating
          expenses generally are not affected by changes in dayrates and may not
          be
          significantly affected by short-term fluctuations in utilization. For instance,
          if a rig is to be idle for a short period of time, few decreases in operating
          expenses may actually occur since the rig is typically maintained in a
          prepared
          or “ready stacked” state with a full crew. In addition, when a rig is idle,
          Diamond Offshore is responsible for certain operating expenses such as
          rig fuel
          and supply boat costs, which are typically a cost of the operator when
          a rig is
          under contract. However, if the rig is to be idle for an extended period
          of
          time, Diamond Offshore may reduce the size of a rig’s crew and take steps to
“cold stack” the rig, which lowers expenses and partially offsets the impact on
          operating income.

Operating
          income is also negatively impacted when Diamond Offshore performs certain
          regulatory inspections that are due every five years (“5-year survey”) for each
          of Diamond Offshore’s rigs as well as intermediate surveys, which are performed
          at interim periods between 5-year surveys. Operating revenue decreases
          because
          these surveys are performed during scheduled down-time in a shipyard. Operating
          expenses increase as a result of these surveys due to the cost to mobilize
          the
          rigs to a shipyard, inspection costs incurred and repair and maintenance
          costs.
          Repair and maintenance costs may be required resulting from the survey
          or may
          have been previously planned to take place during this mandatory down-time.
          The
          number of rigs undergoing a 5-year survey will vary from year to year.

During
          2007, Diamond Offshore expects to spend an aggregate of approximately $46.0
          million for 5-year surveys and intermediate surveys, including estimated
          mobilization costs, but excluding any resulting repair and maintenance
          costs,
          which could be significant. Costs of mobilizing Diamond Offshore’s rigs to
          shipyards for scheduled surveys, which were a major component of its
          survey-related costs during 2006, are indicative of higher prices commanded
          by
          support businesses to the offshore drilling industry. Diamond Offshore
          expects
          mobilization costs to be a significant component of its survey-related
          costs in
          2007.

          Compared with 2005

Revenues
          increased by $809.1 million, or 62.6%, and net income increased by $225.1
          million in 2006, as compared to 2005.

Revenues
          from high specification floaters and intermediate semisubmersible rigs
          increased
          by $646.2 million or 71.4% in 2006, as compared to 2005. The increase primarily
          reflects increased dayrates of $545.2 million and improved utilization
          of $100.9
          million.

          the
          third quarter of 2005, one of Diamond Offshore’s jack-up drilling rigs, the

Ocean
          Warwick

,
          was
          damaged beyond repair during Hurricane Katrina and other rigs in Diamond
          Offshore’s fleet sustained lesser damage in Hurricanes Katrina or Rita, or in
          some cases from both storms. Diamond Offshore believes the physical damage
          to
          its rigs, as well as any related removal and recovery costs, are covered
          by
          insurance, after applicable deductibles. Diamond Offshore

recognized a $33.6 million casualty gain during the third quarter of 2005
          as a
          result of the constructive total loss of the

Ocean
          Warwick

.
          During
          2005, this drilling unit generated $11.8 million in revenues.

Investment
          income increased by $11.9 million for 2006, primarily due to the combined
          effect
          of higher interest rates earned on higher average cash balances in 2006,
          as
          compared to the prior year.

Interest
          expense decreased $17.8 million in 2006, primarily due to the 2005 redemption
          of
          zero coupon debentures, partially offset by the additional expense related
          to
          the 2005 issuance of 4.9% senior unsecured notes. In 2005, interest expense
          included a write-off of $6.9 million of debt issuance costs associated
          with the
          partial repurchase of Diamond Offshore’s Zero Coupon Debentures.

Net
          income increased in 2006 due primarily to the increased revenues noted
          above,
          and reduced interest expense, partially offset by increased contract drilling
          expenses driven by higher labor and benefit costs as a result of wage increases
          and other compensation enhancement programs implemented subsequent to the
          second
          quarter of 2005. In addition, Diamond Offshore incurred higher repair and
          maintenance costs for most of its rigs primarily due to the high utilization
          of
          its fleet and higher prices experienced throughout the offshore drilling
          industry and support businesses.

          Compared with 2004

Revenues
          increased by $457.0 million, or 54.7% and net income increased by $136.1
          million
          in the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004. Revenues increased
          primarily due to an overall increase in rig utilization rates and dayrates
          for
          all classes of rigs.

.
          During
          2005, this drilling unit generated $11.8 million in revenues compared to
          $9.3
          million in 2004 primarily due to a higher average operating dayrate earned
          during 2005, as compared to 2004.

Revenues
          from high-specification floaters and other semisubmersible rigs increased
          $304.8
          million in 2005 due primarily to increased dayrates of $242.0 million as
          compared to 2004. Utilization improved in 2005, which generated an additional
          $58.3 million in revenue as compared to 2004.

Revenues
          from jack-up rigs increased by $93.4 million in the year ended December
          31,
          2005, as compared to 2004. The increase primarily reflects increased dayrates
          of
          $89.5 million and improved utilization of $11.3 million, partially offset
          by a
          decrease of $7.4 million in rig mobilization fees.

Net
          investment income increased by $13.8 million, primarily due to interest
          earned
          on higher average cash and investment balances in 2005 as compared to
          2004.

Interest
          expense increased $11.6 million in 2005, primarily due to the additional
          expense
          related to the issuance of 5.2% and 4.9% senior unsecured notes, partially
          offset by redemption of zero coupon debentures. In 2005, interest expense
          included a write-off of $6.9 million of debt issuance costs associated
          with the
          partial repurchase of Diamond Offshore’s Zero Coupon Debentures.

Net
          income increased in 2005 due primarily to the higher revenues discussed
          above,
          partially offset by increased contract drilling expenses and interest expense
          noted above.

          Compared with 2005

Revenues
          increased by $20.8 million, or 5.9% and net income decreased by $1.8 million,
          or
          5.8%, in 2006, as compared to 2005.

Revenues
          increased in 2006, as compared with 2005, due primarily to an increase
          in
          revenue per available room of $16.51, or 10.9%, to $168.40, from $151.89
          in the
          prior year. Revenue per available room increased due to higher average
          room
          rates, which increased $20.39, or 10.2%, and a 0.7% increase in occupancy
          rates
          for 2006. These increases were partially offset by a non-recurring pretax
          gain
          in 2005 of $4.5 million from the early repayment of a note in connection
          with
          the sale of a hotel property and lower equity income of $3.6 million due
          primarily to higher land rent at the Orlando property.

Revenue
          per available room is an industry measure of the combined effect of occupancy
          rates and average room rates on room revenues. Other hotel operating revenues
          primarily include guest charges for food and beverages.

Net
          income for 2006 decreased primarily due to

the
          non-recurring gain in 2005

discussed
          above and increased costs related to linen and service upgrades, partially
          offset by the increase in revenue per available room.

          Compared with 2004

Revenues
          increased by $35.3 million, or 11.2% and net income increased by $9.8 million
          in
          2005, as compared to 2004.

Revenues
          increased in 2005, as compared to 2004, due primarily to an increase in
          revenue
          per available room of $16.20, or 11.9%, to $151.89 from $135.69 in the
          prior
          year. Revenue per available room increased due to higher average room rates,
          which increased $20.01, or 11.1% and a 0.8% increase in occupancy rates
          for
          2005. In addition, higher equity income from joint ventures reflecting
          increased
          average room rates at the Universal Orlando properties and increased investment
          income as a result of the early repayment of a note received in connection
          with
          the sale of a hotel property contributed $7.1 million to the
          increase.

Net
          income for 2005 increased due to the higher revenues discussed above, partially
          offset by increased interest and operating expenses.

Revenues
          increased by $276.8 million, or 91.4%, and net income increased by $168.5
          million in December 31, 2006, compared to 2005.

Revenues
          increased in 2006, as compared to 2005, due primarily to higher net investment
          income of $242.1 million and increased investment gains of $12.5 million.
          Net
          investment income includes income from the trading portfolio of $223.7
          million
          and $42.8 million ($146.1 million and $27.8 million after taxes) for 2006
          and
          2005. In addition, interest income in 2006 increased due to improved yields
          and
          higher invested amounts.

Net
          income increased in 2006 due primarily to the increased revenues discussed
          above
          and the absence of costs ($23.1 million after taxes) incurred in 2005 associated
          with the early retirement of our $400.0 million principal amount of 7.0%
          senior
          notes due 2023 and $1,150.0 million principal amount of 3.1% exchangeable
          subordinated notes due 2007, as well as reduced interest expense. Net income
          for
          2005 also reflected a lower effective tax rate related to the federal income
          tax
          settlement as discussed below.

The
          lower
          income tax expense in 2005 was primarily due to a review of tax liabilities
          we
          performed subsequent to the settlement of our 1998 through 2001 tax returns
          with
          the Internal Revenue Service. As a result, we reduced our deferred tax
          liabilities by $24.4 million in 2005.

          Compared with 2004

Revenues
          decreased by $204.0 million and net income decreased by $110.5 million
          in the
          year ended December 31, 2005, compared to 2004.

- Corporate and Other -
                    (Continued)

Revenues
          decreased in 2005, as compared to 2004, due primarily to a reduction in
          equity
          income of $188.2 million from shipping operations, and decreased net investment
          income of $34.2 million in 2005.

In
          2004,
          Hellespont sold all of its ultra-large crude oil tankers. We received cash
          distributions from Hellespont and recognized income of $179.3 million ($116.5
          million after taxes). Hellespont had been engaged in the business of owning
          and
          operating four ultra-large crude oil tankers that were used primarily to
          transport crude oil from the Persian Gulf to a limited number of ports
          in the
          Far East, Northern Europe and the United States.

Net
          investment income includes income from the trading portfolio of $42.8 million
          and $105.9 million ($27.8 million and $68.9 million after taxes) for the
          years
          ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Net
          income decreased in 2005 due primarily to the reduced revenues discussed
          above,
          partially offset by lower income tax expense related to the federal income
          tax
          settlement discussed above. Net income for 2005 also included charges of
          $23.1
          million related to the early retirement of our $400.0 million principal
          amount
          of 7.0% senior notes due 2023 and $1,150.0 million principal amount of
          3.1%
          exchangeable subordinated notes due 2007. Net income for 2004 included
          $11.1
          million related to charges from the early retirement of our $300.0 million
          principal amount of 7.6% senior notes due 2023.

LIQUIDITY
          AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CNA
          Financial

Cash
          Flow

CNA’s
          principal operating cash flow sources are premiums and investment income
          from
          its insurance subsidiaries. CNA’s primary operating cash flow uses are payments
          for claims, policy benefits and operating expenses.

For
          2006,
          net cash provided by operating activities was $2,250.0 million as compared
          to
          $2,169.0 million in 2005.

Cash
          provided by operating activities was favorably impacted by increased net
          sales
          of trading securities to fund policyholder withdrawals of investment contract
          products issued by CNA and increased investment income receipts. Policyholder
          fund withdrawals are reflected as financing cash flows. Cash provided by
          operating activities was unfavorably impacted by decreased premium collections,
          increased tax payments, and increased loss payments.

For
          2005,
          net cash provided by operating activities was $2,169.0 million as compared
          to
          $1,968.0 million in 2004. The increase in cash provided by operations was
          primarily driven by a reduction in claims and expense payments, including
          the
          impact of $446.0 million related to commutations. Also impacting operating
          cash
          flows were net tax payments of $164.0 million in 2005 as compared with
          net tax
          refunds of $627.0 million in 2004. In addition, CNA received cash of $121.0
          million related to interest on a federal income tax settlement in
          2005.

Cash
          flows from investing activities include the purchase and sale of financial
          instruments, as well as the purchase and sale of businesses, land, buildings,
          equipment and other assets not generally held for resale.

Net
          cash
          used for investing activities was $1,646.0 million, $1,316.0 million, and
          $2,084.0 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004. Cash flows used by investing
          activities related principally to purchases of fixed maturity securities
          and
          short term investments.

The
          cash
          flow from investing activities is impacted by various factors such as the
          anticipated payment of claims, financing activity, asset/liability management
          and individual security buy and sell decisions made in the normal course
          of
          portfolio management. A consideration in management of the portfolio is
          the
          characteristics of the underlying liabilities and the ability to align
          the
          duration of the portfolio to those liabilities to meet future liquidity
          needs
          and minimize interest rate risk. For portfolios where future liability
          cash
          flows are determinable and are generally long term in nature, management
          segregates assets and related liabilities for asset/liability management
          purposes. The asset/liability management strategy is used to mitigate valuation
          changes due to interest rate risk in those specific portfolios. Another
          consideration in the asset/liability matched portfolios is to maintain
          a level
          of income sufficient to support the underlying insurance
          liabilities.

Liquidity
                    and Capital Resources - CNA Financial -
                    (Continued)

For
          those
          securities in the portfolio that are not part of a segregated asset/liability
          management strategy, CNA typically manages the portfolio to a target duration
          range dictated by the underlying insurance liabilities. In managing these
          portfolios, securities are bought and sold based on individual security
          value
          assessments made, but with the overall goal of meeting the duration
          targets.

For
          and 2005, net cash used for financing activities was $605.0 million and
          $837.0
          million as compared with net cash provided from financing activities of
          $61.0
          million in 2004. Net cash flows used by financing activities in 2006 were
          primarily related to the return of investment contract balances. Additionally,
          CNA issued long-term debt and common stock, the proceeds of which were
          used to
          repurchase the Series H Cumulative Preferred Stock Issue (Series H Issue)
          and to
          repay its 6.75% notes. See the CNA Series H Preferred Stock section below
          for
          further discussion.

CNA
          believes that its present cash flows from operating, investing and financing
          activities are sufficient to fund its working capital needs.

CNA
          has
          an effective shelf registration statement under which it may issue debt
          or
          equity securities.

CNA
          Series H Preferred Stock

In
          December of 2002, CNA sold $750.0 million of a new issue of preferred stock,
          the
          Series H Issue, to us. The Series H Issue accrued cumulative dividends
          at an
          initial rate of 8.0% per year, compounded annually. In August of 2006,
          CNA
          repurchased the Series H Issue for approximately $993.0 million, a price
          equal
          to the liquidation preference.

CNA
          financed the repurchase of the Series H Issue with the proceeds from its
          sales
          of: (i) 7.0 million shares of CNA’s common stock in a public offering for
          approximately $235.5 million; (ii) $400.0 million of new 6.0% five-year
          senior
          notes and $350.0 million of new 6.5% ten-year senior notes in a public
          offering;
          and (iii) 7.86 million shares of CNA’s common stock to us in a private placement
          for approximately $264.5 million. CNA used the proceeds in excess of the
          amount
          used to repurchase the Series H Issue to fund the repayment of its $250.0
          million outstanding 6.75% senior notes in November of 2006.

Commitments,
          Contingencies and Guarantees

CNA
          has
          various commitments, contingencies and guarantees which it becomes involved
          with
          during the ordinary course of business. The impact of these commitments,
          contingencies and guarantees should be considered when evaluating CNA’s
          liquidity and capital resources.

Regulatory
          Matters

CNA
          previously established a plan to reorganize and streamline its U.S. property
          and
          casualty insurance legal entity structure in order to realize capital,
          operational, and cost efficiencies. Another phase of this multi-year plan
          has
          been completed with the mergers of thirteen of CNA’s U.S. property and casualty
          insurance entities into other CNA insurance entities. Effective December
          31,
          2006, twelve companies merged, either directly or indirectly, with and
          into CIC,
          and one company merged directly into CCC. CNA also reduced the number of
          states
          in which these entities are domiciled as part of this phase. Previous phases
          of
          this plan served to consolidate CNA’s U.S. property and casualty insurance risks
          into CCC, as well as realign the capital supporting these risks. In order
          to
          facilitate the execution of this plan, CNA has agreed to participate in
          a
          working group consisting of several states of the NAIC. Pursuant to CNA’s
          participation in this working group, CNA has agreed to certain time frames
          and
          informational provisions in relation to the reorganization plan.

Along
          with other companies in the industry, CNA has received subpoenas,
          interrogatories and inquiries from: (i) California, Connecticut, Delaware,
          Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North
          Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, West Virginia and the Canadian
          Council of Insurance Regulators concerning investigations into practices
          including contingent compensation arrangements, fictitious quotes and tying
          arrangements; (ii) the SEC, the New York State Attorney General, the United
          States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, the Connecticut
          Attorney
          General, the Connecticut Department of Insurance, the Delaware Department
          of
          Insurance, the Georgia Office of Insurance and Safety Fire Commissioner
          and the
          California Department of Insurance

          reinsurance products and finite insurance products purchased and sold by
          CNA;
          (iii) the Massachusetts Attorney General and the Connecticut Attorney General
          concerning investigations into anti-competitive practices; and (iv) the
          New York
          State Attorney General concerning declinations of attorney malpractice
          insurance. CNA continues to respond to these subpoenas, interrogatories
          and
          inquiries to the extent they are still open.

Subsequent
          to receipt of the SEC subpoena, CNA produced documents and provided additional
          information at the SEC’s request. In addition, the SEC and representatives of
          the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York
          conducted interviews with several of CNA’s current and former executives
          relating to the restatement of CNA’s financial results for 2004, including CNA’s
          relationship with and accounting for transactions with an affiliate that
          were
          the basis for the restatement. The SEC also requested information relating
          to
          CNA’s restatement in 2006 of prior period results. It is possible that CNA’s
          analyses of, or accounting treatment for, finite reinsurance contracts
          or
          discontinued operations could be questioned or disputed by regulatory
          authorities. As a result, further restatements of the financial results
          is
          possible.

Ratings

Ratings
          are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance
          companies. CNA’s insurance company subsidiaries are rated by major rating
          agencies, and these ratings reflect the rating agency’s opinion of the insurance
          company’s financial strength, operating performance, strategic position and
          ability to meet its obligations to policyholders. Agency ratings are not
          a
          recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security, and may be revised or
          withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization. Each agency’s rating should
          be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating. One or more of these
          agencies could take action in the future to change the ratings of CNA’s
          insurance subsidiaries.

The
          table
          below reflects the various group ratings issued by A.M. Best Company (“A.M.
          Best”), Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”), Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”)
          and Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”) as of January 24, 2007 for the Property and Casualty
          and Life companies. The table also includes the ratings for CNA’s senior debt
          and Continental senior debt.

(a)

A.M.
                    Best, Fitch, Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s outlooks are stable for
                    CNA’s debt and insurance financial strength
                    ratings.

If
          CNA’s
          property and casualty insurance financial strength ratings were downgraded
          below
          current levels, CNA’s business and our results of operations could be materially
          adversely affected. The severity of the impact on CNA’s business is dependent on
          the level of downgrade and, for certain products, which rating agency takes
          the
          rating action. Among the adverse effects in the event of such downgrades
          would
          be the inability to obtain a material volume of business from certain major
          insurance brokers, the inability to sell a material volume of CNA’s insurance
          products to certain markets and the required collateralization of certain
          future
          payment obligations or reserves.

In
          addition, we believe that a lowering of our debt ratings by certain of
          these
          agencies could result in an adverse impact on CNA’s ratings, independent of any
          change in circumstances at CNA. None of the major rating agencies which
          rates us
          currently maintains a negative outlook or has us on negative Credit
          Watch.

CNA
          has
          entered into several settlement agreements and assumed reinsurance contracts
          that require collateralization of future payment obligations and assumed
          reserves if CNA’s ratings or other specific criteria fall below certain
          thresholds. The ratings triggers are generally more than one level below
          CNA’s
          current ratings.

Dividend
          Paying Ability

CNA’s
          ability to pay dividends and other credit obligations is significantly
          dependent
          on receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries. The payment of dividends
          to CNA
          by its insurance subsidiaries without prior approval of the insurance department
          of each subsidiary’s domiciliary jurisdiction is limited by formula. Dividends
          in excess of these amounts are subject to prior approval by the respective
          state
          insurance departments.

Further
          information on CNA’s dividends from subsidiaries is provided in Note 16 of the
          Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

Lorillard

Lorillard
          and other cigarette manufacturers continue to be confronted with substantial
          litigation. Plaintiffs in most of the cases seek unspecified amounts of
          compensatory damages and punitive damages, although some seek damages ranging
          into the billions of dollars. Plaintiffs in some of the cases seek treble
          damages, statutory damages, disgorgement of profits, equitable and injunctive
          relief, and medical monitoring, among other damages.

Lorillard
          believes that it has valid defenses to the cases pending against it. Lorillard
          also believes it has valid bases for appeal of the adverse verdicts against
          it.
          To the extent we are a defendant in any of the lawsuits, we believe that
          we are
          not a proper defendant in these matters and have moved or plan to move
          for
          dismissal of all such claims against us. While Lorillard intends to defend
          vigorously all tobacco products liability litigation, it is not possible
          to
          predict the outcome of any of this litigation. Litigation is subject to
          many
          uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these actions could be decided
          unfavorably. Lorillard may enter into discussions in an attempt to settle
          particular cases if it believes it is appropriate to do so.

Except
          for the impact of the State Settlement Agreements as described below, we
          are
          unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that
          could
          result from an unfavorable outcome of pending tobacco related litigation
          and,
          therefore, no provision has been made in the Consolidated Financial Statements
          for any unfavorable outcome. It is possible that our results of operations,
          cash
          flows and our financial position could be materially adversely affected
          by an
          unfavorable outcome of certain pending litigation.

The
          State
          Settlement Agreements require

Lorillard
          and

the

other

Original
          Participating Manufacturers (“OPMs”) to make

aggregate

annual
          payments of $8.4 billion through 2007 and $9.4 billion thereafter, subject
          to
          adjustment for several factors

described below

.

In
          addition, the

OPMs

are
          required to pay plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees, subject to an

aggregate

annual
          cap of $500.0 million, as well as an additional

aggregate

amount
          of
          up to $125.0 million in each year through 2008. These payment obligations
          are
          the several and not joint obligations of each

of
          the
          OPMs

.
          We
          believe that Lorillard’s obligations under the State Settlement Agreements will
          materially adversely affect our cash flows and operating income in future
          years.

Both
          the
          aggregate payment

obligations

of the
          OPMs, and the payment obligations of Lorillard, individually,

under
          the State Settlement Agreements are subject to adjustment for

several
          factors which include:

·

inflation

;

·

aggregate

volume of domestic cigarette shipments

;

·

market
                    share; and

·

industry
                    operating income

.

The
          inflation adjustment increases payments on a compounded annual basis by
          the
          greater of 3.0% or the actual total percentage change in the consumer price
          index for the preceding year. The inflation adjustment is measured starting
          with
          inflation for 1999. The volume adjustment increases or decreases payments
          based
          on the increase or decrease in the total number of cigarettes shipped in
          or to
          the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico by the OPMs
          during
          the preceding year, as compared to the 1997 base

year
          shipments

.
          If
          volume has increased, the volume adjustment would increase the annual payment
          by
          the same percentage as the number of cigarettes shipped exceeds the 1997
          base
          number.

Lorillard
                    - (Continued)

If
          volume
          has decreased, the volume adjustment would decrease the annual payment
          by

98.0%
          of
          the percentage reduction in volume.

In
          addition, downward

adjustments to the annual payments for changes in volume may, subject to
          specified conditions and exceptions, be reduced in the event of an increase
          in
          the OPMs aggregate operating income from domestic sales of cigarettes over
          base
          year levels established in the State Settlement Agreements, adjusted for
          inflation. Any adjustments resulting from increases in operating income
          would be
          allocated among those OPMs who have had increases.

Lorillard’s
          cash payment under the State Settlement Agreements in 2006 was $889.9
          million

including

Lorillard’s deposit of $108.0 million in an interest-bearing escrow account in
          accordance with procedures established in the MSA pending resolution of
          a claim
          by Lorillard and the OPMs that they are entitled to reduce their MSA payments
          based on a loss of market share to non-participating manufacturers. Most
          of the
          states that are parties to the MSA are disputing the availability of the
          reduction and Lorillard believes that this dispute will ultimately be resolved
          by judicial and arbitration proceedings. Lorillard’s $108.0 million reduction is
          based upon the OPMs collective loss of market share in 2003.

Lorillard
          and the OPMs have the right to claim additional reductions of MSA payments
          in
          subsequent years under provisions of the MSA.

Lorillard anticipates the amount payable in 2007 will be approximately

$925.0

million
          to

$975.0

million

,
          primarily based on 2006 estimated industry volume.

See
          Item
          3 - Legal Proceedings and Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
          Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information
          regarding this settlement and other litigation matters.

Lorillard’s
          cash and investments, net of receivables and payables, totaled $1,768.7
          million
          and $1,750.1 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. At December
          31, 2006, 87.2% of Lorillard’s cash and investments were invested in short-term
          securities.

The
          principal source of liquidity for Lorillard’s business and operating needs is
          internally generated funds from its operations. Lorillard’s operating activities
          resulted in a net cash inflow of approximately $778.2 million for the year
          ended
          December 31, 2006, compared to $820.3 million for the prior year. Lorillard
          believes, based on current conditions, that cash flows from operating activities
          will be sufficient to enable it to meet its obligations under the State
          Settlement Agreements and to fund its capital expenditures. Lorillard cannot
          predict the impact on its cash flows of cash requirements related to any
          future
          settlements or judgments, including cash required to bond any appeals,
          if
          necessary, or the impact of subsequent legislative actions, and thus can
          give no
          assurance that it will be able to meet all of those requirements.

Boardwalk
          Pipeline

At
          December 31, 2006 and 2005, cash and investments amounted to $399.0 million
          and
          $65.8 million, respectively. Funds from operations for the year ended December
          31, 2006 amounted to $255.6 million, compared to $218.7 million in 2005.
          In 2006
          and 2005,

Boardwalk
          Pipeline’s capital expenditures were $196.7 million and $83.0 million,
          respectively.

In
          June
          of 2006, Boardwalk Pipeline and certain of its subsidiaries entered into
          a
          $400.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility which amended and restated
          the previous $200.0 million facility entered into at the time of its initial
          public offering. Interest on amounts drawn under the credit facility is
          payable
          at a floating rate equal to an applicable spread per annum over the London
          Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or a base rate defined as the greater of the
          prime rate or the Federal funds rate plus 50 basis points. As of December
          31,
          2006, Boardwalk Pipeline was in compliance with all the covenant requirements
          under its credit agreement and no funds were drawn under this facility.
          The
          revolving credit facility has a maturity date of June 29, 2011.

In
          the
          fourth quarter of 2006, Boardwalk Pipeline sold 6,900,000 common units
          at a
          price of $29.65 per unit in a public offering and received net proceeds
          of
          $195.2 million. In addition, we contributed $4.2 million to maintain our
          2.0%
          general partner interest.

In
          November of 2006, Boardwalk Pipeline completed an offering of $250.0 million
          of
          5.9% senior notes due 2016 and received net proceeds of approximately $248.3
          million. To hedge the risk attributable to changes in the risk-free component
          of
          forward 10-year interest rates through December 1, 2006, on October 5,

into
          a
          Treasury rate lock for a notional amount of $250.0 million of principal.
          The
          reference rate on the Treasury rate lock was 4.6%. The Treasury rate lock
          was
          settled at the time of the closing of its debt offering in November of
          2006.
          Boardwalk Pipeline received $0.9 million from the counterparty as a result
          of
          the settlement of the Treasury rate lock, which has been recorded as a
          component
          of accumulated other comprehensive income. The amount of the credit in
          accumulated other comprehensive income will be recognized in income as
          a
          reduction to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the 10-year
          term of
          the 5.9% senior notes.

The
          proceeds of the equity and debt offerings will be used to finance its expansion
          activities. Boardwalk Pipeline used $90.0 million of the proceeds to repay
          outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility which had been
          used
          to finance expansion activities.

Boardwalk
          Pipeline is currently engaged in several major pipeline and storage expansion
          projects that will require the investment of approximately $3.3 billion
          of
          capital resources from 2007 to 2009 (before taking into account equity
          that
          would be contributed by the purchaser of a 49.0% interest in Gulf Crossing
          Pipeline). The pipeline expansion projects will transport natural gas supplies
          from the Bossier Sands, Barnett Shale, Fayetteville Shale and the Caney/Woodford
          Shale areas in East Texas, Arkansas and Oklahoma to existing or new assets
          and
          third-party interstate pipeline interconnects. For more information on
          Boardwalk
          Pipeline’s expansion projects, please read “Expansion Projects” in Item 1 of
          this Report.

For
          the
          year ending December 31, 2007, Boardwalk Pipeline expects to make capital
          expenditures of approximately $1.7 billion, of which it expects approximately
          $1.6 billion for the expansion projects discussed in Item 1 and approximately
          $60.0 million to be for maintenance capital. The amount of expansion capital
          Boardwalk Pipeline expends in 2007 could vary significantly depending on
          the
          progress made with these projects, the number and types of other capital
          projects Boardwalk Pipeline decides to pursue, the timing of any of those
          projects and numerous other factors beyond Boardwalk Pipeline’s control.

Boardwalk
          Pipeline entered into Treasury rate locks with two counterparties in August
          of
          2006 each for a notional amount of $100.0 million of principal to hedge
          the risk
          attributable to changes in the risk-free component of forward 10-year interest
          rates through August 1, 2007. The reference rates on the Treasury rate
          locks
          were 5.0%. Under the terms of the Treasury rate locks, settlement amounts
          will
          be paid to either Boardwalk Pipeline or the counterparties depending on
          the
          movement of the 10-year Treasury rate versus the reference rates.

Boardwalk
          Pipeline expects to fund its 2007 maintenance capital expenditures from
          operating cash flows and its 2007 expansion capital expenditures with a
          combination of borrowings under the revolving credit facility and proceeds
          from
          sales of debt and equity securities.

During
          the year ended December 31, 2006, Boardwalk Pipeline paid cash distributions
          of
          $1.3188 per unit.

In
          February of 2007, Boardwalk Pipeline declared a quarterly distribution
          of $0.415
          per unit.

Diamond
          Offshore

Cash
          and
          investments, net of receivables and payables, totaled $825.8 million at
          December
          31, 2006 compared to $844.8 at December 31, 2005. Cash provided by operating
          activities was $760.1 million in 2006, compared to $388.6 million in 2005.

The
          increase in cash flow from operations in 2006 is the result of higher
          utilization and average dayrates earned by Diamond Offshore’s drilling units as
          a result of an increase in overall demand for offshore contract drilling
          services.

Diamond
          Offshore estimates that capital expenditures for rig modifications and
          new
          construction in 2007 and 2008 will be approximately $456.0 million. As
          of
          December 31, 2006, Diamond Offshore spent approximately $418.4 million
          for the
          upgrade of two rigs and construction of two new jack-up rigs.

Diamond
          Offshore estimates that capital expenditures in 2007 associated with its
          ongoing
          rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs and other corporate
          requirements will be approximately $316.0 million. In 2006, Diamond Offshore
          spent approximately $273.2 million for capital additions.

                    of Operations

Liquidity
                    and Capital Resources - Diamond Offshore -
                    (Continued)

In
          November of 2006, Diamond Offshore entered into a $285.0 million syndicated,
          5-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate
          purposes, including loans and performance or standby letters of credit.
          As of
          December 31, 2006, there were no amounts outstanding under this credit
          facility.

Diamond
          Offshore’s liquidity and capital requirements are primarily a function of its
          working capital needs, capital expenditures and debt service
          requirements.

Cash
          required to meet Diamond Offshore’s capital commitments is determined by
          evaluating the need to upgrade rigs to meet specific customer requirements
          and
          by evaluating Diamond Offshore’s ongoing rig equipment replacement and
          enhancement programs, including water depth and drilling capability upgrades.
          It
          is the opinion of Diamond Offshore’s management that its operating cash flows
          and cash reserves will be sufficient to meet these capital commitments;
          however,
          Diamond Offshore will continue to make periodic assessments based on industry
          conditions.

When
          Diamond Offshore renewed its principal insurance policies effective May
          1, 2006,
          coverage for offshore drilling rigs, if available, was offered at substantially
          higher premiums than in the past and subject to an increasing number of
          coverage
          limitations, due in part to underwriting losses suffered by the insurance
          industry as a result of damage caused by hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico
          in
          2004 and 2005. In some cases, quoted renewal premiums increased by more
          than
          200%, with the addition of substantial deductibles and limits on the amount
          of
          claims payable for losses arising from named windstorms. In light of these
          factors, Diamond Offshore determined that retention of additional risk
          was
          preferable to paying dramatically higher premiums for limited coverage.
          Accordingly, Diamond Offshore elected to self-insure for physical damage
          to rigs
          and equipment caused by named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. For
          other
          physical damage coverage, its deductible is $150.0 million per occurrence.
          As a
          result of Diamond Offshore’s reduced coverage, premiums for this coverage were
          reduced from the amounts paid in 2005 and were lower than the renewal rates
          quoted by its insurance carriers. Diamond Offshore also renewed its liability
          policies in May of 2006, with an increase in premiums and deductibles.
          The new
          deductibles under these policies have generally increased to $5.0 million
          per
          occurrence, but Diamond Offshore’s deductibles arising in connection with
          certain liabilities relating to named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico
          have
          increased to $10.0 million per occurrence, with no annual aggregate deductible.
          In addition, Diamond Offshore elected to self-insure a portion of its excess
          liability coverage related to named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
          To
          the extent that Diamond Offshore incurs liabilities related to named windstorms
          in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in excess of $75.0 million, Diamond Offshore
          is
          self-insured for up to a maximum retention of $17.5 million per occurrence
          in
          addition to these deductibles. Diamond Offshore is currently in the early
          stages
          of renewing its insurance policies that expire on May 1, 2007. Diamond
          Offshore
          is unable to predict what changes, if any, it may make to its insurance
          coverage
          effective May 1, 2007. If named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico cause
          significant damage to its rigs or equipment, or to the property of others
          for
          which Diamond Offshore may be liable, it could have a material adverse
          effect on
          the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash
          flows.

In
          the
          first quarter of 2006, Diamond Offshore paid a special cash dividend of
          $1.50
          per share. In addition, Diamond Offshore paid regular quarterly cash dividends
          aggregating $0.50 per share during the year ended December 31, 2006. In
          the
          first quarter of 2007, Diamond Offshore declared a special cash dividend
          of
          $4.00 per share of its common stock payable on March 1, 2007 to shareholders
          of
          record on February 14, 2007.

Subsequent
          to December 31, 2006 and through February 14, 2007, the holders of $438.4
          million in principal amount of Diamond Offshore’s 1.5% Debentures converted
          their outstanding debentures into 8,943,284 shares of Diamond Offshore’s common
          stock. As a result of these conversions, $21.5 million aggregate principal
          amount of the 1.5% Debentures remained outstanding as of February 14, 2007.
          The
          cash requirements for the interest payable to holders of its 1.5% debentures
          will be reduced due to the decrease in the outstanding principal
          amount.

Cash
          and
          short-term investments increased to $24.5 million at December 31, 2006

          operating requirements. Funds for other capital expenditures and working
          capital
          requirements are expected to be provided from existing cash balances and
          operations.

In
          October of 2006, Loews Hotels entered into a joint venture with a single
          investor to fund acquisitions and/or develop hotels. Loews Hotels will
          manage
          the operations of all hotels acquired by the joint venture. As of December
          31,

          billion, as compared to $2.9 billion at December 31, 2005. The increase
          in net
          cash and investments is primarily due to the receipt of $1,306.4 million
          in
          dividends from subsidiaries and net proceeds of $728.4 million from CNA’s
          repurchase of its Series H preferred stock. We also received net proceeds
          of
          $876.8 million and $751.5 million from the sale of 15,000,000 shares of
          Carolina
          Group stock in each of August and May of 2006. During 2006 we paid out
          $307.7
          million of dividends to our shareholders, $509.8 million to repurchase
          Loews
          common stock and $300.0 million to repay at maturity our principal amount
          of
          6.8% senior notes.

As
          of
          December 31, 2006, there were 544,203,457 shares of Loews common stock
          outstanding and 108,325,806 shares of Carolina Group stock outstanding.
          Depending on market and other conditions, we may purchase shares of our,
          and our
          subsidiaries’, outstanding common stock in the open market or otherwise. During
          2006, we purchased 13,934,500 shares of Loews common stock at an aggregate
          cost
          of $509.8 million.

Off-Balance
          Sheet Arrangements

In
          the
          course of selling business entities and assets to third parties, CNA has
          agreed
          to indemnify purchasers for losses arising out of breaches of representation
          and
          warranties with respect to the business entities or assets being sold,
          including, in certain cases, losses arising from undisclosed liabilities
          or
          certain named litigation. Such indemnification provisions generally survive
          for
          periods ranging from nine months following the applicable closing date
          to the
          expiration of the relevant statutes of limitation. As of December 31, 2006,
          the
          aggregate amount of quantifiable indemnification agreements in effect for
          sales
          of CNA business entities, assets, and third party loans was $933.0
          million.

In
          addition, CNA has agreed to provide indemnification to third party purchasers
          for certain losses associated with sold business entities or assets that
          are not
          limited by a contractual monetary amount. As of December 31, 2006, CNA
          had
          outstanding unlimited indemnifications in connection with the sales of
          certain
          of their business entities or assets that included tax liabilities arising
          from
          prior to a purchaser’s ownership of an entity or asset, defects in title at the
          time of sale, employee claims arising prior to closing and in some cases,
          losses
          arising from certain litigation and undisclosed liabilities. These
          indemnification agreements survive until the applicable statues of limitation
          expire, or until the agreed upon contract terms expire. As of December
          31, 2006,
          CNA has recorded approximately $28.0 million of liabilities related to
          the CNA
          indemnification agreements.

At
          December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had no other off-balance sheet debt or other
          arrangements.

          will be approximately $925.0 million to $975.0 million, primarily based
          on 2006
          estimated industry volume. Payment obligations are not incurred until the
          related sales occur and therefore are not reflected in the above
          table.

INVESTMENTS

Investment
          activities of non-insurance companies include investments in fixed income
          securities, equity securities including short sales, derivative instruments
          and
          short-term investments, and are carried at fair value. Equity securities,
          which
          are considered part of our trading portfolio, short sales and derivative
          instruments are marked to market and reported as net investment income
          in the
          Consolidated Statements of Income.

We
          enter
          into short sales and invest in certain derivative instruments that are
          used for
          asset and liability management activities, income enhancements to our portfolio
          management strategy and to benefit from anticipated future movements in
          the
          underlying markets. If such movements do not occur as anticipated, then
          significant losses may occur. Monitoring procedures include senior management
          review of daily detailed reports of existing positions and valuation
          fluctuations to ensure that open positions are consistent with our portfolio
          strategy.

                    - (Continued)

Credit
          exposure associated with non-performance by the counterparties to derivative
          instruments is generally limited to the uncollateralized change in fair
          value of
          the derivative instruments recognized in the Consolidated Balance

Sheets.
          We mitigate

the
          risk
          of non-

performance
          by monitoring the creditworthiness of counterparties and diversifying
          derivatives to multiple counter-parties. We occasionally require collateral
          from
          our derivative investment counterparties depending on the amount of the
          exposure
          and the credit rating of the counterparty.

We
          do not
          believe that any of the derivative instruments we use are unusually complex,
          nor
          do the use of these instruments, in our opinion, result in a higher degree
          of
          risk. See “Results of Operations,” “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
          about Market Risk” and Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
          included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information with respect
          to
          derivative instruments, including recognized gains and losses on these
          instruments.

There
                    was no change in net unrealized gains (losses) on trading securities
                    included in net investment income for the year ended December
                    31, 2006.
                    The change in net unrealized gains (losses) on trading securities,
                    included in net investment income, was $(7.0) and $2.0 million
                    for the
                    years ended December 31, 2005 and
                    2004.

Net
          investment income increased by $520.3 million for 2006 compared with 2005.
          The
          improvement was primarily driven by interest rate increases across fixed
          maturity securities and short term investments, an increase in the overall
          invested asset base resulting from improved cash flow and a reduction of
          interest expense on funds withheld and other deposits. During 2006 and
          2005, CNA
          commuted several significant finite reinsurance contracts which contained
          interest crediting provisions and as a result, interest expense on funds
          withheld has declined significantly. No further interest expense is due
          on the
          funds withheld on the commuted contracts. The pretax interest expense on
          funds
          withheld related to these significant commuted contracts was $14.0 million,
          $84.0 million and $146.0 million for December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
          and was
          reflected as a component of Net investment income in our Consolidated Statements
          of Income. The 2005 and 2004 amounts include the interest charges associated
          with the contract commuted in 2006. See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated
          Financial Statements included under Item 8 for additional information for
          interest costs on funds withheld and other deposits. Also impacting net
          investment income was increased income from the trading portfolio of $55.9
          million. The increased income from the trading portfolio was largely offset
          by a
          corresponding increase in the policyholders’ funds reserves supported by the
          trading portfolio, which is included in Insurance claims and policyholders’
benefits on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Net
          investment income increased by $212.4 million for 2005 compared with 2004.
          This
          increase was due to the reduced interest expense on funds withheld and
          other
          deposits discussed above and improved results across all other
          available-for-sale asset classes, especially short term investments, due
          to the
          improved period over period yields. This improvement was partly offset
          by
          decreases in investment income from the trading portfolio.

Net
          realized investment results increased by $69.8 million for 2006 compared
          with
          2005. The increase in net realized investment results was primarily driven
          by
          improved results in fixed maturity securities, partially offset by increases
          in
          interest rate related other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) losses for which
          CNA did not assert an intent to hold until an anticipated recovery in value.
          For
          2006, OTTI losses of $101.2 million were recorded primarily in the corporate
          and
          other taxable bonds sector. Other realized investment gains (losses) for
          the
          year ended December 31, 2006, included a $33.4 million pretax gain related
          to a
          settlement received as a result of bankruptcy litigation of a major
          telecommunications corporation.

Net
          realized investment results improved $130.2 million in 2005 compared with
          2004.
          This improvement was primarily the result of a 2004 loss of $352.9 million
          on
          the sale of the individual life insurance business, partly offset by reduced
          gains for equities securities. Equity results in 2004 included a gain of
          $95.8
          million related to CNA’s investment in Canary Wharf Group PLC, a London-based
          real estate company. Also impacting results for 2005 versus 2004 were decreased
          results in the overall fixed maturity asset class partly offset by improved
          results for the derivatives asset class. OTTI losses of $63.9 million were
          recorded in 2005 across various sectors, including an OTTI loss of $20.1
          million
          related to loans made under a credit facility to a national contractor,
          that are
          classified as fixed maturities. OTTI losses of $54.8 million were recorded
          in
          2004 across various sectors, including an OTTI loss of $32.9 million related
          to
          loans to the national contractor. For additional information on loans to
          the
          national contractor, see Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
          Statements included under Item 8. Other realized investment gains (losses)
          for
          the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 include gains and losses related
          to
          the sales of certain operations or affiliates that are described in Note
          14 of
          the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item
          8.

A
          primary
          objective in the management of the fixed maturity and equity portfolios
          is to
          optimize return relative to underlying liabilities and respective liquidity
          needs. CNA’s views on the current interest rate environment, tax regulations,
          asset class valuations, specific security issuer and broader industry segment
          conditions, and the domestic and global economic conditions, are some of
          the
          factors that enter into an investment decision. CNA also continually monitors
          exposure to issuers of securities held and broader industry sector exposures
          and
          may from time to time adjust such exposures based on its views of a specific
          issuer or industry sector.


Item
                    7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
                    of Operations

Investments
                    - (Continued)

The
          investment portfolio is periodically analyzed for changes in duration and
          related price change risk. Additionally, CNA periodically reviews the
          sensitivity of the portfolio to the level of foreign exchange rates and
          other
          factors that contribute to market price changes. A summary of these risks
          and
          specific analysis on changes is included in Item 7A - Quantitative and
          Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk included herein.

CNA
          invests in certain derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce
          its
          exposure to market risk (principally interest rate, equity price and foreign
          currency risk) and credit risk (risk of nonperformance of underlying obligor).
          Derivative securities are recorded at fair value at the reporting date.
          CNA also
          uses derivatives to mitigate market risk by purchasing S&P 500 index futures
          in a notional amount equal to the contract liability relating to Life and
          Group
          Non-Core indexed group annuity contracts. CNA provided collateral to satisfy
          margin deposits on exchange-traded derivatives totaling $27.0 million as
          of
          December 31, 2006. For over-the-counter derivative transactions CNA utilizes
          International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) Master Agreements that
          specify certain limits over which collateral is exchanged. As of December
          31,
          2006, we provided $31.0 million of cash as collateral for over-the-counter
          derivative instruments.

A
          further
          consideration in the management of the investment portfolio is the
          characteristics of the underlying liabilities and the ability to align
          the
          duration of the portfolio to those liabilities to meet future liquidity
          needs,
          minimize interest rate risk and maintain a level of income sufficient to
          support
          the underlying insurance liabilities. For portfolios where future liability
          cash
          flows are determinable and long term in nature, CNA segregates assets for
          asset
          liability management purposes.

CNA
          classifies its fixed maturity securities (bonds and redeemable preferred
          stocks)
          and its equity securities as either available-for-sale or trading, and
          as such,
          they are carried at fair value. The amortized cost of fixed maturity securities
          is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to
          maturity,
          which is included in net investment income. Changes in fair value related
          to
          available-for-sale securities are reported as a component of other comprehensive
          income. Changes in fair value of trading securities are reported within
          net
          investment income.

The
          following table provides further detail of gross realized gains and losses
          on

CNA’s
          general account investments consist primarily of asset-backed securities,
          corporate securities, short term investments, municipal and U.S. treasury
          securities.

A
          significant judgment in the valuation of investments is the determination
          of
          when an OTTI has occurred. CNA analyzes securities on at least a quarterly
          basis. Part of this analysis is to monitor the length of time and severity
          of
          the decline below book value for those securities in an unrealized loss
          position. Information on CNA’s OTTI process is set forth in Note 2 of the Notes
          to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

Investments
          in the general account had a total net unrealized gain of $966.0 million
          at
          December 31, 2006 compared with $787.0 million at December 31, 2005. The
          unrealized position at December 31, 2006 was comprised of a net unrealized
          gain
          of $716.0 million for fixed maturities, a net unrealized gain of $249.0
          million
          for equity securities, and a net unrealized gain of $1.0 million for short
          term
          securities. The unrealized position at December 31, 2005 was comprised
          of a net
          unrealized gain of $618.0 million for fixed maturities, a net unrealized
          gain of
          $170.0 million for equity

securities,
          and a net unrealized loss of $1.0 million for short term securities. See

Consolidated
          Financial Statements included under Item 8 for further detail on the unrealized
          position of CNA’s general account investment portfolio.

CNA’s
          investment policies for both the general account and separate account emphasize
          high credit quality and diversification by industry, issuer and issue.
          Assets
          supporting interest rate sensitive liabilities are segmented within the
          general
          account to facilitate asset/liability duration management.

The
          following table provides the composition of fixed maturity securities with
          an
          unrealized loss at December 31, 2006 in relation to the total of all fixed
          maturity securities with an unrealized loss by maturity profile. Securities
          not
          due at a single date are allocated based on weighted average life.

As
          part
          of the ongoing OTTI monitoring process,

CNA
          evaluated the facts and circumstances based on available information for
          each of
          the non-investment grade securities and determined that the securities
          presented
          in the above tables were temporarily impaired when evaluated at December
          31,
          2006 and 2005. This determination was based on a number of factors that
          CNA
          regularly considers including, but not limited to: the issuers’ ability to meet
          current and future interest and principal payments, an evaluation of the
          issuers’ financial condition and near term prospects, CNA’s assessment of the
          sector outlook and estimates of the fair value of any underlying collateral.
          In
          all cases where a decline

in
          value
          is judged to be temporary,

CNA
          has
          the intent and ability to hold these securities for a period of time sufficient
          to recover the book value of its investment through an anticipated recovery
          in
          the fair value of such securities or by holding the securities to maturity.
          In
          many cases, the securities held are matched to liabilities as part of ongoing
          asset/liability duration management. As such, CNA continually assesses
          its
          ability to hold securities for a time sufficient to recover any temporary
          loss
          in value or until maturity. CNA believes it has sufficient levels of liquidity
          so as to not impact the asset/liability management process.

CNA’s
          equity securities classified as available-for-sale as of December 31, 2006
          that
          were in an unrealized loss position had a fair value of $14.0 million and
          unrealized losses of $1 million. Under the same process as followed for
          fixed
          maturity securities, CNA monitors the equity securities for other-than-temporary
          declines in value. In all cases where a decline in value is judged to be
          temporary, CNA has the intent and ability to hold these securities for
          a period
          of time sufficient to recover the book value of its investment through
          anticipated recovery in the fair value of such securities.

Invested
          assets are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, market and
          credit
          risk. Due to the level of risk associated with certain invested assets
          and the
          level of uncertainty related to changes in the value of these assets, it
          is
          possible that changes in these risks in the near term, including increases
          in
          interest rates, could have an adverse material impact on our results of
          operations or equity.

          general account portfolio consists primarily of high quality bonds, 90.9%

          million, which represents 0.4% of our total investment portfolio. These
          securities were in a net unrealized gain position of $143.0 million at
          December
          31, 2006. Of these securities, 80.0% are priced by unrelated third party

Included
          in CNA’s general account fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2006 were
          $13,732.0 million of asset-backed securities, at fair value, consisting
          of
          approximately 63.0% in collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”), 21.0% in
          corporate asset-backed obligations, 14.0% in corporate mortgage-backed
          pass-through certificates and 2.0% in U.S. Government agency issued pass-through

ACCOUNTING
          STANDARDS

In
          September of 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS
          No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.”

SFAS
          No.
          157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value
          in
          accordance with GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
          SFAS
          No. 157 retains the exchange price notion in the definition of fair value
          and
          clarifies that the exchange price is the price in an orderly transaction
          between
          market participants to sell the asset or transfer the liability in the
          market in
          which the reporting entity would transact for the asset or liability. SFAS
          No.
          157 emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an
          entity-specific measurement and the fair value measurement should be determined
          based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing
          the asset
          or liability. SFAS No. 157 expands disclosures surrounding the use of fair
          value
          to measure assets and liabilities and specifically focuses on the sources
          used
          to measure fair value. In instances of recurring use of fair value measures
          using unobservable inputs, SFAS No. 157 requires separate disclosure of
          the
          effect on earnings for the period.

SFAS No.
          157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We
          are
          currently evaluating the impact that adopting SFAS No. 157 will have on
          our
          results of operations and equity.

In
          July
          of 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 48, “Accounting for
          Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.” FIN 48
          prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should

recognize,
          measure, present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax
          positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return.
          FIN 48
          states that a tax benefit from an uncertain position may be recognized
          only if
          it is “more likely than not” that the position is sustainable, based on its
          technical merits. The tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest
          amount
          of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized
          upon
          ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all
          relevant information. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
          December 15, 2006. We are currently evaluating the impact that adopting
          FIN 48
          will have and expect an impact to operations and equity of approximately
          $40.0
          million, after minority interest.

In
          March
          of 2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) 85-4-1, “Accounting for
          Life Settlement Contracts by Third-Party Investors.” A life settlement contract
          for purposes of FSP 85-4-1 is a contract between the owner of a life insurance
          policy (the “policy owner”) and a third-party investor (“investor”). The
          previous accounting guidance, FASB Technical Bulletin (“FTB”) No. 85-4,
“Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance”, required the purchaser of life
          insurance contracts to account for the life insurance contract at its cash
          surrender value. Because life insurance contracts are purchased in the
          secondary
          market at amounts in excess of the policies’ cash surrender values, the
          application of guidance in FTB 85-4 created a loss upon acquisition of
          the
          policy. FSP 85-4-1 provides initial and subsequent measurement guidance
          and
          financial statement presentation and disclosure guidance for investments
          by
          third-party investors in life settlement contracts. FSP 85-4-1 allows an
          investor to elect to account for its investments in life settlement contracts
          using either the investment method or the fair value method. The election
          shall
          be made on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable. FSP 85-4-1
          is
          effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2006. CNA has elected
          to
          account for its investment in life settlement contracts using the fair
          value
          method and the initial expected impact upon adoption under the fair value
          method
          will be an increase to retained earnings as of January 1, 2007 of approximately
          $34.0 million.

In
          September 2005, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the American
          Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position
          (“SOP”)
          05-01, “Accounting by Insurance Enterprises for Deferred Acquisition Costs in
          Connection with Modifications or Exchanges of Insurance Contracts.” SOP 05-01
          provides guidance on accounting by insurance enterprises for deferred
          acquisition costs on internal replacements of insurance and investment
          contracts
          other than those specifically described in SFAS No. 97, “Accounting and
          Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts
          and for
          Realized Gains and Losses from the Sale of Investments.” SOP 05-01 defines an
          internal replacement as a modification in product benefits, features, rights,
          or
          coverages that occurs by the exchange of a contract for a new contract,
          or by
          amendment, endorsement, or rider to a contract, or by the election of a
          feature
          or coverage within a contract. SOP 05-01 is effective for internal replacements
          occurring in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. Adoption of
          SOP
          05-01 is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations
          or
          financial condition.

SUPPLEMENTAL
          FINANCIAL INFORMATION

The
          following supplemental condensed financial information reflects the financial
          position, results of operations and cash flows of Loews Corporation with
          our
          investments in CNA and Diamond Offshore accounted for on an equity basis
          rather
          than as consolidated subsidiaries. It does not purport to present

our
          financial position, results of

operations

and cash

flows
          in
          accordance with generally accepted accounting principles because it does
          not
          comply with SFAS No. 94, “Consolidation of All Majority-Owned Subsidiaries.” We
          believe, however, that this disaggregated financial data enhances an
          understanding of the consolidated financial statements by providing users
          with a
          format that our management uses in assessing our performance. See Notes
          1 and 24
          of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item
          8.

Quantitative
                      and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
                      Risk.

We
          are a
          large diversified financial services company. As such, we and our subsidiaries
          have significant amounts of financial instruments that involve market risk.
          Our
          measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in
          fair
          value of our financial instruments. Changes in the trading portfolio are
          recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Market risk exposure
          is
          presented for each class of financial instrument held by us at December
          31,
          assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described
          below. We
          believe that the various rates of adverse market movements represent a
          measure
          of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions. The
          estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future
          earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected
          actual loss, even under adverse conditions, because actual adverse fluctuations
          would likely differ. In addition, since our investment portfolio is subject
          to
          change based on our portfolio management strategy as well as in response
          to
          changes in the market, these estimates are not necessarily indicative of
          the
          actual results which may occur.

Exposure
          to market risk is managed and monitored by senior management. Senior management
          approves our overall investment strategy and has responsibility to ensure
          that
          the investment positions are consistent with that strategy with an acceptable
          level of risk. We may manage risk by buying or selling instruments or entering
          into offsetting positions.

Interest
          Rate Risk - We have exposure to interest rate risk arising from changes
          in the
          level or volatility of interest rates. We attempt to mitigate our exposure
          to
          interest rate risk by utilizing instruments such as interest rate swaps,
          interest rate caps, commitments to purchase securities, options, futures
          and
          forwards. We monitor our sensitivity to interest rate risk by evaluating
          the
          change in the value of our financial assets and liabilities due to fluctuations
          in interest rates. The evaluation is performed by applying an instantaneous
          change in interest rates by varying magnitudes on a static balance sheet
          to
          determine the effect such a change in rates would have on the recorded
          market
          value of our investments and the resulting effect on shareholders’ equity. The
          analysis presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial
          instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices which we believe
          are
          reasonably possible over a one-year period.

The
          sensitivity analysis estimates the change in the market value of our interest
          sensitive assets and liabilities that were held on December 31, 2006 and
          due to instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve of 100 basis points,
          with all other variables held constant.

The
          interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate
          in
          advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other
          types
          may lag behind changes in market rates. Accordingly, the analysis may not
          be
          indicative of, is not intended to provide, and does not provide a precise
          forecast of the effect of changes of market interest rates on our earnings
          or
          shareholders’ equity. Further, the computations do not contemplate any actions
          we could undertake in response to changes in interest rates.

Our
          debt

is
          denominated in U.S. Dollars and has been primarily issued at fixed rates,
          therefore, interest expense would not be impacted by interest rate shifts.
          The
          impact of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on fixed rate debt
          would
          result in a decrease in market value of $559.9 million and $528.5 million
          at
          December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The impact of a 100 basis point
          decrease would result in an increase in market value of $352.9 million
          and
          $328.4 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005 respectively.

Equity
          Price Risk - We have exposure to equity price risk as a result of our investment
          in equity securities and equity derivatives. Equity price risk results
          from
          changes in the level or volatility of equity prices which affect the value
          of
          equity securities or instruments that derive their value from such securities
          or
          indexes. Equity price risk was measured assuming an instantaneous 25% decrease
          in the underlying reference price or index from its level at December 31,
          and 2005, with all other variables held constant.


Item
                    7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
                    Risk

Foreign
          Exchange Rate Risk - Foreign exchange rate risk arises from the possibility
          that
          changes in foreign currency exchange rates will impact the value of financial
          instruments. We have foreign exchange rate exposure when we buy or sell
          foreign
          currencies or financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency.
          This
          exposure is mitigated by our asset/liability matching strategy and through
          the
          use of futures for those instruments which are not matched. Our foreign
          transactions are primarily denominated in Australian dollars, Canadian
          dollars,
          British pounds, Japanese yen and the

European
          Monetary Unit. The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 20% decrease
          in
          the foreign currency

exchange
          rates versus the U.S. dollar from their levels at December 31, 2006 and
          2005,
          with all other variables held constant.

Commodity
          Price Risk - We have exposure to price risk as a result of our investments
          in
          commodities. Commodity price risk results from changes in the level or
          volatility of commodity prices that impact instruments which derive their
          value
          from such commodities. Commodity price risk was measured assuming an
          instantaneous increase in commodity prices of 20% from their levels at
          December
          31, 2006 and an instantaneous decrease in commodity prices of 20% from
          their
          levels at December 31, 2005.

Credit
          Risk - We are exposed to credit risk which relates to the risk of loss
          resulting
          from the nonperformance by a customer of its contractual obligations. Boardwalk
          Pipeline has exposure related to receivables for services provided, as
          well as
          volumes owed by customers for imbalances or gas lent by Boardwalk Pipeline
          to
          them generally under parking and lending services and no-notice services.
          Boardwalk Pipeline maintains credit policies intended to minimize this
          risk and
          actively monitors these policies. Natural gas price volatility has increased
          dramatically in recent years, which has materially increased Boardwalk
          Pipeline’s credit risk related to gas loaned to its customers. As of December
          31, 2006, the amount of gas loaned out was approximately 15.1 trillion
          British
          thermal units (“TBtu”) and, assuming an average market price during December
          2006 of $6.81 per million British thermal units (“MMBtu”), the market value of
          gas loaned out at December 31, 2006 would have been approximately $102.8
          million. If any significant customer should have credit or financial problems
          resulting in a delay or failure to repay the gas it owes Boardwalk Pipeline,
          it
          could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results
          of
          operations and cash flows.

Note:

The
                      calculation of estimated market risk exposure is based on assumed
                      adverse
                      changes in the underlying reference price or index of (1) a
                      decrease in
                      equity prices of 25%, (2) an increase in interest rates of
                      100 basis
                      points in 2006 and a decrease in interest rates of 100 basis
                      points in
                      2005 and (3) an increase in commodity prices of 20% in 2006
                      and a decrease
                      in commodity prices of 20% in 2005. Adverse changes on options
                      which
                      differ from those presented above would not necessarily result
                      in a
                      proportionate change to the estimated market risk
                      exposure.

(a)

A
                    decrease in equity prices of 25% would result in market risk
                    amounting to
                    $(162.0) and $(255.0) at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
                    This
                    market risk would be offset by decreases in liabilities to customers
                    under
                    variable insurance contracts.

Note:

The
                    calculation of estimated market risk exposure is based on assumed
                    adverse
                    changes in the underlying reference price or index of (1) a decrease
                    in
                    equity prices of 25% and (2) an increase in interest rates of
                    100 basis
                    points.

(a)

Certain
                    securities are denominated in foreign currencies. An assumed
                    20% decline
                    in the underlying exchange rates would result in an aggregate
                    foreign
                    currency exchange rate risk of $(283.0) and $(245.0) at December
                    31, 2006
                    and 2005, respectively.

(b)

Certain
                    fixed maturities positions include options embedded in convertible
                    debt
                    securities. A decrease in underlying equity prices of 25% would
                    result in
                    market risk amounting to $(227.0) and $(54.0) at December 31,
                    2006 and
                    2005, respectively.

Basis
        of
        presentation

-

Loews
        Corporation is a holding company. Its subsidiaries are engaged in the following
        lines of business: commercial property and casualty insurance (CNA Financial
        Corporation (“CNA”), an 89% owned subsidiary); the production and sale of
        cigarettes (Lorillard, Inc. (“Lorillard”), a wholly owned subsidiary); the
        operation of interstate natural gas transmission pipeline systems (Boardwalk
        Pipeline Partners, LP (“Boardwalk Pipeline”), an 80% owned subsidiary) the
        operation of offshore oil and gas drilling rigs (Diamond Offshore Drilling,
        Inc.
        (“Diamond Offshore”), a 51% owned subsidiary); the operation of hotels (Loews
        Hotels Holding Corporation (“Loews Hotels”), a wholly owned subsidiary); and the
        distribution and sale of watches and clocks (Bulova Corporation (“Bulova”), a
        wholly owned subsidiary). Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms
        “Company,” “Loews” and “Registrant” as used herein mean Loews Corporation
        excluding its subsidiaries.

On
        May 8,
        2006, the Company effected a three-for-one stock split of Loews common stock
        to
        shareholders of record on April 24, 2006. On August 3, 2006, the Company’s
        shareholders approved amendments to its certificate of incorporation increasing
        the number of shares of Loews common stock authorized for issuance from 600
        million to 1.8 billion shares and reducing the par value per share of Loews
        common stock from $1.00 to $0.01 per share. All share and per share information
        has been retroactively adjusted to reflect these events.

Principles
        of consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include all significant
        subsidiaries and all material intercompany accounts and transactions have
        been
        eliminated. The equity method of accounting is used for investments in
        associated companies in which the Company generally has an interest of 20%
        to
        50%.

Accounting
        estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
        accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
        (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
        amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related
        notes.
        Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Accounting
        changes

-

In
        November of 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB
        Staff Position (“FSP”) No. FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, “The Meaning of
        Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments,” as
        applicable to debt and equity securities that are within the scope of Statement
        of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 115, “Accounting for Certain
        Investments in Debt and Equity Securities” and equity securities that are
        accounted for using the cost method specified in Accounting Principles Board
        Opinion No. 18, “The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common
        Stock.” FSP 115-1 nullifies certain requirements of Emerging Issues Task Force
        (“EITF”) Issue No. 03-1, “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its
        Application to Certain Investments,” which provided guidance on determining
        whether an impairment is other-than-temporary. FSP 115-1 replaces guidance
        set
        forth in EITF No. 03-1 with references to existing other-than-temporary
        impairment guidance and clarifies that an investor should recognize an
        impairment loss no later than when the impairment is deemed
        other-than-temporary, even if a decision to sell has not been made. FSP 115-1
        carries forward the requirements in EITF No. 03-1 regarding required disclosures
        in the financial statements and requires additional disclosure related to
        factors considered in reaching the conclusion that the impairment is not
        other-than-temporary. In addition, in periods subsequent to the recognition
        of
        an other-than-temporary impairment loss for debt securities, the discount
        or
        reduced premium would be amortized over the remaining life of the security
        based
        on future estimated cash flows. FSP 115-1 was effective for reporting periods
        beginning after December 15, 2005 and was adopted by the Company as of January
        1, 2006. Adoption of this standard increased income by approximately $3.0
        million for the year ended December 31, 2006, related to the amortization
        of
        discount or reduced premium resulting from prior impairments. The Company
        has
        included the required additional disclosures in these financial
        statements.

In
        September of 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 108,
“Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying
        Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements.” This bulletin summarizes
        the SEC staff’s views regarding the process of quantifying financial statement
        misstatements. Implementation of SAB No. 108 did not have a material impact
        on
        the Company’s results of operations or equity.


Notes
        to
        Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
        1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - (Continued)

In
        September of 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for
        Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans.” SFAS No. 158 requires
        an employer to recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement
        plan in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that
        funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive
        income. The Company adopted SFAS No. 158 in December of 2006. Adoption of
        the
        pronouncement decreased equity by $143.1 million as of December 31, 2006.
        See
        Note 17 for additional information on the Company’s benefit plans.

Investments
        - Investments in securities are carried as follows:

The
        Company classifies its fixed maturity securities (bonds and redeemable preferred
        stocks) and its equity securities held principally by insurance subsidiaries
        as
        either available-for-sale or trading, and as such, they are carried at fair
        value.

Changes
        in fair value of trading securities are reported within net investment income.
        The amortized cost of fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale
        is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity,
        which are included in net investment income. Changes in fair value related
        to
        available-for-sale securities are reported as a component of Other comprehensive
        income in Shareholders’ equity. Investments are written down to fair value and
        losses are recognized in the income statement when a decline in value is
        determined to be other-than-temporary. See Note 2 for information related
        to the
        Company’s impairment charges.

For
        asset-backed securities included in fixed maturity securities, the Company
        recognizes income using a constant effective yield based on anticipated
        prepayments and the estimated economic life of the securities. When estimates
        of
        prepayments change, the effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual
        payments to date and anticipated future payments. The net investment in the
        securities is adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the new
        effective yield been applied since the acquisition of the securities. Such
        adjustments are reflected in net investment income.

Real
        estate investments are carried at the lower of cost or market value. These
        items
        are included in “Other investments” in the Consolidated Balance
        Sheets.

Short-term
        investments consist primarily of U.S. government securities, money market
        funds
        and commercial paper. These investments are generally carried at fair value,
        which approximates amortized cost.

All
        securities transactions are recorded on the trade date. The cost of securities
        sold is generally determined by the identified certificate method.

The
        Company’s limited partnership investments are recorded at fair value typically
        reflecting a reporting lag of up to three months, with changes in fair value
        reported in net investment income. Fair value of the Company’s limited
        partnership investments represents the Company’s equity in the partnership’s net
        assets as determined by the general partner. The carrying value of the Company’s
        limited partnership investments was $2,160.5 million and $1,769.0 million
        as of
        December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The majority of the limited
        partnerships invest in a substantial number of securities that are readily
        marketable. The Company is primarily a passive investor in such partnerships
        and
        does not have influence over the partnerships’ management, who are committed to
        operate them according to established guidelines and strategies. These
        strategies may include the use of leverage and hedging techniques that
        potentially introduce more volatility and risk to the partnerships. In
        accordance with FASB Interpretation No. (“FIN”) 46R, “Consolidation of Variable
        Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51,” the Company consolidated
        three limited partnerships, which were previously accounted for using the
        equity
        method.

Other
        investments also include certain derivative securities. Investments in
        derivative securities are carried at fair value with changes in fair value
        reported as a component of investment gains or losses or other comprehensive
        income, depending on their hedge designation. Changes in the fair value of
        derivative securities which are not designated as hedges, are reported as
        a
        component of investment gains or losses in the Consolidated Statements of
        Income. A derivative is typically defined as an instrument whose value is
        “derived” from an underlying instrument, index or rate, has a notional amount,
        requires little or no initial investment, and can be net settled. Derivatives
        include, but are not limited to, the following types of investments: interest
        rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, put and call options, warrants,
        futures, forwards, commitments to purchase securities, and combinations of
        the

bonds)
        must be split from the host instrument when the embedded derivative is not
        clearly and closely related to the host instrument.

The
        Company’s derivatives are reported as other invested assets or other
        liabilities. Embedded derivative instruments subject to bifurcation are reported
        together with the host contract, at fair value. If certain criteria are met,
        a
        derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge of exposures to changes
        in
        fair value, cash flows or foreign currency exchange rates. The accounting
        for
        changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of
        the
        derivative, the nature of any hedge designation thereon and whether the
        derivative was transacted in a designated trading portfolio.

The
        Company’s accounting for changes in the fair value of derivative instruments is
        as follows:

Nature
                  of Hedge Designation

Derivative’s
                  Change in Fair Value Reflected in

No
                  hedge designation

Investment
                  gains (losses).

Fair
                  value

Investment
                  gains (losses), along with the change in fair value of the hedged
                  asset or
                  liability that is attributable to the hedged risk.

Cash
                  flow

Other
                  comprehensive income (loss), with subsequent reclassification to
                  earnings
                  when the hedged transaction, asset or liability impacts
                  earnings.

Foreign
                  currency

Consistent
                  with fair value or cash flow above, depending on the nature of
                  the hedging
                  relationship.

The
        Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments
        and
        hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for
        undertaking various hedging transactions. The Company also formally assesses
        (both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis) whether the derivatives
        that are used in hedging transactions have been highly effective in offsetting
        changes in fair value or cash flows of hedged items and whether those
        derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods.
        When
        it is determined that a derivative for which hedge accounting has been
        designated is not (or ceases to be) highly effective, the Company discontinues
        hedge accounting prospectively.

Separate
        account investments held in designated trading portfolios are carried at
        fair
        value with changes therein reflected in investment income. Hedge accounting
        on
        derivatives in these separate accounts is generally not applicable.

Securities
        lending and repurchase activities - The Company lends securities to unrelated
        parties, primarily major brokerage firms. Borrowers of these securities must
        deposit collateral with the Company of at least 102% of the fair value of
        the
        securities loaned if the collateral is cash or securities. The Company maintains
        effective control over all loaned securities and, therefore, continues to
        report
        such securities as Fixed maturity securities in the Consolidated Balance
        Sheets.

Cash
        collateral received on these transactions is invested in short-term investments
        with an offsetting liability recognized for the obligation to return the
        collateral. Non-cash collateral, such as securities or letters of credit,
        received by the Company are not reflected as assets of the Company as there
        exists no right to sell or re-pledge the collateral. The fair value of
        collateral held and included in short-term investments was $3,601.5 million
        and
        $767.4 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005. The fair value of non-cash
        collateral was $385.0 million and $138.0 million at December 31, 2006 and
        2005.

Revenue
        Recognition

Insurance
        premiums on property and casualty and accident and health insurance contracts
        are recognized in proportion to the underlying risk insured which principally
        are earned ratably over the duration of the policies after deductions for
        ceded
        insurance premiums. The reserve for unearned premiums on these contracts
        represents the portion of premiums written relating to the unexpired terms
        of
        coverage.


Notes
        to
        Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
        1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - (Continued)

An
        estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded on the basis of periodic
        evaluations of balances due currently or in the future from insureds, including
        amounts due from insureds related to losses under high deductible policies,
        management’s experience and current economic conditions.

Property
        and casualty contracts that are retrospectively rated contain provisions
        that
        result in an adjustment to the initial policy premium depending on the contract
        provisions and loss experience of the insured during the experience period.
        For
        such contracts, CNA estimates the amount of ultimate premiums that CNA may
        earn
        upon completion of the experience period and recognizes either an asset or
        a
        liability for the difference between the initial policy premium and the
        estimated ultimate premium. CNA adjusts such estimated ultimate premium amounts
        during the course of the experience period based on actual results to date.
        The
        resulting adjustment is recorded as either a reduction of or an increase
        to the
        earned premiums for the period.

Premiums
        for life insurance products and annuities are recognized as revenue when
        due
        after deductions for ceded insurance premiums.

Revenue
        from cigarette sales is recognized upon shipment of goods, when title and
        risk
        of loss passes to customers.

Revenue
        from dayrate drilling contracts is recognized as services are performed.
        In
        connection with such drilling contracts, Diamond Offshore may receive lump-sum
        fees for the mobilization of equipment. These fees are earned as services
        are
        performed over the initial term of the related drilling contracts. Absent
        a
        contract, mobilization costs are recognized currently.

From
        time
        to time, Diamond Offshore may receive fees from its customers for capital
        improvements to their rigs. Diamond Offshore defers such fees received and
        recognizes these fees into revenue on a straight-line basis over the period
        of
        the related drilling contract. Diamond Offshore capitalizes the costs of
        such
        capital improvements and depreciates them over the estimated useful life
        of the
        improvement.

Revenues
        from the transportation of gas are recognized in the period the service is
        provided based on contractual terms and the related transported volumes.
        Revenues from storage services are recognized over the term of the contract.
        Texas Gas is subject to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”)
        regulations and, accordingly, certain revenues collected may be subject to
        possible refunds upon final orders in pending cases. An estimated refund
        liability is recorded considering regulatory proceedings, advice of counsel
        and
        estimated total exposure.

Insurance
        Operations

Claim
        and
        claim adjustment expense reserves ─ Claim and claim adjustment expense reserves,
        except reserves for structured settlements not associated with asbestos and
        environmental pollution and mass tort (“APMT”), workers’ compensation lifetime
        claims, accident and health claims and certain claims associated with
        discontinued operations, are not discounted and are based on 1) case basis
        estimates for losses reported on direct business, adjusted in the aggregate
        for
        ultimate loss expectations; 2) estimates of incurred but not reported losses;
        3)
        estimates of losses on assumed reinsurance; 4) estimates of future expenses
        to
        be incurred in the settlement of claims; 5) estimates of salvage and subrogation
        recoveries and 6) estimates of amounts due from insureds related to losses
        under
        high deductible policies. CNA management considers current conditions and
        trends
        as well as past CNA and industry experience in establishing these estimates.
        The
        effects of inflation, which can be significant, are implicitly considered
        in the
        reserving process and are part of the recorded reserve balance. Ceded claim
        and
        claim adjustment expense reserves are reported as a component of Reinsurance
        receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 22 for further
        information on claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for discontinued
        operations.

Claim
        and
        claim adjustment expense reserves are presented net of anticipated amounts
        due
        from insureds related to losses under high deductible policies of $2.5 billion
        and $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. A portion of these amounts
        is
        supported by collateral. CNA also has an allowance for uncollectible deductible
        amounts, which is presented as a component of the allowance for doubtful
        accounts included in the Insurance receivables on the Consolidated Balance
        Sheets.

Structured
          settlements have been negotiated for certain property and casualty insurance
          claims. Structured settlements are agreements to provide fixed periodic
          payments
          to claimants. Certain structured settlements are

funded

by

annuities purchased from Continental Assurance Company (“CAC”)

for

which

Note
        1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - (Continued)

obligations
        are reported in future policy benefits reserves. Obligations for structured
        settlements not funded by annuities are included in claim and claim adjustment
        expense reserves and carried at present values determined using interest
        rates
        ranging from 4.6% to 7.5% at December 31, 2006 and 2005. At December 31,
        and 2005, the discounted reserves for unfunded structured settlements were
        $814.0 million and $843.0 million, net of discount of $1,250.0 million and
        $1,309.0 million.

Workers’
        compensation lifetime claim reserves are calculated using mortality assumptions
        determined through statutory regulation and economic factors. Accident and
        health claim reserves are calculated using mortality and morbidity assumptions
        based on Company and industry experience. Workers’ compensation lifetime claim
        reserves and accident and health claim reserves are discounted at interest
        rates
        that range from 3.5% to 6.5% at December 31, 2006 and 2005. At December 31,
        and 2005, such discounted reserves totaled $1,284.0 million and $1,238.0
        million, net of discount of $416.0 million and $430.0 million.

Future
        policy benefits reserves ─ Reserves for long term care products are computed
        using the net level premium method, which incorporates actuarial assumptions
        as
        to interest rates, mortality, morbidity, persistency, withdrawals and expenses.
        Actuarial assumptions generally vary by plan, age at issue and policy duration,
        and include a margin for adverse deviation. Interest rates range from 6.0%
        to
        8.6% at December 31, 2006 and 2005, and mortality, morbidity and withdrawal
        assumptions are based on CNA and industry experience prevailing at the time
        of
        issue. Expense assumptions include the estimated effects of inflation and
        expenses to be incurred beyond the premium paying period. The net reserves
        for
        traditional life insurance products (whole and term life products) including
        interest-sensitive contracts were ceded on a 100% indemnity reinsurance basis
        to
        Swiss Re in connection with the sale of the individual life insurance business.
        See Note 14 for further information.

Policyholders’
        funds reserves ─ Policyholders’ funds reserves primarily include reserves for
        investment contracts without life contingencies. For these contracts,
        policyholder liabilities are equal to the accumulated policy account values,
        which consist of an accumulation of deposit payments plus credited interest,
        less withdrawals and amounts assessed through the end of the
        period.

Guaranty
        fund and other insurance-related assessments ─ Liabilities for guaranty fund and
        other insurance-related assessments are accrued when an assessment is probable,
        when it can be reasonably estimated, and when the event obligating the entity
        to
        pay an imposed or probable assessment has occurred. Liabilities for guaranty
        funds and other insurance-related assessments are not discounted and are
        included as part of Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
        As of
        December 31, 2006 and 2005, the liability balances were $189.0 and $185.0
        million. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, included in other assets were
        $7.0 million and $10.0 million of related assets for premium tax offsets.
        The
        related asset is limited to the amount that is able to be assessed on future
        premium collections from business written or committed to be
        written.

Reinsurance
        ─ Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent
        with
        claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves
        and are reported as receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The cost
        of
        reinsurance is primarily accounted for over the life of the underlying reinsured
        policies using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the
        underlying policies. The ceding of insurance does not discharge the primary
        liability of CNA. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded
        on
        the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from reinsurers, reinsurer
        solvency, management’s experience and current economic conditions. The expenses
        incurred related to uncollectible reinsurance receivables are presented as
        a
        component of Insurance claims and policyholders’ benefits in the Consolidated
        Statements of Income.

Reinsurance
        contracts that do not effectively transfer the underlying economic risk of
        loss
        on policies written by CNA are recorded using the deposit method of accounting,
        which requires that premium paid or received by the ceding company or assuming
        company be accounted for as a deposit asset or liability. At December 31,
        and 2005, CNA had approximately $104.0 million and $171.0 million recorded
        as
        deposit assets and $71.0 million and $111.0 million recorded as deposit
        liabilities.


Notes
        to
        Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
        1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - (Continued)

Income
        on
        reinsurance contracts accounted for under the deposit method is recognized
        using
        an effective yield based on the anticipated timing of payments and the remaining
        life of the contract. When the estimate of timing of payments changes, the
        effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments to date and the
        estimated timing of future payments. The deposit asset or liability is adjusted
        to the amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been applied
        since the inception of the contract. This adjustment is reflected in other
        revenue or other operating expense as appropriate.

Participating
        insurance ─ Policyholder dividends are accrued using an estimate of the amount
        to be paid based on underlying contractual obligations under policies and
        applicable state laws. When limitations exist on the amount of net income
        from
        participating life insurance contracts that may be distributed to shareholders,
        the share of net income on those policies that cannot be distributed to
        shareholders is excluded from stockholders' equity by a charge to operations
        and
        the establishment of a corresponding liability.

Deferred
        acquisition costs ─ Acquisition costs include commissions, premium taxes and
        certain underwriting and policy issuance costs which vary with and are related
        primarily to the acquisition of business. Such costs related to property
        and
        casualty business are deferred and amortized ratably over the period the
        related
        premiums are earned.

Deferred
        acquisition costs related to accident and health insurance are amortized
        over
        the premium-paying period of the related policies using assumptions consistent
        with those used for computing future policy benefits reserves for such
        contracts. Assumptions as to anticipated premiums are made at the date of
        policy
        issuance or acquisition and are consistently applied during the lives of
        the
        contracts. Deviations from estimated experience are included in results of
        operations when they occur. For these contracts, the amortization period
        is
        typically the estimated life of the policy.

Anticipated
        investment income is considered in the determination of the recoverability
        of
        deferred acquisition costs. Deferred acquisition costs are recorded net of
        ceding commissions and other ceded acquisition costs. CNA evaluates deferred
        acquisition costs for recoverability. Adjustments, if necessary, are recorded
        in
        current results of operations.

Investments
        in life settlement contracts and related revenue recognition ─ CNA has purchased
        investments in life settlement contracts. Under a life settlement contract,
        CNA
        obtains the rights of being the owner and beneficiary to an underlying life
        insurance policy. The carrying value of each contract at purchase and at
        the end
        of each reporting period is equal to the cash surrender value of the policy.
        Amounts paid to purchase these contracts that are in excess of the cash
        surrender value, at the date of purchase, were expensed immediately. Periodic
        maintenance costs, such as premiums, necessary to keep the underlying policy
        inforce are expensed as incurred and are included in other operating expenses.
        Revenue is recognized and included in Other revenue in the Consolidated
        Statements of Income when the life insurance policy underlying the life
        settlement contract matures. See the New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet
        Adopted section of this note for further discussion of FASB Staff Position
        (“FSP”) 85-4-1, “Accounting for Life Settlement Contracts by Third-Party
        Investors.”

Separate
        Account Business ─ Separate account assets and liabilities represent contract
        holder funds related to investment and annuity products, which are segregated
        into accounts with specific underlying investment objectives. The assets
        and
        liabilities of these contracts are legally segregated and reported as assets
        and
        liabilities of the separate account business. Substantially all assets of
        the
        separate account business are carried at fair value. Separate account
        liabilities are carried at contract values. Net income accruing to CNA related
        to separate accounts is primarily included within Other revenue in the
        Consolidated Statements of Income.

Tobacco
        product inventories - These inventories, aggregating $182.9 million and $181.6
        million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, are stated at the lower
        of
        cost or market, using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method and primarily
        consist
        of leaf tobacco. If the average cost method of accounting had been used for
        tobacco inventories instead of the LIFO method, such inventories would have
        been
        $156.4 million and $161.4 million higher at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
        respectively.

Watch
        and
        clock inventories - These inventories, aggregating $70.3 million and $68.3
        million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, are stated at the lower
        of
        cost or market, using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.


Notes
        to
        Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
        1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - (Continued)

Goodwill
        and other intangible assets - Goodwill and other intangible assets with
        indefinite lives are annually tested for impairment. Goodwill represents
        the
        excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets of acquired entities.
        Impairment losses, if any, are included in the Consolidated Statements of
        Income.

Property,
        plant and equipment - Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less
        accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed principally by the
        straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the various classes
        of
        properties. Leaseholds and leasehold improvements are depreciated or amortized
        over the terms of the related leases (including optional renewal periods
        where
        appropriate) or the estimated lives of improvements, if less than the lease
        term.

The
        principal service lives used in computing provisions for depreciation are
        as
        follows:

Years

Buildings
                  and building equipment


Building
                  fixtures

                  to 20

                  drilling equipment

                  to 30

Pipeline
                  equipment

                  to 50

Machinery
                  and equipment

                  to 12

Hotel
                  equipment

                  to 12

Computer
                  equipment and software

                  to 5

Impairment
        of long-lived assets - The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment
        when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
        may
        not be recoverable. Long-lived assets and intangibles with finite lives,
        under
        certain circumstances, are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair
        value. Assets to be disposed of and assets not expected to provide any future
        service potential to the Company are recorded at the lower of carrying amount
        or
        fair value less cost to sell.

Stock
        option plans - In December of 2004, the FASB issued a complete replacement
        of
        SFAS No. 123, “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS No. 123R”), which covers a wide range
        of share-based compensation arrangements, including share options, restricted
        share plans, performance-based awards, share appreciation rights, and employee
        share purchase plans. SFAS No. 123R requires companies to use the fair value
        method in accounting for employee stock options which results in compensation
        expense recorded in the income statement. Compensation expense is measured
        at
        the grant date using an option-pricing model and is recognized over the service
        period.

Effective
        January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified
        prospective transition method. The Company applied the transition method
        in
        calculating its pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb future tax
        deficiencies as provided by FSP FAS 123(R)-3, “Transition Election Related to
        Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards.” Adoption of SFAS
        No. 123R decreased net income attributable to Loews common stock by $6.5
        million
        for the year ended December 31, 2006, or $0.01 per Loews common share. Net
        income attributable to Carolina Group stock decreased by $0.3 million for
        the
        year ended December 31, 2006. There was no impact per Carolina Group share.
        Several of the Company’s subsidiaries also maintain their own stock option
        plans. The amounts reported above include the Company’s share of expense related
        to its subsidiaries’ plans as well.

Prior
        to
        the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company elected to follow Accounting
        Principles Board Opinion (“APB”) No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
        Employees” and related interpretations in accounting for its employee stock
        options and awards. Under APB No. 25, no compensation expense was recognized
        when the exercise prices of options equaled the fair value (market price)
        of the
        underlying stock on the date of grant. SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
        Compensation,” required the Company to disclose pro forma information regarding
        option grants made to its employees. SFAS No. 123 specified certain valuation
        techniques that produced estimated compensation charges for purposes of valuing
        stock option grants. These amounts were not included in the Company’s
        Consolidated Statements of Income, in accordance with APB No. 25. The pro
        forma
        effect of applying SFAS No. 123 included the Company’s share of expense related
        to its subsidiaries’ plans as well. The Company’s pro forma net income and the
        related basic and diluted income per Loews common and Carolina Group shares
        would have been as follows:

Regulatory
        accounting - The FERC regulates the operations of Texas Gas. SFAS No. 71,
        “Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation,” requires Texas Gas
        to report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the
        manner in which independent third-party regulators establish rates. Accordingly,
        certain costs and benefits are capitalized as regulatory assets and liabilities
        in order to provide for recovery from or refund to customers in future
        periods.

Supplementary
        cash flow information - Cash payments made for interest on long-term debt,
        including capitalized interest and commitment fees, amounted to approximately

New
        accounting pronouncements not yet adopted -

In
        September of 2005, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the American
        Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position (“SOP”)
        05-01, “Accounting by Insurance Enterprises for Deferred Acquisition Costs in
        Connection with Modifications or Exchanges of Insurance Contracts.” SOP 05-01
        provides guidance on accounting by insurance enterprises for deferred
        acquisition costs on internal replacements of insurance and investment contracts
        other than those specifically described in SFAS No. 97, “Accounting and
        Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and
        for
        Realized Gains and Losses from the Sale of Investments.” SOP 05-01 defines an
        internal replacement as a modification in product benefits, features, rights,
        or
        coverages that occurs by the exchange of a contract for a new contract, or
        by
        amendment, endorsement, or rider to a contract, or by the election of a feature
        or coverage within a contract. SOP 05-01 is effective for internal replacements
        occurring in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. Adoption of
        SOP
        05-01 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s results of
        operations or financial condition.

In
          January of 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.155, “Accounting for Certain Hybrid
          Financial Instruments.” SFAS No. 155 amends SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for
          Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” and SFAS No. 140, “Accounting
          for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
          Liabilities.” SFAS

No.
          also resolves issues addressed in SFAS No. 133 Implementation Issue No.
          D1,
“Application of Statement

Note

        to
        Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets.” SFAS No. 155 eliminates
        the exemption from applying SFAS No.133 to interests in securitized financial
        assets so that similar instruments are accounted for similarly regardless
        of the
        form of the instruments. SFAS No.155 allows a preparer to elect fair value
        measurement at acquisition, at issuance, or when a previously recognized
        financial instrument is subject to a remeasurement (new basis) event, on
        an
        instrument-by-instrument basis, in cases in which a derivative would otherwise
        have to be bifurcated. SFAS No. 155 is effective for all financial instruments
        acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that
        begins after September 15, 2006. The fair value election provided for in
        paragraph 4(c) of SFAS No. 155 may also be applied upon adoption of SFAS
        No. 155
        for hybrid financial instruments that had been bifurcated under paragraph
        12 of
        SFAS No. 133 prior to the adoption of this Statement. Earlier adoption is
        permitted as of the beginning of an entity’s fiscal year, provided the entity
        has not yet issued financial statements, including financial statements for
        any
        interim period for that fiscal year. Provisions of SFAS No. 155 may be applied
        to instruments that an entity holds at the date of adoption on an
        instrument-by-instrument basis. Adoption of this standard is not expected
        to
        have a material impact on the carrying value of securities held or acquired
        subsequent to January 1, 2007.

In
        March
        of 2006, the FASB issued FSP 85-4-1, “Accounting for Life Settlement Contracts
        by Third-Party Investors.” A life settlement contract for purposes of FSP 85-4-1
        is a contract between the owner of a life insurance policy (the “policy owner”)
        and a third-party investor (“investor”). The previous accounting guidance, FASB
        Technical Bulletin (“FTB”) No. 85-4, “Accounting for Purchases of Life
        Insurance”, required the purchaser of life insurance contracts to account for
        the life insurance contract at its cash surrender value. Because life insurance
        contracts are purchased in the secondary market at amounts in excess of the
        policies’ cash surrender values, the application of guidance in FTB 85-4 created
        a loss upon acquisition of the policy. FSP 85-4-1 provides initial and
        subsequent measurement guidance and financial statement presentation and
        disclosure guidance for investments by third-party investors in life settlement
        contracts. FSP 85-4-1 allows an investor to elect to account for its investments
        in life settlement contracts using either the investment method or the fair
        value method. The election shall be made on an instrument-by-instrument basis
        and is irrevocable. FSP 85-4-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
        June 15, 2006. CNA has elected to account for its investment in life settlement
        contracts using the fair value method and the initial expected impact upon
        adoption under the fair value method will be an increase to retained earnings
        as
        of January 1, 2007 of approximately $34.0 million.

In
        July
        of 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 48, “Accounting for
        Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.” FIN 48
        prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure,
        present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions
        that
        the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return. FIN 48 states that
        a
        tax benefit from an uncertain position may be recognized only if it is “more
        likely than not” that the position is sustainable, based on its technical
        merits. The tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of
        tax
        benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate
        settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant
        information. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
        15,
        2006. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that adopting FIN 48
        will
        have and expects an impact to operations and equity of approximately $40.0
        million, after minority interest.

In
        September of 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.”

SFAS
        No.
        157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value
        in
        accordance with GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
        SFAS
        No. 157 retains the exchange price notion in the definition of fair value
        and
        clarifies that the exchange price is the price in an orderly transaction
        between
        market participants to sell the asset or transfer the liability in the market
        in
        which the reporting entity would transact for the asset or liability. SFAS
        No.
        157 emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an
        entity-specific measurement and the fair value measurement should be determined
        based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the
        asset
        or liability. In addition, the price that would be paid to acquire an asset
        or
        received to assume a liability should be considered in determining fair value.
        SFAS No. 157 expands disclosures surrounding the use of fair value to measure
        assets and liabilities and specifically focuses on the sources used to measure
        fair value. In instances of recurring use of fair value measures based on
        management’s assumptions to set market pricing for the asset or liability
        derived from available market data or selected best information, SFAS No.
        requires separate disclosure of the effect on earnings for the period.

SFAS
        No.
        157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The
        Company
        is currently evaluating the impact that adopting SFAS No. 157 will have on
        its
        results of operations and equity.

Reclassifications
        - Certain amounts applicable to prior periods have been reclassified to conform
        to the classifications followed in 2006.

The
        amounts presented on the December 31, 2005 Consolidated Balance Sheet related
        to
        Receivables and Other liabilities have been corrected from $15,313.7 million
        and
        $4,524.8 million to $15,543.9 million and $4,755.0 million, to conform to
        the
        2006 presentation. The correction of $230.2 million relates to balances payable
        to insureds that were previously reflected as a deduction from insurance
        receivables and are currently reflected as liabilities. The balances are
        principally related to amounts deposited with CNA by customers, such as amounts
        related to the funding of deductible obligations.

                  to CNA’s sale of its individual life insurance business for the year ended
                  December 31, 2004. See Note 14.

Investment
        securities are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, market and
        credit. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities
        and the level of uncertainty related to changes in the value of investment
        securities, it is possible that changes in these risk factors in the near
        term
        could have an adverse material impact on the Company’s results of operations or
        equity.

The
        Company’s investment policies emphasize high credit quality and diversification
        by industry, issuer and issue. Assets supporting interest rate sensitive
        liabilities are segmented within the general account to facilitate
        asset/liability duration management.

Realized
          investment losses included $173.0

million,
          $120.4

million
          and $117.5 million of other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) losses for the
          years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The 2006, 2005 and 2004 OTTI
          losses were recorded across various sectors. The increase in OTTI losses
          for
          2006 was primarily driven by an

        2. Investments - (Continued)

increase
        in interest rate related OTTI losses on securities for which the Company
        did not
        assert an intent to hold until an anticipated recovery in value. The 2005
        and
        2004 OTTI losses included $47.0 million and $80.5 million related to loans
        made
        under a credit facility to a national contractor, that are classified as
        fixed
        maturity securities. See Note 21 for additional information on loans to the

        investment is impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its
        cost
        adjusted for accretion, amortization, previous OTTI and hedging, otherwise
        defined as an unrealized loss. When an investment is impaired, the impairment
        is
        evaluated to determine whether it is temporary or
        other-than-temporary

.

A
        significant judgment in the valuation of investments is the determination
        of
        when an OTTI has occurred. CNA follows a consistent and systematic process
        for
        determining and recording an OTTI. CNA has established a committee responsible
        for the OTTI process. This committee, referred to as the Impairment Committee,
        is made up of three officers appointed by CNA’s Chief Financial Officer. The
        Impairment Committee is responsible for analyzing watch list securities on
        at
        least a quarterly basis. The watch list includes individual securities that
        fall
        below certain thresholds or that exhibit evidence of OTTI indicators including,
        but not limited to, a significant adverse change in the financial condition
        and
        near term prospects of the issuer or a significant adverse change in legal
        factors, the business climate or credit ratings.

When
        a
        security is placed on the watch list, it is monitored for further market
        value
        changes and additional information related to the issuer’s financial condition.
        The focus is on objective evidence that may influence the evaluation of OTTI
        factors.

The
        decision to record an OTTI incorporates both quantitative criteria and
        qualitative information. The Impairment Committee considers a number of factors
        including, but not limited to: (a) the length of time and the extent to which
        the fair value has been less than book value, (b) the financial condition
        and
        near term prospects of the issuer, (c) the intent and ability of the Company
        to
        retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an
        anticipated recovery in value, (d) whether the debtor is current on interest
        and
        principal payments and (e) general market conditions and industry or sector
        specific factors.

The
        Impairment Committee’s decision to record an OTTI loss is primarily based on
        whether the security’s fair value is likely to recover to its book value in
        light of all of the factors considered. For securities considered to be OTTI,
        the security is adjusted to fair value and the resulting losses are recognized
        in Investment gains (losses) on the Consolidated Statements of
        Income.

At
        December 31, 2006, the carrying value of available-for-sale fixed maturities
        was
        $35,648.0 million, representing 66.2% of the total investment portfolio.
        The net
        unrealized position associated with the available-for-sale fixed maturity
        portfolio included $208.1 million in gross unrealized losses, consisting
        of
        asset-backed securities which represented 82.6%, corporate bonds which
        represented 8.3%, municipal securities which represented 2.8%, and all other
        fixed maturity securities which represe

nted
        6.3%. The gross unrealized loss for any single issuer was no greater than
        0.1%
        of the carrying value of the total available-for-sale fixed maturity portfolio.
        The total available-for-sale fixed maturity portfolio gross unrealized losses
        included 1,492 securities which were, in aggregate, approximately 1.0% below
        amortized cost.

The
        gross
        unrealized losses on available-for-sale equity securities were less than
        $1.0
        million, including 105 securities which, in aggregate, were below cost by
        approximately 3.0%.

Note
        2. Investments - (Continued)

Given
        the
        current facts and circumstances, the Impairment Committee has determined
        that
        the securities presented in the above unrealized gain/loss tables were
        temporarily impaired when evaluated at December 31, 2006 or December 31,
        2005,
        and therefore no related realized losses were recorded. A discussion of some
        of
        the factors reviewed in making that determination is presented below by major
        security type. The unrealized loss related to any single issuer is not
        considered to be significant.

Asset-Backed
        Securities

The
        unrealized losses on the Company’s investments in asset-backed securities were
        caused primarily by a change in interest rates. This category includes
        mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by an agency of the U.S. government.
        There
        were 477 agency mortgage-backed pass-through securities and 3 agency
        collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”) in an unrealized loss position as
        of December 31, 2006. The aggregate severity of the unrealized loss on these
        securities was approximately 3.0% of amortized cost. These securities do
        not
        tend to be influenced by the credit of the issuer but rather the characteristics
        and projected principal payments of the underlying collateral.

The
        remainder of the holdings in this category are corporate mortgage-backed
        pass-through, CMOs and corporate asset-backed structured securities. The
        holdings in these sectors include 493 securities in an unrealized loss position
        with over 92.0% of these unrealized losses related to securities rated AAA.
        The
        aggregate severity of the unrealized loss was approximately 2.0% of amortized
        cost. The contractual cash flows on the asset-backed structured securities
        are
        pass-through but may be structured into classes of preference. The structured
        securities held are generally secured by over collateralization or default
        protection provided by subordinated tranches. Within this category, securities
        subject to EITF Issue No. 99-20, “Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment
        on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets,”
are monitored for adverse changes in cash flow projections. If there are
        adverse
        changes in cash flows the amount of accretable yield is prospectively adjusted
        and an OTTI loss is recognized. As of December 31, 2006, there was no adverse
        change in estimated cash flows noted for the EITF No. 99-20 securities, which
        have an aggregate unrealized loss of $9.0 million and an aggregate severity
        of
        the unrealized loss of approximately 1.0% of amortized cost.

Because
        the decline in fair value was primarily attributable to changes in interest
        rates and not credit quality and because the Company has the ability and
        intent
        to hold those investments until an anticipated recovery of fair value, which
        may
        be maturity, the Company considers these investments to be temporarily impaired
        at December 31, 2006.

Corporate
        Securities

The
        Company’s portfolio management objective for corporate bonds focuses on sector
        and issuer exposures and value analysis within sectors. In order to maximize
        investment objectives, corporate bonds are analyzed on a risk adjusted basis
        compared to other opportunities that are available in the market. Trading
        decisions may be made based on an issuer that may be overvalued in the Company’s
        portfolio compared to a like issuer that may be undervalued in the market.
        The
        Company also monitors issuer exposure and broader industry sector exposures
        and
        may reduce exposures based on its current view of a specific issuer or
        sector.

Of
        the
        unrealized losses in this category, approximately 81.0% relate to securities
        rated as investment grade (rated BBB or higher). The total holdings in this
        category are diversified across 10 industry sectors and 220 securities. The
        aggregate severity of the unrealized loss was approximately 1.0% of amortized
        cost. Within corporate bonds, the largest industry sectors were financial
        and
        consumer cyclical, which as a percentage of total gross unrealized losses
        were
        approximately 64.0% and 12.0% at December 31, 2006. The decline in fair value
        is
        primarily attributable to changes in interest rates and macro conditions
        in
        certain sectors that the market views as temporarily out of favor. Because
        the
        decline is not related to specific credit quality issues, and because the
        Company has the ability and intent to hold those investments until an
        anticipated recovery of fair value, which may be maturity, the Company considers
        these investments to be temporarily impaired at December 31,
        2006.

The
        carrying value of fixed maturity investments that did not produce income
        during
        2006 and 2005 was $26.8 million and $42.2 million. At December 31, 2006 and
        2005, no investments, other than investments in U.S. government treasury
        and
        U.S. government agency securities, respectively, exceeded 10.0% of shareholders’
equity.

Investment
        Commitments

As
        of
        December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had committed approximately $109.0
        million and $191.0 million to future capital calls from various third-party
        limited partnership investments in exchange for an ownership interest in
        the
        related partnerships.

The
        Company invests in multiple bank loan participations as part of its overall
        investment strategy and has committed to additional future purchases and
        sales.
        The purchase and sale of these investments are recorded on the date that
        the
        legal agreements are finalized and cash settlement is made. As of December
        31,
        2006 and 2005, the Company had commitments to purchase $64.0 million and
        $135.3
        million and sell $23.7 million and $26.3 million of various bank loan
        participations. When loan participation purchases are settled and recorded
        they
        may contain both funded and unfunded amounts. An unfunded loan represents
        an
        obligation by the Company to provide additional amounts under the terms of
        the
        loan participation. The funded portions are reflected on the Consolidated
        Balance Sheets, while any unfunded amounts are not recorded until a draw
        is made
        under the loan facility. As of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, the
        Company had obligations on unfunded bank loan participations in the amount
        of
        $29.0 million and $21.0 million.

Investments
        on Deposit

CNA
        may
        from time to time invest in securities that may be restricted in whole or
        in
        part. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, CNA did not hold any significant
        positions in investments whose sale was restricted.

Cash
        and
        securities with carrying values of approximately $2.5 billion and $2.4 billion
        were deposited by CNA’s insurance subsidiaries under requirements of regulatory
        authorities as of December 31, 2006 and 2005.

The
        Company’s investments in limited partnerships contain withdrawal provisions that
        typically require advanced written notice of up to 90 days for withdrawals.
        The
        carrying value of these investments, reported as a separate line item in
        the
        Consolidated Balance Sheets, is $2,160.5 million and $1,769.0 million as
        of
        December 31, 2006 and 2005.

Cash
        and
        securities with carrying values of approximately $11.0 million and $13.0
        million
        were deposited with financial institutions as collateral for letters of credit
        as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. In addition, cash and securities were
        deposited in trusts with financial institutions to secure reinsurance
        obligations with various third parties. The carrying values of these deposits
        were approximately $327.0 million and $356.0 million as of December 31, 2006
        and
        2005.

In
        cases
        where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are estimated using
        present value or other valuation techniques. These techniques are significantly
        affected by management’s assumptions, including discount rates and estimates of
        future cash flows. The estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative
        of the amounts that the Company could realize in a current market exchange.
        The
        amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for fixed maturity
        securities, equity securities, derivative instruments, short-term investments
        and collateral on loaned securities are at fair value. As such, these financial
        instruments are not shown in the table above. See Note 4 for the fair value
        of
        derivative instruments. Since the disclosure excludes certain financial
        instruments and non-financial instruments such as real estate, deferred
        acquisition costs and insurance reserves, the aggregate fair value amounts
        cannot be summed to determine the underlying economic value of the
        Company.

The
        following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating
        its
        fair value disclosures for financial instruments:

The
        fair
        values of fixed maturity securities and equity securities were based on quoted
        market prices, where available. For securities not actively traded, fair
        values
        were estimated using values obtained from independent pricing services or
        quoted
        market prices of comparable instruments.

Other
        investments consist of mortgage loans and notes receivable, policy loans,
        investments in limited partnerships and various miscellaneous assets. Valuation
        techniques to determine fair value of limited partnership investments, other
        investments and other separate account assets consisted of discounting cash
        flows, obtaining quoted market prices of the investments and comparing the
        investments to similar instruments or to the comparable underlying assets
        of the
        investments.

Premium
        deposits and annuity contracts were valued based on cash surrender values,
        estimated fair values or policyholder liabilities, net of amounts ceded related
        to sold businesses.

Fair
        value of debt was based on quoted market prices when available. When quoted
        market prices were not available, the fair value for debt was based on quoted
        market prices of comparable instruments adjusted for differences between
        the
        quoted instruments and the instruments being valued or is estimated using
        discounted cash flow analyses, based on current incremental borrowing rates
        for
        similar types of borrowing arrangements.


Notes
        to
        Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
        4.  Derivative Financial Instruments

The
        Company invests in certain derivative instruments for a number of purposes,
        including: (i) asset and liability management activities, (ii) income
        enhancements for its portfolio management strategy, and (iii) benefit from
        anticipated future movements in the underlying markets. If such movements
        do not
        occur as anticipated, then significant losses may occur.

Monitoring
        procedures include senior management review of daily detailed reports of
        existing positions and valuation fluctuations to ensure that open positions
        are
        consistent with the Company’s portfolio strategy.

The
        Company does not believe that any of the derivative instruments utilized
        by it
        are unusually complex, nor do these instruments contain embedded leverage
        features which would expose the Company to a higher degree of risk.

CNA
        uses
        derivatives in the normal course of business, primarily in an attempt to
        reduce
        its exposure to market risk (principally interest rate risk, equity stock
        price
        risk and foreign currency risk) stemming from various assets and liabilities
        and
        credit risk (the ability of an obligor to make timely payment of principal
        and/or interest). CNA’s principal objective under such risk strategies is to
        achieve the desired reduction in economic risk, even if the position will
        not
        receive hedge accounting treatment.

CNA’s
        use
        of derivatives is limited by statutes and regulations promulgated by the
        various
        regulatory bodies to which it is subject, and by its own derivative policy.
        The
        derivative policy limits the authorization to initiate derivative transactions
        to certain personnel. Derivatives entered into for hedging, regardless of
        the
        choice to designate hedge accounting, shall have a maturity that effectively
        correlates to the underlying hedged asset or liability. The policy prohibits
        the
        use of derivatives containing greater than one-to-one leverage with respect
        to
        changes in the underlying price, rate or index. The policy also prohibits
        the
        use of borrowed funds, including funds obtained through securities lending,
        to
        engage in derivative transactions.

Credit
        exposure associated with non-performance by the counterparties to derivative
        instruments is generally limited to the uncollateralized fair value of the
        asset
        related to the instruments recognized in the Consolidated Balance

Sheets.
        The Company mitigates

the
        risk
        of non-

performance
        by monitoring the creditworthiness of counterparties and diversifying
        derivatives to multiple counterparties. The Company generally requires that
        all
        over-the-counter derivative contracts be governed by an International Swaps
        and
        Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) Master Agreement, and exchanges collateral
        under the terms of these arrangements with its derivative investment
        counterparties depending on the amount of the exposure and the credit rating
        of
        the counterparty.

The
        Company has exposure to economic losses due to interest rate risk arising
        from
        changes in the level or volatility of interest rates. The Company

attempts
        to mitigate

its
        exposure to interest rate risk through portfolio management, which includes
        rebalancing its existing portfolios of assets and liabilities, as well as
        changing the characteristics of investments to be purchased or sold in the
        future. In addition, various derivative financial instruments are used to
        modify
        the interest rate risk exposures of certain assets and liabilities. These
        strategies include the use of interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and
        floors, options, futures, forwards and commitments to purchase securities.
        These
        instruments are generally used to lock interest rates or market values, to
        shorten or lengthen durations of fixed maturity securities or investment
        contracts, or to hedge (on an economic basis) interest rate risks associated
        with investments and variable rate debt. The Company has used these types
        of
        instruments as designated hedges against specific assets or liabilities on
        an
        infrequent basis.

The
        Company is exposed to equity price risk as a result of its investment in
        equity
        securities and equity derivatives. Equity price risk results from changes
        in the
        level or volatility of equity prices, which affect the value of equity
        securities, or instruments that derive their value from such securities.
        The
        Company attempts to mitigate its exposure to such risks by limiting its
        investment in any one security or index. The Company may also manage this
        risk
        by utilizing instruments such as options, swaps, futures and collars to protect
        appreciation in securities held. CNA uses derivatives in one of its separate

Notes

        Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
        4. Derivative Financial Instruments - (Continued)

The
        Company has exposure to credit risk arising from the uncertainty associated
        with
        a financial instrument obligor’s ability to make timely principal and/or
        interest payments. The Company attempts to mitigate this risk by limiting
        credit
        concentrations, practicing diversification, and frequently monitoring the
        credit
        quality of issuers and counterparties. In addition, the Company may utilize
        credit derivatives such as credit default swaps to modify the credit risk
        inherent in certain investments. Credit default swaps involve a transfer
        of
        credit risk from one party to another in exchange for periodic payments.
        The
        Company infrequently designates these types of instruments as hedges against
        specific assets.

Foreign
        exchange rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in foreign currency
        exchange rates will impact the fair value of financial instruments denominated
        in a foreign currency. The Company’s foreign transactions are primarily
        denominated in Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, British pounds, Japanese
        yen and the European Monetary Unit. The Company typically manages this risk
        via
        asset/liability matching and through the use of foreign currency futures
        and
        forwards. The Company has infrequently designated these types of instruments
        as
        hedges against specific assets or liabilities.

The
        contractual or notional amounts for derivatives are used to calculate the
        exchange of contractual payments under the agreements and are not representative
        of the potential for gain or loss on these instruments. Interest rates, equity
        prices, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices affect the fair
        value of derivatives. The fair values generally represent the estimated amounts
        that the Company would expect to receive or pay upon termination of the
        contracts at the reporting date. Dealer quotes are available for substantially
        all of the Company’s derivatives. For derivative instruments not actively
        traded, fair values are estimated using values obtained from independent
        pricing
        services, costs to settle or quoted market prices of comparable
        instruments.

The
        Company is required to provide collateral for all exchange-traded futures
        and
        options contracts. These margin requirements are determined by the individual
        exchanges based on the fair value of the open positions and are in the custody
        of the exchange. Collateral may also be required for over-the-counter contracts
        such as interest rate swaps, credit default swaps and currency forwards per
        the
        ISDA agreements in place. The fair value of collateral provided was $58.0
        million at December 31, 2006 and consisted primarily of cash. The fair value
        of
        the collateral at December 31, 2005 was $66.0 million and consisted primarily
        of
        U.S. Treasury Bills, which the Company had access to subject to replacement
        and
        therefore remained recorded as a component of Short term investments on the
        Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Fair
        value hedges

-

The
        Company’s hedging activities primarily involve hedging risk exposures to
        interest rate and foreign currency risks on various assets and liabilities.
        The
        Company periodically enters into interest rate swaps to modify the interest
        rate
        exposures of designated invested assets. Changes in the fair value of a
        derivative that is highly effective and that is designated and qualifies
        as a
        fair value hedge, along with the changes in the fair value of the hedged
        asset
        that are attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded as Investment gains
        (losses) in the Consolidated Statements of Income. For the year ended December
        31, 2005, CNA recognized a net gain of $0.3 million, which represents the
        ineffective portion of all fair value hedges. There was no gain or loss on
        the
        ineffective portion of the fair value hedges for the years ended December
        31,
        2006 and 2004, because CNA did not designate derivatives as fair value hedges
        in
        those years.

Cash
        flow
        hedges − Boardwalk Pipeline entered into a Treasury rate lock in October of 2006
        for a notional amount of $250.0 million of principal to hedge the risk
        attributable to changes in the risk-free component of forward 10-year interest
        rates through the issuance of its $250.0 million senior unsecured notes,
        which
        was settled at the time of the closing of the debt offering in November of
        2006.
        Boardwalk Pipeline received $0.9 million from the counterparty as a result
        of
        the settlement of the instrument, which was recorded as a component of
        Accumulated other comprehensive income and will be recognized in income as
        a
        reduction to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the 10-year term
        of
        the 5.9% senior notes.

In
        August
        of 2006, Boardwalk Pipeline entered into Treasury rate locks with two
        counterparties each for a notional amount of $100.0 million of principal
        to
        hedge the risk attributable to changes in the risk-free component of forward
        10-year interest rates through August 1, 2007. The reference rate on the
        rate
        locks is 5.0%.

The
        Company also enters into short sales as part of its portfolio management
        strategy. Short sales are commitments to sell a financial instrument not
        owned
        at the time of sale, usually done in anticipation of a price decline. These
        sales resulted in proceeds of $53.8 million and $153.0 million with fair
        value
        liabilities of $61.9 million and $165.9 million at December 31, 2006 and
        2005,
        respectively. These positions are marked to market and investment gains or
        losses are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

        Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
        5.  Earnings Per Share

Companies
        with complex capital structures are required to present basic and diluted
        earnings per share. Basic earnings per share excludes dilution and is computed
        by dividing net income attributable to each class of common stock by the
        weighted average number of common shares of each class of common stock
        outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential
        dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common
        stock
        were exercised or converted into common stock.

Certain
        options were not included in the diluted weighted shares amount due to the
        exercise price being greater than the average stock price for the respective
        periods. The number of shares not included in the diluted computations is
        as
        follows:

Note
        6.  Loews and Carolina Group Consolidating Condensed Financial
        Information

The
        issuance of Carolina Group stock has resulted in a two class common stock
        structure for the Company. Carolina Group stock, commonly called a tracking
        stock, is intended to reflect the economic performance of a defined group
        of
        assets and liabilities of the Company referred to as the Carolina Group.
        The
        principal assets and liabilities attributed to the Carolina Group are the
        Company’s 100% stock ownership interest in Lorillard, Inc.; notional, intergroup
        debt owed by the Carolina Group to the Loews Group ($1.2 billion outstanding
        at
        December 31, 2006), bearing interest at the annual rate of 8.0% and, subject
        to
        optional prepayment, due December 31, 2021; and any and all liabilities,
        costs
        and expenses of the Company and Lorillard arising out of or related to tobacco
        or tobacco-related businesses.

As
        of
        December 31, 2006, the outstanding Carolina Group stock represents a 62.34%
        economic interest in the economic performance of the Carolina Group. The
        Loews
        Group consists of all of the Company’s assets and liabilities other than the
        62.34% economic interest represented by the outstanding Carolina Group stock,
        and includes as an asset the notional, intergroup debt of the Carolina Group.
        Holders of the Company’s common stock and of Carolina Group stock are
        shareholders of Loews Corporation and are subject to the risks related to
        an
        equity investment in Loews Corporation. Each outstanding share of Carolina
        Group
        stock has 3/10 of a vote per share.

In
        August
        of 2006, May of 2006, November of 2005 and December of 2004, the Company
        sold an
        additional 15 million, 15 million, 10 million and 10 million shares of Carolina
        Group stock for net proceeds of $876.8 million, $751.5 million, $415.1 million
        and $281.9 million, respectively.

The
        Company has separated, for financial reporting purposes, the Carolina Group
        and
        Loews Group. The following schedules present the consolidating condensed
        financial information for these individual groups. Neither group is a separate
        company or legal entity. Rather, each group is intended to reflect a defined
        set
        of assets and liabilities.

Note
        9.  Claim and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves

CNA’

s
        property and casualty insurance claim and claim adjustment expense reserves
        represent the estimated amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims,
        including claims that are incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) as of the reporting
        date. CNA’s reserve projections are based primarily on detailed analysis of the
        facts in each case, CNA’s experience with similar cases and various historical
        development patterns. Consideration is given to such historical patterns
        as
        field reserving trends and claims settlement practices, loss payments, pending
        levels of unpaid claims and product mix, as well as court decisions, economic
        conditions and public attitudes. All of these factors can affect the estimation
        of claim and claim adjustment expense reserves.

Establishing
        claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, including claim and claim
        adjustment expense reserves for catastrophic events that have occurred, is
        an
        estimation process. Many factors can ultimately affect the final settlement
        of a
        claim and, therefore, the necessary reserve. Changes in the law, results
        of
        litigation, medical costs, the cost of repair materials and labor rates can
        all
        affect ultimate claim costs. In addition, time can be a critical part of
        reserving determinations since the longer the span between the incidence
        of a
        loss and the payment or settlement of the claim, the more variable the ultimate
        settlement amount can be. Accordingly, short-tail claims, such as property
        damage claims, tend to be more reasonably estimable than long-tail claims,
        such
        as general liability and professional liability claims. Adjustments to prior
        year reserve estimates, if necessary, are reflected in the results of operations
        in the period that the need for such adjustments is determined.

Catastrophes
        are an inherent risk of the property and casualty insurance business and
        have
        contributed to material period-to-period fluctuations in the Company’s results
        of operations and/or equity. Catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, were
        $59.0
        million, $493.0 million and $278.0 million for the years ended December 31,
        2006, 2005 and 2004.

The
        catastrophe losses in 2005 related

primarily to Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma, Rita, Dennis and Ophelia.


Notes
        to
        Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
        9. Claim and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves - (Continued)

The
        catastrophe losses in 2004 related primarily to Hurricanes Charley, Frances,
        Ivan and Jeanne. There can be no assurance that CNA’s ultimate cost for these
        catastrophes will not exceed current estimates.

Commercial
        catastrophe losses, gross of reinsurance, were $59.0 million, $976.0 million
        and
        $308.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and
        2004.

The
        table
        below provides a reconciliation between beginning and ending claim and claim
        adjustment expense reserves, including claim and claim adjustment expense
        reserves of the life companies.

                  above.

In
                  2006, net payments were decreased by $935.0 million due to the
                  impact of
                  significant commutations. In 2005, net payments were decreased
                  by $1,581.0
                  due to the impact of significant commutations. See Note 18 for
                  further
                  discussion related to commutations.

The
        changes in provision for insured events of prior years (net prior year claim

The
        following provides discussion of CNA’s Asbestos, Environmental Pollution and
        Mass Tort (“APMT”) and core reserves.

APMT
        Reserves

CNA’s
        property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have actual and potential exposures
        related to APMT claims.

Establishing
        reserves for APMT claim and claim adjustment expenses is subject to
        uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims. Traditional
        actuarial methods and techniques employed to estimate the ultimate cost of
        claims for more traditional property and casualty exposures are less precise
        in
        estimating claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for APMT, particularly
        in
        an environment of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise
        from industry practices and legal, judicial and social conditions. Therefore,
        these traditional actuarial methods and techniques are necessarily supplemented
        with additional estimating techniques and

methodologies,
        many of which involve significant judgments that are required of management.
        Accordingly, a high degree of uncertainty remains for CNA’s ultimate liability
        for APMT claim and claim adjustment expenses.

In
        addition to the difficulties described above, estimating the ultimate cost
        of
        both reported and unreported APMT claims is subject to a higher degree of
        variability due to a number of additional factors, including among others:
        the
        number and outcome of direct actions against CNA; coverage issues, including
        whether certain costs are covered under the policies and whether policy limits
        apply; allocation of liability among numerous parties, some of whom may be
        in
        bankruptcy proceedings, and in particular the application of “joint and several”
liability to specific

plaintiffs’
          lawyers; the risks and lack of predictability inherent in major litigation;
          enactment of state and federal

legislation
          to address asbestos claims; increases and decreases in asbestos, environmental
          pollution and mass tort claims which cannot now be anticipated; increases
          and
          decreases in costs to defend asbestos, pollution and mass tort claims;
          changing
          liability theories against CNA’s policyholders in environmental and mass tort
          matters; possible exhaustion of underlying umbrella and excess coverage;
          and
          future developments pertaining to CNA’s ability to recover reinsurance for
          asbestos, pollution and mass tort claims.

CNA
        has
        annually performed ground up reviews of all open APMT claims to evaluate
        the
        adequacy of CNA’s APMT reserves. In performing its comprehensive ground up
        analysis, CNA considers input from its professionals with direct responsibility
        for the claims, inside and outside counsel with responsibility for
        representation of CNA and its actuarial staff. These professionals review,
        among
        many factors, the policyholder’s present and predicted future exposures,
        including such factors as claims volume, trial conditions, prior settlement
        history, settlement demands and defense costs; the impact of asbestos defendant
        bankruptcies on the policyholder; the policies issued by CNA, including such
        factors as aggregate or per occurrence limits, whether the policy is primary,
        umbrella or excess, and the existence of policyholder retentions and/or
        deductibles; the existence of other insurance; and reinsurance
        arrangements.

The
        following table provides data related to CNA’s APMT claim and claim adjustment
        expense reserves.

Asbestos

CNA’s
        property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have exposure to asbestos-related
        claims. Estimation of asbestos-related claim and claim adjustment expense
        reserves involves limitations such as inconsistency of court decisions, specific
        policy provisions, allocation of liability among insurers and insureds, and
        additional factors such as missing policies and proof of coverage. Furthermore,
        estimation of asbestos-related claims is difficult due to, among other reasons,
        the proliferation of bankruptcy proceedings and attendant uncertainties,
        the
        targeting of a broader range of businesses and entities as defendants, the
        uncertainty as to which other insureds may be targeted in the future and
        the
        uncertainties inherent in predicting the number of future claims.

As
        of
        December 31, 2006 and 2005, CNA carried approximately $1,452.0 million and
        $1,554.0 million of claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, net of
        reinsurance recoverables, for reported and unreported asbestos-related claims.
        CNA recorded no asbestos-related net claim and claim adjustment expense reserve
        development for the year ended December 31, 2006. For the years ended December
        31, 2005 and 2004, CNA recorded $10.0 million and $54.0 million of unfavorable
        asbestos-related net claim and claim adjustment expense reserve development.
        The
        2004 unfavorable net prior year development was primarily related to a loss
        from
        the commutation of reinsurance treaties with The Trenwick Group (“Trenwick”).
        CNA paid asbestos-related claims, net of reinsurance recoveries, of $102.0
        million, $142.0 million and $135.0 million for the years ended December 31,
        2006, 2005 and 2004.

Certain
        asbestos claim litigation in which CNA is currently engaged is described
        below:

The
        ultimate cost of reported claims, and in particular APMT claims, is subject
        to a
        great many uncertainties, including future developments of various kinds
        that
        CNA does not control and that are difficult or impossible to foresee accurately.
        With respect to the litigation identified below in particular, numerous factual
        and legal issues remain unresolved. Rulings on those issues by the courts
        are
        critical to the evaluation of the ultimate cost to CNA. The outcome of the
        litigation cannot be predicted with any reliability. Accordingly, the extent
        of
        losses beyond any amounts that may be accrued are not readily determinable
        at
        this time.

        Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
        9. Claim and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves - (Continued)

On
        February 13, 2003, CNA announced it had resolved asbestos related coverage
        litigation and claims involving A.P. Green Industries, A.P. Green Services
        and
        Bigelow − Liptak Corporation. Under the agreement, CNA is required to pay $74.0
        million, net of reinsurance recoveries, over a ten year period commencing
        after
        the final approval of a bankruptcy plan of reorganization. The settlement
        resolves CNA’s liabilities for all pending and future asbestos and silica claims
        involving A.P. Green Industries, Bigelow − Liptak Corporation and related
        subsidiaries, including alleged “non-products” exposures. The settlement
        received initial bankruptcy court approval on August 18, 2003. The court
        has
        held a confirmation hearing on the bankruptcy plan containing an injunction
        to
        protect CNA from any future claims and the parties are awaiting a ruling
        on
        confirmation.

CNA
        is
        engaged in insurance coverage litigation in New York State Court, filed in
        2003,
        with a defendant class of underlying plaintiffs who have asbestos bodily
        injury
        claims against the former Robert A. Keasbey Company (“Keasbey”)

(

Continental
        Casualty Co. v. Employers Ins. of Wausau et al.

,
        No.
        601037/03 (N.Y. County)). Keasbey, a currently dissolved corporation, was
        a
        seller and installer of asbestos-containing insulation products in New York
        and
        New Jersey. Thousands of plaintiffs have filed bodily injury claims against
        Keasbey; however, Keasbey’s involvement at a number of work sites is a highly
        contested issue. Therefore, the defense disputes the percentage of valid
        claims
        against Keasbey. CNA issued Keasbey primary policies for 1970-1987 and excess
        policies for 1972-1978. CNA has paid an amount substantially equal to the
        policies’ aggregate limits for products and completed operations claims in the
        confirmed CNA policies. Claimants against Keasbey allege, among other things,
        that CNA owes coverage under sections of the policies not subject to the
        aggregate limits, an allegation CNA vigorously contests in the lawsuit. In
        the
        litigation, CNA and the claimants seek declaratory relief as to the
        interpretation of various policy provisions. The court dismissed a claim
        alleging bad faith and seeking unspecified damages on March 21, 2004; that
        ruling was affirmed on March 31, 2005 by Appellate Division, First Department.
        The trial in the Keasbey coverage action commenced on July 13, 2005; closing
        arguments concluded on October 28, 2005. The Court reopened the record in
        January 2006 for additional evidentiary submissions and briefing, and additional
        closing arguments were held March 27, 2006. It is unclear when CNA will have
        a
        decision from the trial court. With respect to this litigation in particular,
        numerous factual and legal issues remain to be resolved that are critical
        to the
        final result, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with any reliability.
        These factors include, among others: (a) whether CNA has any further
        responsibility to compensate claimants against Keasbey under its policies
        and,
        if so, under which policies; (b) whether CNA’s responsibilities extend to a
        particular claimant’s entire claim or only to a limited percentage of the claim;
        (c) whether CNA’s responsibilities under its policies are limited by the
        occurrence limits or other provisions of the policies; (d) whether certain
        exclusions in some of the policies apply to exclude certain claims; (e) the
        extent to which claimants can establish exposures to asbestos materials as
        to
        which Keasbey has any responsibility; (f) the legal theories which must be
        pursued by such claimants to establish the liability of Keasbey and whether
        such
        theories can, in fact, be established; (g) the diseases and damages alleged
        by
        such claimants; and (h) the extent that such liability would be shared with
        other responsible parties. Accordingly, the extent of losses beyond any amounts
        that may be accrued are not readily determinable at this time.

CNA
        has
        insurance coverage disputes related to asbestos bodily injury claims against
        a
        bankrupt insured, Burns & Roe Enterprises, Inc. (“Burns & Roe”). These
        disputes are currently part of coverage litigation (stayed in view of the
        bankruptcy) and an adversary proceeding in

In
        re: Burns & Roe Enterprises, Inc

.,
        pending in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey, No.
        00-41610. Burns & Roe provided engineering and related services in
        connection with construction projects. At the time of its bankruptcy filing,
        on
        December 4, 2000, Burns & Roe asserted that it faced approximately 11,000
        claims alleging bodily injury resulting from exposure to asbestos as a result
        of
        construction projects in which Burns & Roe was involved. CNA allegedly
        provided primary liability coverage to Burns & Roe from 1956-1969 and
        1971-1974, along with certain project-specific policies from 1964-1970. The
        litigation involves disputes over the confirmation of the Plan of Reorganization
        in bankruptcy, the scope and extent of coverage, if any, afforded to Burns
&
Roe for its asbestos liabilities. On December 5, 2005, Burns & Roe filed its
        Third Amended Plan of Reorganization (“Plan”). A confirmation hearing relating
        to that Plan is anticipated in 2007. Coverage issues will be determined in
        a
        later proceeding. With respect to both confirmation of the Plan and coverage
        issues, numerous factual and legal issues remain to be resolved that are
        critical to the final result, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with
        any
        reliability. These factors include, among others: (a) whether CNA has any
        further responsibility to compensate claimants against Burns & Roe under its
        policies and, if so, under which; (b) whether CNA’s responsibilities under its
        policies extend to a particular claimant’s entire claim or only to a limited
        percentage of the claim; (c) whether CNA’s responsibilities under its policies
        are limited by the occurrence limits or other provisions of the policies;
        (d)
        whether certain exclusions, including professional liability

establish
          exposure to asbestos materials as to which Burns & Roe has any
          responsibility; (f) the legal theories which must be pursued by such claimants
          to establish the liability of Burns & Roe and whether such theories can, in
          fact, be established; (g) the diseases and damages alleged by such claimants;
          (h) the extent that any liability of Burns & Roe would be shared with other
          potentially responsible parties; and (i) the impact of bankruptcy proceedings
          on
          claims and coverage issue resolution. Accordingly, the extent of losses
          beyond
          any amounts that may be accrued are not readily determinable at this
          time.

Suits
        have also been initiated directly against the CNA companies and numerous
        other
        insurers in three jurisdictions: Texas, West Virginia and Montana. Lawsuits
        were
        filed in Texas beginning in 2002, against two CNA companies and numerous
        other
        insurers and non-insurer corporate defendants asserting liability for failing
        to
        warn of the dangers of asbestos (E.g.

Boson
        v. Union Carbide Corp.

,

(Nueces
        County, Texas)). During 2003, many of the Texas suits were dismissed as
        time-barred by the applicable Statute of Limitations. In other suits, the
        carriers argued that they did not owe any duty to the plaintiffs or the general
        public to advise the world generally or the plaintiffs particularly of the
        effects of asbestos and that Texas statutes precluded liability for such
        claims,
        and two Texas courts dismissed these suits. Certain of the Texas courts’ rulings
        were appealed, but plaintiffs later dismissed their appeals. A different
        Texas
        court denied similar motions seeking dismissal at the pleading stage, allowing
        limited discovery to proceed. After that court denied a related challenge
        to
        jurisdiction, the insurers transferred those cases, among others, to a state
        multi-district litigation court in Harris County charged with handling asbestos
        cases, and the cases remain in that court. The insurers have petitioned the
        appellate court in Houston for an order of mandamus, requiring the
        multi-district litigation court to dismiss the cases on jurisdictional and
        substantive grounds. With respect to this litigation in particular, numerous
        factual and legal issues remain to be resolved that are critical to the final
        result, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with any reliability. These
        factors include: (a) the speculative nature and unclear scope of any alleged
        duties owed to individuals exposed to asbestos and the resulting uncertainty
        as
        to the potential pool of potential claimants; (b) the fact that imposing
        such
        duties on all insurer and non-insurer corporate defendants would be
        unprecedented and, therefore, the legal boundaries of recovery are difficult
        to
        estimate; (c) the fact that many of the claims brought to date are barred
        by
        various Statutes of Limitation and it is unclear whether future claims would
        also be barred; (d) the unclear nature of the required nexus between the
        acts of
        the defendants and the right of any particular claimant to recovery; and
        (e) the
        existence of hundreds of co-defendants in some of the suits and the
        applicability of the legal theories pled by the claimants to thousands of
        potential defendants. Accordingly, the extent of losses beyond any amounts
        that
        may be accrued are not readily determinable at this time.

Continental
        Casualty Company (“CCC”) was named in

Adams
        v. Aetna, Inc., et al

.

(Circuit
        Court of Kanawha County, West Virginia, Nos, 0-2C-1708 to -1719, filed June
        28,
        2002), a purported class action against CCC and other insurers, alleging
        that
        the defendants violated West Virginia’s Unfair Trade Practices Act (“UTPA”) in
        handling and resolving asbestos claims against their insureds. In September
        2006, CCC entered into a settlement with plaintiffs and on November 15, 2006,
        the Circuit Court of Kanawha County dismissed plaintiffs’ claims against CCC.
        While no party filed an opposition to the settlement, the time for seeking
        leave
        to appeal that dismissal order to the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals
        has
        not yet expired.

In
        the
        event the dismissal order is appealed to the West Virginia Supreme Court
        and the
        dismissal order is set aside, numerous factual and legal issues would determine
        the final result in Adams, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with
        any
        reliability.

These
        issues include: (a) the legal sufficiency and factual validity of the novel
        statutory claims pled by the claimants; (b) the applicability of claimants’
legal theories to insurers who issued excess policies and/or neither defended
        nor controlled the defense of certain policyholders; (c) the possibility
        that
        certain of the claims are barred by various Statutes of Limitation; (d) the
        fact
        that the imposition of duties would interfere with the attorney-client privilege
        and the contractual rights and responsibilities of the parties to CNA’s
        insurance policies; (e) whether plaintiffs’ claims are barred in whole or in
        part by injunctions that have been issued by bankruptcy courts that are
        overseeing, or that have overseen, the bankruptcies of various insureds;
        (f)
        whether some or all of the named plaintiffs or members of the plaintiff class
        have released CCC from the claims alleged in the Amended Complaint when they
        resolved their underlying asbestos claims; (g) the appropriateness of the
        case
        for class action treatment; and (h) the potential and relative magnitude
        of
        liabilities of co-defendants. Accordingly, the extent of losses beyond any
        amounts that may be accrued are not readily determinable at this time.

On
          March
          22, 2002, a direct action was filed in Montana (

Pennock,
          et al. v. Maryland Casualty, et al.

          Judicial District Court of Lewis & Clark County, Montana) by eight
          individual plaintiffs (all employees of W.R.

This

action
        alleges that the carriers failed to warn of or otherwise protect W.R. Grace
        employees from the dangers of asbestos at a W.R. Grace vermiculite mining
        facility in Libby, Montana. The Montana direct action is currently stayed
        because of W.R. Grace’s pending bankruptcy. With respect to such claims,
        numerous factual and legal issues remain to be resolved that are critical
        to the
        final result, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with any reliability.
        These factors include: (a) the unclear nature and scope of any alleged duties
        owed to people exposed to asbestos and the resulting uncertainty as to the
        potential pool of potential claimants; (b) the potential application of Statutes
        of Limitation to many of the claims which may be made depending on the nature
        and scope of the alleged duties; (c) the unclear nature of the required nexus
        between the acts of the defendants and the right of any particular claimant
        to
        recovery; (d) the diseases and damages claimed by such claimants; (e) the
        extent
        that such liability would be shared with other potentially responsible parties;
        and (f) the impact of bankruptcy proceedings on claims resolution. Accordingly,
        the extent of losses beyond any amounts that may be accrued are not readily
        determinable at this time.

CNA
        is
        vigorously defending these and other cases and believes that it has meritorious
        defenses to the claims asserted. However, there are numerous factual and
        legal
        issues to be resolved in connection with these claims, and it is extremely
        difficult to predict the outcome or ultimate financial exposure represented
        by
        these matters. Adverse developments with respect to any of these matters
        could
        have a material adverse effect on CNA’s business and insurer financial strength
        and debt ratings and the Company’s results of operations and/or
        equity.

Environmental
        Pollution and Mass Tort

As
        of
        December 31, 2006 and 2005, CNA carried approximately $416.0 million and
        $423.0
        million of claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, net of reinsurance
        recoverables, for reported and unreported environmental pollution and mass
        tort
        claims. There was $63.0 million, $53.0 million and $1.0 million of unfavorable
        environmental pollution and mass tort net claim and claim adjustment expense
        reserve development recorded for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005
        and
        2004. CNA recorded $40.0 million, $20.0 million and $15.0 million of current
        accident year losses related to mass tort for the years ended December 31,
        2006,
        2005 and 2004. CNA paid environmental pollution-related claims and mass
        tort-related claims, net of reinsurance recoveries, of $110.0 million, $147.0
        million and $96.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and
        2004.

In
        addition to mass tort claims arising from exposure to asbestos as discussed
        above, CNA also has exposure arising from other mass tort claims. Such claims
        typically involve allegations by multiple plaintiffs alleging injury resulting
        from exposure to or use of similar substances or products over multiple policy
        periods. Examples include, but are not limited to, lead paint claims, hardboard
        siding, polybutylene pipe, mold, silica, latex gloves, benzene products,
        welding
        rods, diet drugs, breast implants, medical devices, and various other toxic
        chemical exposures. During CNA’s 2006 ground up review, CNA noted adverse
        development in various mass tort accounts. The adverse development results
        primarily from increases related to defense costs in a small number of accounts
        arising out of various substances and products. As a result, CNA increased
        mass
        tort reserves for prior accident years by $63.0 million in 2006.

CNA
        noted
        adverse development in various pollution accounts in its 2005 ground up review.
        In the course of its review, CNA did not observe a negative trend or
        deterioration in the underlying pollution claims environment. Rather, individual
        account estimates changed due to changes in liability and/or coverage
        circumstances particular to those accounts. As a result, CNA increased pollution
        reserves for prior accident years by $50.0 million in 2005.

Net
        Prior Year Development

Unfavorable
        net prior year development of $185.0 million, including $251.0 million of
        unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development
        and
        $66.0 million of favorable premium development, was recorded in 2006.
        Unfavorable net prior year development of $807.0 million, including $945.0
        million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
        development and $138.0 million of favorable premium development, was recorded
        in
        2005. Unfavorable net prior year development of $134.0 million, including
        $250.0
        million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
        development and $116.0 million of favorable premium development, was recorded
        in
        2004.

Note
        9. Claim and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves - (Continued)

The
        development discussed below includes premium development due to its direct
        relationship to claim and claim adjustment expense reserve development. The
        development discussed below excludes the impact of the provision for
        uncollectible reinsurance, but includes the impact of commutations. See Note
        for further discussion of the provision for uncollectible
        reinsurance.

In
        and 2004, CNA recorded favorable or unfavorable premium and claim and claim
        adjustment expense reserve development related to the corporate aggregate
        reinsurance treaties as movements in the claim and allocated claim adjustment
        expense reserves for the accident years covered by the corporate aggregate
        reinsurance treaties indicated such development was required. While the
        available limit of these treaties was fully utilized in 2003, the ceded premiums
        and losses for an individual segment changed in subsequent years because
        of the
        re-estimation of the subject losses or commutations of the underlying contracts.
        In 2005, CNA commuted a significant corporate aggregate reinsurance treaty
        and
        in 2006, CNA commuted its remaining corporate aggregate reinsurance treaty.
        See
        Note 18 for further discussion of the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties.

The
        following tables and discussion include the net prior year development recorded
        for Standard Lines, Specialty Lines and Other Insurance for the years ended
        December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Unfavorable net prior year development
        of
        $13.0 million was recorded in the Life and Group Non-Core segment for the
        year
        ended December 31, 2006. Favorable net prior year development of $5.0 million
        and $7.0 million was recorded in the Life and Group Non-Core segment for

primarily
          2002 and prior. The primary drivers of the continuing claim cost inflation
          are
          medical inflation and advances in medical care.

Favorable
        claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development of
        approximately $88.0 million was recorded in relation to the short-tail coverages
        such as property and marine, primarily in accident years 2004 and 2005. The
        favorable results are primarily due to the underwriting actions taken by
        CNA
        that have significantly improved the results on this business and favorable
        outcomes on individual claims.

The
        majority of the favorable premium development was due to additional premium
        primarily resulting from audits and changes to premium on several ceded
        reinsurance agreements. Business impacted included various middle market
        liability coverages, workers’ compensation, property, and large accounts. This
        favorable premium development was partially offset by approximately $44.0
        million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
        development recorded as a result of this favorable premium
        development.

Specialty
        Lines

Approximately
        $55.0 million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense
        reserve development was recorded due to increased claim adjustment expenses
        and
        increased severities in the architects and engineers book of business in
        accident years 2003 and prior. Previous reviews assumed that incurred severities
        had increased, at least in part, due to increases in the adequacy of case
        reserve estimates with relatively minor changes in underlying severity.
        Subsequent changes in paid and case incurred losses have shown that more
        of the
        change was due to underlying increases in verdict and settlement size for
        these
        accident years rather than increases in case reserve adequacy, resulting
        in
        higher ultimate losses. One of the primary drivers of these larger verdicts
        and
        settlements is the continuing general increase in commercial and private
        real
        estate values.

Approximately
        $60.0 million of favorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
        development was due to improved claim severity and claim frequency in the
        healthcare professional liability business, primarily in dental, nursing
        home
        liability, physicians and other healthcare facilities. The improved severity
        and
        frequency are due to underwriting changes. CNA no longer writes large national
        nursing home chains and focuses on smaller insureds in selected areas of
        the
        country. These changes have resulted in business that experiences fewer large
        claims.

Approximately
        $15.0 million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense
        reserve development was primarily related to increased severity on individual
        large claims from large law firm errors and omissions (“E&O”), and directors
        and officers (“D&O”) coverages. These increases result in higher ultimate
        loss projections from the average loss methods used by the Company’s
        actuaries.

Approximately
        $17.0 million of favorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
        development was recorded in the warranty line of business for accident years
        2004 and 2005. The reserves for this business are initially estimated based
        on
        the loss ratio expected for the business. Subsequent estimates rely more
        heavily
        on the actual case incurred losses due to the short-tail nature of this
        business. The short-tail nature of the business is due to the short period
        of
        time that passes between the time the business is written and the time when
        all
        claims are known and settled. Case incurred loss for the most recent accident
        year has been lower than indicated by the initial loss ratio.

The
        majority of the unfavorable premium development was related to ceded reinsurance
        activity.

Other
        Insurance

The
        majority of the unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense
        reserve
        development was related to CNA’s exposure arising from other mass tort claims.
        Such claims typically involve allegations by multiple plaintiffs alleging
        injury
        resulting from exposure to or use of similar substances or products over
        multiple policy periods. Examples include, but are not limited to, lead paint
        claims, hardboard siding, polybutylene pipe, mold, silica, latex gloves,
        benzene
        products, welding rods, diet drugs, breast implants, medical devices, and

          The adverse development results primarily from increases related to defense
          costs in a small number of accounts arising out of various substances and
          products.

        Net Prior Year Development

Standard
        Lines

During
        the fourth quarter of 2005, CNA executed commutation agreements with certain
        reinsurers, including the commutation of a corporate aggregate reinsurance
        agreement. These agreements resulted in approximately $285.0 million of
        unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development.
        This unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
        development was partially offset by a release of a previously established
        allowance for uncollectible reinsurance.

Also,
        in
        the fourth quarter of 2005, reserve reviews of certain products were conducted
        and changes in reserve estimates were recorded. Approximately $102.0 million
        of
        unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development
        was
        due to higher frequency and severity on claims related to excess workers’
compensation, particularly in accident years 2003 and prior. The primary
        drivers
        of the higher frequency and severity were increasing medical inflation and
        advances in medical care. Medical inflation increases the cost of claims
        resulting in more claims reaching the excess layers covered by CNA. Medical
        inflation also increases the size of claims in CNA’s layers. Similarly, advances
        in medical care extend the life expectancies of claimants again resulting
        in
        additional costs to be covered by CNA as well as more claims reaching the
        excess
        layers covered by CNA.

In
        addition, approximately $4.0 million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim
        adjustment expense reserve development was recorded due to increased severity
        on
        known claims on package policies provided to small businesses in accident
        years
        2002 and 2003. Approximately $10.0 million of favorable claim and allocated
        claim adjustment expense reserve development was due to lower severities
        in the
        excess and surplus lines runoff business in accident years 2001 and prior.
        These
        severity changes were driven primarily by judicial decisions and settlement
        activities on individual cases.

Approximately
        $23.0 million of favorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
        development was related to favorable loss trends on accident years 2002 and
        subsequent in CNA’s international business, specifically Europe and Canada,
        primarily in property, cargo and marine coverages. Approximately $4.0 million
        of
        favorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
        development was due to less than expected losses in involuntary
        business.

Approximately
        $140.0 million of favorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment
        expense reserve development was recorded due to improvement in the severity
        and
        number of claims for property coverages and marine business, primarily in
        accident year 2004. The improvements in severity and frequency are substantially
        due to underwriting actions taken by CNA that have significantly improved
        the
        results on this business.

Approximately
        $126.0 million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim
        adjustment expense reserve development resulted from increased severity trends
        for workers’ compensation, primarily in accident year 2002 and prior. The
        primary drivers of the higher severity trends were increasing medical inflation
        and advances in medical care. Medical inflation increases the cost of medical
        services, and advances in medical care extend the life expectancies of claimants
        resulting in additional costs to be covered by CNA.

Approximately
        $15.0 million of unfavorable premium development was recorded in relation
        to
        this unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment expense
        reserve development which resulted from additional ceded reinsurance premium
        on
        agreements where the ceded premium is impacted by the level of ceded
        losses.

Approximately
        $90.0 million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment
        expense reserve development and $83.0 million of favorable net prior year
        premium development resulted from an unfavorable arbitration ruling on two
        reinsurance treaties.


Notes
        to
        Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
        9. Claim and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves - (Continued)

Approximately
        $76.0 million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment
        expense reserve development was attributed to increased severity in liability
        coverages for large account policies. These increases are driven by increasing
        medical inflation and larger verdicts than anticipated, both of which increase
        the severity of these claims.

Approximately
        $53.0 million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment
        expense reserve development was related to reviews of liquor liability, trucking
        and habitational business that indicated that the number of large claims
        was
        higher than previously expected in recent accident years. The remainder of
        the
        favorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
        development was primarily a result of improved experience on several coverages
        on middle market business, mainly in accident year 2004.

Favorable
        net prior year premium development was recorded primarily as a result of
        additional premium resulting from audits on recent policies, primarily workers’
compensation.

Additionally,
        there was $19.0 million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated
        claim
        adjustment expense reserve development and $6.0 million of favorable premium
        development related to the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties, excluding
        the impact of a corporate aggregate reinsurance commutation as discussed
        above.

Specialty
        Lines

Approximately
        $60.0 million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense
        reserve development was recorded due to increased claim adjustment expenses
        and
        increased severities in the architects and engineers book of business, in
        accident years 2000 through 2003. Previous reviews assumed that severities
        had
        increased, at least in part, due to increases in the adequacy of case reserve
        estimates. Subsequent changes in paid and incurred loss have shown that more
        of
        the change was due to larger verdicts and settlements during these accident
        years. One of the primary drivers of these larger verdicts and settlements
        is
        the continuing general increase in real estate values. Favorable net prior
        year
        premium development of approximately $10.0 million was recorded in relation
        to
        this unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
        development.

Approximately
        $45.0 million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment
        expense reserve development was related to large D&O claims assumed from a
        London syndicate, primarily in accident years 2001 and prior. Approximately
        $43.0 million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment
        expense reserve development was recorded due to large claims under excess
        coverages provided to health care facilities.

Approximately
        $32.0 million of favorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
        development related to surety business was due to a favorable outcome on
        several
        specific large claims and lower than expected emergence of additional large
        claims related to accident years 1999 through 2003.

Approximately
        $30.0 million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense
        reserve development was related to a commutation agreement executed in the
        fourth quarter of 2005 of a corporate aggregate reinsurance agreement. This
        unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development
        was
        partially offset by a release of a previously established allowance for
        uncollectible reinsurance.

Approximately
        $24.0 million of favorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment
        expense reserve development was recorded as a result of improvements in the
        claim severity and claim frequency, mainly in recent accident years, from
        nursing home businesses. The improved severity and frequency are due to
        underwriting changes in this business. CNA no longer writes large national
        chains and focuses on smaller insureds in selected areas of the country.
        These
        changes have resulted in business that experiences fewer large
        claims.

Approximately
        $14.0 million of favorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment
        expense reserve development was recorded due to lower severity in the dental
        program. The lower severity is driven by efforts to resolve a higher percentage
        of claims without a resulting indemnity payment.

The
        remainder of the favorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment
        expense reserve development was primarily attributed to favorable experience
        in
        the warranty line of business, partially offset by unfavorable net prior
        year
        claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development attributed
        to
        other large D&O claims.


Notes
        to
        Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
        9. Claim and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves - (Continued)

Additionally,
        there was approximately $25.0 million of favorable net prior year claim and
        allocated claim adjustment expense reserve development and $19.0 million
        of
        unfavorable premium development related to the corporate aggregate reinsurance
        treaties in 2005, excluding the impact of a corporate aggregate reinsurance
        commutation as discussed above.

Other
        Insurance

Approximately
        $157.0 million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense
        reserve development was attributable to CNA’s assumed reinsurance operations,
        driven by a significant increase in large claim activity during 2005 across
        multiple accident years. This development was concentrated in the proportional
        liability, excess of loss liability, and professional liability businesses,
        which impact underlying coverages that include general liability, umbrella,
        E&O and D&O. CNA’s assumed reinsurance operations were put in run-off in
        2003.

During
        the fourth quarter of 2005, CNA executed significant commutation agreements
        with
        certain reinsurers, including the commutation of a corporate aggregate
        reinsurance agreement. These agreements resulted in approximately $62.0 million
        of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
        development.

Approximately
        $56.0 million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense
        reserve development recorded in 2005 was a result of a second quarter
        commutation of a finite reinsurance contract put in place in 1992. CNA
        recaptured $400.0 million of losses and received $344.0 million of cash.
        The
        commutation was economically attractive because of the reinsurance agreement’s
        contractual interest rate and maintenance charges.

Approximately
        $6.0 million of unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense
        reserve
        development was related to the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties,
        excluding the impact of a corporate aggregate reinsurance commutation as
        discussed above. The unfavorable premium development was driven by $10.0
        million
        of additional ceded reinsurance premium on agreements where the ceded premium
        depends on the ceded loss and $4.0 million of additional premium ceded to
        the
        corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties.

CNA
        noted
        adverse development in various pollution accounts in its most recent ground
        up
        review. In the course of its review, CNA did not observe a negative trend
        or
        deterioration in the underlying pollution claims environment. Rather, individual
        account estimates changed due to changes in liability and/or coverage
        circumstances particular to those accounts. As a result, CNA increased pollution
        reserves by $50.0 million in 2005.

The
        overall unfavorable claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserve
        development was partially decreased by favorable claim and allocated claim
        adjustment expense reserve development in various other programs in runoff,
        including Financial Guarantee, Guarantee and Credit, and Mortgage Guarantee.
        These programs have recently exhibited favorable trends due to offsetting
        recoveries and commutations, leading to reductions in the estimated
        liabilities.

        Net Prior Year Development

Standard
        Lines

Approximately
        $190.0 million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim
        adjustment expense reserve development recorded during 2004 resulted from
        increased severity trends for workers’ compensation on large account policies
        primarily in accident years 2002 and prior. The primary drivers of the higher
        severity trends were increasing medical inflation and advances in medical
        care.
        Medical inflation increases the cost of medical services, and advances in
        medical care extend the life expectancies of claimants resulting in additional
        costs to be covered by CNA. Favorable premium development on retrospectively
        rated large account policies of $50.0 million was recorded in relation to
        this
        unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claims adjustment expense
        reserve
        development.

Approximately
          $60.0 million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment
          expense reserve development was recorded in involuntary pools in which
          CNA’s
          participation is mandatory and primarily based on

adjustment
        expense reserve development was related to CNA’s share of the National Workers’
Compensation Reinsurance Pool (“NWCRP”). During 2004, the NWCRP reached an
        agreement with a former pool member to settle their pool liabilities at an
        amount less than their established share. The result of this settlement is
        a
        higher allocation to the remaining pool members, including CNA. The remainder
        of
        this unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment expense
        reserve development was primarily due to increased severity trends for workers’
compensation exposures in older years.

Approximately
        $60.0 million of unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment
        expense reserve development resulted from the change in estimates due to
        increased severity trends for excess and surplus business driven by excess
        liability, liquor liability and coverages provided to apartment and condominium
        complexes. These severity changes were driven primarily by judicial decisions
        and settlement activities on individual cases.

Approximately
        $105.0 million of favorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment
        expense reserve development resulted from reserve studies of commercial auto
        liability policies and the liability portion of package policies. The change
        was
        due to improvement in the severity and number of claims for this business.
        This
        is primarily due to a lower than expected number of large claims. Approximately
        $85.0 million of favorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment
        expense reserve development was due to improvement in the severity and number
        of
        claims for property coverages primarily in accident year 2003. The improvements
        in severity and frequency are substantially due to underwriting actions taken
        by
        the Company that have significantly improved the results on this business.
        Other
        favorable net prior year premium development of approximately $50.0 million
        resulted primarily from higher audit and endorsement premiums on workers’
compensation policies.

During
        2004, CNA executed commutation agreements with several members of Trenwick.
        These commutations resulted in unfavorable claim and claim adjustment expense
        reserve development which was more than offset by a release of a previously
        established allowance for uncollectible reinsurance.

        of
        the unfavorable net prior year claim and allocated claim adjustment expense
        reserve development resulted from several other small commutations and increases
        to net reserves due to reducing ceded losses, partially offset by a release

The
        Company and its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income
        tax
        return. The Company has entered into a separate tax allocation agreement
        with
        CNA, a majority-owned subsidiary in which its ownership exceeds 80%. The
        agreement provides that the Company will (i) pay to CNA the amount, if any,
        by
        which the Company’s consolidated federal income tax is reduced by virtue of
        inclusion of CNA in the Company’s return, or (ii) be paid by CNA an amount, if
        any, equal to the federal income tax that would have been payable by CNA
        if it
        had filed a separate consolidated return. The agreement may be canceled by
        either of the parties upon thirty days’ written notice.

The
        Company’s consolidated federal income tax returns for 2002 through 2004 have
        been settled with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), including related
        carryback claims for refund which were approved by the Joint Committee on
        Taxation. As a result, the Company recorded a federal income tax benefit
        of $9.1
        million and net refund interest of $2.3 million, net of tax and minority
        interest, in the year ended December 31, 2006.

In
        2005,
        the Company’s consolidated federal income tax returns were settled with the IRS
        through 2001 as the tax returns for 1998 through 2001, including related
        carryback claims and prior claims for refund, were approved by the Joint
        Committee on Taxation in the second quarter of 2005. As a result, the Company
        recorded net refund interest of $130.6 million that is included in Other
        Revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Subsequent to this
        settlement, a review of tax liabilities was performed and the Company reduced
        its deferred tax liabilities by $58.5 million for the year ended December
        31,
        2005. The tax benefit related primarily to the release of federal income
        tax
        reserves.

The
        Company’s consolidated federal income tax return for 2005 is currently under
        examination by the IRS. The Company believes the outcome of this examination
        will not have a material effect on the financial condition or results of
        operations of the Company. In addition, for 2007, the IRS has invited the
        Company and its eligible tax consolidated subsidiaries to participate in
        the
        Compliance Assurance Process (“CAP”) which is a voluntary program for a limited
        number of large corporations. Under CAP, the IRS conducts a real-time audit
        and
        works contemporaneously with the Company to resolve any issues prior to the
        filing of the 2007 tax return. The Company has agreed to participate. The
        Company believes that this approach should reduce tax-related uncertainties,
        if
        any.

Provision
        has been made for the expected U.S. federal income tax liabilities applicable
        to
        undistributed earnings of subsidiaries, except for certain subsidiaries for
        which the Company intends to invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely,
        or
        recover such undistributed earnings tax-free. At December 31, 2006, the Company
        has not provided deferred taxes of $104.0 million, if sold through a taxable
        sale, on $297.0 million of undistributed earnings related to a domestic
        affiliate. The determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax
        liability related to the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries is
        not
        practicable.

Total
        income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
        was
        different than the amounts of $1,565.2 million, $646.3 million and $640.1
        million, computed by applying the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate
        of 35%
        to income before income taxes and minority interest for each of the
        years.

At
        December 31, 2005, a valuation allowance of $31.2 million related to certain
        foreign subsidiaries remained outstanding, due to uncertainty in the ability
        of
        the foreign subsidiaries to generate sufficient future income. During 2006,
        the
        Company reconsidered the need for this allowance in light of recent earnings
        levels and anticipated future earnings and determined the allowance was no
        longer required. Therefore, the allowance was released in 2006. Although
        realization of deferred tax assets is not assured, management believes it
        is
        more likely than not that the recognized net deferred tax asset will be realized
        through future earnings, including but not limited to future income from
        continuing operations, reversal of existing temporary differences, and available
        tax planning strategies.

At
        December 31, 2006, Diamond Offshore, which is not included in the Company’s
        consolidated federal income tax return, had a net operating loss carryforward
        of
        approximately $7.9 million which will expire by 2010. It is expected that
        the
        net operating loss carryforward will be fully utilized by Diamond Offshore
        in
        future years.

Gain
        on Issuance of Subsidiary Stock

In
        August
        of 2006, CNA completed a public offering of 7.0 million shares of its common
        stock. In addition, the Company purchased 7.86 million shares of CNA’s common
        stock in a private offering at the same price. As a result of these
        transactions, the Company’s ownership percentage in CNA declined from 91% to 89%
        and the Company recorded a pretax gain of $9.0 million including purchase
        accounting adjustments ($5.9 million after provision for deferred income
        taxes).

In
          November of 2005, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, Boardwalk Pipeline,
          completed an initial public offering of 15,000,000 common limited partnership
          units at a price of $19.50 per common unit, representing a 14.5% limited
          partnership interest. In connection with the closing of this offering,
          the
          Company contributed, through a wholly owned subsidiary, its ownership interest
          in Boardwalk Pipelines, LLC, together with certain of its liabilities to
          Boardwalk Pipeline and received 53,256,122 common and 33,093,878 subordinated
          units representing an aggregate 83.5% limited partner interest. In addition,
          the
          Company’s subsidiary received a 2% general partnership interest and incentive
          distribution rights, which entitles the Company to an increasing percentage
          of
          the cash that is

distributed
          in excess of $0.4025 per unit per quarter. Boardwalk Pipeline used the
          net
          proceeds of approximately


Notes
        to

Note
        14. Significant Transactions - (Continued)

$271.4
        million to fund the repayment of its intercompany debt ($250.0 million) relating
        to the acquisition of Gulf South and to provide additional working
        capital.

In
        the
        fourth quarter of 2006, Boardwalk Pipeline sold an additional 6,900,000 common
        units, respectively, at a price of $29.65 per unit in a public offering and
        received net proceeds of $195.2 million. In addition, the Company contributed
        $4.2 million to maintain its 2.0% general partner interest.

The
        subordinated units have secondary distribution rights during the subordination
        period and will convert to common units at the earliest date subsequent to
        which
        Boardwalk Pipeline has paid a $0.35 minimum quarterly distribution for twelve
        consecutive quarters, or minimum quarterly distributions in the amount of
        $0.525
        per unit for four consecutive quarters.

The
        issuance prices of the common units exceeded the Company’s carrying amount,
        resulting in cumulative pretax gains of approximately $234.6 million and
        $133.1
        million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In accordance with SEC
        Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 51, “Accounting for Sales of Stock by a
        Subsidiary,” recognition of a gain is only appropriate if the class of
        securities sold by the subsidiary does not contain any preference over the
        subsidiary’s other classes of securities. As a result, the Company will defer
        gain recognition until the subordinated units are converted into common
        units.

Acquisition
        of Gulf South

The
        Company, through its subsidiary Boardwalk Pipelines, LLC acquired Gulf South
        Pipeline, LP (“Gulf South”) from Entergy-Koch, LP, a venture between Entergy
        Corporation and Koch Energy, Inc., a subsidiary of privately-owned Koch
        Industries, Inc., in December of 2004. The Company funded the $1.14 billion
        purchase price, including transaction costs and closing adjustments, with
        $575.0
        million of proceeds from an interim loan and the remaining approximately
        $561.0
        million from its available cash. In January of 2005, Boardwalk Pipelines,
        LLC
        and Gulf South issued long-term debt and used the proceeds to repay the $575.0
        million interim loan.

Gulf
        South owns and operates a 7,500-mile interstate natural gas pipeline and
        storage
        system located in the states of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and
        Florida. The Gulf South pipeline system is comprised of the interstate
        transmission pipeline and 83.0 billion cubic feet (“Bcf”) of working gas storage
        capacity.

The
        allocation of purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired was as

Sale
        of Oil Tankers

Hellespont
        Shipping Corporation (“Hellespont”), in which the Company, through Majestic
        Shipping Corporation (“Majestic”), a wholly owned subsidiary, has a 49% common
        stock interest, sold all of its ultra-large crude oil tankers in July of
        2004.
        Majestic received cash distributions from Hellespont and recognized income
        of
        $179.3 million ($116.5 million after taxes) for the year ended December 31,
        2004.

Specialty
        Medical Business

On
        January 6, 2005, CNA completed the sale of its specialty medical business
        to
        Aetna Inc. As a result of the sale, CNA recorded a realized gain of
        approximately $8.2 million after-tax and minority interest in 2005. The revenues
        of the business sold were $17.0 million and $166.0 million for the years
        ended
        December 31, 2005 and 2004. Net income related to this business was $16.4
        million and $14.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and
        2004.

Individual
        Life Sale

On
        April
        30, 2004, CNA completed the sale of its individual life insurance business
        to
        Swiss Re. The business sold included term, universal and permanent life
        insurance policies and individual annuity products. CNA’s individual long term
        care and structured settlement businesses were excluded from the sale. Swiss
        Re
        acquired VFL and CNA’s Nashville, Tennessee insurance servicing and
        administration building as part of the sale. In connection with the sale,
        CNA
        entered into a reinsurance agreement in which CAC ceded its individual life
        insurance business to Swiss Re on a 100% indemnity reinsurance basis. Subject
        to
        certain exceptions, Swiss Re assumed the credit risk of the business that
        was
        previously reinsured to other carriers. As a result of this reinsurance
        agreement with Swiss Re, approximately $1.0 billion of future policy benefit
        reserves were ceded to Swiss Re. CNA received consideration of approximately
        $700.0 million and recorded a realized investment loss of $622.0 million
        pretax
        ($352.9 million after-tax and minority interest).

The
        revenues of the individual life business through the sale date were $151.0
        million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The net results for this business
        through the sale date were a net loss of $5.5 million for the year ended
        December 31, 2004.

        Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
        15.  Restructuring and Other Related Charges

In
        2001,
        CNA finalized and approved two separate restructuring plans. The first plan
        related to CNA’s Information Technology operations. The initial restructuring
        and other related charges amounted to $62.0 million in 2001. The remaining
        accrual related to this restructuring charge of $3.0 million was released
        in
        2004.

The
        second plan related to restructuring the property and casualty segments and
        Life
        and Group Non-Core segment, discontinuation of the variable life and annuity
        business and consolidation of real estate locations. During the second quarter
        of 2006, CNA management reevaluated the sufficiency of the remaining accrual,
        which related to lease termination costs, and determined that the liability
        is
        no longer required as CNA has completed its lease obligations. As a result,
        the
        excess remaining accrual was released in 2006, resulting in pretax income
        of
        $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. During 2005 and 2004,
        approximately $1.0 million and $5.0 million of costs were paid. The initial
        restructuring and other related charges amounted to $189.0 million in
        2001.

Note
        16.  Statutory Accounting Practices (Unaudited)

CNA’s
        domestic insurance subsidiaries maintain their accounts in conformity with
        accounting practices prescribed or permitted by insurance regulatory
        authorities, which vary in certain respects from GAAP. In converting from
        statutory accounting principles to GAAP, typical adjustments include deferral
        of
        policy acquisition costs and the inclusion of net unrealized holding gains
        or
        losses in shareholders’ equity relating to certain fixed maturity securities.
        The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) has codified
        statutory accounting principles to foster more consistency among the states
        for
        accounting guidelines and reporting.

CNA’s
        insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in various jurisdictions. These
        subsidiaries prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with
        accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the respective jurisdictions’
insurance regulators. Prescribed statutory accounting practices are set forth
        in
        a variety of publications of the NAIC as well as state laws, regulations
        and
        general administrative rules.

CCC
        follows a permitted practice related to the statutory provision for reinsurance,
        or the uncollectible reinsurance reserve. This permitted practice allows
        CCC to
        record an additional uncollectible reinsurance reserve amount through a
        different financial statement line item than the prescribed statutory
        convention. This permitted practice had no effect on CCC’s statutory surplus in
        2006 or 2005.

CNA’s
        ability to pay dividends and other credit obligations is significantly dependent
        on receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries. The payment of dividends to
        CNA
        by its insurance subsidiaries without prior approval of the insurance department
        of each subsidiary’s domiciliary jurisdiction is limited by formula. Dividends
        in excess of these amounts are subject to prior approval by the respective
        state
        insurance departments.

Dividends
        from CCC are subject to the insurance holding company laws of the State of
        Illinois, the domiciliary state of CCC. Under these laws, ordinary dividends,
        or
        dividends that do not require prior approval of the Illinois Department of
        Financial and Professional Regulation - Division of Insurance (the
“Department”), may be paid only from earned surplus, which is calculated by
        removing unrealized gains from unassigned surplus. As of December 31, 2006,
        CCC
        is in a positive earned surplus position, enabling CCC to pay approximately
        $556.0 million of dividend payments during 2007 that would not be subject
        to the
        Department’s prior approval. The actual level of dividends paid in any year is
        determined after an assessment of available dividend capacity, holding company
        liquidity and cash needs as well as the impact the dividends will have on
        the
        statutory surplus of the applicable insurance company.

CNA’s
        domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk-based capital requirements.
        Risk-based capital is a method developed by the NAIC to determine the minimum
        amount of statutory capital appropriate for an insurance company to support
        its
        overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile.
        The
        formula for determining the amount of risk-based capital specifies various
        factors, weighted based on the perceived degree of risk, which are applied
        to
        certain financial balances and financial activity. The adequacy of a company’s
        actual capital is evaluated by a comparison to the risk-based capital results,
        as determined by the formula. Companies below minimum risk-based capital
        requirements are classified within

certain

levels,
        each of which requires

        subsidiaries exceeded the minimum risk-based capital requirements.

Combined
        statutory capital and surplus and net income, determined in accordance with
        accounting practices prescribed or permitted by insurance regulatory

Note
        17.  Benefit Plans

Pension
        Plans - The Company has several non-contributory defined benefit plans for
        eligible employees. The benefits for certain plans which cover salaried
        employees and certain union employees are based on formulas which include,
        among
        others, years of service and average pay. The benefits for one plan which
        covers
        union workers under various union contracts and certain salaried employees
        are
        based on years of service multiplied by a stated amount. Benefits for another
        plan are determined annually based on a specified percentage of annual earnings
        (based on the participant’s age) and a specified interest rate (which is
        established annually for all participants) applied to accrued balances. The
        Company’s funding policy is to make contributions in accordance with applicable
        governmental regulatory requirements.

Other
        Postretirement Benefit Plans - The Company has several postretirement benefit
        plans covering eligible employees and retirees. Participants generally become
        eligible after reaching age 55 with required years of service. Actual
        requirements for coverage vary by plan. Benefits for retirees who were covered
        by bargaining units vary by each unit and contract. Benefits for certain
        retirees are in the form of a Company health care account.

Benefits
        for retirees reaching age 65 are generally integrated with Medicare. Other
        retirees, based on plan provisions, must use Medicare as their primary coverage,
        with the Company reimbursing a portion of the unpaid amount; or are reimbursed
        for the Medicare Part B premium or have no Company coverage. The benefits
        provided by the Company are basically health and, for certain retirees, life
        insurance type benefits.

The
        Company funds certain of these benefit plans and accrues postretirement benefits
        during the active service of those employees who would become eligible for
        such
        benefits when they retire.

The
        Company uses December 31 as the measurement date for the majority of its
        plans.

        capital market principles, long-term return analysis for global fixed income
        and
        equity markets as well as the active total return oriented portfolio management
        style. Long-term trends are evaluated relative to market factors such as
        inflation, interest rates and fiscal and monetary policies, in order to assess
        the capital market assumptions as applied to the plan. Consideration of
        diversification needs and rebalancing is maintained.

The
        Company employs a total return approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed
        income investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets
        for
        a prudent level of risk. The intent of this strategy is to minimize plan
        expenses by outperforming plan liabilities over the long run. Risk tolerance
        is
        established through careful consideration of the plan liabilities, plan funded
        status and corporate financial conditions. The investment portfolio contains
        a
        diversified blend of U.S. and non-U.S. fixed income and equity investments.
        Alternative investments, including hedge funds, are used judiciously to enhance
        risk adjusted long-term returns while improving portfolio diversification.
        Derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient and timely
        manner. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through
        annual liability measurements, periodic asset/liability studies and quarterly
        investment portfolio reviews.

In
        2007,
        it is expected that contributions of $64.2 million will be made to pension
        plans
        and $27.3 million to postretirement healthcare and life insurance benefit
        plans.

Savings
        Plans - The Company and its subsidiaries have several contributory savings
        plans
        which allow employees to make regular contributions based upon a percentage
        of
        their salaries. Matching contributions are made up to specified percentages
        of
        employees’ contributions. The contributions by the Company and its subsidiaries
        to these plans amounted to $72.9 million, $40.1 million and $64.4 million
        for
        the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Stock
        Option Plans - In 2005, shareholders approved the amended and restated Loews
        Corporation 2000 Stock Option Plan (the “Loews Plan”). The aggregate number of
        shares of Loews common stock for which options or stock appreciation rights
        (“SARs”) may be granted under the Loews Plan is 12,000,000 shares, and the
        maximum number of shares of Loews common stock with respect to which options
        or
        SARs may be granted to any individual

in

any
        calendar year

is
        1,200,000 shares. The exercise price per share may

common
        stock on the date of grant. Generally, options and SARs vest ratably over
        a
        four-year period and expire in ten years.

A
        summary
        of the stock option and SAR transactions for the Loews Plan
        follows:

The
          following table summarizes information about the Company’s stock options and
          SARs outstanding in connection with the Loews Plan at December 31,
          2006:

In

2006,
        the
        Company awarded SARs totaling 933,300 shares. In accordance with the Loews
        Plan,
        the Company has the ability to settle SARs in shares or cash and has the
        intention to settle in shares. The SARs balance at December 31, 2006 was
        922,800
        shares with 10,500 shares forfeited during 2006.

The
        weighted average remaining contractual terms of awards outstanding and
        exercisable as of December 31, 2006, were 7.0 years and 5.8 years. The aggregate
        intrinsic values of awards outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2006
        were
        $75.4 million and $46.8 million. The total intrinsic value of awards exercised
        during 2006 was $10.5 million.

The
        Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $4.9 million related
        to the
        Loews Plan for the year ended December 31, 2006. The related income tax benefits
        recognized were $1.7 million. At December 31, 2006, the compensation cost
        related to nonvested awards not yet recognized was $11.6 million, and the
        weighted average period over which it is expected to be recognized is 1.6
        years.

Note
        18.  Reinsurance

CNA
        cedes
        insurance to reinsurers to limit its maximum loss, provide greater
        diversification of risk, minimize exposures on larger risks and to exit certain
        lines of business. The ceding of insurance does not discharge the primary
        liability of CNA. Therefore, a credit exposure exists with respect to property
        and casualty and life reinsurance ceded to the extent that any reinsurer
        is
        unable to meet its obligations or to the extent that the reinsurer disputes
        the
        liabilities assumed under reinsurance agreements. Property and casualty
        reinsurance coverages are tailored to the specific risk characteristics of
        each
        product line and CNA’s retained amount varies by type of coverage. Reinsurance
        contracts are purchased to protect specific lines of business such as property,
        workers’ compensation and professional liability. Corporate catastrophe
        reinsurance is also purchased for property and workers’ compensation exposure.
        Most reinsurance contracts are purchased on an excess of loss basis. CNA
        also
        utilizes facultative reinsurance in certain lines. In addition, CNA assumes
        reinsurance as a member of various reinsurance pools and
        associations.

The
        following table summarizes the amounts receivable from reinsurers at December
        31, 2006 and 2005.

Ceded
        claim and claim adjustment expense related reinsurance receivables were reduced
        by $1,162.0 million and $2,007.0 million in 2006 and 2005 due to the impact
        of
        commutations. The funds withheld liability, which is included in Reinsurance
        balances payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets had a corresponding
        reduction of $942.0 million and $1,126.0 million in 2006 and 2005. See further
        discussion related to commutations below.

The
        net
        decrease in the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance was primarily due
        to a
        release of a previously established allowance due to the execution of a
        significant commutation agreement, as discussed further below. The provision
        for
        uncollectible reinsurance was $23.0 million, $35.0 million and $95.0 million
        in
        2006, 2005 and 2004.


Notes
        to
        Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
        18. Reinsurance - (Continued)

CNA
        attempts to mitigate its credit risk related to reinsurance by entering into
        reinsurance arrangements with reinsurers that have credit ratings above certain
        levels and by obtaining collateral. The primary methods of obtaining collateral
        are through reinsurance trusts, letters of credit and funds withheld balances.
        Such collateral was approximately $2.6 billion and $4.3 billion at December
        31,
        2006 and 2005. On a more limited basis, CNA may enter into reinsurance
        agreements with reinsurers that are not rated.

In
        2001,
        CNA entered into a one-year corporate aggregate reinsurance treaty related
        to
        the 2001 accident year covering substantially all property and casualty lines
        of
        business in the Continental Casualty Company pool (the “CCC Cover”). The CCC
        Cover was fully utilized in 2003 and interest charges accrued on the related
        funds held balance at 8.0% per annum. In 2006, CNA commuted the CCC Cover.
        This
        commutation had no impact on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the
        year
        ended December 31, 2006.

Also,
        in
        2006, CNA commuted several reinsurance treaties, including several finite
        treaties, with a European reinsurance group. This commutation resulted in
        a
        pretax loss, net of allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, of $48.0 million.
        CNA received $35.0 million of cash in connection with this significant
        commutation.

In
        2005,
        CNA entered into several significant commutation agreements, including the
        commutation of the Aggregate Cover, which was a corporate aggregate reinsurance
        treaty related to the 1999 through 2001 accident years and covered substantially
        all of CNA’s property and casualty lines of business. These commutations
        resulted in an unfavorable pretax impact of $399.0 million and CNA received
        $446.0 million of cash in connection with these significant commutations.

In
        2004,
        CNA executed commutation agreements with several members of The Trenwick
        Group.
        These commutations resulted in unfavorable claim and claim adjustment expense
        reserve development which was more than offset by a release of previously
        established allowance of uncollectible reinsurance. These commutations resulted
        in a pretax favorable impact of $28.0 million and CNA received $69.0 million
        of
        cash.

CNA’s
        largest recoverables from a single reinsurer at December 31, 2006, including
        prepaid reinsurance premiums, were approximately $1,574.0 million from
        subsidiaries of Swiss Reinsurance Group, $1,013.0 million from subsidiaries
        of
        The Hartford Life Group Insurance Company, $911.0 million from subsidiaries
        of
        Muenchener Rueckversicherungs, $574.0 million from The Allstate Corporation
        (“Allstate”), and $535.0 million from syndicates of Equitas.

Prior
        to
        the April 2004 sale of its individual life and annuity business to Swiss
        Re, CNA
        had reinsured a portion of this business through coinsurance, yearly renewable
        term and facultative programs to various reinsurers. As a result of the sale
        of
        the individual life and annuity business, 100% of the net reserves were
        reinsured to Swiss Re. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, CNA ceded $891.0
        million and $968.0 million of future policy benefits to Swiss Re. Subject
        to
        certain exceptions, Swiss Re assumed the credit risk of the business that
        was
        previously reinsured to other carriers. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005,
        the
        assumed credit risk was $28.0 million.

On
        December 31, 2003, the Company completed the sale of the majority of its
        Group
        Benefits business to The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (“The
        Hartford”). In connection with the sale, CNA ceded insurance reserves to The
        Hartford. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, ceded claim and claim adjustment
        expense reserves, ceded policyholder benefits and ceded policyholder funds
        were
        $1,029.0 million and $1,347.0 million. Subject to certain exceptions, The
        Hartford assumed 50.0% of the credit risk of the business that was previously
        reinsured to other carriers. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the assumed
        credit risk was $21.0 million and $26.0 million.

Insurance
        claims and policyholders’ benefits reported in the Consolidated Statements of
        Income are net of reinsurance recoveries of $1,314.0 million, $1,459.0 million
        and $4,626.0 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004.

        and
        accident and health premiums are primarily from long duration contracts;
        property and casualty premiums are primarily from short duration
        contracts.

Reinsurance
        accounting allows for contractual cash flows to be reflected as premiums
        and
        losses, as compared to deposit accounting, which requires cash flows to be
        reflected as assets and liabilities. To qualify for reinsurance accounting,
        reinsurance agreements must include risk transfer. To meet risk transfer
        requirements, a reinsurance contract must include both insurance risk,
        consisting of underwriting and timing risk, and a reasonable possibility
        of a
        significant loss for the assuming entity. Reinsurance contracts that include
        both significant risk sharing provisions, such as adjustments to premiums
        or
        loss coverage based on loss experience, and relatively low policy limits
        as
        evidenced by a high proportion of maximum premium assessments to loss limits,
        may require considerable judgment to determine whether or not risk transfer
        requirements are met. For such contracts, often referred to as finite products,
        CNA assesses risk transfer for each contract generally by developing
        quantitative analyses at contract inception which measure the present value
        of
        reinsurer losses as compared to the present value of the related premium.
        In
        2003, CNA discontinued purchases of finite contracts.

Note
        18. Reinsurance - (Continued)

Funds
        Withheld Reinsurance Arrangements

CNA’s
        overall reinsurance program has included certain property and casualty
        contracts, such as the commuted CCC and Aggregate Covers that were entered
        into
        and accounted for on a “funds withheld” basis and which are deemed to be finite
        reinsurance. Under the funds withheld basis, CNA recorded the cash remitted
        to
        the reinsurer for the reinsurer’s margin, or cost of the reinsurance contract,
        as ceded premiums. The remainder of the premiums ceded under the reinsurance
        contract not remitted in cash was recorded as funds withheld liabilities.
        CNA
        was required to increase the funds withheld balance at stated interest crediting
        rates applied to the funds withheld balance or as otherwise specified under
        the
        terms of the contract. The funds withheld liability was reduced by any
        cumulative claim payments made by CNA in excess of CNA’s retention under the
        reinsurance contract. If the funds withheld liability was exhausted, interest
        crediting would cease and additional claim payments would be recoverable
        from
        the reinsurer. The funds withheld liability is recorded in Reinsurance balances
        payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Interest
        cost on reinsurance contracts accounted for on a funds withheld basis is
        incurred during all periods in which a funds withheld liability exists
        and is included in net investment income. There were no amounts subject to
        such interest crediting at December 31, 2006. The amount subject to interest
        crediting rates was $1,050.0 million at December 31, 2005.

As
        of
        December 31, 2006 and 2005, there were one and thirteen ceded reinsurance
        treaties inforce respectively that CNA considers to be finite reinsurance.
        The
        remaining treaty at December 31, 2006 provides reinsurance protection for
        the
        1999 accident year on specified portions of CNA’s domestic property and casualty
        business. The remaining treaty is fully utilized and had no related funds
        withheld liability at December 31, 2006. In 2003, CNA discontinued purchases
        of
        such contracts. The following table summarizes the pretax impact of contracts
        accounted for on a funds withheld basis, including the commuted Aggregate
        and
        CCC Covers discussed above.

above.
        This unfavorable development was partially offset by the release of previously
        established allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, resulting in an unfavorable
        impact of $48.0 million.

Included
        in “All Other” above for the year ended December 31, 2005 is approximately $24.0
        million of pretax expense related to Standard Lines which resulted from an
        unfavorable arbitration ruling on two reinsurance treaties impacting ceded
        earned premiums, ceded claim and claim adjustment expenses, ceding commissions
        and interest charges. This unfavorable outcome was partially offset by a
        release
        of previously established reinsurance bad debt reserves resulting in a net
        impact from the arbitration ruling of $10.0 million pretax expense for the
        year
        ended December 31, 2005.

The

INSURANCE
        RELATED

California
        Long Term Care Litigation

Shaffer
        v. Continental Casualty Company, et al

.,
        U.S.
        District Court, Central District of California, CV06-2235 RGK, is a class
        action
        on behalf of certain California long-term health care policyholders, alleging
        that CCC knowingly used unrealistic actuarial assumptions in pricing these
        policies, which according to plaintiff, would inevitably necessitate premium
        increases. The plaintiff asserts claims for intentional fraud, negligent
        misrepresentation, and violations of various California statutes. On January
        26,
        2007, the court certified the case to proceed as a class action, although
        CCC is
        currently seeking review of that decision in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
        CCC has denied the material allegations of the amended complaint and intends
        to
        vigorously contest the claims. Numerous unresolved factual and legal issues
        remain that are critical to the final result, the outcome of which cannot
        be
        predicted with any reliability. Accordingly, the extent of losses are not
        readily determinable at this time. However, based on facts and circumstances
        presently known in the opinion of management, an unfavorable outcome would
        not
        materially adversely affect the equity of the Company, although the results
        of
        operations may be adversely affected.

Insurance
        Brokerage Antitrust Litigation

On
        August
        1, 2005, CNA and several of its insurance subsidiaries were joined as
        defendants, along with other insurers and brokers, in multidistrict litigation
        pending in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey,

In
        re
        Insurance Brokerage Antitrust Litigation,

Civil
        No.
        04-5184 (FSH

)

.
        The
        plaintiffs in this litigation allege improprieties in the payment of contingent
        commissions to brokers and bid rigging in connection with the sale of various
        lines of insurance. The plaintiffs further allege the existence of a conspiracy
        and assert claims for federal and state antitrust law violations, for violations
        of the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and for
        recovery under various state common law theories. By an order entered on
        October
        3, 2006, the Court required the plaintiffs to supplement their pleadings
        with a
        statement setting forth the details of their claims. CNA believes it has
        meritorious defenses to this action and intends to defend the case
        vigorously.

The
        extent of losses beyond any amounts that may be accrued are not readily
        determinable at this time. However, based on facts and circumstances presently
        known, in the opinion of management, an unfavorable outcome will not materially
        affect the equity of the Company, although results of operations may be
        adversely affected.

Global
        Crossing Limited Litigation

CCC
        has
        been named as a defendant in an action brought by the bankruptcy estate of
        Global Crossing Limited (“Global Crossing”) in the United States Bankruptcy
        Court for the Southern District of New York. In the Complaint, served on
        CCC on
        May 24, 2005, plaintiff seeks unspecified monetary damages from CCC and the
        other defendants for alleged fraudulent transfers and alleged breaches of
        fiduciary duties arising from actions taken by Global Crossing while CCC
        was a
        shareholder of Global Crossing. On August 3, 2006, the Court granted in part
        and
        denied in part CCC’s motion to dismiss the Estate Representative’s Amended
        Complaint. CCC believes it has meritorious defenses to the remaining claims
        in
        this action and intends to defend the case vigorously.

The
        extent of losses beyond any amounts that may be accrued are not readily
        determinable at this time. However, based on facts and circumstances presently
        known, in the opinion of management, an unfavorable outcome will not materially
        affect the equity of the Company, although results of operations may be
        adversely affected.

IGI
        Contingency

In
        1997,
        CNA Reinsurance Company Limited (“CNA Re Ltd”.) entered into an arrangement with
        IOA Global, Ltd. (“IOA”), an independent managing general agent based in
        Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to develop and manage a book of accident and
        health
        coverages. Pursuant to this arrangement, IGI Underwriting Agencies, Ltd.
        (“IGI”), a personal accident reinsurance managing general underwriter, was
        appointed to underwrite and market the book under the supervision of IOA.
        Between April 1, 1997 and December 1, 1999, IGI underwrote a number of
        reinsurance arrangements with respect to personal accident insurance worldwide
        (the “IGI Program”). Under various arrangements, CNA Re Ltd. both assumed risks
        as a reinsurer and also ceded a substantial portion of those risks to other
        companies, including other CNA insurance subsidiaries and ultimately to a
        group
        of reinsurers participating in a reinsurance pool known as the Associated
        Accident and Health Reinsurance Underwriters (“AAHRU”) Facility. CNA's group
        operations business unit participated as a pool member in the AAHRU Facility
        in
        varying percentages between 1997 and 1999.

A
        portion
        of the premiums assumed under the IGI Program related to United States workers’
compensation “carve-out” business. Some of these premiums were received from
        John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company (“John Hancock”) under four excess of
        loss reinsurance treaties (the “Treaties”) issued by CNA Re Ltd. While John
        Hancock has indicated that it is not able to accurately quantify its potential
        exposure to its cedents on business which is retroceded to CNA, John Hancock
        has
        reported $280.0 million of paid and unpaid losses under these Treaties. John
        Hancock is disputing portions of its assumed obligations resulting in these
        reported losses, and has advised CNA that it is, or has been, involved in
        multiple arbitrations with its own cedents, in which proceedings John Hancock
        is
        seeking to avoid and/or reduce risks that would otherwise arguably be ceded
        to
        CNA through the Treaties. John Hancock has further informed CNA that it has
        settled several of these disputes, but has not provided CNA with details
        of the
        settlements. To the extent that John Hancock is successful in reducing its
        liabilities in these disputes, that development may have an impact on the
        recoveries it is seeking under the Treaties from CNA.

As
        indicated, CNA arranged substantial reinsurance protection to manage its
        exposures under the IGI Program, including the United States workers’
compensation “carve-out” business ceded from John Hancock and other reinsurers.
        While certain reinsurers of CNA, including participants in the AAHRU Facility,
        disputed their liabilities under the reinsurance contracts with respect to
        the
        IGI Program, those disputes have been resolved and substantial reinsurance
        coverage exists for those exposures.

CNA
        has
        instituted arbitration proceedings against John Hancock in which CNA is seeking
        rescission of the Treaties as well as access to and the right to inspect
        the
        books and records relating to the Treaties. Discovery is ongoing in that
        arbitration proceeding and a hearing is currently scheduled for April of
        2007.
        Based on information known at this time, CNA believes it has strong grounds
        to
        successfully challenge its alleged exposure derived from John Hancock through
        the ongoing arbitration proceedings. CNA has also undertaken legal action
        seeking to avoid portions of the remaining exposure arising out of the IGI
        Program.

CNA
        has
        established reserves for its estimated exposure under the IGI Program, other
        than that derived from John Hancock, and an estimate for recoverables from
        retrocessionaires. CNA has not established any reserve for any

        to
        Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
        20. Legal Proceedings - (Continued)

exposure
        derived from John Hancock because, as indicated, CNA believes the contract
        will
        be rescinded. Although the results of CNA’s various loss mitigation strategies
        with respect to the entire IGI Program to date support the recorded reserves,
        the estimate of ultimate losses is subject to considerable uncertainty due
        to
        the complexities described above, and CNA’s inability to guarantee any outcome
        in the arbitration proceedings. As a result of these uncertainties, the results
        of operations in future periods may be adversely affected by potentially
        significant reserve additions. However, the extent of losses beyond any amounts
        that may be accrued are not readily determinable at this time. Management
        does
        not believe that any such reserve additions would be material to the equity
        of
        the Company. CNA’s position in relation to the IGI Program was unaffected by the
        sale of CNA Re Ltd. in 2002.

New
        Jersey Wage and Hour Litigation

W.
        Curtis Himmelman, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated
        v.
        Continental Casualty Company

,
        Civil
        Action: 06-166, District Court of New Jersey (Trenton Division) is a purported
        class action and representative action brought on behalf of present and former
        CNA environmental claims analysts and workers’ compensation claims analysts
        asserting they worked hours for which they should have been compensated at
        a
        rate of one and one-half times their base hourly wage. The Complaint was
        filed
        on January 12, 2006. The claims were originally brought under both federal
        and
        New Jersey state wage and hour laws on the basis that the relevant jobs are
        not
        exempt from overtime pay because the duties performed are not exempt duties.
        On
        August 11, 2006, the Court dismissed plaintiff’s New Jersey state law claims.
        Under federal law, plaintiff seeks to represent others similarly situated
        who
        opt in to the action and who also allege they are owed overtime pay for hours
        worked over eight hours per day and/or forty hours per workweek for the period
        January 5, 2003 to the entry of judgment. Plaintiff seeks “overtime
        compensation,” “compensatory, punitive and statutory damages, interest, costs
        and disbursements and attorneys’ fees” without specifying any particular amounts
        (as well as an injunction). CNA denies the material allegations of the Complaint
        and intends to vigorously contest the claims on numerous substantive and
        procedural grounds.

The
        extent of losses beyond any amounts that may be accrued are not readily
        determinable at this time. However, based on facts and circumstances presently
        known, in the opinion of management, an unfavorable outcome will not materially
        affect the equity of the Company, although results of operations may be
        adversely affected.

APMT
        Reserves

CNA
        is
        also a party

to
        litigation and claims related to APMT cases arising in the ordinary course
        of
        business. See Note 9 for further discussion.

TOBACCO
        RELATED

Tobacco
        Related Product Liability Litigation

Approximately
        3,960 product liability cases are pending against cigarette manufacturers
        in the
        United States. Lorillard is a defendant in approximately 2,840 of these
        cases.

The
        pending product liability cases are composed of the following types of
        cases:

“Conventional
        product liability cases” are brought by individuals who allege cancer or other
        health effects caused by smoking cigarettes, by using smokeless tobacco
        products, by addiction to tobacco, or by exposure to environmental tobacco
        smoke. Approximately 1,285 cases are pending, including approximately 200
        cases
        against Lorillard. The 1,285 cases include approximately 1,000 cases pending
        in
        a single West Virginia court that have been consolidated for trial. Lorillard
        is
        a defendant in approximately 75 of the approximately 1,000 consolidated West
        Virginia cases.

“Flight
        Attendant cases” are brought by non-smoking flight attendants alleging injury
        from exposure to environmental smoke in the cabins of aircraft. Plaintiffs
        in
        these cases may not seek punitive damages for injuries that arose prior to
        January 15, 1997. Lorillard is a defendant in each of the approximately 2,625
        pending Flight Attendant cases.


Notes
        to
        Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
        20. Legal Proceedings - (Continued)

“Class
        action cases” are purported to be brought on behalf of large numbers of
        individuals for damages allegedly caused by smoking.

Ten

of these
        cases are pending against Lorillard. In one of these cases,

Schwab v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., et al.

,
        the
        court has certified a nationwide class composed of purchasers of “light”
cigarettes. Lorillard is not a defendant in approximately 35 additional “lights”
class actions that are pending against other cigarette
        manufacturers.

“Reimbursement
        cases” are brought by or on behalf of entities who seek reimbursement of
        expenses incurred in providing health care to individuals who allegedly were
        injured by smoking. Plaintiffs in these cases have included the U.S. federal
        government, U.S. state and local governments, foreign governmental entities,
        hospitals or hospital districts, American Indian tribes, labor unions, private
        companies and private citizens. Lorillard is a defendant in four of the six
        Reimbursement cases pending against cigarette manufacturers in the United
        States. Lorillard and the Company are defendants in an additional case pending
        in Israel.

Included
        in this category is the suit filed by the federal government,

United States of America v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., et al.

,
        that
        sought disgorgement of profits and injunctive relief. During 2005, an appellate
        court ruled that the government may not seek disgorgement of profits. During
        August of 2006, the trial court issued its verdict and granted injunctive
        relief. The verdict did not award monetary damages. See Reimbursement Cases
        below.

Excluding
        the flight attendant and the consolidated West Virginia suits, approximately
        product liability cases are pending against cigarette manufacturers in U.S.
        courts. Lorillard is a defendant in approximately 140 of the 330 cases. The
        Company, which is not a defendant in any of the flight attendant or the
        consolidated West Virginia matters, is a defendant in four of the
        actions.

In
        addition to the above, “Filter cases” are brought by individuals, including
        former employees of Lorillard, who seek damages resulting from their alleged
        exposure to asbestos fibers that were incorporated into filter material used
        in
        one brand of cigarettes manufactured by Lorillard for a limited period of
        time
        ending more than 50 years ago. Lorillard is a defendant in approximately
        30 such
        cases.

Plaintiffs
        assert a broad range of legal theories in these cases, including, among others,
        theories of negligence, fraud, misrepresentation, strict liability, breach
        of
        warranty, enterprise liability (including claims asserted under the federal
        Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”)), civil
        conspiracy, intentional infliction of harm, violation of consumer protection
        statutes, violation of antitrust statutes, injunctive relief, indemnity,
        restitution, unjust enrichment, public nuisance, claims based on antitrust
        laws
        and state consumer protection acts, and claims based on failure to warn of
        the
        harmful or addictive nature of tobacco products.

Plaintiffs
        in most of the cases seek unspecified amounts of compensatory damages and
        punitive damages, although some seek damages ranging into the billions of
        dollars. Plaintiffs in some of the cases seek treble damages, statutory damages,
        disgorgement of profits, equitable and injunctive relief, and medical
        monitoring, among other damages.

CONVENTIONAL
        PRODUCT LIABILITY CASES - Approximately 1,285 cases are pending against
        cigarette manufacturers in the United States. Lorillard is a defendant in
        approximately 200 of these cases. The Company is a defendant in two of the
        pending cases.

Approximately
        1,000 of the 1,285 cases are pending in a single West Virginia court in a
        consolidated proceeding known as

West
        Virginia Individual Personal Injury Cases

or
“IPIC.” During the third quarter of 2006, the court dismissed Lorillard from
        approximately 800 IPIC cases because those plaintiffs had not submitted evidence
        that they had smoked a Lorillard product. These dismissals are not final
        and it
        is possible some or all of these 800 dismissals could be contested in subsequent
        appeals noticed by the plaintiffs. Following these dismissals, Lorillard
        is a
        defendant in approximately 75 of the 1,000 IPIC cases. The Company is not
        a
        defendant in any of the IPIC cases. The court has entered a trial plan to
        govern
        the cases, and the first phase of trial is scheduled to begin on March 17,
        2008.

Since
        January 1, 2005, verdicts have been returned in ten cases. Lorillard was
        not a
        defendant in any of these cases. Defense verdicts were returned in eight
        of the
        ten trials, while juries found in favor of the plaintiffs and awarded damages
        in
        the two other cases. The defendants are pursuing appeals in both of these
        cases.
        In rulings


Notes
        to
        Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
        20. Legal Proceedings - (Continued)

addressing
        cases tried in earlier years, some appellate courts have reversed verdicts
        returned in favor of the plaintiffs while other judgments that awarded damages
        to smokers have been affirmed on appeal. Manufacturers have exhausted their
        appeals in nine Individual cases in recent years and have been required to
        pay
        damages to plaintiffs. Punitive damages were paid to the smokers in three
        of the
        nine cases. Lorillard was not a party to these nine matters.

Some
        cases against U.S. cigarette manufacturers are scheduled for trial during
        and beyond. Lorillard is a defendant in some of the cases scheduled for trial
        in
        2007. The Company is not a defendant in any of the cases scheduled for trial
        in
        2007. The trial dates are subject to change.

FLIGHT
        ATTENDANT CASES - Approximately 2,625 Flight Attendant cases are pending.
        Lorillard and three other cigarette manufacturers are the defendants in each
        of
        these matters. The Company is not a defendant in any of these cases. These
        suits
        were filed as a result of a settlement agreement by the parties, including
        Lorillard, in

Broin v. Philip Morris Companies, Inc., et al.

(Circuit
        Court, Miami-Dade County, Florida, filed October 31, 1991), a class action
        brought on behalf of flight attendants claiming injury as a result of exposure
        to environmental tobacco smoke. The settlement agreement, among other things,
        permitted the plaintiff class members to file these individual suits. These
        individuals may not seek punitive damages for injuries that arose prior to
        January 15, 1997.

The
        judges that have presided over the cases that have been tried have relied
        upon
        an order entered during October of 2000 by the Circuit Court of Miami-Dade
        County, Florida. The October 2000 order has been construed by these judges
        as
        holding that the flight attendants are not required to prove the substantive
        liability elements of their claims for negligence, strict liability and breach
        of implied warranty in order to recover damages. The court further ruled
        that
        the trials of these suits are to address whether the plaintiffs’ alleged
        injuries were caused by their exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and,
        if
        so, the amount of damages to be awarded.

Lorillard
        has been a defendant in each of the seven flight attendant cases in which
        verdicts have been returned. Defendants have prevailed in six of the seven
        trials. In the single trial decided for the plaintiff, the jury awarded $5.5
        million in damages. The court, however, reduced this award to $500,000. This
        verdict, as reduced by the trial court, was affirmed on appeal and the
        defendants have paid the award. Lorillard’s share of the judgment in this
        matter, including interest, was approximately $60,000. In one of the six
        cases
        in which a defense verdict was returned, the court granted plaintiff’s motion
        for a new trial and, following appeal, the case has been returned to the
        trial
        court for a second trial that has not been scheduled. In another of the cases
        in
        which a defense verdict was returned, plaintiff has appealed.

None
        of
        the flight attendant cases are scheduled for trial. Trial dates are subject
        to
        change.

CLASS
        ACTION CASES - Lorillard is a defendant in

ten

pending
        cases. The Company is a defendant in two of these cases. In most of the pending
        cases, plaintiffs seek class certification on behalf of groups of cigarette
        smokers, or the estates of deceased cigarette smokers, who reside in the
        state
        in which the case was filed. One of the cases in which Lorillard is a
        defendant,

Schwab v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., et al.

,
        is a
        purported national class action on behalf of purchasers of “light” cigarettes in
        which plaintiffs’ claims are based on defendants’ alleged RICO violations.
        Neither Lorillard nor the Company are defendants in approximately 35 additional
        class action cases in which plaintiffs assert claims on behalf of smokers
        or
        purchasers of “light” cigarettes. These cases are discussed below.

Cigarette
        manufacturers, including Lorillard, have defeated motions for class
        certification in a total of 35 cases, 13 of which were in state court and
        22 of
        which were in federal court. Motions for class certification have also been
        ruled upon in some of the “lights” cases or in other class actions to which
        Lorillard was not a party. In some of these cases, courts have denied class
        certification to the plaintiffs, while classes have been certified in other
        matters.

The

Engle

Case - During 2006, the Florida Supreme Court issued rulings in the
        case of

Engle v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., et al.

(Circuit Court,
        Miami-Dade County, Florida, filed May 5, 1994), that affirmed the 2003 holding
        of an intermediate appellate court vacating the $145.0 billion punitive damages
        award, including approximately $16.3 billion against Lorillard. Prior to
        trial,

Engle

was certified as a class action on behalf of Florida residents,
        and survivors of Florida residents, who were injured or died from medical
        conditions allegedly caused by addiction to cigarettes, and the trial was
        governed by a three-phase trial plan. The Florida Supreme Court determined
        that
        the case could not proceed further as a class action and decertified the
        class.
        However, the Florida Supreme Court ruling


Notes
        to
        Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
        20. Legal Proceedings - (Continued)

permits
        members of the now-decertified class a period of one year to file individual
        claims, including claims for punitive damages. This one-year period expires
        during January of 2008. The Florida Supreme Court held that these individual
        plaintiffs are entitled to rely on some of the jury’s findings in favor of the
        plaintiffs in the first phase of the

Engle

trial on
        a number of issues, including, among other things, that smoking cigarettes
        causes a number of diseases; that cigarettes are addictive or
        dependence-producing; and that the defendants, including Lorillard, were
        negligent, breached express and implied warranties, placed cigarettes on
        the
        market that were defective and unreasonably dangerous, and concealed or
        conspired to conceal the risks of smoking. The 2006 decision by the Florida
        Supreme Court also reinstated the actual damages awarded during 2000 to two
        of
        the three individuals whose claims were heard during the second phase of
        trial.
        These awards totaled approximately $2.8 million to one smoker and $4.0 million
        to the second, and bear interest at the rate of 10.0% per year. Lorillard’s
        share of either of these verdicts, if any, has not been determined. The Florida
        Supreme Court has formally concluded its consideration of

Engle

,
        but the
        opportunity for either the plaintiffs or the defendants to seek review of
        the
        case by the U.S. Supreme Court has not expired. Plaintiffs have filed a
        motion in a Florida trial court seeking an order to publish notice, at
        defendants’ expense, to former class members regarding the one-year period for
        filing individual claims.

Florida
        enacted legislation that limits the amount of an appellate bond required
        to be
        posted in order to stay execution of a judgment for punitive damages in a
        certified class action. While Lorillard believes this legislation is valid
        and
        that any challenges to the possible application or constitutionality of this
        legislation would fail, Lorillard entered into an agreement with the plaintiffs
        during May of 2001 in which it contributed $200.0 million to a fund held
        for the
        benefit of the

Engle

plaintiffs (the “

Engle

Agreement”). The $200.0 million contribution included the $100.0 million that
        Lorillard posted as collateral for the appellate bond. Accordingly, Lorillard
        recorded a pretax charge of $200.0 million in the year ended December 31,
        2001.
        Two other defendants executed agreements with the plaintiffs that were similar
        to Lorillard’s. As a result, the class agreed to a stay of execution, with
        respect to Lorillard and the two other defendants on its punitive damages
        judgment until appellate review is completed, including any review by the
        U.S.
        Supreme Court.

The

Engle

Agreement provides that in the event that Lorillard, Inc.’s balance sheet net
        worth falls below $921.2 million (as determined in accordance with generally
        accepted accounting principles in effect as of July 14, 2000), the stay granted
        in favor of Lorillard in the

Engle

Agreement would terminate and the class would be free to challenge the Florida
        legislation. As of December 31, 2006, Lorillard, Inc. had a balance sheet
        net
        worth of approximately $1.3 billion. In addition, the

Engle

Agreement requires Lorillard to obtain the written consent of class counsel
        or
        the court prior to selling any trademark of or formula comprising a cigarette
        brand having a U.S. market share of 0.5% or more during the preceding calendar
        year. The

Engle

Agreement also requires Lorillard to obtain the written consent of the

Engle

class
        counsel or the court to license to a third party the right to manufacture
        or
        sell such a cigarette brand unless the cigarettes to be manufactured under
        the
        license will be sold by Lorillard.

The
        Scott case

-
        Another class action pending against Lorillard is

Scott v. The American Tobacco Company, et al.

(District Court, Orleans Parish, Louisiana, filed May 24, 1996). During 1997,
        the court certified a class composed of certain cigarette smokers resident
        in
        the State of Louisiana who desire to participate in medical monitoring or
        smoking cessation programs and who began smoking prior to September 1, 1988,
        or
        who began smoking prior to May 24, 1996 and allege that defendants undermined
        compliance with the warnings on cigarette packages.

Trial
        in

Scott

was
        heard in two phases. While the jury in its July 2003 Phase I verdict rejected
        medical monitoring, the primary relief requested by plaintiffs, it returned
        sufficient findings in favor of the class to proceed to a Phase II trial
        on
        plaintiffs’ request for a state-wide smoking cessation program.

During
        May of 2004, the jury returned its verdict in the trial’s second phase and
        awarded approximately $591.0 million to fund cessation programs for Louisiana
        smokers. The court’s final judgment, entered during June of 2004, reflects the
        jury’s award of damages and also awarded prejudgment interest. During February
        of 2007, the Louisiana Court of Appeal issued a ruling that, among other
        things,
        reduced the amount of the award by approximately $312.0 million; struck the
        award of prejudgment interest, which totaled approximately $440.0 million
        as of
        December 31, 2006; and ruled that the only class members who are eligible
        to
        participate in the smoking cessation program are

those
        who
        began smoking by September 1, 1988, and whose claims accrued by September
        1,
        1988. The Louisiana


Notes
        to
        Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
        20. Legal Proceedings - (Continued)

Court
        of
        Appeal has returned the case to the trial court, for further proceedings.
        Lorillard’s share of any judgment has not been determined. It is possible that
        the parties will seek further review of this decision.

The
        parties filed a stipulation in the trial court agreeing that an article of
        the
        Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure, and a Louisiana statute governing the
        amount
        of appellate bonds in civil cases involving a signatory to the Master Settlement
        Agreement, required that the amount of the bond for the appeal be set at
        $50.0
        million for all defendants collectively. The parties further agreed that
        the
        plaintiffs have full reservations of rights to contest in the trial court,
        at a
        later date, the sufficiency or amount of the bond on any grounds. The trial
        court entered an order setting the amount of the bond at $50.0 million for
        all
        defendants. Defendants collectively posted a surety bond in that amount,
        of
        which Lorillard secured 25%, or $12.5 million. While Lorillard believes the
        limitation on the appeal bond amount is valid as required by Louisiana law,
        and
        that any challenges to the amount of the bond would fail, in the event of
        a
        successful challenge the amount of the appeal bond could be set as high as
        150%
        of the judgment and judicial interest combined. If such an event occurred,
        Lorillard’s share of the appeal bond has not been determined.

Other
        class action cases

- Two
        additional cases are pending against Lorillard in which motions for class
        certification were granted. In one of them,

Brown
        v. The American Tobacco Company, Inc., et al.

(Superior Court, San Diego County, California, filed June 10, 1997), a
        California court granted defendants’ motion to decertify the class. The class
        decertification order has been affirmed on appeal, but the California Supreme
        Court has agreed to hear the case. The class originally certified in

Brown

was
        composed of residents of California who smoked at least one of defendants’
cigarettes between June 10, 1993 and April 23, 2001 and who were exposed
        to
        defendants’ marketing and advertising activities in California. In the second
        case,

Daniels
        v. Philip Morris, Incorporated, et al.

(Superior Court, San Diego County, California, filed August 2, 1998), the
        court
        granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment during 2002 and dismissed the
        case. Plaintiffs appealed, but the California Court of Appeal affirmed the
        dismissal during 2004. Plaintiffs are now pursuing an appeal to the California
        Supreme Court. Prior to granting defendants’ motion for summary judgment, the
        court had certified a class composed of California residents who, while minors,
        smoked at least one cigarette between April of 1994 and December 31, 1999
        and
        were exposed to defendants’ marketing and advertising activities in California.
        It is possible that either or both of these class certification rulings could
        be
        reinstated as a result of the pending appeals.

As
        discussed above, other cigarette manufacturers are defendants in approximately
        35 cases in which plaintiffs’ claims are based on the allegedly fraudulent
        marketing of “lights” or “ultra-lights” cigarettes. Among those “lights” class
        actions in which neither the Company nor Lorillard are defendants is the
        case
        of

Price v. Philip Morris USA

(Circuit
        Court, Madison County, Illinois, filed February 10, 2000). During March of
        2003,
        the court returned a verdict in favor of the class and awarded it $7.1 billion
        in actual damages. The court also awarded $3.0 billion in punitive damages
        to
        the State of Illinois, which was not a party to the suit, and awarded
        plaintiffs’ counsel approximately $1.8 billion in fees and costs. During
        December of 2005, the Illinois Supreme Court vacated the damages awards,
        decertified the class, and ordered that the case be dismissed. The U.S. Supreme
        Court declined to review the case, and the Illinois trial court dismissed

Price

in favor
        of Philip Morris during December of 2006. The court has not ruled on the
        motion
        plaintiffs filed during January of 2007 that seeks an order vacating the
        dismissal.

Price

is the
        only “lights” class action to have been tried, although classes have been
        certified in some of the other pending matters.

The
        Schwab case -

Lorillard is a defendant in one “lights” class action,

Schwab
        v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., et al.

(U.S.
        District Court, Eastern District, New York, filed May 11, 2004). The Company
        is
        not a party to this case. Plaintiffs in

Schwab

base
        their claims on defendants’ alleged violations of the RICO statute in the
        manufacture, marketing and sale of “lights” cigarettes. Plaintiffs have
        estimated damages to the class in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Any
        damages awarded to the plaintiffs based on defendants’ violation of the RICO
        statute would be trebled. During September of 2006, the court granted
        plaintiffs’ motion for class certification and certified a nationwide class
        action on behalf of purchasers of “light” cigarettes. The federal court of
        appeals has granted review of the class certification order, and it has ordered
        that no activity can proceed before the trial court until the appeal is
        concluded.

REIMBURSEMENT
        CASES - Although the cases settled by the State Settlement Agreements, as
        described below, are concluded, certain matters are pending against cigarette
        manufacturers. The pending cases include Reimbursement cases on file in U.S.
        courts, a Reimbursement case on file in Israel, and cases challenging the
        State
        Settlement Agreements. Lorillard is a defendant in four pending Reimbursement
        cases in the U.S. and has been

named
        as
        a party to the case in Israel. The Company also is a party to the case in
        Israel, but it is not a defendant in

        to
        Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
        20. Legal Proceedings - (Continued)

any
        of
        the Reimbursement cases in the U.S. The four cases pending against Lorillard
        are
        brought by a city government and a group of hospitals; a group of taxpayers;
        an
        Indian tribe; and the U.S. federal government.

U.S.
        Federal Government Action - During August of 2006, the U.S. District Court
        for
        the District of Columbia issued its final judgment and remedial order in
        the
        federal government’s reimbursement suit (

United
        States of America v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., et al.

,
        U.S.
        District Court, District of Columbia, filed September 22, 1999). The verdict
        concluded a bench trial that began in September of 2004. Lorillard, other
        cigarette manufacturers, two parent companies and two trade associations
        are
        defendants in this action. The Company is not a party to this case.

The
        court
        determined that the defendants, including Lorillard, violated certain provisions
        of the RICO statute, that there was a likelihood of present and future RICO
        violations, and that equitable relief was warranted. Plaintiff was not awarded
        monetary damages. The equitable relief included permanent injunctions that
        prohibit the defendants, including Lorillard: from engaging in any act of
        racketeering, as defined under RICO; from making any material false or deceptive
        statements concerning cigarettes; from making any express or implied statement
        about health on cigarette packaging or promotional materials (these prohibitions
        include a ban on using such descriptors as “low tar,” “light,” “ultra-light,”
“mild,” or “natural”); and from making any statements that “low tar,” “light,”
“ultra-light,” “mild,” or “natural” or low-nicotine cigarettes may result in a
        reduced risk of disease. The final judgment and remedial order also requires
        the
        defendants, including Lorillard, to make corrective statements on their
        websites, in certain media, in point-of-sale advertisements, and on cigarette
        package “onserts” concerning: the health effects of smoking; the addictiveness
        of smoking; that there are no significant health benefits to be gained by
        smoking “low tar,” “light,” “ultra-light,” “mild,” or “natural” cigarettes; that
        cigarette design has been manipulated to ensure optimum nicotine delivery
        to
        smokers; and that there are adverse effects from exposure to secondhand smoke.
        The text of these statements, which have not been determined, are subject
        to the
        court’s approval. The final judgment and remedial order also requires the
        defendants, including Lorillard, to maintain and to disclose documents on
        their
        internet websites and to continue to place documents in a document depository
        created in the case of

State
        of Minnesota v. Philip Morris Inc., et al.

The
        defendants, including Lorillard, were directed in the final judgment and
        remedial order to disclose “disaggregated” marketing data. If the final judgment
        and remedial order are not modified or vacated on appeal, the costs to Lorillard
        for compliance could exceed $10.0 million. Defendants have noticed an appeal
        from the final judgment and remedial order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for
        the
        District of Columbia Circuit. Defendants have received a stay of the judgment
        and remedial order from the District of Columbia Court of Appeal that will
        remain in effect while the appeal is proceeding. The government also has
        noticed
        an appeal from the final judgment. As a result of this appeal, it is possible
        that the District of Columbia Court of Appeals could reinstate certain of
        the
        government’s claims or damages. While trial was underway, the District of
        Columbia Court of Appeals ruled that plaintiff may not seek disgorgement
        of
        profits, but this appeal was interlocutory in nature and could be reconsidered
        in the present appeal. Prior to trial, the government had estimated that
        it was
        entitled to approximately $280.0 billion from the defendants for its
        disgorgement of profits claim. In addition, the government sought during
        trial
        more than $10.0 billion for the creation of nationwide smoking cessation,
        public
        education and counter-marketing programs. In its 2006 verdict, the trial
        court
        declined to award such relief. It is possible that these claims could be
        reinstated on appeal.

In
        another of the cases, a private insurer in Israel, Clalit Health Services,
        seeks
        damages for providing treatment to individuals allegedly injured by cigarette
        smoking in Israel (

Clalit
        Health Services v. Philip Morris, Inc., et al.

,
        District Court of Jerusalem, Israel). The Company was dismissed from this
        suit
        during 2005, although plaintiff has appealed this ruling. The case remains
        pending against Lorillard, other cigarette manufacturers, and other
        defendants.

SETTLEMENT
        OF STATE REIMBURSEMENT LITIGATION - On November 23, 1998, Lorillard, Philip
        Morris Incorporated, Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation and R.J.
        Reynolds Tobacco Company, the “Original Participating Manufacturers,” entered
        into a Master Settlement Agreement (“MSA”) with 46 states, the District of
        Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands,
        American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands to settle
        the asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and certain other claims
        of those states. These settling entities are generally referred to as the
        “Settling States.” The Original Participating Manufacturers had previously
        settled similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota,
        which together with the Master Settlement Agreement are generally referred
        to as
        the “State Settlement Agreements.”


Notes
        to
        Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
        20. Legal Proceedings - (Continued)

The
        State
        Settlement Agreements provide that the agreements are not admissions,
        concessions or evidence of any liability or wrongdoing on the part of any
        party,
        and were entered into by the Original Participating Manufacturers to avoid
        the
        further expense, inconvenience, burden and uncertainty of
        litigation.

Lorillard
        recorded pretax charges of $911.4 million, $876.4 million and $845.9 million
        ($560.2 million, $537.7 million and $522.6 million after taxes) for 2006,
        and 2004, to accrue its obligations under the State Settlement Agreements.
        Lorillard’s portion of ongoing adjusted payments and legal fees is based on its
        share of domestic cigarette shipments in the year preceding that in which
        the
        payment is due. Accordingly, Lorillard records its portions of ongoing
        settlement payments as part of cost of manufactured products sold as the
        related
        sales occur.

The
        State
        Settlement Agreements require that the domestic tobacco industry make annual
        payments in the following amounts, subject to adjustment for several factors,
        including inflation, market share and industry volume: $8.4 billion through
        and $9.4 billion thereafter. In addition, the domestic tobacco industry is
        required to pay settling plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees, subject to an annual cap
        of $500.0 million, as well as an additional amount of up to $125.0 million
        in
        each year through 2008. These payment obligations are the several and not
        joint
        obligations of each settling defendant.

The
        State
        Settlement Agreements also include provisions relating to significant
        advertising and marketing restrictions, public disclosure of certain industry
        documents, limitations on challenges to tobacco control and underage use
        laws,
        and other provisions. Lorillard and the other Original Participating
        Manufacturers have notified the States that they intend to seek an adjustment
        in
        the amount of payments made in 2003 pursuant to a provision in the MSA that
        permits such adjustment if the companies can prove that the MSA was a
        significant factor in their loss of market share to companies not participating
        in the MSA and that the States failed to diligently enforce certain statutes
        passed in connection with the MSA. If the Original Participating Manufacturers
        are ultimately successful, any adjustment would be reflected as a credit
        against
        future payments by the Original Participating Manufacturers under the
        agreement.

From
        time
        to time, lawsuits have been brought against Lorillard and other participating
        manufacturers to the MSA, or against one or more of the states, challenging
        the
        validity of that agreement on certain grounds, including as a violation of
        the
        antitrust laws. Lorillard is a defendant in one such case, which has been
        dismissed by the trial court but has been appealed by the plaintiffs. Lorillard
        understands that additional such cases are proceeding against other
        defendants.

In
        addition, in connection with the MSA, the Original Participating Manufacturers
        entered into an agreement to establish a $5.2 billion trust fund payable
        between
        1999 and 2010 to compensate the tobacco growing communities in 14 states
        (the
“Trust”). Payments to the Trust will no longer be required as a result of an
        assessment imposed under a new federal law repealing the federal supply
        management program for tobacco growers, although the states of Maryland and
        Pennsylvania are contending that payments under the Trust should continue
        to
        growers in those states since the new federal law did not cover them, and
        the
        matter is being litigated. In 2005 other litigation was resolved over the
        Trust’s obligation to return payments made by the Original Participating
        Manufacturers in 2004 or withheld from payment to the Trust for the fourth
        quarter of 2004, when the North Carolina Supreme Court ruled that such payments
        were due to the Trust. Lorillard’s share of payments into the Trust in 2004 was
        approximately $30.0 million and its share of the payment due for the last
        quarter of that year was approximately $10.0 million. Under the new law,
        enacted
        in October of 2004, tobacco quota holders and growers will be compensated
        with
        payments totaling $10.1 billion, funded by an assessment on tobacco
        manufacturers and importers. Payments to qualifying tobacco quota holders
        and
        growers commenced in 2005.

The
        Company believes that the State Settlement Agreements will materially adversely
        affect its cash flows and operating income in future years. The degree of
        the
        adverse impact will depend, among other things, on the rates of decline in
        U.S.
        cigarette sales in the premium price and discount price segments, Lorillard’s
        share of the domestic premium price and discount price cigarette segments,
        and
        the effect of any resulting cost advantage of manufacturers not subject to
        significant payment obligations under the State Settlement
        Agreements.

FILTER
        CASES - In addition to the above, claims have been brought against Lorillard
        by
        individuals who seek damages resulting from their alleged exposure to asbestos
        fibers that were incorporated into filter material used in

one
        brand
        of cigarettes manufactured by Lorillard for a limited period of time ending
        more
        than 50 years ago.

Approximately
        30 such matters are pending against Lorillard. The Company is not a defendant
        in
        any of these matters. Since January 1, 2005, Lorillard has paid, or has reached
        agreement to pay, a total of approximately $10.2 million in payments of
        judgments and settlements to finally resolve approximately 60 claims. No
        such
        cases have been tried since January 1, 2005. Trial dates are scheduled in
        some
        of the pending cases. Trial dates are subject to change.

Other
        Tobacco - Related

TOBACCO
        -
        RELATED ANTITRUST CASES - Indirect Purchaser Suits - Approximately 30 antitrust
        suits were filed on behalf of putative classes of consumers in various state
        courts against Lorillard and its major competitors. The suits

all
        alleged

that the
        defendants entered into agreements to fix the wholesale prices of cigarettes
        in
        violation of state antitrust laws which permit indirect purchasers, such
        as
        retailers and consumers, to sue under price fixing or consumer fraud statutes.

More
        than

        states permit such suits. Lorillard was a defendant in all but one of these
        indirect purchaser cases. The Company was also named as a defendant in most
        of
        these indirect purchaser cases

,

but

was

voluntarily dismissed without prejudice from all of them. Three indirect
        purchaser suits

,

in New
        York, Florida and Michigan, were dismissed by courts in their entirety and
        the

plaintiffs
        withdrew

their
        appeals. The

actions
        in all other

states
        except for New Mexico and Kansas,

have
        been voluntarily dismissed.

In
        the
        Kansas case, the District Court of Seward County certified a class
        of

Kansas
        indirect purchasers in 2002. The

parties
        are in the process of litigating certain privilege issues

.
        On July
        14, 2006, the Court issued an order confirming

that
        fact discovery is closed,

with
        the
        exception of privilege issues that the Court determines, based on a Special
        Master’s report, justify further limited fact discovery. Expert discovery, as

A
        decision granting class certification in New Mexico was affirmed by the New
        Mexico Court of Appeals on February 8, 2005. As ordered by the Court, class
        notice was sent out

on

October
        30, 2005. The New Mexico plaintiffs

were

permitted to rely on discovery produced in the Kansas case.

On June
        30, 2006, the New Mexico Court granted summary judgment to all defendants,
        and
        the suit was dismissed. An appeal was filed by the plaintiffs on August 14,
        2006, and has not yet been heard.

Tobacco
        Growers Suit -

DeLoach
        v. Philip Morris Inc., et al.

(U.S.
        District Court, Middle District of North Carolina, filed February 16, 2000).
        On
        October 1, 2003, the Court approved a settlement by Lorillard with a class
        consisting of all persons holding a quota (the licenses that a farmer must
        either own or rent to sell the crop) to grow, and all domestic producers
        who
        sold flue-cured or burley tobacco at anytime from February 1996 to present.
        In
        addition to payments previously made, Lorillard committed to buy 20 million
        pounds of domestic tobacco for each crop year through 2012. Pursuant to the
        terms of the settlement agreement, that obligation was subsequently extended
        until crop year 2014 as a result of the enactment of the Fair and Equitable
        Tobacco Reform Act of 2004.

Lorillard
        has also committed to purchase at least 35% of its annual total requirements
        for
        flue-cured and burley tobacco domestically for the same period. The other
        major
        domestic tobacco companies and the major leaf buyers were also defendants,
        and
        all of the defendants with the exception of R.J. Reynolds were parties to
        the
        settlement agreement entered on October 1, 2003. R.J. Reynolds subsequently
        entered into a settlement agreement with the class and that agreement was
        approved by the Court. Lorillard contended that the R.J. Reynolds settlement
        agreement triggered a clause in Lorillard’s settlement agreement that would
        substantially reduce Lorillard’s commitments to buy domestic tobacco. After
        Lorillard prevailed on an appeal related to the claimed reduction, the trial
        court ruled that the leaf commitment will be reduced for Lorillard by
        approximately 60%, effective in 2006.

MSA
        Federal Antitrust Suit -

Sanders
        v. Lockyer, et al.

(U.S.
        District Court, Northern District of California, filed June 9, 2004). Lorillard
        and the other major cigarette manufacturers, along with the Attorney General
        of
        the State of California, have been sued by a consumer purchaser of cigarettes
        in
        a putative class action alleging violations of the Sherman Act and California
        state antitrust and unfair competition laws. The plaintiff seeks treble damages
        of an unstated amount for the putative class as well as declaratory and
        injunctive relief. All claims are based on the assertion that the Master
        Settlement Agreement that Lorillard and the other cigarette manufacturer
        defendants entered into with the State of California and more than forty
        other
        states, together with certain implementing legislation enacted

by

California,

constitute

unlawful
        restraints

the

defendants’

motion


Notes
        to
        Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
        20. Legal Proceedings - (Continued)

to
        dismiss the suit was granted. Plaintiffs appealed the dismissal to the Court
        of
        Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Argument on the appeal is to be heard on February
        15, 2007.

Defenses

Lorillard
        believes that it has valid defenses to the cases pending against it. Lorillard
        also believes it has valid bases for appeal of the adverse verdicts against
        it.
        To the extent the Company is a defendant in any of the lawsuits described
        in
        this section, the Company believes that it is not a proper defendant in these
        matters and has moved or plans to move for dismissal of all such claims against
        it. While Lorillard intends to defend vigorously all tobacco products liability
        litigation, it is not possible to predict the outcome of any of this litigation.
        Litigation is subject to many uncertainties. Plaintiffs have prevailed in
        several cases, as noted above. It is possible that one or more of the pending
        actions could be decided unfavorably as to Lorillard or the other defendants.
        Lorillard may enter into discussions in an attempt to settle particular cases
        if
        it believes it is appropriate to do so.

Lorillard
        cannot predict the outcome of pending litigation.

Some
        plaintiffs have been awarded damages from cigarette manufacturers at trial.
        While some of these awards have been overturned or reduced, other damages
        awards
        have been paid after the manufacturers have exhausted their appeals. These
        awards and other litigation activities against cigarette manufacturers continue
        to receive media attention.

In
        addition, health issues related to tobacco products also continue to receive
        media attention.

It
        is
        possible, for example, that the 2006 verdict in

United
        States of America v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., et al.

,
        which
        made many adverse findings regarding the conduct of the defendants, including
        Lorillard, could form the basis of allegations by other plaintiffs or additional
        judicial findings against cigarette manufacturers. The 2006 decision by the
        Florida Supreme Court in

Engle

could
        lead to the filing of many new cases against cigarette manufacturers, including
        Lorillard.

These
        events could have an adverse affect on the ability of Lorillard to prevail
        in
        smoking and health litigation

and
        could influence the filing of new suits against Lorillard or the Company.

Lorillard
        also cannot predict the type or extent of litigation that could be brought
        against it and other cigarette manufacturers in the future.

Except
        for the impact of the State Settlement Agreements as described above, management
        is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that
        could result from an unfavorable outcome of pending litigation and, therefore,
        no provision has been made in the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements
        for any unfavorable outcome. It is possible that the Company’s results of
        operations or cash flows in a particular quarterly or annual period or its
        financial position could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable
        outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation.

OTHER
        LITIGATION

The
        Company and its subsidiaries are also parties to other litigation arising
        in the
        ordinary course of business. The outcome of this other litigation will not,
        in
        the opinion of management, materially affect the Company’s results of operations
        or equity.

Note
        21.  Commitments and Contingencies

Guarantees

In
        the
        course of selling business entities and assets to third parties, CNA has
        agreed
        to indemnify purchasers for losses arising out of breaches of representation
        and
        warranties with respect to the business entities or assets being sold,
        including, in certain cases, losses arising from undisclosed liabilities
        or
        certain named litigation. Such indemnification provisions generally survive
        for
        periods ranging from nine months following the applicable closing date to
        the
        expiration of the relevant statutes of limitation. As of December 31, 2006,
        the
        aggregate amount of quantifiable indemnification agreements in effect for
        sales
        of business entities, assets and third party loans was $933.0
        million.

In
        addition, CNA has agreed to provide indemnification to third party purchasers
        for certain losses associated with sold business entities or assets that
        are not
        limited by a contractual monetary amount. As of December 31, 2006, CNA had
        outstanding unlimited indemnifications in connection with the sales of certain
        of its business entities or

assets

that

included
        tax liabilities

        a

time
        of
        sale, employee claims arising prior to closing and in some cases losses arising
        from certain litigation and undisclosed liabilities. These indemnification
        agreements survive until the applicable statutes of limitation expire, or
        until
        the agreed upon contract terms expire. As of December 31, 2006, CNA has recorded
        approximately $28.0 million of liabilities related to these indemnification
        agreements.

In
        connection with the issuance of preferred securities by CNA Surety Capital
        Trust
        I, CNA Surety, a 63% owned and consolidated subsidiary of CNA, issued a
        guarantee of $75.0 million to guarantee the payment by CNA Surety Capital
        Trust
        I of annual dividends of $1.5 million over 30 years and redemption of $30.0
        million of preferred securities.

CNA
        Surety

CNA
        Surety has provided significant surety bond protection for a large national
        contractor that undertakes projects for the construction of government and
        private facilities, a substantial portion of which have been reinsured by
        CCC.
        In order to help this contractor meet its liquidity needs and complete projects
        which had been bonded by CNA Surety, commencing in 2003 CNA provided loans to
        the contractor through a credit facility. Due to reduced operating cash flow
        at
        the contractor these loans were fully impaired through realized investment
        losses in 2004 and 2005. The Company, through a participation agreement with
        CNA, has funded and owns an interest in the credit facility. For the years
        ended
        December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company recorded a pretax impairment charge
        of
        $47.0 million and $80.5 million. CNA no longer provides additional liquidity
        to
        the contractor and has not recognized interest income related to the loans
        since
        June 30, 2005.

In
        addition to the impairment of loans outstanding under the credit facility,
        CNA
        determined that the contractor would likely be unable to meet its obligations
        under the surety bonds. Accordingly, during 2005, CNA Surety established
        $110.0
        million of surety loss reserves in anticipation of future loss payments,
        $50.0
        million of which was ceded to CCC under the reinsurance agreements discussed
        below. Further deterioration of the contractor’s operating cash flow could
        result in higher loss estimates and trigger additional reserve actions. If
        any
        such reserve additions were required, CCC would have all further surety bond
        exposure through the reinsurance arrangements. During the years ended December
        31, 2006 and 2005, CNA Surety paid $34.0 million and $26.0 million related
        to
        surety losses of the contractor.

CNA
        Surety may provide surety bonds on a limited basis on behalf of the contractor
        to support its revised restructuring plan, subject to the contractor’s
        compliance with CNA Surety’s underwriting standards and ongoing management of
        CNA Surety’s exposure in relation to the contractor. All surety bonds written
        for the contractor are issued by CCC and its affiliates, other than CNA Surety,
        and are subject to underlying reinsurance treaties pursuant to which all
        bonds
        written on behalf of CNA Surety are 100% reinsured to one of CNA Surety’s
        insurance subsidiaries.

CCC
        provides reinsurance protection to CNA Surety for losses in excess of an
        aggregate of $60.0 million associated with the contractor. This treaty provides
        coverage for the life of bonds either in force or written from January 1,
        to December 31, 2005. CCC and CNA Surety agreed by addendum to extend this
        contract for twenty four months, expiring on December 31, 2007.

CCC
        and
        CNA Surety continue to engage in periodic discussions with insurance regulatory
        authorities regarding the level of surety bonds provided for this contractor
        and
        will continue to apprise those authorities of the status of their ongoing
        exposure to this account.

Indemnification
        and subrogation rights, including rights to contract proceeds on construction
        projects in the event of default, reduce CNA Surety’s and ultimately the
        Company’s exposure to loss. While CNA believes that the contractor’s continuing
        restructuring efforts may be successful, the contractor’s failure to ultimately
        achieve its extended restructuring plan or perform its contractual obligations
        under CNA’s surety bonds could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
        results of operations. If such failures occur, CNA estimates the additional
        surety loss, net of indemnification and subrogation recoveries, but before
        the
        effects of minority interest, could be up to $90.0 million pretax.


Notes
        to
        Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
        21. Commitments and Contingencies - (Continued)

CNA
        has
        also guaranteed or provided collateral for the contractor’s letters of credit.
        As of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, these guarantees and collateral
        obligations aggregated $9.0 million and $13.0 million.

CCC
        provided an excess of loss reinsurance contract to the insurance subsidiaries
        of
        CNA Surety over a period that expired on December 31, 2000 (the “stop loss
        contract”). The stop loss contract limits the net loss ratios for CNA Surety
        with respect to certain accounts and lines of insurance business. In the
        event
        that CNA Surety’s accident year net loss ratio exceeds 24.0% for 1997 through
        2000 (the “contractual loss ratio”), the stop loss contract requires CCC to pay
        amounts equal to the amount, if any, by which CNA Surety’s actual accident year
        net loss ratio exceeds the contractual loss ratio multiplied by the applicable
        net earned premiums. The minority shareholders of CNA Surety do not share
        in any
        losses that apply to this contract.

Diamond
        Offshore Construction Projects

As
        of
        December 31, 2006, Diamond Offshore had purchase obligations aggregating
        approximately $456.0 million related to the major upgrades of the

Ocean
        Monarch

and
        the

Ocean
        Endeavor

and
        construction of two new jack-up rigs, the

Ocean
        Scepter

and

Ocean
        Shield

.
        Diamond
        Offshore anticipates that expenditures related to these shipyard projects
        will
        be approximately $263.0 million and $193.0 million in 2007 and 2008,
        respectively. However, the actual timing of these expenditures will vary
        based
        on the completion of various construction milestones and the timing of the
        delivery of equipment, which are beyond Diamond Offshore’s control.

Regulatory
        and Rate Matters

Texas
        Gas
        filed a rate case with FERC in April of 2005, and implemented the new rates
        on
        November 1, 2005, subject to refund. As of December 31, 2005, an estimated
        refund liability of approximately $5.0 million related to Texas Gas’ open
        general rate case was recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In June
        of
        2006, the settlement of Texas Gas’ general rate case became final. On June 30,
        2006, Texas Gas refunded approximately $6.6 million consisting of $6.4 million
        in principal and $0.2 million of interest to its customers. In accordance
        with
        the terms of the settlement, Texas Gas has no obligation to file a new rate
        case
        and is prohibited from placing new rates into effect prior to November 1,
        2010.
        Currently, neither Texas Gas nor Gulf South is involved in an open general
        rate
        case.

Pipeline
        Expansion Projects

Boardwalk
        Pipeline is engaged in several major expansion projects that will require
        the
        investment of significant capital resources. These projects include a 1.7
        Bcf
        pipeline expansion in East Texas/Mississippi, construction of a 1.6 Bcf
        interstate pipeline from Texas to Louisiana, a 1.2 Bcf pipeline expansion
        from
        Mississippi to Alabama, the construction of two laterals connecting its Texas
        Gas pipeline to transport gas for producers operating in Arkansas and
        Mississippi and storage expansion projects in western Kentucky and Louisiana.
        These projects are subject to FERC approval. As of December 31, 2006, Boardwalk
        Pipeline had purchase commitments of $409.1 million primarily related to
        its
        expansion projects.

Other

In
        the
        normal course of business, CNA has provided letters of credit in favor of
        various unaffiliated insurance companies, regulatory authorities and other
        entities. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, there were approximately $27.0 million
        and $30.0 million of outstanding letters of credit.

Note
        22.  Discontinued Operations

CNA
        has
        discontinued operations which consist of run-off insurance operations acquired
        in its merger with The Continental Corporation in 1995. The business consists
        of
        facultative property and casualty, treaty excess casualty and treaty pro-rata
        reinsurance with underlying exposure to a diverse, multi-line domestic and
        international book of business encompassing property, casualty, the London
        Market and marine liabilities. The run-off operations are concentrated in
        the
        United Kingdom and Bermuda subsidiaries also acquired in the
        merger.

The
        results for 2006 reflect an impairment loss of $26.2 million, after minority
        interest, related to the anticipated sale of a portion of the discontinued
        operations. The assets and liabilities that would be subject to a sale were
        $239.0 million and $157.0 million at December 31, 2006. Excluding the impairment
        loss on the anticipated sale, net loss for this business was $0.9 million
        and
        $2.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2004, and net income
        was
        $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. CNA’s subsidiary, The
        Continental Corporation, provides a guarantee for a portion of the subject
        liabilities related to certain marine products. Any sale is expected to include
        provisions that would significantly limit CNA’s exposure related to this
        guarantee.

Net
        assets of discontinued operations, including the assets and liabilities subject
        to the sale discussed above, are included in Other Assets in the Consolidated

        realized investment gains and losses, foreign currency gains and losses,
        effects
        of the accretion of the loss reserve discount and re-estimation of the ultimate
        claim and claim adjustment expense of the discontinued operations.

Note
        23.  Business Segments

The
        Company’s reportable segments are primarily based on its individual operating
        subsidiaries. Each of the principal operating subsidiaries are headed by
        a chief
        executive officer who is responsible for the operation of its business and
        has
        the duties and authority commensurate with that position. Investment gains
        (losses) and the related income taxes, excluding those of CNA Financial,
        are
        included in the Corporate and other segment.

CNA
        manages its property and casualty operations in two operating segments, which
        represent CNA’s core operations: Standard Lines and Specialty Lines. The
        non-core operations are managed in Life and Group Non-Core segment and Other
        Insurance segment. Standard Lines includes standard property and casualty
        coverages sold to small and middle market commercial businesses primarily
        through an independent agency distribution system, and excess and surplus
        lines,
        as well as insurance and risk management products sold to large corporations
        in
        the U.S. and globally. Specialty Lines provides professional, financial and
        specialty property and casualty products and services. Life and Group Non-Core
        primarily includes the results of the life and group lines of business sold
        or
        placed in run-off. Other Insurance primarily includes the results of certain
        property and casualty lines of business placed in run-off, including CNA
        Re.
        This segment also includes the results related to the centralized adjusting
        and
        settlement of APMT claims as well as the results of CNA’s participation in
        voluntary insurance pools, which are primarily in run-off and various other
        non-insurance operations.

Lorillard
        is engaged in the production and sale of cigarettes with its principal products
        marketed under the brand names of Newport, Kent, True, Maverick and Old Gold
        with substantially all of its sales in the United States.

Boardwalk
        Pipeline is engaged in the interstate transportation and storage of natural
        gas.
        This segment consists of two interstate natural gas pipeline systems originating
        in the Gulf Coast area and running north and east through Texas, Louisiana,
        Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio
        and
        Illinois with approximately 13,400 miles of pipeline.

Diamond
        Offshore’s business primarily consists of operating 44 offshore drilling rigs
        that are chartered on a contract basis for fixed terms by companies engaged
        in
        exploration and production of hydrocarbons. Offshore rigs are mobile units
        that
        can be relocated based on market demand. The majority of these rigs are located
        in the Gulf of Mexico region with the remainder operating in Brazil, the
        North
        Sea, and various other foreign markets.

Loews
        Hotels owns and/or operates 18 hotels, 16 of which are in the United States
        and
        two are in Canada.

The
        Corporate and other segment consists primarily of corporate investment income,
        including investment gains (losses) from non-insurance subsidiaries, the
        operations of Bulova Corporation which distributes and sells watches and
        clocks,
        equity earnings from shipping operations, as well as corporate interest expenses
        and other corporate administrative costs.

The
        accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the
        summary of significant accounting policies. In addition, CNA does not maintain
        a
        distinct investment portfolio for each of its insurance segments, and
        accordingly, allocation of assets to each segment is not performed. Therefore,
        net investment income and investment gains (losses) are allocated based on
        each
        segment’s carried insurance reserves, as adjusted.

Notes
        to
        Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
        24.  Consolidating Financial Information

The
        following schedules present the Company’s consolidating balance sheet
        information at December 31, 2006 and 2005, and consolidating statements of
        income information for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.
        These
        schedules present the individual subsidiaries of the Company and their
        contribution to the consolidated financial statements. Amounts presented
        will
        not necessarily be the same as those in the individual financial statements
        of
        the Company’s subsidiaries due to adjustments for purchase accounting, income
        taxes and minority interests. In addition, many of the Company’s subsidiaries
        use a classified balance sheet which also leads to differences in amounts
        reported for certain line items. This information also does not reflect the
        impact of the Company’s issuance of Carolina Group stock. Lorillard is reported
        as a 100% owned subsidiary and does not include any adjustments relating
        to the
        tracking stock structure. See Note 6 for consolidating information of the
        Carolina Group and Loews Group.

The
        Corporate and Other column primarily reflects the parent company’s investment in
        its subsidiaries, invested cash portfolio, corporate long-term debt and Bulova
        Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary. The elimination adjustments are for
        intercompany assets and liabilities, interest and dividends, the parent
        company’s investment in capital stocks of subsidiaries, and various reclasses of
        debit or credit balances to the amounts in consolidation. Purchase accounting
        adjustments have been pushed down to the appropriate subsidiary.

Notes

        Consolidated Financial Statements

Note
        25.  Subsequent Event

Subsequent
        to December 31, 2006 and through February 14, 2007, the holders of $438.4
        million in principal amount of Diamond Offshore’s 1.5% debentures converted
        their outstanding debentures into 8,943,284 shares of Diamond Offshore’s common
        stock.

Subsequent
        to December 31, 2006 and through February 14, 2007, the holders of $1.5 million
        accreted value at the dates of conversion, of $2.4 million aggregate principal
        amount at maturity, of Diamond Offshore’s Zero Coupon Debentures converted their
        outstanding debentures into 20,658 shares of Diamond Offshore’s common
        stock.

As
        a
        result of the conversions of Diamond Offshore’s 1.5% debentures, the Company
        will recognize a deferred tax benefit of approximately $50.0 million in 2007
        related to the release of a deferred tax liability from the interest expense
        imputed on these bonds for U.S. federal income tax return
        purposes.

The
        Company’s ownership interest in Diamond Offshore declined from approximately 54%
        to 51% due to these transactions. The Company estimates it will recognize
        a
        pretax gain of approximately $135.0 million on the issuance of subsidiary
        stock
        in the first quarter of 2007.

            amended (the “Exchange Act”)) which is designed to ensure that information
            required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits
            under the federal securities laws, including this report is recorded,
            processed,
            summarized and reported on a timely basis. These disclosure controls
            and
            procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
            required to be disclosed by the Company under the federal securities
            laws is
            accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management on a timely basis to
            allow decisions regarding required disclosure.

The
            Company’s principal executive officer (“CEO”) and principal financial officer
            (“CFO”) undertook an evaluation of the Company’s disclosure controls and
            procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e))
            as of the
            end of the period covered by this report. CNA has engaged in a number
            of efforts
            to remediate the two material weaknesses in internal control over financial
            reporting, described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period
            ended
            December 31, 2005. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the revised
            control processes have now been operating for a sufficient period of
            time so as
            to provide reasonable assurance as to their effectiveness and, therefore,
            the
            control deficiencies have been fully remediated. As a result, the CEO
            and CFO
            have concluded that the Company’s controls and procedures were effective as of
            December 31, 2006.

Internal
            Control Over Financial Reporting

Pursuant
            to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the implementing
            rules of
            the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company included a report
            of
            management’s assessment of the design and effectiveness of its internal controls
            as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
            31, 2006.
            The independent registered public accounting firm of the Company also
            reported
            on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
            financial reporting. Management’s report and the independent registered public
            accounting firm’s report are included on pages [58 to 61] under the captions
            entitled “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting” and
“Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” and are incorporated
            herein by reference.

There
            were no other changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
            (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
            identified
            in connection with the foregoing evaluation that occurred during the
            quarter
            ended December 31, 2006, that have materially affected or that are reasonably
            likely to materially affect the Company’s internal control over financial
            reporting.
