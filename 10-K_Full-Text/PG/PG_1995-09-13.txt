         ---------

                      General Development of Business
                      -------------------------------
     The Procter & Gamble Company was incorporated in Ohio in 1905, having
been built from a business founded in 1837 by William Procter and James
Gamble.  Today, the Company manufactures and markets a broad range of
consumer products in many countries throughout the world.

     Unless the context indicates otherwise, the term the "Company" as used
herein refers to The Procter & Gamble Company (the registrant) and its
subsidiaries.

     Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by
reference to the Letter to Shareholders, which appears on pages 1-5 of the
Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1995.

               Financial Information About Industry Segments
               ---------------------------------------------
     The Company's products fall into five business segments:  Laundry and
Cleaning, Paper, Beauty Care, Food and Beverage, and Health Care.

     Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by
reference to Note 12 Segment Information, which appears on pages 35 and 36
of the Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30,
1995.

                     Narrative Description of Business
                    ----------------------------------
     The Company's business, represented by the aggregate of its Laundry
and Cleaning, Paper, Beauty Care, Food and Beverage, and Health Care
segments, is essentially homogeneous.  For the most part, the factors
necessary for an understanding of these five segments are essentially
identical.  The markets in which the Company's products are sold are highly
competitive.  The products of the Company's business segments compete with
many large and small companies, and there is no dominant competitor or
competitors.  Advertising is used in conjunction with an extensive sales
force because the Company believes this combination provides the most
efficient method of marketing these types of products.  Product quality,
performance, value and packaging are also important competitive factors.
Most of the Company's products in each of its segments are distributed
through grocery stores and other retail outlets.

     The Laundry category and Diaper category constitute 21% and 13% of
consolidated 1995 sales, respectively.  These categories constituted
approximately the same percentages of consolidated sales in the preceding
two fiscal years.  The creation of new products and the development of new
performance benefits for consumers on the Company's existing products are
vital ingredients in its continuing progress in the highly competitive
markets in which it does business.  Basic research and product development
activities continued to carry a high priority during the past fiscal year.
While many of the benefits from these efforts will not be realized until
future years, the Company believes these activities demonstrate its
commitment to future growth.
                                    -2-


     The Company has registered trademarks and owns or has licenses under
patents which are used in connection with its business in all segments.
Some of these patents or licenses cover significant product formulation and
processing of the Company's products.  The trade names of all major
products in each segment are registered trademarks.  In part, the Company's
success can be attributed to the existence of these trademarks, patents and
licenses.

     Most of the raw materials used by the Company are purchased from
others.  Additionally, some raw materials, primarily chemicals, are
produced by the Company for further use in the manufacturing process.  The
Company purchases and produces a substantial variety of raw materials, no
one of which is material to the Company's business taken as a whole.

     Expenditures in fiscal year 1995 for compliance with Federal, State
and local environmental laws and regulations were not materially different
from such expenditures in the prior year, and no material increase is
expected in fiscal year 1996.

     Operations outside the United States are generally characterized by
the same conditions discussed in the description of the business above and
may also be affected by additional elements including changing currency
values and different rates of inflation and economic growth.  The effect of
these additional elements is less significant in the Food and Beverage
segment than in the Company's other business segments.

     The Company provides an Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") which is
part of The Procter & Gamble Profit Sharing Trust and Employee Stock
Ownership Plan.  Convertible preferred stock of the Company and other assets
owned by the ESOP are held through a trust (the "ESOP Trust").  The ESOP
Trust has issued certain debt securities to the public.  The Company has
guaranteed payment of principal and interest on these debt securities.
Holders of these debt securities have no recourse against the assets of the
ESOP Trust except with respect to cash contributions made by the Company to
the ESOP Trust, and earnings attributable to such contributions.  Such cash
contributions are made by the Company only to the extent that dividends on
the convertible preferred stock are inadequate to fund repayment of the debt
securities.  Any such contributions and subsequent payments to holders are
made on a same-day basis and such contributions would therefore not be held
by the ESOP Trust unless there was a default in payment on the debt
securities by the ESOP Trust after having received such contributions from
the Company.  Such a default is not likely to occur and there is therefore
little likelihood that there would be assets available to satisfy the claims
of any holders of the debt securities.  A summary description of the
liabilities of the ESOP Trust and of the dividends paid by the Company on the
convertible preferred stock and cash payments from the Company to the ESOP
Trust for the three years ended June 30, 1995 are incorporated by reference
to Note 9 Retirement Plans, which appears on pages 32-34 of the Annual Report
to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1995.

     Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by
reference to the Letter to Shareholders, which appears on pages 1-5, Note 12
Segment Information, which appears on pages 35 and 36, the Financial
Highlights, which appear on page 37, and Management's Discussion and
Analysis, which appears on pages 18-22 of the Annual Report to Shareholders
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1995.

        Financial Information About Foreign and Domestic Operations
        -----------------------------------------------------------
     The information required by this item is incorporated herein by
reference to Note 12 Segment Information, which appears on pages 35 and 36 of
the Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1995.

Item 2.  Properties.
         -----------
     In the United States, the Company owns and operates manufacturing
facilities at 39 locations in 20 states.  In addition, it owns and operates
90 manufacturing facilities in 42 other countries.  Laundry and Cleaning
products are produced at 37 of these locations, Paper products at 35, Health
Care products at 30, Beauty Care products at 47, and Food and Beverage
products at 16.  Management believes that the Company's production facilities
are adequate to support the business efficiently and that the properties and
equipment have been well maintained.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings.
         ------------------
     The Company is involved in clean-up efforts at off-site Superfund
locations, many of which are in the preliminary stages of investigation.  The
amount accrued at June 30, 1995 representing the Company's probable future
costs that can be reasonably estimated was $8 million.

     The Company is also involved in certain other environmental proceedings.
No such proceeding is expected to result in material monetary or other
sanctions being imposed by any governmental entity, or in other material
liabilities.  However, the Company has agreed to participate in the Toxic
Substances Control Act ("TSCA") Section 8(e) Compliance Audit Program of the
United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA").  As a participant, the
Company has agreed to audit its files for materials which under current EPA
guidelines would be subject to notification under Section 8(e) of TSCA and to
pay stipulated penalties for each report submitted under this program.  It is
anticipated that the Company's liability under the Program will be
$1,000,000.  No administrative proceeding is pending; however the Company
anticipates being required to enter an Administrative Order on Consent
pursuant to this Program in late 1995.  In addition, the EPA issued to a
subsidiary of the Company a Finding and Notice of Violation ("NOV") dated
June 16, 1994, based on Section 113(a) of the Clean Air Act (as amended), for
alleged violations of the California State Implementation Plan by the
subsidiary's manufacturing plant in Sacramento, California.  The violations
relate to 1) a plant expansion project that was implemented on the basis of
calculated emission data that later proved to be inaccurate, with the result
that the project allegedly failed to observe the federal construction ban and
certain "new source review" provisions; and 2) the subsequent installation of
a material recovery unit that is now alleged to be pollution control
equipment for which a permit was required.  The subsidiary and EPA have
tentatively agreed that this matter (together with a relatively minor
Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act ("SARA") reporting deficiency)
would be resolved upon the payment of a civil penalty of less than $500,000.
