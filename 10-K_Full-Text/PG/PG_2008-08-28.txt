PART I

Item 1.

Business

.

Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to
Management’s Discussion and Analysis, which appears on pages 39-55; Note 1, Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies, which appears on pages 60-63; Note 2, Acquisitions, which appears on page 63;
and Note 12, Segment Information, which appears on pages 74-75 of the Annual Report to Shareholders
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms the
“Company,” “P&G,” “we,” “our” or “us” as used herein refers to The Procter & Gamble Company (the
registrant) and its subsidiaries.

The Procter & Gamble Company is focused on providing branded consumer goods products of
superior quality and value to improve the lives of the world’s consumers. The Company was
incorporated in Ohio in 1905, having been built from a business founded in 1837 by William Procter
and James Gamble. Today, we market our products in more than 180 countries.

Throughout this Form 10-K, we incorporate by reference information from other documents filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The Company’s annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports
on Form 8-K are filed electronically with the SEC. The SEC maintains an internet site that
contains these reports at:

http://www.sec.gov

. You can also access these reports through links
from our website at: www.pg.com/investors/sectionmain.shtml.

Copies of these reports are also available, without charge, by contacting The Procter & Gamble
Company, Shareholder Services Department, P.O. Box 5572, Cincinnati, Ohio 45201-5572.

Financial Information About Segments

In fiscal year 2008, the Company was organized into three Global Business Units: Beauty;
Health & Well-Being; and Household Care. We had six reportable segments under U.S. GAAP: Beauty;
Grooming; Health Care; Snacks, Coffee and Pet Care; Fabric Care and Home Care; and Baby Care and
Family Care. Many of the factors necessary for an understanding of these businesses are similar.
Operating margins of the individual businesses vary slightly due to the nature of materials and
processes used to manufacture the products, the capital intensity of the businesses and differences
in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales. Net sales growth by
business is also expected to vary slightly due to the underlying growth of the markets of each
business and products. While none of our reportable segments are highly seasonal, components
within certain of our reportable segments, such as batteries (Fabric Care and Home Care),
appliances (Grooming) and prestige fine fragrances (Beauty) are seasonal. In addition,
anticipation or occurrence of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, can drive unusually high
demand for batteries.

Additional information about our businesses can be found in Management’s Discussion and
Analysis, pages 39-55, and Note 12, Segment Information, which appears on pages 74-75 of the Annual
Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008.



Narrative Description of Business

Business Model

. Our business model relies on the continued growth and success of existing
brands and products, as well as the creation of new products. The markets and industry segments in
which we offer our products are highly competitive. Our products are sold in over 180 countries
around the world primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug
stores and in “high-frequency stores,” the neighborhood stores which serve many consumers in
developing markets. We work collaboratively with our customers to improve the in-store presence of
our products and win the “first moment of truth” — when a consumer is shopping in the store. We
must also win the “second moment of truth” — when a consumer uses the product, evaluates how well
it met his or her expectations and whether it was a good value. We believe we must continue to
provide new, innovative products and branding to the consumer in order to grow our business.
Research and product development activities, designed to enable sustained organic growth, continued
to carry a high priority during the past fiscal year. While many of the benefits from these
efforts will not be realized until future years, we believe these activities demonstrate our
commitment to future growth.

Key Product Categories

. In 2008, one product category accounted for 10% or more of
consolidated net sales. The laundry category constituted approximately 16% of net sales for fiscal
years 2008, 2007 and 2006.

Key Customers

. Our customers include mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club
stores, drug stores and high-frequency stores. Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates
represent approximately 15% of our total revenue in 2008, 2007 and 2006. No other customer
represents more than 10% of our net sales. Our top ten customers account for approximately 31% of
our total unit volume in 2008, compared to 30% of total unit volume in 2007 and 31% in 2006. The
nature of our business results in no material backlog orders or contracts with the government. We
believe our practices related to working capital items for customers and suppliers are consistent
with the industry segments in which we compete.

Sources and Availability of Materials

. Almost all of the raw and packaging materials used by
the Company are purchased from others, some of whom are single-source suppliers. We produce raw
materials, primarily chemicals, for further use in the manufacturing process. In addition, fuel,
natural gas and derivative products are important commodities used in our plants, products and in
the trucks used to deliver our products to customers. The prices we pay for materials and other
commodities are subject to fluctuation. When prices for these items change, we may or may not pass
on the change to our customers, depending on the magnitude and expected duration of the change.
The Company purchases a substantial variety of other raw and packaging materials, no one of which
is material to our business taken as a whole.

Trademarks and Patents

. We own or have licenses under patents and registered trademarks which
are used in connection with our activity in all businesses. Some of these patents or licenses
cover significant product formulation and processes used to manufacture our products. The
trademarks are important to the overall marketing and branding of our products.
All major products and trademarks in each business are registered. In part, our success can be
attributed to the existence and continued protection of these trademarks, patents and licenses.



Competitive Condition.

The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive. Our
products compete against similar products of many large and small companies, including well-known
global competitors. We market our products with advertising, promotions and other vehicles to
build awareness of our brands in conjunction with an extensive sales force. We believe this
combination provides the most efficient method of marketing for these types of products. Product
quality, performance, value and packaging are also important competitive factors.

Research
and Development Expenditures.

Research and development
expenditures enable us to
develop technologies and obtain patents across all categories in order to meet the needs and
improve the lives of our consumers. Total research and development expenses were $2,226 million in
2008, $2,112 million in 2007 and $2,075 million in 2006.

Expenditures for Environmental Compliance

. Expenditures for compliance with federal, state and
local environmental laws and regulations are fairly consistent from year to year and are not
material to the Company. No material change is expected in fiscal year 2009.

Employees

. The Company has approximately 138,000 employees.

Financial Information About Foreign and Domestic Operations

Net sales in the United States account for approximately 40% of total net sales. No other
individual country had net sales exceeding 10% of total net sales. Operations outside the United
States are generally characterized by the same conditions discussed in the description of the
business above and may also be affected by additional factors including changing currency values,
different rates of inflation, economic growth and political and economic uncertainties and
disruptions. Our sales by geography for the fiscal years ended June 30 were as follows:

Development of the Business

The discussion below provides insight to the general development of our business, including
the material acquisitions and disposition of assets over the past five years.

Gillette Acquisition.

On October 1, 2005, we completed the acquisition of The Gillette
Company. Pursuant to the acquisition agreement, which provided for the exchange of 0.975 shares
of The Procter & Gamble Company common stock, on a tax-free basis, for each share of The Gillette
Company, we issued 962 million shares of The Procter & Gamble Company common stock. We also issued
79 million stock options in exchange for The Gillette Company’s outstanding stock options. Under
the purchase method of accounting, the total consideration was approximately $53.43 billion
including common stock, the fair value of vested stock options and acquisition costs.

The acquisition of The Gillette Company provided us with global market leadership in male
grooming, selected female grooming products, alkaline batteries and in manual and power
toothbrushes. Total sales for The Gillette Company during its most recent pre-acquisition year
ended December 31, 2004 were $10.5 billion.

In order to obtain regulatory approval of the transaction, we were required to divest certain
overlapping businesses. We completed the divestiture of the Spinbrush toothbrush business,
Rembrandt (a Gillette oral care product line) and Right Guard and other Gillette deodorant brands
during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006.

Juice Divestiture.

In August 2004 the Company completed the divestiture of its Juice business.

Wella Acquisition

. In September 2003, the Company acquired a controlling interest in Wella.
Through a stock purchase agreement with the majority shareholders of Wella and a tender offer made
on the remaining shares, we acquired approximately 81% of the outstanding Wella shares (99% of the
voting class shares and 45% of the preference shares). In June 2004, a Company’s subsidiary and
Wella entered into a Domination and Profit Transfer Agreement (the Domination Agreement). Under
the Domination Agreement, we are entitled to exercise full operating control and receive 100% of
the future earnings of Wella. As consideration for the Domination Agreement, we agreed to pay the
remaining shareholders of Wella a guaranteed annual dividend payment. Alternatively, the remaining
Wella shareholders could have elected to tender their shares to the Company for an agreed price.
The fair value of the total guaranteed annual dividend payments was $1.11 billion, which is the
approximate cost if all remaining shares were tendered. During the year ended June 30, 2006, a
portion of the remaining shares were tendered, resulting in a $944 million reduction in our
liability under the Domination Agreement. In December 2005, the Wella shareholder meeting approved
the squeeze-out of the remaining shareholders. Upon the registration of the squeeze-out in the
commercial register on November 12, 2007, the remaining shares of the minority shareholders were
transferred to the Company in exchange for a pre-determined cash consideration. While the
Domination Agreement transaction, including the guaranteed dividend payment and the cash offer, as
well as
the squeeze-out transaction, including the cash consideration, have been challenged by the
former minority shareholders, the Company now owns 100% of the Wella stock.



The total purchase price for Wella, including acquisition costs and the costs of the
guaranteed dividend and squeeze-out payments, was $6.27 billion based on exchange rates at the
acquisition dates. The acquisition was financed by a mixture of available cash balances, debt and
the liability recorded under the Domination Agreement.

Hutchison Acquisition

. In June 2004, we purchased the remaining 20% stake of our China venture
from our partner, Hutchison Whampoa China Ltd. (Hutchison), giving us full ownership of our
operations in China. The net purchase price was $1.85 billion, which is the purchase price of
$2.00 billion net of minority interest and certain obligations that were eliminated as a result of
the transaction. The acquisition was funded by debt.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors.

We discuss our expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our
business outlook and objectives in this Form 10-K, the Annual Report to Shareholders, quarterly
reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All statements, except for
historical and present factual information, are “forward-looking statements” and are based on
financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may
become out of date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements
as a result of new information, future events, or other factors. Forward-looking statements are
inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our
expectations.

The following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may
adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance.
This information should be read in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) and
the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report.
The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we
believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. These factors could
cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical
trends.

A material change in consumer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our
business.

We are a consumer products company and rely on continued global demand for our brands and
products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers.
This is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to develop effective sales,
advertising and marketing programs in an increasingly fragmented media environment. We expect to
achieve our financial targets, in part, by shifting our portfolio towards faster growing, higher
margin businesses. If demand and growth rates fall substantially below expected levels or our
market share declines significantly in these businesses, our results could be negatively impacted.
This could occur due to unforeseen negative economic or political events or to changes in consumer
trends and habits. In addition, our continued success is dependent on leading-edge innovation,
with respect to both products and operations. This means we must be able to obtain patents that
lead to the development of products that appeal to our consumers across the world.

The ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can respond to our local
and global competitors.



Across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local
competitors. As a result, there are ongoing competitive product and pricing pressures in the
environments in which we operate, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins. To address
these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors, including
pricing, promotional incentives and trade terms, as well as technological advances and patents
granted to competition.

Our ability to successfully integrate key acquisitions, such as Gillette, could impact our business
results.

Since our goals include a growth component tied to acquisitions, we must be able to
successfully manage and integrate key acquisitions, such as the acquisition of The Gillette
Company. Specifically, we must be able to integrate acquisitions without any significant
disruption to our ability to manage and execute business plans on our base businesses. In
addition, our financial results could be adversely impacted if we are not able to deliver the
expected cost and growth synergies associated with our acquisitions.

Our businesses face cost pressures which could affect our business results.

Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw
materials, cost of labor, foreign exchange and interest rates. Our costs in 2008 were impacted by
higher commodity costs and this trend is likely to continue in 2009. Therefore, our success is
dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions,
cost savings projects (including outsourcing projects), sourcing decisions and certain hedging
transactions. In the manufacturing and general overhead areas, we need to maintain key
manufacturing and supply arrangements, including any key sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant
arrangements.

We face risks associated with significant international operations.

We conduct business across the globe with a significant portion of our sales outside the
United States. We expect to achieve our financial targets, in part, by achieving disproportionate
growth in developing regions. Should growth rates or our market share fall substantially below
expected levels in these regions, our results could be negatively impacted. In addition, economic
changes, terrorist activity and political unrest may result in business interruption, inflation,
deflation or decreased demand for our products. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability
to manage continued global political and/or economic uncertainty, especially in our significant
geographical markets, as well as any political or economic disruption due to terrorist and other
hostile activities.

Our business is subject to regulation in the U.S. and abroad.

Changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations may alter the environment in
which we do business. This includes changes in environmental, competitive and product-related
laws, as well as changes in accounting standards and taxation requirements. Accordingly, our
ability to manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including product liability, patent, and
intellectual property matters), and to resolve pending legal matters without significant
liability, including the competition law and antitrust investigations described in Part I, Item 3
of this Form
10-K, which could require the Company to take significant reserves or pay significant fines
during a reporting period, may materially impact our results.

If the reputation of one or more of our leading brands erodes significantly, it could have a
material impact on our financial results

.



Our Company’s financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands,
particularly our billion-dollar brands. The success of these brands can suffer if our marketing
plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand’s image or its ability to
attract consumers. Further, our Company’s results could be negatively impacted if one of our
leading brands suffers a substantial impediment to its reputation due to real or perceived quality
issues.

A material change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a
significant impact on our business.

Our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail
trade customers. This includes our ability to offer trade terms that are acceptable to our
customers and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. Our business could suffer if
we cannot reach agreement with a key customer based on our trade terms and principles. Further,
there is a continuing trend towards retail trade consolidation and this leads to more complex work
across broader geographic boundaries for both us and key retailers. This can be particularly
difficult when major customers are addressing local trade pressures or local law and regulation
changes. Further, our business would be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly
reduce the range or inventory level of our products.

Item 1B.

Unresolved Staff Comments.

None.

Item 2.

Properties.

In the United States, we own and operate 39 manufacturing facilities located in 23 different
states. In addition, we own and operate 103 manufacturing facilities in 42 other countries. Many
of the domestic and international facilities produce products for multiple businesses. Beauty
products are manufactured at 42 of these locations; Grooming products are manufactured at 13 of
these locations; Fabric Care and Home Care products at 49; Baby Care and Family Care products at
29; Pet Care, Snacks and Coffee products at 15; and Health Care products at 37. Management
believes that the Company’s production facilities are adequate to support the business efficiently
and that the properties and equipment have been well maintained.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings.

The Company is subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out
of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation,
product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental issues, patent and trademark matters, and
taxes.

Recently, the Company has become subject to a variety of investigations into potential
competition law violations in the European Union. In July 2006, French authorities, in connection
with an inquiry into potential competition law violations in France, entered the premises of two of
the Company’s French subsidiaries and seized a variety of documents. In April 2008, UK authorities
initiated an investigation concerning potential antitrust violations in the UK involving one of the
Company’s subsidiaries. In June 2008, European Commission officials, with the
assistance of the national authorities from a variety of countries, started an investigation into
potential competition law violations in a variety of countries across the European Union. At the
same time, the national authorities in Spain and Italy initiated additional investigations into
potential antitrust concerns within those countries. In connection with these investigations, a
number of the Company’s subsidiaries were visited and documents seized. The Company or its



subsidiaries are also involved in other competition law investigations in Belgium, Romania and
Greece. We believe that all of the above matters involve a number of other consumer products
companies and/or retail customers. The Company’s policy is to comply with all laws and
regulations, including all antitrust and competition laws.

Competition and antitrust law investigations often continue for several years and, if
violations are found, can result in substantial fines. At this point, no formal claims have been
made against the Company or any of our subsidiaries in connection with any of above inquiries.

During the fiscal year just ended, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries in Germany received a
formal complaint alleging violations of the antitrust laws. We are now discussing the situation
with the German authorities.

Although the Company cannot accurately predict what financial impact may ultimately result
from the totality of these matters, we have taken and will take reserves as appropriate. Please
refer to the Company’s Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Form 10-K for additional information.

The Procter & Gamble 1992 Stock Plan (Belgian Version)

No further grants can be made under the plan, although unexercised stock options previously
granted under this plan remain outstanding. This plan was approved by the Company’s Board of
Directors on February 14, 1997. Although the plan has not been submitted to shareholders for
approval, it is nearly identical to The Procter & Gamble 1992 Stock Plan, approved by the Company’s
shareholders on October 13, 1992, except for a few minor changes designed to comply with the
Belgian tax laws.

The plan was designed to attract, retain and motivate key Belgian employees. Under the plan,
eligible participants were: (i) granted or offered the right to purchase stock options, (ii)
granted stock appreciation rights and/or (iii) granted shares of the Company’s common stock.
Except in the case of death of the recipient, all stock options and stock appreciation rights must
vest in no less than one year from the date of grant and must expire no later than fifteen years
from the date of grant. The exercise price for all stock options granted under the plan is the
average price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant. If a recipient of a grant leaves
the Company while holding an unexercised option or right, any unexercisable portions immediately
become void, except in the case of death, and any exercisable portions become void within one month
of departure, except in the case of death or retirement. Any common stock awarded under the plan
may be subject to restrictions on sale or transfer while the recipient is employed, as the
committee administering the plan may determine.



The Procter & Gamble Future Shares Plan

On October 14, 1997, the Company’s Board of Directors approved The Procter & Gamble Future
Shares Plan pursuant to which options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock may be
granted to employees worldwide. The purpose of this plan is to advance the interests of the
Company by giving substantially all employees a stake in the Company’s future growth and success
and to strengthen the alignment of interests between employees and the Company’s shareholders
through increased ownership of shares of the Company’s stock. The plan has not been submitted to
shareholders for approval.

Subject to adjustment for changes in the Company’s capitalization, the number of shares to be
granted under the plan is not to exceed 17 million shares. Under the plan’s regulations,
recipients are granted options to acquire 100 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise
price equal to the average price of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant. These
options vest five years after the date of grant and expire ten years following the date of grant.
If a recipient leaves the employ of the Company prior to the vesting date for a reason other than
disability, retirement or special separation (as defined in the plan), then the award is forfeited.

At the time of the first grant following Board approval of the plan, each employee of the
Company not eligible for an award under the 1992 Stock Plan was granted options for 100 shares.
From the date of this first grant through June 30, 2003, each new employee of the Company has also
received options for 100 shares. Following the grant of options on June 30, 2003, the Company
suspended this part of the plan and intends to make no further grants under this part of the plan.
The plan terminated on October 13, 2007.

In addition to the grants above, annual grants of options for 100 shares are granted to
approximately 3,000 employees who are not eligible for participation in the 2001 Stock and
Incentive Compensation Plan in recognition of outstanding performance. The Company’s key managers
are not eligible for such grants.

The Gillette Company 1971 Stock Option Plan

No further grants can be made under the plan after April 25, 2005, although unexercised stock
options previously granted under this plan remain outstanding. The plan was approved by
shareholders of The Gillette Company and assumed by the Company upon the merger between The Procter
& Gamble Company and The Gillette Company. All options became immediately vested and exercisable on
October 1, 2005 as a result of the merger. After the merger, all outstanding options became options
to purchase shares of The Procter & Gamble Company subject to an exchange ratio of 0.975 shares of
P&G stock per share of Gillette stock.

The plan was designed to attract, retain and motivate key salaried employees of The Gillette
Company and non-employee members of its Board of Directors. Under the plan, eligible
participants receive the option to purchase Company stock at a pre-determined price which
cannot be less than 100% of the fair market value per share at the time that the option is granted.
The period of any option may not exceed ten years from the date of grant. Subject to adjustment for
changes in the Company’s capitalization, the number of shares granted under the plan was not to
exceed 198 million shares.



If a recipient leaves the employ of the Company for any reason other than death or discharge
for cause, the recipient is permitted to exercise any vested options granted under the plan for a period
between thirty days and five years after termination, depending on the circumstances of his/her
departure. If a participant is discharged for cause, all options are immediately cancelled. If a
participant dies while holding options, the options are exercisable for a period of one to three
years depending on the date of grant. In addition, the plan allows Gillette employees whose
employment is terminated for “Good Reason” within two years after the effective date of the merger
the ability to exercise remaining options for the shorter of five years following their termination
date or the original life of the grant. Employees terminated for “Good Reason” who are also
eligible to retire under a Company plan are allowed to exercise their options subject to the
original terms of the grant.

The Gillette Company 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan

Shareholders of The Gillette Company approved The Gillette Company 2004 Long Term Incentive
Plan on May 20, 2004, and the plan was assumed by the Company upon the merger between The Procter &
Gamble Company and The Gillette Company. All options became immediately vested and exercisable on
October 1, 2005 as a result of the merger. After the merger, all outstanding options became options
to purchase shares of The Procter & Gamble Company subject to an exchange ratio of 0.975 shares of
P&G stock per share of Gillette stock. Only employees previously employed by the Gillette Company
prior to October 1, 2005 are eligible to receive grants under this plan.

The plan was designed to attract, retain and motivate employees of The Gillette Company, and
until the effective date of the merger between The Gillette Company and The Procter & Gamble
Company, non-employee members of the Gillette Board of Directors. Under the plan, eligible
participants are: (i) granted or offered the right to purchase stock options, (ii) granted stock
appreciation rights and/or (iii) granted shares of the Company’s common stock or restricted stock
units (and dividend equivalents). Subject to adjustment for changes in the Company’s
capitalization and the addition of any shares authorized but not issued or redeemed under The
Gillette Company 1971 Stock Option Plan, the number of shares to be granted under the plan is not
to exceed 19 million shares.

Except in the case of death of the recipient, all stock options and stock appreciation rights
must expire no later than ten years from the date of grant. The exercise price for all stock
options granted under the plan must be equal to or greater than the fair market value of the
Company’s stock on the date of grant. Any common stock awarded under the plan may be subject to
restrictions on sale or transfer while the recipient is employed, as the committee administering
the plan may determine.

If a recipient of a grant leaves the Company while holding an unexercised option or right: (1)
any unexercisable portions immediately become void, except in the case of death, retirement,
special separation (as those terms are defined in the plan) or any grants as to which the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has waived the termination provisions; and
(2) any exercisable portions immediately become void, except in the case of death, retirement,
special separation, voluntary resignation that is not for Good Reason (as those terms are defined
in the plan) or any grants as to which the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has
waived the termination provisions. In addition, the plan allows Gillette employees whose
employment was terminated for “Good Reason” within two years of the effective date of the merger
the ability to exercise their options for the shorter of five years following their



termination
date or the original life of the grant. Employees terminated for “Good Reason” who are also
eligible to retire under a Company plan are allowed to exercise their options subject to the
original terms of the grant.
