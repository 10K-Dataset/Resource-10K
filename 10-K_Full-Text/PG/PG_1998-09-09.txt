Item 1.  Business.
         ---------
                         General Development of Business
                         -------------------------------

     The Procter & Gamble Company was incorporated in Ohio in 1905, having been
built from a business founded in 1837 by William Procter and James Gamble.
Today, the Company manufactures and markets a broad range of consumer products
in many countries throughout the world.

     Unless the context indicates otherwise, the term the "Company" as used
herein refers to The Procter & Gamble Company (the registrant) and its
subsidiaries.

     Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by
reference to the Letter to Shareholders, which appears on pages 1-3, New to the
World Brands on pages 4-5, and New to the Brand Innovations on pages 6-7 of the
Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998.

                  Financial Information About Industry Segments
                  ---------------------------------------------

     The Company's products fall into five business segments: Laundry and
Cleaning, Paper, Beauty Care, Food and Beverage, and Health Care.

     Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by
reference to Note 11 Segment Information of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, which appears on page 32, and Financial Review, which
appears on pages 9-17 of the Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1998.

                        Narrative Description of Business
                        ---------------------------------

     The Company's business, represented by the aggregate of its Laundry and
Cleaning, Paper, Beauty Care, Food and Beverage, and Health Care segments, is
essentially homogeneous. For the most part, the factors necessary for an
understanding of these five segments are essentially identical. The markets in
which the Company's products are sold are highly competitive. The products of
the Company's business segments compete with many large and small companies, and
there is no dominant competitor or competitors. Advertising is used in
conjunction with an extensive sales force because the Company believes this
combination provides the most efficient method of marketing these types of
products. Product quality, performance, value and packaging are also important
competitive factors. Most of the Company's products in each of its segments are
distributed through grocery stores and other retail outlets.

     The Laundry category and Diaper category constitute approximately 20% and
12% of consolidated fiscal 1998 sales, respectively. These categories
constituted approximately the same percentages of consolidated sales in the
preceding two fiscal years. The creation of new products and the development of
new performance benefits for consumers on the Company's existing products are
vital ingredients in its continuing progress in the highly competitive markets
in which it does business. Basic research and product development activities
continued to carry a high priority during the past fiscal year. While many of
the benefits from these efforts will not be realized until future years, the
Company believes these activities demonstrate its commitment to future growth.

     The Company has registered trademarks and owns or has licenses under
patents which are used in connection with its business in all segments. Some of
these patents or licenses cover significant product formulation and processing
of the Company's products. The trademarks of all major products in each segment
are registered. In part, the Company's success can be attributed to the
existence of these trademarks, patents and licenses.

     Most of the raw materials used by the Company are purchased from others.
Additionally, some raw materials, primarily chemicals, are produced by the
Company for further use in the manufacturing process. The Company purchases and
produces a substantial variety of raw materials, no one of which is material to
the Company's business taken as a whole.

     Expenditures in fiscal year 1998 for compliance with Federal, State and
local environmental laws and regulations were not materially different from such
expenditures in the prior year, and no material increase is expected in fiscal
year 1999.

     Operations outside the United States are generally characterized by the
same conditions discussed in the description of the business above and may also
be affected by additional elements including changing currency values and
different rates of inflation and economic growth. The effect of these additional
elements is less significant in the Food and Beverage segment than in the
Company's other business segments. In addition, several countries in Europe will
be converting their currencies to a common European currency, the euro. This
change and the cost of modification of business systems and processes, is not
expected to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations,
financial position or cash flows.

     The Company has approximately 110,000 employees.

     The Company provides an Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") which is
part of The Procter & Gamble Profit Sharing Trust and Employee Stock Ownership
Plan. Convertible preferred stock of the Company and other assets owned by the
ESOP are held through a trust (the "ESOP Trust"). The ESOP Trust has issued
certain debt securities to the public. The Company has guaranteed payment of
principal and interest on these debt securities. Holders of these debt
securities have no recourse against the assets of the ESOP Trust except with
respect to cash contributions made by the Company to the ESOP Trust, and
earnings attributable to such contributions. Such cash contributions are made by
the Company only to the extent that dividends on the convertible preferred stock
are inadequate to fund repayment of the debt securities. Any such contributions
and subsequent payments to holders are made on a same-day basis and such
contributions would therefore not be held by the ESOP Trust unless there was a
default in payment on the debt securities by the ESOP Trust after having
received such contributions from the Company. Such a default is not likely to
occur and therefore there is little likelihood that there would not be assets
available to satisfy the claims of any holders of the debt securities. A summary
description of the liabilities of the ESOP Trust and of the dividends paid by
the Company on the convertible preferred stock and cash payments from the
Company to the ESOP Trust for the three years ended June 30, 1998 are
incorporated by reference to Note 7 Postretirement Benefits and Note 8 Employee
Stock Ownership Plan, which appear on pages 29-31 of the Annual Report to
Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998.

Item 2.  Properties.
         -----------

     In the United States, the Company owns and operates manufacturing
facilities at 38 locations in 22 states. In addition, it owns and operates 97
manufacturing facilities in 46 other countries. Laundry and Cleaning products
are produced at 44 of these locations; Paper products at 51; Health Care
products at 26; Beauty Care products at 45; and Food and Beverage products at
19. Management believes that the Company's production facilities are adequate to
support the business efficiently and that the properties and equipment have been
well maintained.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings.
         ------------------

     The Company is involved in clean-up efforts at off-site Superfund
locations, many of which are in the preliminary stages of investigation. The
amount accrued at June 30, 1998 representing the Company's probable future costs
that can be reasonably estimated was $8 million.

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
         Results of Operations
         ---------------------------------------------------------------

     The information required by this item is incorporated by reference to
Financial Review, which appears on pages 9-17, Note 10 Commitments and
Contingencies, which appears on page 31, and Note 11 Segment Information, which
appears on page 32 of the Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1998, and supplemented by the press release dated September 9,
1998 included as Exhibit 20. The Company has made certain forward-looking
statements in the Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June
30, 1998, and has and will make such statements in other contexts, relating to
volume growth, increases in market shares, Year 2000 compliance, financial goals
and cost reduction, among others. These forward-looking statements represent
challenging goals for the Company and are based on certain assumptions and
estimates regarding the worldwide economy, technological innovation, competitive
activity, pricing, currency movements, product introductions, governmental
action and the development of certain markets. Among the key factors necessary
to achieve the Company's goals are: (1) the achievement of lower costs and
increases in reliability and capacity utilization, resulting from simplification
and standardization; (2) the ability to improve results despite high levels of
competitive activity and the economic downturn in Asia; (3) the successful
implementation of ECR and the ability to maintain key customer relationships in
important developed markets; (4) the continuation of substantial growth in
significant developing markets such as China, Mexico, Brazil and the countries
of Central and Eastern Europe; (5) obtaining successful outcomes in regulatory,
tax and legal matters; (6) the ability to continue technological innovation; and
(7) the timely resolution of the Year 2000 issue by the Company and its
customers and suppliers. If the Company's assumptions and estimates are
incorrect or do not come to fruition, or if the Company does not achieve all of
these key factors, then the Company's actual performance could vary materially
from the forward-looking statements made herein.
