PART I

Item 1.

Business.

General Development of Business

The Procter & Gamble Company was incorporated in Ohio in 1905, having been
built from a business founded in 1837 by William Procter and James Gamble.
Today, the Company manufactures and markets a broad range of consumer products
in many countries throughout the world.

Unless the context indicates otherwise, the term the “Company” as used
herein refers to The Procter & Gamble Company (the registrant) and its
subsidiaries.

In 1999, the Company announced its intention to transition from its
previous geographic-based structure to a product-based global business unit
structure. Concurrent with that change, the Company initiated its Organization
2005 restructuring program, a discussion of which is incorporated herein by
reference to Note 2, Restructuring Program, which appears on pages 27-28 of the
Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001.
Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by
reference to the Letter to Shareholders, which appears on pages 1-3 of the
Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001.

Financial Information About Industry Segments

The Company’s products fall into five business segments: fabric and home
care, paper, beauty care, health care, and food and beverage.

Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by
reference to Note 12, Segment Information, of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, which appears on page 34, and Financial Review, which
appears on pages 10-19 of the Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2001.

Narrative Description of Business

The Company’s business, represented by the aggregate of its fabric and
home care, paper, beauty care, health care, and food and beverage segments, is
essentially homogeneous. Many of the factors necessary for an understanding of
these five segments are essentially identical. The markets in which the
Company’s products are sold are highly competitive. The products of the
Company’s business segments compete with many large and small companies, and
there is no dominant competitor or competitors. Advertising is used in
conjunction with an extensive sales force because the Company believes this
combination provides the most efficient method of marketing these types of
products. Product quality, performance, value and packaging are also important
competitive factors. Most of the Company’s products in each of its segments
are distributed through food, drug, mass and other retail outlets.



The laundry and diaper categories constitute approximately 20% and 12% of
consolidated fiscal 2001 sales, respectively. These results are comparable to
the year before. The creation of new products and the development of new
performance benefits for consumers on the Company’s existing products are vital
ingredients in its continuing progress in the highly competitive markets in
which it does business. Basic research and product development activities
continued to carry a high priority during the past fiscal year. While many of
the benefits from these efforts will not be realized until future years, the
Company believes these activities demonstrate its commitment to future growth.

The Company has registered trademarks and owns or has licenses under
patents which are used in connection with its business in all segments. Some
of these patents or licenses cover significant product formulation and
processing of the Company’s products. The trademarks of all major products in
each segment are registered. In part, the Company’s success can be attributed
to the existence of these trademarks, patents and licenses.

Most of the raw materials used by the Company are purchased from others.
Additionally, some raw materials, primarily chemicals, are produced by the
Company for further use in the manufacturing process. The Company purchases
and produces a substantial variety of raw materials, no one of which is
material to the Company’s business taken as a whole.

Expenditures in fiscal year 2001 for compliance with federal, state and
local environmental laws and regulations were not materially different from
such expenditures in the prior year, and no material increase is expected in
fiscal year 2002.

Operations outside the United States are generally characterized by the
same conditions discussed in the description of the business above and may also
be affected by additional elements including changing currency values and
different rates of inflation and economic growth.

The Company has approximately 106,000 employees. The decline of
approximately 4,000 employees versus the prior year is primarily due to the
Company’s restructuring program.

Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by
reference to Note 12, Segment Information, which appears on page 34; Financial
Summary, which appears on page 35; and Financial Review, which appears on pages
10-19 of the Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30,
2001.

Item 2.

Properties.

In the United States, the Company owns and operates 40 manufacturing
facilities and leases and operates 2 manufacturing facilities. These
facilities are located in 23 different states. In addition, the Company owns
and operates 92 manufacturing facilities in 45 other countries. Fabric and
home care products are produced at 47 of these locations; paper products at 50;
health care products at 27; beauty care products at 34; and food and beverage
products at 15. Management believes that the Company’s production facilities
are adequate to support the business efficiently and that the properties and
equipment have been well maintained.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings.

The Company is involved in clean-up efforts at off-site Superfund locations,
many of which are in the preliminary stages of investigation. The amount
accrued at the end of June 30, 2001 representing the Company’s probable future
costs that can be reasonably estimated was $6 million.

On June 8, 2001, the Company announced it had reached an agreement in principle
to settle a lawsuit alleging damages under the U.S. Securities laws relating to
our March 7, 2000 and June 8, 2000 earnings releases. If approved by the

Item 6.

Selected Financial Data

The information required by this item is incorporated by reference to

Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The information required by this item is incorporated by reference to
Financial Review, which appears on pages 10-19; Note 2, Restructuring Program,
which appears on pages 27-28; Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies, which
appears on page 33; Note 12, Segment Information, which appears on page 34 of
the Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001; and
the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K dated August 15, 2001.

The Company has made and will make certain forward-looking statements in
the Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001 and
in other contexts relating to volume growth, increases in market shares,
Organization 2005, financial goals and cost reduction, among others.

These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions and estimates
regarding competitive activity, pricing, product introductions, economic
conditions, technological innovation, currency movements, governmental action
and the development of certain markets. Among the key factors necessary to
achieve the Company’s goals are: (1) the successful execution of Organization
2005 within the Company’s planned timing, including achievement of expected
cost and tax savings and successful management of organizational and work
process restructuring; (2) the ability to achieve business plans, including
volume growth and pricing plans, despite high levels of competitive activity,
especially with respect to the product categories and geographical markets in
which the Company has chosen to focus; (3) the ability to maintain key customer
relationships; (4) the achievement of growth in significant developing markets
such as China, Korea, Mexico, the Southern Cone of Latin America and the
countries of Central and Eastern Europe; (5) the ability to successfully manage
regulatory, tax and legal matters, including resolution of pending matters
within current estimates; (6) the successful and timely execution of planned
brand divestitures; (7) the ability to successfully implement cost improvement
plans in manufacturing and overhead areas; (8) the timely execution of
definitive agreements and the receipt of timely and successful regulatory
clearances with respect to a potential transaction with The Coca-Cola Company;
(9) the timely and successful receipt of regulatory clearances and subsequent
successful integration of the Clairol business; and (10) the ability to
successfully manage currency, interest rate and certain commodity cost
exposures. If the Company’s assumptions and estimates are incorrect or do not
come to fruition, or if the Company does not achieve all of these key factors,
then the Company’s actual performance could vary materially from the
forward-looking statements made herein.
