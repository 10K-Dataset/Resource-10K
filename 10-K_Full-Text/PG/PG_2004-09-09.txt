PART I

Item 1.

Business.

Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by
reference to Management’s Discussion and Analysis, which appears on pages
29-43; Note 3, Acquisitions and Spin-Off, which appears on pages 52-54; Note 5,
Supplemental Financial Information, which appears on page 55; and Note 12,
Segment Information, which appears on pages 65-66 of the Annual Report to
Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004.

The Procter & Gamble Company is focused on providing branded products of
superior quality and value to improve the lives of the world’s consumers. The
Company was incorporated in Ohio in 1905, having been built from a business
founded in 1837 by William Procter and James Gamble. Today, we market over 300
branded products in more than 160 countries. Unless the context indicates
otherwise, the terms the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us” as used herein refers
to The Procter & Gamble Company (the registrant) and its subsidiaries.

The Company manages its business in five product segments: Fabric and Home
Care; Baby and Family Care; Beauty Care; Health Care; and Snacks and Beverages.
None of these segments is highly seasonal. Many of the factors necessary for an
understanding of these five segments are similar. Operating margins of the
individual segments vary slightly due to nature of the materials and processes
used to manufacture the products, the capital intensity of the businesses and
differences in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net
sales. Net sales growth by segment is also expected to vary slightly due to
the underlying growth of the markets of each segments’ products. For example,
we expect the Beauty Care and Health Care segments to provide a
disproportionate percentage of overall Company net sales growth, as the market
for these products is expected to grow at a higher rate than the remaining
segments.

The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive. The
products of the Company’s business segments compete with products of many large
and small companies, including well-known global competitors. We market our
products with advertising, promotions and other vehicles to build awareness of
our brands in conjunction with an extensive sales force. We believe this
combination provides the most efficient method of marketing for these types of
products. Product quality, performance, value and packaging are also important
competitive factors.

Throughout this Form 10-K, we incorporate by reference information from
other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The Company’s annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q
and current reports on Form 8-K are filed electronically with the SEC. The SEC
maintains an internet site that contains these reports at:

http://www.sec.gov.

Narrative Description of Business

Business Model.

Our business model relies on the continued growth and
success of existing brands and products and the creation of new products. The
markets and industry segments in which we offer our products are highly
competitive. We work collaboratively with our customers to improve the in-store
presence of our products and win the “first moment of truth” – when a consumer
is shopping in the store. We must also win the “second moment of truth” – when
a consumer uses the product, evaluates how well it met his or her expectations
and whether it was a good value. We believe we must continue to provide new,
innovative products and branding to the consumer in order to grow our business.
Basic research and product development activities, designed to enable sustained
organic growth, continued to carry a high priority during the past fiscal year.
While many of the benefits from these efforts will not be realized until future
years, the Company believes these activities demonstrate its commitment to
future growth.

Key Product Categories.

We currently have three product categories that
each account for 10% or more of consolidated net sales. The laundry category
constituted approximately 18% of net sales for fiscal year 2004, compared to
19% in 2003 and 19% in 2002. The diaper category represents approximately 11%
of consolidated sales in 2004, compared to 12% in 2003 and 2002. The retail
hair care category accounted for approximately 11% of fiscal year 2004 net
sales, up from just over 9% in 2003 and 2002. The increase in hair care
category sales is due, in part, to the addition of Wella AG (Wella).

Key Customers.

Our customers include mass merchandisers, grocery stores,
membership club stores and drug stores. Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its
affiliates represent approximately 17% of our total revenue, compared to 18% in
2003 and 17% in 2002. No other customer represents more than 10% of our net
sales. Our top ten customers account for approximately 33% of total unit
volume, compared to 33% in 2003 and 35% in 2002. The nature of our business
results in no material backlog orders or contracts with the government. We
believe our practices related to working capital items for customers and
suppliers are consistent with the industry segments in which we compete.

Sources and Availability of Materials.

Almost all of the raw and packaging
materials used by the Company are purchased from others, some of whom are
single-source suppliers. Some raw materials, primarily chemicals, are produced
by the Company for further use in the manufacturing process. In addition, fuel
and natural gas are important commodities used in our plants and in the trucks
used to deliver our products to customers. The prices we pay for materials and
other commodities are subject to fluctuation. When prices for these items
change, we may or may not pass on the change to our customers depending on the
magnitude and expected duration of the change. We have, however, recently
announced price increases in some categories, including tissue, coffee and pet
health and nutrition, to recover increases in commodity costs. The Company
purchases and produces a substantial variety of raw and packaging materials, no
one of which is material to the Company’s business taken as a whole.

Trademarks and Patents.

We own or have licenses under patents and
registered trademarks which are used in connection with our business in all
segments. Some of these patents or licenses cover significant product
formulation and processing of the Company’s
products. The trademarks of all major products in each segment are
registered. In part, the



Company’s success can be attributed to the existence
and continued protection of these trademarks, patents and licenses.

Expenditures for Environmental Compliance.

Expenditures for compliance
with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are fairly
consistent from year to year and are not material to the Company. No material
change is expected in fiscal year 2005.

Employees.

The Company has approximately 110,000 employees. The increase
of approximately 12,000 employees versus the prior year is primarily related to
the addition of Wella.

Financial Information About Foreign and Domestic Operations

Net sales in the United States account for approximately 46% of total net
sales. No other individual country had net sales exceeding 10% of total net
sales. Operations outside the United States are generally characterized by the
same conditions discussed in the description of the business above and may also
be affected by additional factors including changing currency values, different
rates of inflation, economic growth and political and economic uncertainties
and disruptions. Company sales by geography for the fiscal years ended June 30
were as follows:

Development of the Business

The discussion below provides insight to the general development of our
business, including the material acquisitions and disposition of assets over
the past five years.

Wella.

In March 2003, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire a
controlling interest in Wella from the majority shareholders. In September
2003, we completed this purchase of the shares of Wella for EUR 3.16 billion
(approximately $3.42 billion based on exchange rates on that date).
Additionally, in September 2003, we purchased shares secured
through a tender offer to remaining shareholders for EUR 1.49 billion
(approximately $1.67



billion based on exchange rates on that date). As a result
of these purchases, the Company acquired approximately 81% of the outstanding
Wella shares (99% of the voting class shares and 45% of the preference shares).

In June 2004, the Company and Wella entered into a Domination and Profit
Transfer Agreement (the Domination Agreement). Under the Domination Agreement,
we are entitled to exercise full operating control and receive 100% of the
future earnings of Wella. As consideration for the Domination Agreement, we
will pay the holders of the remaining outstanding shares of Wella a guaranteed
annual dividend payment. Alternatively, the remaining Wella shareholders may
elect to tender their shares to the Company for an agreed price. The fair
value of the total guaranteed annual dividend payments is $1.11 billion, which
is the approximate cost if all remaining shares were tendered.

The acquisition of Wella was financed by a mixture of available cash
balances and debt. Wella is a leading beauty care company selling its products
in more than 150 countries, focused on professional hair care, retail hair care
and cosmetics and fragrances.

Hutchison

. In June 2004, we purchased the remaining 20% stake of our
China venture from our partner, Hutchison Whampoa China Ltd. (Hutchison),
giving the Company full ownership of our operations in China. The net purchase
price was $1.85 billion, which is the purchase price of $2.00 billion net of
minority interest and certain obligations that were eliminated as a result of
the transaction. The acquisition was funded by debt.

Jif/Crisco.

During May 2002, we completed the spin-off of the Jif peanut
butter and Crisco shortening brands to the Company’s shareholders and their
subsequent merger into The J.M. Smucker Company.

Clairol.

In November 2001, we completed the acquisition of the Clairol
business from The Bristol-Myers Squibb Company.

Restructuring Program.

In 1999, the Company announced its intention to
transition from its previous geographic-based structure to a product-based
global business unit structure. Concurrent with that change, we initiated a
multi-year restructuring program, a discussion of which is incorporated herein
by reference to Note 2, Restructuring Program, which appears on page 52 of the
Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004.

Item 2.

Properties.

In the United States, the Company owns and operates 37 manufacturing
facilities located in 21 different states. In addition, the Company owns and
operates 99 manufacturing facilities in 42 other countries. Many of the
domestic and international facilities produce products for multiple business
segments. Fabric and Home Care products are produced at 43 of these locations;
Baby and Family Care products at 31; Health Care products at 22; Beauty Care
products at 64; and Snacks and Beverages products at 11. Management believes
that the Company’s production facilities are adequate to support the business
efficiently and that the properties and equipment have been well maintained.



Item 3.

Legal Proceedings.

The Company is involved in clean-up efforts at off-site Superfund
locations, many of which are in the preliminary stages of investigation. The
amount accrued at the end of June 30, 2004, representing the Company’s probable
future costs that can be reasonably estimated, was $8 million.

The Company is also involved in certain other environmental proceedings.
No such proceeding is expected to result in material monetary or other
sanctions being imposed by any governmental entity, or in other material
liabilities. In 2003 and thereafter, The Folger Coffee Company, a subsidiary
of the Company, voluntarily contacted the Louisiana Department of Environmental
Quality (LDEQ) concerning compliance with certain air emission permit
requirements at its New Orleans coffee processing plant. As a result of these
self-disclosures, the subsidiary expects to receive from the LDEQ an
Administrative Order on Consent and anticipates negotiating an agreed penalty
with the agency to resolve these issues. No judicial proceeding is pending.
The Company’s liability is estimated not to exceed $260,000.

All share repurchases were made in open-market transactions. None of these transactions were made pursuant to
a publicly announced repurchase plan. This table excludes shares withheld from employees to satisfy minimum tax
withholding requirements on option exercises and other equity-based transactions. The Company administers
employee cashless exercises through an independent, third party broker and does not repurchase stock in
connection with cashless exercises.

(2)

Average price paid per share is calculated on a settlement basis and excludes commission.

(3)

No share repurchases were made pursuant to a publicly announced plan or program. The Company’s strategy for
cash flow utilization is to pay dividends first and then repurchase Company common stock to cover option
exercises made pursuant to the Company’s stock option programs. The remaining cash is then available for
strategic acquisitions and discretionary repurchase of the Company’s common stock.

The Company has made certain forward-looking statements in the Annual
Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004 and in other
contexts relating to volume and net sales growth, increases in market shares,
financial goals and cost reduction, among others.

Controls and Procedures.

The Company’s Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive, A.G.
Lafley, and the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, Clayton C. Daley, Jr., have
evaluated the Company’s internal control and disclosure control systems as of
the end of the period covered by this report.

Messrs. Lafley and Daley have concluded that the Company’s disclosure
control systems are functioning effectively to provide reasonable assurance
that the Company can meet its disclosure obligations. The Company’s disclosure
control system is based upon a global chain of financial, staff and general
business reporting lines that converge in the worldwide headquarters of the
Company in Cincinnati, Ohio. The reporting process is designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits with the Commission is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms.
Consistent with SEC suggestion, the Company has formed a Disclosure Committee
consisting of key Company personnel designed to review the accuracy and
completeness of all disclosures made by the Company.

In connection with the evaluation described above, no changes in the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting occurred during the
Company’s fourth fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting.

The Procter & Gamble 1992 Stock Plan (Belgian Version)

Effective February 14, 1997, the Company’s Board of Directors approved The
Procter & Gamble 1992 Stock Plan (Belgian Version). Although the plan has not
been submitted to shareholders for approval, the plan is nearly identical to
The Procter & Gamble 1992 Stock Plan, approved by the Company’s shareholders on
October 13, 1992, except for a few minor changes designed to comply with the
Belgian tax laws. Although no further grants can be made under the plan,
unexercised stock options previously granted under this plan remain
outstanding.

The plan is a stock incentive plan designed to attract, retain and
motivate key Belgian employees. Under the plan, eligible participants may be
granted or offered the right to purchase stock options, may be granted stock
appreciation rights and/or may be granted shares of the Company’s common stock.
Except in the case of death of the recipient, all stock options and stock
appreciation rights must vest in no less than one year from the date of grant
and must expire no later than fifteen years from the date of grant. The
exercise price for all stock options granted under the plan is the average
price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant. If a recipient of a grant
leaves the Company while holding an unexercised option or right, any
unexercisable portions immediately become void, except in the case of death,
and any exercisable portions become void within one month of departure, except
in the case of death or retirement. Any common stock awarded under the plan
may be subject to restrictions on sale or transfer while the recipient is
employed, as the committee administering the plan may determine.

The Procter & Gamble Future Shares Plan

On October 14, 1997, the Company’s Board of Directors approved The Procter
& Gamble Future Shares Plan pursuant to which options to purchase shares of the
Company’s common stock may be granted to employees worldwide. The purpose of
this plan is to advance the interests of the Company by giving substantially
all employees a stake in the Company’s future growth and success and to
strengthen the alignment of interests between employees and the Company’s
shareholders through increased ownership of shares of the Company’s stock. The
plan has not been submitted to shareholders for approval.

Subject to adjustment for changes in the Company’s capitalization, the
number of shares to be granted under the plan is not to exceed 17 million
shares. Under the plan’s regulations, recipients are granted options to
acquire 100 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price equal to
the average price of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant.
These options vest five years after the date of grant and expire ten years
following the date of grant. If a recipient leaves the employ of the Company
prior to the vesting date for a reason other than disability, retirement or
special separation (as defined in the plan), then the award is forfeited.

At the time of the first grant following approval of the plan, each
employee of the Company not eligible for an award under the 1992 Stock Plan was
granted options for 100 shares. Since the date of the first grant, each new
employee of the Company has also received options for 100 shares. Following the
grant of options on June 30, 2003, the Company suspended this part of the plan
and intends to make no further grants under this part of the plan.



In addition to the grants above, annual grants of options for 100 shares
are granted to approximately 2,000 employees who are not eligible for
participation in the 2001 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan in recognition
of outstanding performance.
