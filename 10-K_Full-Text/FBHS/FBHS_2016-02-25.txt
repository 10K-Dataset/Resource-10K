Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain “forward-looking statements” made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), regarding business strategies, market potential, future financial
performance and other matters. Statements that include the words “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “projects,” “estimates,” “plans” and similar expressions or
future or conditional verbs such as “will,” “should,” “would,” “may” and “could” are generally forward-looking in nature and not historical facts. Where, in any forward-looking statement, we express
an expectation or belief as to future results or events, such expectation or belief is based on the current plans and expectations at the time this report is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) or, with respect to
any documents incorporated by reference, available at the time such document was prepared or filed with the SEC. Although we believe that these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, they are subject to numerous factors, risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to be materially different from those indicated in such statements. These factors include those listed in the section below entitled “Risk Factors.” Except as required by law, we
undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events, new information or changes to future results over time or otherwise.

Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to (i) “Fortune Brands,” the “Company,”
“we,” “our” or “us” refer to Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, after giving effect to the spin-off of Fortune Brands from Fortune Brands, Inc. in 2011 and

Our Company

We are a leading home and security products company that competes in attractive long-term growth markets in our product categories. With a foundation of market-leading brands across a diversified mix of channels,
and lean and flexible supply chains, as well as a tradition of strong product innovation and customer service, we are focused on outperforming our markets in both growth and returns, and driving increased shareholder value. We sell our products
through a wide array of sales channels, including kitchen and bath dealers, wholesalers oriented toward builders or professional remodelers, industrial and locksmith distributors, “do-it-yourself” remodeling-oriented home centers and other
retail outlets. We believe the Company’s impressive track record reflects the long-term attractiveness and potential of our categories and our leading brands. Our performance since becoming an independent publicly traded company demonstrates
the strength of our operating model and our ability to generate profitable growth as sales volume increases and we leverage our structural competitive advantages to gain share in our categories.

Our Strategy

Build on leading business and brand
positions in attractive growth and return categories.

We believe that we have leading market positions and brands in many of our product categories. We continue to invest in targeted advertising and other strategic
initiatives aimed at enhancing brand awareness and educating consumers regarding the breadth, features and benefits of our product lines. We also strive to leverage our brands by expanding into adjacent product categories and continue to develop new
programs through working closely with our customers.



Continue to develop innovative products for customers, designers, installers and
consumers

.

Sustained investments in consumer-driven product innovation and customer service, along with our lower cost structures, have contributed to our success in winning in the marketplace and creating
consumer demand. MasterBrand Cabinets continues to provide cabinetry solutions for the home, ranging from kitchens, bathroom vanities, to home offices. Norcraft Companies, Inc. (“Norcraft”), acquired in May 2015, strengthens our overall
product offering, deepens our access to the dealer channel, expands our regional market presence and enhances our frameless cabinetry capabilities. In 2015, MasterBrand Cabinets launched innovative new cabinet door designs, color palettes and
features in a range of styles that allows consumers to create a custom kitchen look at an affordable price and introduced new, exclusive laminate door & finish options across multiple price segments. We continue to provide channel support
with a responsive website featuring our cabinet brands in one convenient location that drives leads to our dealerships. Moen’s track record of continued innovation includes hand showers featuring the Magnetix magnetic docking system, a powerful
new line of garbage disposals, the market-leading Spot Resist finish, our touchless Motionsense electronic faucets and our pull-out and pull-down faucets with Reflex self-retraction. The Therma-Tru portfolio of on-trend door and glass collections
continued to advance to meet current and emerging architectural design trends including wider and taller door styles, with its contemporary Pulse line of doors, as well as additional decorative, privacy and textured glass designs. In addition,
Therma-Tru launched its Doorway App, an innovative app allowing homeowners to customize and visualize Therma-Tru doors on their own homes. Master Lock continues to be a leader in innovative security products and services, such as its Bluetooth
enabled padlocks and Professional Lockout Services, a group of experts providing customized procedures and training for lockout programs. John D. Brush & Co., Inc. (“SentrySafe”), acquired in July 2014, continues to provide
quality and innovative fire-resistant safes that secure consumers’ property and important documents.

Expand in international
markets

.

We expect to have opportunities to expand sales by further penetrating international markets, which represented approximately 15% of net sales in 2015. In 2015, Moen opened a manufacturing facility in
China as part of our continued international expansion. In Cabinets, Kitchen Craft remained a leading cabinetry brand in Canada in 2015, while WoodCrafters provides a presence in Mexico. Master Lock continued to expand its presence in Europe and
Asia, while Therma-Tru has made inroads in Canada as consumers transition from traditional entry door materials to more advanced and energy-efficient fiberglass doors.

Leverage our global supply chains

.

We are using lean manufacturing, design-to-manufacture and distributive assembly techniques to make our supply chains more flexible and
improve supply chain quality, cost, response times and asset efficiency. We view our supply chains as a strategic asset not only to support strong operating leverage as volumes increase, but also to enable the profitable growth of new products,
adjacent market expansion and international growth.

Enhance returns and deploy our cash flow to high-return
opportunities

.

We continue to believe our most attractive opportunities are to invest in profitable organic growth initiatives, pursue accretive strategic acquisitions and joint ventures, and return cash to
shareholders through a combination of dividends and repurchases of shares of our common stock under our share repurchase programs. Both add-on acquisitions and share repurchase opportunities may be particularly attractive in the next few years. In
2015, we took a number of steps to position ourselves for the future including purchasing Norcraft, pricing a $900 million bond issuance, further integrating our SentrySafe business, investing in capacity, and strategically repurchasing our shares.



Our Competitive Strengths

We believe our competitive strengths include the following:

Leading
brands

.

We have leading brands in many of our product categories. We believe that established brands are meaningful to both consumers and trade customers in their respective categories and that we have
the opportunity to, among other things, continue to expand many of our brands into adjacent product categories and international markets.

Strategic focus on attractive consumer-facing categories

.

We believe we operate in categories
that, while very competitive, are among the more attractive categories in the home products and security products markets. Some of the key characteristics that make these categories attractive in our view include the following:

>

product quality, innovation, fashion, finish, durability and functionality, which are key determinants of product selection in addition to price;

>

established brands, which are meaningful to both consumers and trade customers;

>

the opportunity to add value to a complex consumer purchasing decision with excellent service propositions, reliability of products, ease of installation and
superior delivery lead times;

>

the value our products add to a home, particularly with kitchen and bath remodeling and additions, and the curb appeal offered by stylish entry door systems;

>

favorable long-term trends in household formations that benefit the outlook for our markets over time;

>

the relatively stable demand for plumbing and security products; and

>

the opportunity to expand into adjacent categories.

Operational excellence

.

We believe our investments in lean manufacturing and productivity initiatives have resulted in supply chain flexibility and the ability to
cost-effectively add capacity in order to match demand levels. In 2015 and 2014, we invested in incremental capacity to support long-term growth potential. In addition, our supply chains and lower cost structures have created favorable operating
leverage as volumes grow without sacrificing customer service levels. We believe that margin improvement will continue to be driven predominantly by organic volume growth that can be readily accommodated by additional production shifts and equipment
as necessary.

Commitment to innovation

.

We have a long track record of successful product and
process innovations that introduce valued new products and services to our customers and consumers. We are committed to continuing to invest in new product development and enhance customer service to strengthen our leading brands and penetrate
adjacent markets.

Diverse sales end-use mix

.

We sell in a variety of product categories in the U.S.
home and security products markets. In addition, our exposure to changing levels of U.S. residential new home construction activity is balanced with repair-and-remodel activity, which comprises a substantial majority of the overall U.S. home
products market and about two-thirds of our U.S. home products sales. We also benefit from a stable market for plumbing and security products and international sales growth opportunities.

Diverse sales channels

.

We sell through a wide array of sales channels, including kitchen and bath dealers, wholesalers oriented to builders or professional
remodelers, industrial and locksmith distributors, “do-it-yourself” remodeling-oriented home centers and other retail outlets. We also sell security products to locksmiths, industrial distributors and mass merchants. We are able to
leverage existing sales channels to expand into adjacent product categories. In 2015, sales to our top ten customers represented less than half of total sales.



Decentralized business model

.

Our business segments are focused on
distinct product categories and are responsible for their own performance. This structure enables each of our segments to independently best position itself within each category in which it competes and reinforces strong accountability for
operational and financial performance. Each of our segments focus on its unique set of consumers, customers, competitors and suppliers, while also sharing best practices.

Strong capital structure.

We exited 2015 with a strong balance sheet, even as we completed the $648.6 million acquisition of Norcraft and repurchased $51.7 million of our shares
in 2015. In June 2015, we issued $900 million of unsecured senior notes (“Senior Notes”) in a public offering. As of December 31, 2015, we had $238.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and total debt was $1,172.4 million, resulting
in a net debt position of $933.9 million. In addition, we had $975 million available under our credit facilities as of December 31, 2015.

Business Segments

We have four business segments:
Cabinets, Plumbing, Doors and Security. The following table shows net sales for each of these segments, including key brands within each segment:

(a)

Thomasville is a registered trademark of Hhg Global Designs LLC

Our segments compete on the basis of innovation, fashion, quality, price, service and responsiveness to distributor, retailer and installer needs, as well as end-user consumer preferences. Our markets are very
competitive. Approximately 15% of 2015 net sales were to international markets, and sales to two of the Company’s customers, The Home Depot, Inc. (“The Home Depot”) and Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (“Lowe’s”), each
accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s net sales in 2015. Sales to all U.S. home centers in the aggregate were approximately 30% of net sales in 2015.

Cabinets.

Our Cabinets segment manufactures custom, semi-custom and stock cabinetry, as well as vanities, for the kitchen, bath and other parts of the home through a regional
supply chain footprint to deliver high quality and service to our customers. This segment sells a portfolio of brands that enables our customers to differentiate themselves against competitors. This portfolio includes brand names such as
Aristokraft, Diamond, Kitchen Craft, Mid-Continent, Kitchen Classics, Schrock, Omega, Thomasville, Homecrest, Ultracraft and StarMark. Substantially all of this segment’s sales are in North America. This segment sells directly to kitchen and
bath dealers, home centers, wholesalers and large builders. In aggregate, sales to The Home Depot and Lowe’s comprised approximately 35% of net sales of the Cabinets segment in 2015. This segment’s competitors include Masco, American
Woodmark and RSI, as well as a large number of regional and local suppliers.



Plumbing.

Our Plumbing segment manufactures or assembles and sells faucets,
accessories, kitchen sinks and waste disposals in North America and China, predominantly under the Moen and Waste King brands. Although this segment sells products principally in the U.S., Canada and China, this segment also sells in Mexico,
Southeast Asia and South America. Approximately 23% of 2015 net sales were to international markets. This segment sells directly through its own sales force and indirectly through independent manufacturers’ representatives, primarily to
wholesalers, home centers, mass merchandisers and industrial distributors. In aggregate, sales to The Home Depot and Lowe’s comprised approximately 26% of net sales of the Plumbing segment in 2015. This segment’s chief competitors include
Delta (owned by Masco), Kohler, Pfister (owned by Spectrum Brands), American Standard (owned by LIXIL Group), InSinkErator (owned by Emerson Electronic Company) and imported private-label brands.

Doors.

Our Doors segment manufactures and sells fiberglass and steel entry door systems under the Therma-Tru brand and
urethane millwork product lines under the Fypon brand. This segment benefits from the long-term trend away from traditional materials, such as wood, steel and aluminum, toward more energy-efficient and durable synthetic materials. Therma-Tru
products include fiberglass and steel residential entry door and patio door systems, primarily for sale in the U.S. and Canada. This segment’s principal customers are home centers, millwork building products and wholesale distributors, and
specialty dealers that provide products to the residential new construction market, as well as to the remodeling and renovation markets. In aggregate, sales to The Home Depot and Lowe’s comprised approximately 11% of net sales of the Doors
segment in 2015. This segment’s competitors include Masonite, JELD-WEN, Plastpro and Pella.

Security.

Our
Security segment’s products consist of locks, safety and security devices, and electronic security products manufactured, sourced and distributed under the Master Lock brand and fire resistant safes, security containers and commercial cabinets
manufactured, sourced and distributed under the SentrySafe brand. This segment sells products principally in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Central America and Australia. Approximately 25% of 2015 net sales were to international markets. This segment
manufactures and sells key-controlled and combination padlocks, bicycle and cable locks, built-in locker locks, door hardware, automotive, trailer and towing locks, electronic access control solutions, and other specialty safety and security devices
for consumer use to hardware, home center and other retail outlets. In addition, the segment sells lock systems to locksmiths, industrial and institutional users, and original equipment manufacturers. In aggregate, sales to The Home Depot and
Lowe’s comprised approximately 17% of the net sales of the Security segment in 2015. Master Lock competes with Abus, W.H. Brady, Hampton, Kwikset (owned by Spectrum Brands), Schlage (owned by Allegion), Assa Abloy and various imports, and
SentrySafe competes with First Alert, Magnum, Fortress, Stack-On and Fire King.

Annual net sales for each of the last three fiscal years for each of
our business segments were as follows:

For additional financial information for each of our business segments, refer to Note 18, “Information on Business
Segments,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



Other Information

Raw materials.

The table below indicates the principal raw materials used by each of our segments. These materials are available from a number of sources. Volatility in the
prices of commodities and energy used in making and distributing our products impacts the cost of manufacturing our products.

Intellectual property.

Product innovation and branding are important to the success of our
business. In addition to the brand protection offered by our trademarks, patent protection helps distinguish our unique product features in the market by preventing copying and making it more difficult for competitors to benefit unfairly from our
design innovation. We hold U.S. and foreign patents covering various features used in products sold within all of our business segments. Although each of our segments relies on a number of patents and patent groups that, in the aggregate, provide
important protections to the Company, no single patent or patent group is material to any of the Company’s segments.

Employees.

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 21,400 full-time employees. 2,635 of these employees are covered
by collective bargaining agreements of which less than 5% of these employees are subject to agreements that will expire within one year of the date on which this Annual Report on Form 10-K was filed. Employee relations are generally good.

Information about geographic areas.

For additional information about net sales and assets by geographic areas,
refer to Note 18, “Information on Business Segments,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Seasonality.

All of our operating segments traditionally experience lower sales in the first quarter of the year when new home construction, repair-and-remodel activity and
security buying are at their lowest. As a result of sales seasonality and associated timing of working capital fluctuations, our cash flow from operating activities is typically higher in the second half of the year.

Environmental matters.

We are involved in remediation activities to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state
laws. Liabilities for remediation costs of each site are based on our best estimate of undiscounted future costs, excluding possible insurance recoveries or recoveries from other third parties. Uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations,
technology and information related to individual sites make it difficult to develop estimates of environmental remediation exposures. Some of the potential liabilities relate to sites we own, and some relate to sites we no longer own or never owned.
Several of our subsidiaries have been designated as potentially responsible parties (“PRP”) under “Superfund” or similar state laws. As of December 31, 2015, ten such instances have not been dismissed, settled or otherwise
resolved. In the calendar year 2015, none of our subsidiaries were identified as a PRP in any new instances and no instances were settled, dismissed or otherwise resolved. In most instances where our subsidiaries are named as a PRP, we enter into
cost-sharing arrangements with other PRPs. We give notice to insurance carriers of potential PRP liability, but very rarely, if ever, receive reimbursement from insurance for PRP costs. We believe that the cost of complying with the present
environmental protection laws, before considering estimated recoveries either from other PRPs or insurance, will not have a material



adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had accruals of $2.8 million, relating to environmental compliance and clean
up including, but not limited to, the above mentioned Superfund sites.

Legal structure.

Fortune Brands
Home & Security, Inc. is a holding company that was organized as a Delaware corporation in 1988. Wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company include MasterBrand Cabinets, Inc., Moen Incorporated, Fortune Brands Doors, Inc. and Fortune Brands
Storage & Security LLC. As a holding company, Fortune Brands is a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiaries. Accordingly, the rights of the Company, and thus the rights of our creditors (including holders of debt securities
and other obligations) and stockholders to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the claims of creditors of the subsidiary, except to the extent that claims of the Company itself as a creditor of
such subsidiary may be recognized, in which event the Company’s claims may in certain circumstances be subordinate to certain claims of others. In addition, as a holding company, the source of our unconsolidated revenues and funds is dividends
and other payments from subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their abilities to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions with respect to their capital stock or other payments to the
Company.

Item 1A.  Risk Factors.

You should carefully consider the risks described below and all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K when deciding whether to
invest in our common stock or otherwise evaluating our business. If any of the following risks materialize, our business, financial condition or operating results could suffer. In this case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and
you may lose all or part of your investment.

Risks Relating to Our Business

Our business primarily relies on North American home improvement, repair and remodel and new home construction activity levels, all of which are impacted by risks associated with fluctuations in the housing
market. Downward changes in the general economy, the housing market or other business conditions could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

Our business primarily relies on home improvement, repair and remodel, and new home construction activity levels, principally in North America. The housing market is sensitive to changes in economic conditions and
other factors, such as the level of employment, consumer confidence, consumer income, availability of financing and interest rate levels. Adverse changes in any of these conditions generally, or in any of the markets where we operate, could decrease
demand and could adversely impact our businesses by: causing consumers to delay or decrease home ownership; making consumers more price conscious resulting in a shift in demand to smaller, less expensive homes; making consumers more reluctant to
make investments in their existing homes, including large kitchen and bath repair and remodel projects; or making it more difficult to secure loans for major renovations. Although the new U.S. home construction market is improving, demand for new
homes is still recovering and remains below historical levels.

We operate in very competitive consumer and trade brand categories.

The markets in which we operate are very competitive. Although we believe that competition in our businesses is based largely on product quality, consumer and
trade brand reputation, customer service and product features, as well as fashion, innovation and ease of installation, price is a significant factor for consumers as well as our trade customers. Some of our competitors may resort to price
competition to sustain market share and manufacturing capacity utilization. Also, certain large customers continue to offer private-label brands that compete with some of our product offerings as a lower-cost alternative. The strong competition that
we face in all of our businesses may adversely affect our profitability and revenue levels, as well as our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

Risks associated with strategic acquisitions could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

We consider acquisitions and joint ventures as a means of enhancing shareholder value. Acquisitions and joint ventures involve risks and uncertainties, including difficulties integrating acquired companies and
operating joint ventures; difficulties retaining the acquired businesses’ customers and brands; the inability to achieve the expected financial results and benefits of transactions; the loss of key employees from acquired companies;
implementing and maintaining consistent standards, controls, policies and information systems; and diversion of management’s attention from other business matters. Future acquisitions could cause us to incur additional debt or issue shares,
resulting in dilution in earnings per share and return on capital.



We may not successfully develop new products or improve existing products.

Our success depends on meeting consumer needs and anticipating changes in consumer preferences with successful new products and product improvements. We aim to
introduce products and new or improved production processes proactively to offset obsolescence and decreases in sales of existing products. While we devote significant focus to the development of new products, we may not be successful in product
development and our new products may not be commercially successful. In addition, it is possible that competitors may improve their products more rapidly or effectively, which could adversely affect our sales. Furthermore, market demand may decline
as a result of consumer preferences trending away from our categories or trending down within our brands or product categories, which could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

Risks associated with our ability to improve organizational productivity and global supply chain efficiency and flexibility could adversely affect our results
of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

We regularly evaluate our organizational productivity and global supply chains and assess
opportunities to increase capacity, reduce costs and enhance quality. We strive to enhance quality, speed and flexibility to meet changing and uncertain market conditions, as well as manage cost inflation, including wages, pension and medical costs.
Our success depends in part on refining our cost structure and supply chains to promote consistently flexible and low cost supply chains that can respond to market changes to protect profitability and cash flow or ramp up quickly and effectively to
meet demand. Failure to achieve the desired level of quality, capacity or cost reductions could impair our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

Risks associated with global commodity and energy availability and price volatility, as well as the possibility of sustained inflation, could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial
condition.

We are exposed to risks associated with global commodity price volatility arising from restricted or uneven supply conditions, the
sustained expansion and volatility of demand from emerging markets, potentially unstable geopolitical and economic variables, weather and other unpredictable external factors. We buy raw materials that contain commodities such as brass, zinc, steel,
wood, glass and petroleum-based products such as resins. In addition, our distribution costs are significantly impacted by the price of oil and diesel fuel. Decreased availability and increased or volatile prices for these commodities, as well as
energy used in making, distributing and transporting our products, could increase the costs of our products. While in the past we have been able to mitigate the impact of these cost increases through productivity improvements and passing on
increasing costs to our customers over time, there is no assurance that we will be able to offset such cost increases in the future, and the risk of potentially sustained high levels of inflation could adversely impact our results of operations,
cash flows and financial condition. While we may use derivative contracts to limit our short-term exposure to commodity price volatility, the commodity exposures under these contracts could still be material to our results of operations, cash flows
and financial condition. In addition, in periods of declining commodity prices, these derivative contracts may have the short-term effect of increasing our expenditures for these raw materials.

We manufacture, source and sell products internationally and are exposed to risks associated with doing business globally.

We manufacture, source or sell our products in a number of locations throughout the world, predominantly in the U.S., Canada, China, Europe and Mexico.
Accordingly, we are subject to risks



associated with potential disruption caused by changes in political, economic and social environments, including civil and political unrest, terrorism, possible expropriation, local labor
conditions, changes in laws, regulations and policies of foreign governments and trade disputes with the U.S., and U.S. laws affecting activities of U.S. companies abroad. Risks inherent to international operations include: potentially adverse tax
laws, uncertainty regarding clearance and enforcement of intellectual property rights, risks associated with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and difficulty enforcing contracts. While we hedge certain foreign currency transactions, a change in the
value of the currencies will impact our financial statements when translated into U.S. dollars. In addition, fluctuations in currency can adversely impact the cost position of our products in local currency, making it more difficult for us to
compete. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage our businesses through the impact of these potential changes. In addition, we source certain raw materials, components and finished goods from China where we have
experienced higher manufacturing costs and longer lead times due to currency fluctuations, higher wage rates, labor shortages and higher raw material costs.

Changes in government and industry regulatory standards could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

Government regulations pertaining to health and safety (including protection of employees as well as consumers) and environmental concerns continue to emerge domestically, as well as internationally. It is
necessary for us to comply with current requirements (including requirements that do not become effective until a future date), and even more stringent requirements could be imposed on our products or processes in the future. Compliance with these
regulations (such as the restrictions on water flow rates and lead content in plumbing products and on volatile organic compounds and formaldehyde emissions that are applicable to many of our businesses) may require us to alter our manufacturing and
installation processes and our sourcing. Such actions could increase our capital expenditures and adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and our inability to effectively and timely meet such regulations could
adversely impact our competitive and reputational positions.

Our inability to secure and protect our intellectual property rights could negatively
impact revenues and brand reputation.

We have many patents, trademarks, brand names and trade names that are important to our business.
Unauthorized use of these intellectual property rights may not only erode sales of our products, but may also cause significant damage to our brand name and reputation, interfere with our ability to effectively represent the Company to our
customers, contractors and suppliers, and increase litigation costs. There can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our brands and trademark rights will prevent violations. In addition, existing patent, trade secret and trademark laws offer
only limited protection, and the laws of some countries in which our products are or may be developed, manufactured or sold may not fully protect our intellectual property from infringement by others. There can be no assurance that our efforts to
assess possible third party intellectual property rights will ensure that Company’s ability to manufacture, distribute, market or sell in any given country or territory. Furthermore, others may assert intellectual property infringement claims
against us or our customers.

Our businesses rely on the performance of wholesale distributors, dealers and other marketing arrangements and could be
adversely affected by poor performance or other disruptions in our distribution channels and customers.

We rely on a distribution network comprised
of consolidating customers. Any disruption to the existing distribution channels could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial



condition. The consolidation of distributors or the financial instability or default of a distributor or one of its major customers could potentially cause such a disruption. In addition to our
own sales force, we offer our products through a variety of third-party distributors, representatives and retailers. Certain of our distributors, representatives or retailers may also market other products that compete with our products. The loss or
termination of one or more of our major distributors, representatives or retailers, the failure of one or more of our distributors or representatives to effectively promote our products, or changes in the financial or business condition of these
distributors or representatives could affect our ability to bring products to market.

Our pension costs and funding requirements could increase as a
result of volatility in the financial markets and changes in interest rates and actuarial assumptions.

Increases in the costs of pension benefits
may continue and negatively affect our business as a result of: the effect of potential declines in the stock and bond markets on the performance of our pension plan assets; potential reductions in the discount rate used to determine the present
value of our benefit obligations; and changes to our investment strategy that may impact our expected return on pension plan assets assumptions. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that we calculate income or expense for the plans
using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates, which may change based on economic conditions. Our accounting policy for defined benefit plans may subject earnings to volatility due to the
recognition of actuarial gains and losses and amortization of liability savings, particularly due to the change in the fair value of pension assets and interest rates. Funding requirements for our U.S. pension plans may become more significant.
However, the ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations.

Risks associated with the disruption of operations could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

We manufacture a significant portion of the products we sell. Any prolonged disruption in our operations, whether due to technical or labor difficulties, weather,
lack of raw material or component availability, startup inefficiencies for new operations, destruction of or damage to any facility (as a result of natural disasters, fires and explosions, use and storage of hazardous materials or other events) or
other reasons, could negatively impact our profitability and competitive position and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

Our inability to obtain raw materials and finished goods in a timely manner from suppliers would adversely affect our ability to manufacture and market our products.

We purchase raw materials to be used in manufacturing our products and also rely on third-party manufacturers as a source for finished goods. We typically do not
enter into long-term contracts with our suppliers or sourcing partners. Instead, most raw materials and sourced goods are obtained on a “purchase order” basis. In addition, in some instances we maintain single-source or limited-source
sourcing relationships, either because multiple sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance, quality, support, delivery, capacity or price considerations. Financial, operating or other difficulties encountered by
our suppliers or sourcing partners or changes in our relationships with them could result in manufacturing or sourcing interruptions, delays and inefficiencies, and prevent us from manufacturing or obtaining the finished goods necessary to meet
customer demand. If we are unable to meet customer demand, there could be an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.



Our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows
and financial condition.

Our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of qualified personnel at all levels, including our senior
management team and other key employees. Their motivation, skills, experience, contacts and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and administration. The failure to attract, motivate and retain members of our senior management team
and key employees could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

Future tax law changes or the
interpretation of existing tax laws may materially impact our effective income tax rate, the resolution of unrecognized tax benefits and cash tax payments.

Our businesses are subject to income taxation in the U.S., as well as internationally. We are routinely audited by income tax authorities in many jurisdictions. Although we believe that the recorded tax estimates
are reasonable and appropriate, there are significant uncertainties in these estimates. As a result, the ultimate outcome from any audit could be materially different from amounts reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals. Future
settlements of income tax audits may have a material adverse effect on earnings between the period of initial recognition of tax estimates in our financial statements and the point of ultimate tax audit settlement.

In connection with the divestiture of businesses and the separation from our Former Parent, we have retained and may further retain tax liabilities and the rights
to tax refunds for periods before any divestiture or separation. As a result, from time to time, we may be required to make payments related to tax matters associated with these transactions.

Potential liabilities and costs from claims and litigation could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

We are, from time to time, involved in various claims, litigation matters and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business and that could have an adverse effect on us. These matters may
include contract disputes, intellectual property disputes, product recalls, personal injury claims, construction defects and home warranty claims, warranty disputes, environmental claims or proceedings, other tort claims, employment and tax matters
and other proceedings and litigation, including class actions. It is not possible to predict the outcome of pending or future litigation, and, as with any litigation, it is possible that some of the actions could be decided unfavorably and could
have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

We are subject to product safety regulations, recalls and
direct claims for product liability that can result in significant liability and, regardless of the ultimate outcome, can be costly to defend. As a result of the difficulty of controlling the quality of products or components sourced from other
manufacturers, we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products and to limitations on our recourse against such suppliers.

An
impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other acquired intangible assets could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.

The carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date. The carrying value of other intangible assets represents
the fair value of trademarks, tradenames and other acquired intangible assets as of the acquisition date. Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized, but must be evaluated
for impairment by our management at least annually. If the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, the goodwill is



considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a non-cash charge to earnings. If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is greater than its fair value, the intangible
asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a non-cash charge to earnings. Events and/or circumstances that could have a potential negative effect on the estimated fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived tradenames
include: actual new construction and repair and remodel growth rates that lag our assumptions, actions of key customers, volatility of discount rates, continued economic uncertainty, higher levels of unemployment, weak consumer confidence, lower
levels of discretionary consumer spending and a decline in the price of our common stock. If the value of goodwill or other acquired intangible assets is impaired, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.

We may experience delays or outages in our information technology system and computer networks.

We, like most companies, may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions. These may be caused by delays or disruptions due to
system updates, natural disasters, malicious attacks, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or similar events or disruptions. Our businesses may
implement enterprise resource planning systems or add applications to replace outdated systems and to operate more efficiently. Predictions regarding benefits resulting from the implementation of these projects are subject to uncertainties. We may
not be able to successfully implement the projects without experiencing difficulties. In addition, any expected benefits of implementing projects might not be realized or the costs of implementation might outweigh the benefits realized.

We may be subject to breaches of our information technology systems, which could damage our reputation and consumer relationships. Such breaches could subject
us to significant financial, legal and operational consequences.

Information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the
proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks. In particular, our Security business is increasingly utilizing digital elements that allow third parties to use and store personally
identifiable information and other information pertaining to their customers and their employees and businesses through online services operated by Master Lock. Such information may include names, passwords, addresses, phone numbers, access to
facilities, email addresses, contact preferences, tax identification numbers and payment account information. We believe we devote appropriate resources to network security, data encryption, and other security measures to protect our systems and
data, but these security measures cannot provide absolute security. In the event of a breach, we would be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash
flows and financial condition.

There can be no assurance that we will have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to us.

From time to time we may need to access the long-term and short-term capital markets to obtain financing. Although we believe that the sources of capital currently
in place permit us to finance our operations for the foreseeable future on acceptable terms and conditions, our access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors,
including, but not limited to: (i) our financial performance, (ii) our credit ratings, (iii) the liquidity of the overall capital markets and (iv) the state of the economy, including the U.S. housing market. There can be no
assurance that we will have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to us. In addition, a prolonged global economic downturn may also adversely impact our access to long-term capital markets, result in increased interest rates on our
corporate debt, and



weaken operating cash flow and liquidity. Decreased cash flow and liquidity could potentially adversely impact our ability to pay dividends, fund acquisitions and repurchase shares in the future.

Item 1B.  Unresolved Staff Comments.

None.

Item 2.  Properties.

Our principal executive office is located at 520 Lake Cook Road, Deerfield, Illinois 60015. We operate 31 U.S. manufacturing facilities in 17 states and have 13
manufacturing facilities in international locations (7 in Mexico, 3 in Asia and 3 in Canada). In addition, we have 34 distribution centers and warehouses worldwide, of which 30 are leased. The following table provides additional information with
respect to these properties.

We are of the opinion that the properties are suitable to our respective businesses and have production capacities adequate to meet
the current needs of our businesses.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings.

The Company is a defendant in lawsuits associated with the normal conduct of its businesses and operations. It is not possible to predict the outcome of the
pending actions, and, as with any litigation, it is possible that these actions could be decided unfavorably to the Company. The Company believes that there are meritorious defenses to these actions and that these actions will not have a material
adverse effect upon the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, and, where appropriate, these actions are being vigorously contested. Accordingly, the Company believes the likelihood of material loss is remote.

Item 4.  Mine Safety Disclosures.

Stock Performance

The above graph compares the relative performance of our common stock, the S&P Midcap 400 Index and a Peer Group Index. This
graph covers the period from September 16, 2011 (the first day our common stock began “when-issued” trading on the NYSE) through December 31, 2015. This graph assumes $100 was invested in the stock or the index on
September 16, 2011 and also assumes the reinvestment of dividends. The foregoing performance graph is being furnished as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K solely in accordance with the requirement under Rule 14a-3(b)(9) to furnish our
stockholders with such information, and therefore, shall not be deemed to be filed or incorporated by reference into any filings by the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Peer Group Index

The Peer Group is composed of the following publicly traded companies corresponding to the Company’s core businesses:

Armstrong World Industries, Inc., Fastenal Company, Leggett & Platt Incorporated, Lennox International Inc., Masco Corporation, Mohawk
Industries, Inc., Newell Rubbermaid Inc., The Sherwin-Williams Company, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., USG Corporation and The Valspar Corporation.

Calculation of Peer Group Index

The weighted-average total return of the entire Peer Group, for the period of
September 16, 2011 (the first day of “when-issued” trading on the NYSE of Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. common stock) through December 31, 2015, is calculated in the following manner:

(1)

the total return of each Peer Group member is calculated by dividing the change in market value of a share of its common stock during the period, assuming reinvestment of any
dividends, by the value of a share of its common stock at the beginning of the period; and

(2)

each Peer Group member’s total return is then weighted within the index based on its market capitalization relative to the market capitalization of the entire index, and the
sum of such weighted returns results in a weighted-average total return for the entire Peer Group Index.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Introduction

This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

operations. MD&A is organized as follows:

>

Overview:    This section provides a general description of our business, and a discussion of management’s general outlook regarding
market demand, our competitive position and product innovation, as well as recent developments we believe are important to understanding our results of operations and financial condition or in understanding anticipated future trends.

>

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates:    This section identifies and summarizes those accounting policies that significantly impact our
reported results of operations and financial condition and require significant judgment or estimates on the part of management in their application.

Overview

The Company is a leader in home and security products focused on the design, manufacture and sale of
market-leading branded products in the following categories: kitchen and bath cabinetry, plumbing and accessories, entry door systems, and security products.

For the year ended December 31, 2015, net sales based on country of destination were:

We believe the Company has certain competitive advantages including market-leading brands, a diversified mix of customer channels,
and lean and flexible supply chains, as well as a tradition of strong innovation and customer service. We are focused on outperforming our markets in growth, profitability and returns in order to drive increased shareholder value. We believe the
Company’s track record reflects the long-term attractiveness and potential of our categories and our leading brands. As consumer demand and the housing market grow, we expect the benefits of operating



leverage and strategic spending to support increased manufacturing capacity and long-term growth initiatives will help us to continue to achieve profitable organic growth.

We believe our most attractive opportunities are to invest in profitable organic growth initiatives. We also believe that as the market grows, we have the
potential to generate additional growth from leveraging our cash flows and balance sheet strength by pursuing accretive strategic acquisitions and joint ventures, and returning cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and repurchases
under our share repurchase programs as explained in further detail under “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below.

The U.S. market for our
home products consists of spending on both new home construction and repair and remodel activities within existing homes, with the substantial majority of the markets we serve consisting of repair and remodel spending. We believe that the U.S.
market for our home products is in the midst of a multi-year recovery from the U.S. economic recession that ended in mid-2009 and that a continued recovery will largely depend on consumer confidence, employment, home prices, stable mortgage rates
and credit availability. Over the long term, we believe that the U.S. home products market will benefit from favorable population and immigration trends, which will drive demand for new housing units, and from aging existing housing stock that will
continue to need to be repaired and remodeled.

We may be impacted by fluctuations in raw material and transportation costs and promotional activity
among our competitors. We strive to offset the potential unfavorable impact of these items with productivity initiatives and price increases.

During
the past three years ended December 31, 2015, our net sales grew at a compounded annual rate of 13% as we benefited from an improving U.S. home products market, acquisitions, share gains and growth in international markets. Operating income
grew at a compounded annual rate of 51% with consolidated operating margins improving from 5% in 2012 to 11% in 2015. Growth in operating income was primarily due to higher sales volume, control and leverage of our operating expenses, the benefits
of productivity programs, and changes to our portfolio of businesses.

During 2015, the U.S. home products market grew due to increases in new home
construction and repair and remodel activities. We believe new housing construction experienced low double-digit growth in 2015 compared to 2014 and spending for home repair and remodeling increased approximately 5%. In 2015, net sales grew 14% and
operating income increased 23% due to the acquisitions of Norcraft Companies, Inc. (“Norcraft”) in 2015, and John D. Brush & Co., Inc. (“SentrySafe”) and Anaheim Manufacturing Company (“Anaheim”) in 2014,
higher sales volume primarily resulting from U.S. home products market growth, price increases to help mitigate cumulative raw material cost increases and productivity improvements.

During 2014, the U.S. home products market also grew due to expansion of both new home construction and repair and remodel activities. We believe new housing construction experienced high-single digit growth in
2014 compared to 2013 and spending for home repair and remodeling increased approximately 4% to 5%. In 2014, net sales grew 8% and operating income increased 25% due to higher sales volume primarily resulting from U.S. home products market growth,
the acquisitions of WoodCrafters Home Products Holding, LLC (“WoodCrafters”) in 2013 and SentrySafe in 2014, and productivity improvements.

In September 2015, we completed the sale of Waterloo Industries, Inc. (“Waterloo”) for approximately $14 million in cash, subject to certain post-closing
adjustments. We recorded a pre-tax loss of $16.7 million as the result of this sale. Transaction and other sale related costs were approximately $2.8 million. The related estimated tax benefit on the sale was $26.5 million with the after-tax gain of
$7.0



million recorded within discontinued operations. The estimated tax benefit resulted primarily from a tax loss in excess of the financial reporting loss as a result of prior period nondeductible
asset impairments. Prior to classifying Waterloo as a discontinued operation, it was reported in the Security segment.

In May 2015, we acquired
Norcraft, a leading publicly-owned manufacturer of kitchen and bathroom cabinetry, for a total purchase price of $648.6 million. Pursuant to the agreement, we acquired all outstanding shares of Norcraft for $25.50 per share of common stock in cash.
We financed the transaction using cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facilities. This acquisition is expected to strengthen our overall product offering, round out our regional market penetration and enhance our frameless
cabinetry capabilities.

In December 2014, we acquired Anaheim, which markets and sells garbage disposals, for $28.9 million in cash. In July 2014, we
acquired SentrySafe, a leading manufacturer of home safes, for a purchase price of $116.7 million in cash. The financial results of SentrySafe were included in the Company’s results of operations and cash flows beginning in August of 2014. The
purchase prices were funded from cash on hand and our existing credit facilities.

In September 2014, we sold the Simonton windows business
(“Simonton”) for $130 million in cash.

In June 2013, the Company acquired WoodCrafters, a manufacturer of bathroom vanities and tops, for a
purchase price of $302.0 million. We paid the purchase price using a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facilities. The financial results of WoodCrafters were included in the Company’s results of operations and
cash flows beginning in the third quarter of 2013. This acquisition greatly expanded our offering of bathroom cabinetry products.

Basis of
Presentation

The consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been derived from the accounts of the Company and its
majority-owned subsidiaries. In May 2015, we acquired Norcraft. The financial results of Norcraft were included in the Company’s consolidated statements of income and statements of cash flow beginning in May 2015 and the consolidated balance
sheets as of December 31, 2015. On September 10, 2015, we completed the sale of Waterloo. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) requirements, the results of operations of Waterloo through the date of sale,
were classified and separately stated as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for 2015, 2014 and 2013. The assets and liabilities of Waterloo were classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014.

In September 2014, we sold of all of the shares of stock of Fortune Brands Windows, Inc., our
subsidiary that owned and operated the Simonton windows business. The results of operations of Simonton were reclassified and separately stated as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for 2014 and 2013.

The cash flows from discontinued operations for 2015, 2014 and 2013 were not separately classified on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash
flows. Information on Business Segments was revised to exclude these discontinued operations.

Results of Operations

The following discussion of both consolidated results of operations and segment results of operations refers to the year ended December 31,
2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, and



the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The discussion of consolidated results of operations should be read in conjunction with the discussion of
segment results of operations and our financial statements and notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Unless otherwise noted, all discussion of results of operations are for continuing operations.

Years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013

(a)

Corporate expenses include the components of defined benefit plan expense other than service cost which totaled (income) expense of $(3.6) million, $4.9 million,
and $(4.9) million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In addition, Corporate expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes $15.1 million of Norcraft transaction costs. There are no amounts
that represent the elimination or reversal of transactions between reportable segments.

Certain items had a significant impact on our
results in 2015, 2014 and 2013. These included the acquisitions of Norcraft, SentrySafe and WoodCrafters, dispositions of Waterloo and Simonton, defined benefit plan recognition of actuarial losses, restructuring and other charges, asset impairment
charges and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

In 2015, financial results included:

>

the impact of the Norcraft, SentrySafe and Anaheim acquisitions, which added approximately $369 million of net sales (approximately $258 million, $80 million and
$31 million, respectively),

>

defined benefit plan recognition of actuarial losses, recorded in the Corporate segment, of $2.5 million ($1.6 million after tax) compared to $13.7 million ($8.7
million after tax) in 2014. The actuarial losses in 2015 were primarily due to the impact of a lower than expected increase in pension plan assets, partially offset by higher discount rates,

>

restructuring and other charges of $22.7 million before tax ($15.8 million after tax), primarily associated with employee related costs,

>

the impact of foreign exchange, which had an unfavorable impact compared to 2014, of approximately $66 million on net sales, approximately $16 million on
operating income and approximately $10 million on net income. The effects of foreign exchange on the Company’s results are principally associated with movements in the Canadian dollar and

>

income from discontinued operations of $9.0 million, net of tax, includes the after-tax gain associated with the sale of the Waterloo business.



In 2014, financial results included:

>

the impact of the WoodCrafters and SentrySafe acquisitions, which added approximately $165 million of net sales (approximately $100 million and $65 million,
respectively),

>

defined benefit plan recognition of actuarial losses, recorded in the Corporate segment, of $13.7 million ($8.7 million after tax) compared to $5.2 million ($3.3
million after tax) in 2013. The actuarial losses in 2014 were primarily due to lower discount rates, partially offset by the impact of a higher than expected increase in pension plan assets and lower postretirement liabilities due to plan amendments
to reduce health benefits,

>

restructuring and other charges of $7.7 million before tax ($4.7 million after tax), primarily associated with supply chain initiatives,

2015 Compared to 2014

Total Fortune Brands

Net sales

Net sales increased $565.8 million, or 14%. The
increase was due to the benefit of the acquisitions of Norcraft, SentrySafe, and Anaheim (approximately $369 million in aggregate), higher sales volume primarily from the continuing improvement in U.S. market conditions for home products, price
increases to help mitigate cumulative raw material cost increases and favorable mix. These factors were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately $66 million and higher sales rebates.



Cost of products sold

Cost of products sold increased $350.8 million, or 13%, due to higher net sales, including the impact of the acquisitions of Norcraft, SentrySafe and Anaheim (approximately $246 million in aggregate), and
investments to support increased manufacturing capacity and long-term growth initiatives, partially offset by the benefit of productivity improvements.

Selling, general and administrative expenses

Selling,
general and administrative expenses increased $104.3 million, or 11%, due to the impact of the acquisitions of Norcraft, SentrySafe, and Anaheim (approximately $82 million in aggregate), $15.1 million of Norcraft transaction costs, higher
employee-related costs, and planned increases in strategic spending to support increased capacity and long-term growth initiatives.

Amortization of
intangible assets

Amortization of intangible assets increased $8.5 million due to the acquisitions of Norcraft, SentrySafe and Anaheim.

Restructuring charges

Restructuring charges of $16.6
million in 2015 primarily related to relocating a manufacturing facility, including severance costs within our Security segment and severance costs to relocate a plumbing manufacturing facility in China. Restructuring charges of $7.0 million in 2014
related to severance in Security, Plumbing and Corporate, partially offset by a benefit from a foreign currency gain associated with the dissolution of a foreign entity in the Plumbing segment.

Operating income

Operating income increased $92.6 million
or 23%. Operating income benefited from higher net sales, including the impact of acquisitions, productivity improvements, and $11.2 million in lower defined benefit plan actuarial losses. These benefits were partially offset by investments to
support manufacturing capacity increases for long-term growth, higher employee-related costs, higher sales rebates, approximately $16 million of unfavorable foreign exchange, $15.1 million of Norcraft transaction costs and $15.0 million of higher
restructuring and other charges.

Interest expense

Interest expense increased $21.5 million to $31.9 million due to higher average borrowings and higher average interest rates.

Other expense, net

Other expense, net, was expense of $4.3 million in 2015 compared to $1.2 million in 2014.
The change was principally due to unfavorable foreign currency adjustments.

Income taxes

The effective income tax rates for 2015 and 2014 were 33.4% and 30.2%, respectively. The effective income tax rates for 2015 and 2014 were favorably impacted by
the tax benefit attributable to the Domestic Production Activity (Internal Revenue Code Section 199) Deduction ($12.5 million and $7.6 million, respectively), favorable tax rates in foreign jurisdictions ($8.7 million and $13.4 million,
respectively) and a benefit associated with the extensions of the U.S. research and development credit ($2.2 million and $1.8 million, respectively), offset by state and local taxes and increases to



uncertain tax positions ($4.7 million and $4.7 million, respectively). The benefit associated with the favorable tax rates in foreign jurisdictions is affected by overall allocation of income,
rate changes and impact of foreign exchange rates. In 2015, the effective income tax rate benefit from foreign tax rates was reduced, as compared to 2014, due to the overall allocation of income within foreign jurisdictions and an expiration of a
favorable tax incentive that in total increased the effective foreign tax rate by 6%. The 2015 effective income tax rate was unfavorably impacted by $2.4 million related to nondeductible acquisition costs. The effective tax rate in 2014 was
favorably impacted by the release of valuation allowances related to state net operating loss carryforwards of $4.1 million.

Noncontrolling
interests

Noncontrolling interest was $0.5 million and $1.2 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Income from continuing operations

Net income from
continuing operations was $306.5 million in 2015 compared to $273.6 million in 2014.

Income (loss) from discontinued operations

The income (loss) from discontinued operations was $9.0 million and $(114.3) million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The discontinued operations in 2015 consist of
the results of operations of Waterloo and the after-tax gain associated with the sale of the business. The net loss from discontinued operations was $(114.3) in 2014, of which $(111.2) million was the loss on the sale of Simonton windows business,
as well as $(14.1) million in restructuring and impairment losses recorded as a result of the decision to sell the Waterloo tool storage business.

Results By Segment

Cabinets

Net sales increased $385.9 million, or 22%, due to the benefit of the Norcraft acquisition (approximately $258 million), higher sales volume including the impact
of new product introductions, favorable mix and the benefit of price increases to help mitigate cumulative raw material cost increases. These benefits were partially offset by approximately $24 million of unfavorable foreign exchange.

Operating income increased $54.5 million, or 40%, due to an increase in net sales, productivity improvements and approximately $28 million benefit from the
acquisition of Norcraft, including a $2.0 million charge related to an inventory purchase accounting adjustment to fair value. These benefits were partially offset by investments to support manufacturing capacity increases for long-term growth,
higher employee-related costs, higher wood-related raw material costs and costs associated with new product introductions.

Plumbing

Net sales increased $83.5 million, or 6%, due to higher sales volume in the U.S. driven by improving U.S. market conditions, the acquisition of Anaheim
(approximately $31 million benefit) and price increases to help mitigate cumulative raw material cost increases. These benefits were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately $29 million and higher sales rebates.



Operating income increased $26.5 million, or 10%, due to an increase in net sales, and productivity improvements.
Operating income was unfavorably impacted by higher sales rebates, approximately $14 million of unfavorable foreign exchange and $5.9 million of higher restructuring and other charges primarily related to severance costs to relocate a manufacturing
facility in China.

Doors

Net sales increased
$25.2 million, or 6%, due to higher sales volume driven primarily by improved conditions in the U.S. home products market, price increases to help mitigate cumulative raw material cost increases and favorable mix.

Operating income increased $14.8 million, or 51%, due to an increase in net sales, productivity improvements and approximately $2 million of favorable foreign
exchange, partially offset by higher employee related costs.

Security

Net sales increased $71.2 million, or 15%, due primarily to the impact of the acquisition of SentrySafe (approximately $80 million), partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange (approximately $14 million).

Operating income increased $6.5 million, or 13%. Operating income was favorably impacted by productivity improvements and the acquisition of
SentrySafe, partially offset by an increase of $9.3 million of restructuring and other charges primarily to relocate a manufacturing facility, higher employee related costs and unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately $4 million.

Corporate

Corporate expenses increased $9.7 million
predominantly due to $15.1 million of transaction costs associated with the Norcraft acquisition partially offset by lower defined benefit plan actuarial losses of $11.2 million.

(a)

Represents external costs directly related to the acquisition of Norcraft and primarily includes expenditures for banking, legal, accounting and other similar
services.

In future periods the Company may record, in the Corporate segment, material expense or income associated with actuarial
gains and losses arising from periodic remeasurement of our liabilities for defined benefit plans. At a minimum the Company will remeasure its defined benefit plan liabilities in the fourth quarter of each year. Remeasurements due to plan amendments
and settlements may also occur in interim periods during the year. Remeasurement of these liabilities attributable to updating our liability discount rates and expected return on assets may, in particular, result in material income or expense
recognition.



2014 Compared to 2013

Total Fortune Brands

Net sales

Net sales increased $310.0 million, or 8%. The increase was due to the benefit of the acquisitions of WoodCrafters and SentrySafe (approximately $165 million in
aggregate), higher sales volume primarily from the continuing improvement in U.S. market conditions for home products, price increases to help mitigate material cost increases, and favorable product mix. These increases were partially offset by the
impact of the planned exit from low margin builder direct cabinet business in the western U.S. (approximately $53 million) and approximately $25 million of unfavorable foreign exchange.

Cost of products sold

Cost of products sold increased $238.2 million, or 10%, due to higher sales volume,
material cost increases and higher costs associated with manufacturing capacity increases to support long-term growth, as well as the $126.0 million impact of the acquisitions of SentrySafe and WoodCrafters. These cost increases were partially
offset by the benefit of productivity improvements.

Selling, general and administrative expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $4.6 million due to higher volume-related costs and the $19.0 million impact of the acquisitions of
SentrySafe and WoodCrafters, partially offset by lower employee-related costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses were also unfavorable due to higher expense from actuarial losses related to defined benefits plans ($10.7 million in 2014
compared to $2.5 million in 2013).

Amortization of intangible assets

Amortization of intangible assets increased $3.7 million due to the acquisitions of WoodCrafters ($2.9 million incremental) and SentrySafe ($0.8 million).

Restructuring charges

Restructuring charges of $7.0 million in 2014 related to severance in Security,
Plumbing and Corporate, partially offset by a benefit from a foreign currency gain associated with dissolution of a foreign entity in the Plumbing segment. Restructuring charges of $2.8 million in 2013 related to supply chain initiatives.

Asset impairment charge

No asset impairment
charges were recorded in 2014 in operating income. In 2013, our Cabinets segment completed an evaluation of its information technology strategy. As a result of this evaluation, the segment abandoned certain software developed for internal use and
recorded an impairment charge of $21.2 million, which was recorded in operating income and reduced property, plant and equipment.



Operating income

Operating income increased $80.5 million, or 25%, primarily due to higher sales volume from our growth initiatives and improving U.S. home products market conditions, the benefit from the WoodCrafters and
SentrySafe acquisitions (approximately $9 million in aggregate) and improved product mix. Operating income was unfavorably impacted by planned costs associated with manufacturing capacity increases to support long-term growth. Operating income was
also impacted by approximately $13 million of unfavorable foreign exchange. In addition, the following items had a significant impact on operating income trends:

expense increased $3.2 million primarily due to higher average borrowings.

Other expense, net

Other expense, net, was $1.2 million in 2014, compared to $5.3 million in 2013. The decrease of $4.1 million was primarily due to a $6.2 million impairment charge
pertaining to a cost method investment in 2013, partially offset by a $1.6 million impairment charge pertaining to a different cost method investment in 2014.

Income taxes

The effective income tax rates for 2014 and 2013 were 30.2% and 32.7%, respectively. The
effective income tax rate for 2014 was favorably impacted by the tax benefit attributable to the Domestic Production Activity (Internal Revenue Code Section 199) Deduction ($7.6 million), the release of valuation allowances related to state net
operating loss carryforwards ($4.1 million), and a $1.8 million benefit associated with the extension of the U.S. research and development credit under the Tax Increase Prevention Act 2014. The effective income tax rate for 2013 was favorably
impacted by the tax benefit attributable to the Domestic Production Activity (Internal Revenue Code Section 199) Deduction ($5.2 million), $1.6 million of deferred tax benefits associated with the enacted repeal of the Mexican Business Flat Tax
under the 2014 Mexican Tax Reform Package, and a $1.4 million tax benefit associated with the extension of the U.S. research and development credit under The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. The effective income tax rate in 2013 was unfavorably
impacted by an increase in the valuation allowance related to an investment impairment charge for which we could not record an income tax benefit ($2.1 million).

Noncontrolling interests

Noncontrolling interest was $1.2 million in 2014 and 2013.

Income from continuing operations

Net income from
continuing operations was $273.6 million in 2014 compared to $209.0 million in 2013. The increase of $64.6 million was primarily due to higher operating income and the impact of the lower effective income tax rate.



Income (loss) from discontinued operations

Discontinued operations consist of the results of operations of Simonton and the loss associated with the sale of the business in 2014, as well as the results of operations of Waterloo. The net loss from
discontinued operations was $114.3 million in 2014, of which $111.2 million was the loss on the sale of the Simonton windows business, as well as $14.1 million in restructuring and impairment losses recorded as a result of the decision to sell the
Waterloo tool storage business. Income from discontinued operations was $21.9 million in 2013.

Results By Segment

Cabinets

Net sales increased $145.3 million, or 9%,
primarily due to the benefit of the acquisition of WoodCrafters (approximately $100 million) and strength in the repair and remodel market. Net sales also benefited from favorable product mix and price increases to help mitigate raw material cost
increases. Net sales were unfavorably affected by the impact of the planned exit from low margin builder direct business in the western U.S. (approximately $53 million) and approximately $15 million of unfavorable foreign exchange.

Operating income increased $40.8 million, or 42%, due to the acquisition of WoodCrafters (approximately $12 million) and the absence in 2014 of the 2013 asset
impairment charge of $21.2 million. Operating income also benefited from productivity improvements, lower employee-related costs, price increases to help mitigate raw material cost increases (wood-related) and improved product mix. Operating income
was unfavorably impacted by higher costs associated with manufacturing capacity increases to support long-term growth.

Plumbing

Net sales increased $44.0 million, or 3%, due to higher sales volume in the U.S. driven primarily by improving U.S. market conditions, price increases to help
mitigate raw material cost increases and approximately $13 million in higher international sales, primarily China and Canada. These benefits were partially offset by approximately $10 million of unfavorable foreign exchange.

Operating income increased $30.6 million, or 13%, due to higher sales volume, price increases to help mitigate raw material cost increases and cost saving
initiatives. These benefits were partially offset by planned strategic and supply chain initiatives to increase capacity for long-term growth, as well as unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately $10 million.

Doors

Net sales increased $42.3 million, or 11%, due to
higher sales volume driven primarily by improved conditions in the U.S. home products market, benefits from new distribution partners and price increases to help mitigate raw material cost increases.

Operating income increased $13.9 million, or 91%, due to higher sales volume. Operating income also benefited from price increases to help mitigate raw material
cost increases and cost savings initiatives, as well as lower employee-related costs. These benefits were partially offset by increased material costs and higher costs related to planned capacity investments.

Security

Net sales increased $78.4 million, or 19%, due to
the benefit of the acquisition of SentrySafe (approximately $65 million), as well as higher sales volume, including internationally, particularly in Europe.



Operating income decreased $6.0 million, or 11%, due to $5.7 million of inventory step-up amortization related to the
acquisition of SentrySafe, increased raw material costs, higher selling and administrative expenses to support long-term growth and $4.1 million of restructuring charges in 2014. Operating income benefited from higher sales volume and lower
employee-related costs.

Corporate

Corporate
expenses decreased $1.2 million, or 2%, due to lower employee-related costs and consulting expense, partially offset by recognition of higher actuarial losses recognized in 2014 compared to 2013 (an $8.5 million increase) and $2.0 million of
restructuring charges in 2014. The actuarial losses related to the normal remeasurement of the defined benefit plan liabilities ($13.1 million) and defined benefit plan amendments that required a remeasurement of certain postretirement benefit
liabilities ($0.6 million).

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our primary liquidity needs are to support working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures and service indebtedness, as well as to finance acquisitions, repurchase shares of our common stock and pay
dividends to stockholders, as deemed appropriate. Our principal sources of liquidity have been cash on hand, cash flows from operating activities, availability under our credit agreements and the capital markets. Our operating income is generated by
our subsidiaries. There are no restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to Fortune Brands. In December 2015, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 14% to $0.16 per share
of our common stock. Our Board of Directors will continue to evaluate dividend payment opportunities on a quarterly basis. There can be no assurance as to when and if future dividends will be paid, and at what level, because the payment of dividends
is dependent on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.

We periodically review our portfolio of brands and evaluate potential strategic transactions to increase shareholder value. However, we cannot predict whether or when we may enter into acquisitions, joint ventures
or dispositions, make any purchases of shares of our common stock under our share repurchase programs, or pay dividends, or what impact any such transactions could have on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, whether as a
result of the issuance of debt or equity securities, or otherwise. Our cash flows from operations, borrowing availability and overall liquidity are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including those described in the section
“Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

In 2015, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of our outstanding common stock under the
Company’s share repurchase programs for $51.7 million. On February 16, 2016, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $400 million of shares of the Company’s common stock over the two years ending February
16, 2018. The share repurchase programs do not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.



Acquisitions and divestitures in 2015, 2014 and 2013 include:

>

In September 2015, we completed the sale of the Waterloo tool storage business for approximately $14 million in cash, subject to certain post-closing
adjustments.

>

In May 2015, we acquired Norcraft, a leading manufacturer of kitchen and bathroom cabinetry, for a purchase price of $648.6 million. We financed this transaction
using cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facilities.

>

In December 2014, we acquired Anaheim, which markets and sells garbage disposals, for $28.9 million in cash. We paid the purchase price using a combination of
cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facilities.

>

In September 2014, we completed the sale of Simonton for $130 million in cash.

>

In July 2014, the Company acquired SentrySafe for a purchase price of $116.7 million in cash. The purchase price was funded from cash on hand and borrowings
under our existing credit facilities.

>

In June 2013, we acquired WoodCrafters, a manufacturer of bathroom vanities and tops, for a purchase price of $302.0 million. We paid the purchase price using a
combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facilities.

In 2015, we invested in incremental capacity to
support long-term growth potential. We expect capital spending in 2016 to be approximately $145 million.

On December 31, 2015, we had cash and
cash equivalents of $238.5 million, of which $219.8 million was held at non-U.S. subsidiaries. We manage our global cash requirements considering (i) available funds among the subsidiaries through which we conduct business, (ii) the
geographic location of our liquidity needs, and (iii) the cost to access international cash balances. The repatriation of non-U.S. cash balances from certain subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences as we may be required to pay and
record income tax expense on those funds to the extent they were previously considered indefinitely reinvested.

Our operating cash flows are
significantly impacted by the seasonality of our businesses. We typically generate most of our operating cash flow in the third and fourth quarters of each year.

In June 2015, we issued $900 million of Senior Notes in a registered public offering. The Senior Notes consist of two tranches: $400 million of five-year notes due 2020 with a coupon of 3% and $500 million of
ten-year notes due 2025 with a coupon of 4%. We used the proceeds from the Senior Notes offering to pay down our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. On December 31, 2015, the outstanding amount of the Senior Notes, net
of underwriting commissions and price discounts, was $891.6 million.

As of December 31, 2015, we had a $975 million committed revolving credit
facility, as well as a term loan in the initial amount of $525 million, both of which expire in July 2018. Both facilities can be used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, our outstanding borrowings under the
revolving credit facility were zero and $145.0 million, respectively; the amounts outstanding under the term loan were $280.0 million and $525.0 million, respectively. The interest rates under these facilities are variable based on LIBOR at the time
of the borrowing and the Company’s leverage as measured by a debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio (as defined in the agreements governing the facilities). Based upon the Company’s debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio, the Company’s borrowing rate
will range from LIBOR + 1.0% to LIBOR + 2.0%. At December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all covenants under these facilities. The credit facilities also include a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio requirement of 3.0 to 1.0.
The Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio is defined as the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as



consolidated net income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, losses from asset impairments, and certain other adjustments. Consolidated Interest
Expense is as disclosed in our financial statements. The credit facilities also include a Maximum Leverage Ratio of 3.5 to 1.0 as measured by the ratio of our debt to Adjusted EBITDA. The Maximum Leverage Ratio is permitted to increase to 3.75 to
1.0 for three succeeding quarters in the event of an acquisition. We believe our operating cash flows, availability under the credit facility and access to capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to support the Company’s financing
needs.

Cash Flows

Below is a summary of cash
flows for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.

Years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013

Net cash provided by operating activities was $411.1 million in 2015 compared to $253.7 million in 2014 and $297.8 million in 2013. The $157.4 million increase in cash provided by operating activities from 2014 to
2015 was primarily due to higher net income. The $44.1 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to higher incentive compensation and customer program payments in the first quarter of 2014 compared
to 2013 and lower accruals in 2014 (approximately $75 million impact in aggregate), partially offset by lower working capital levels in 2014 and absence of the 2013 inventory build that did not repeat in 2014.

Net cash used in investing activities was $766.6 million in 2015 compared to $151.1 million in 2014 and $396.7 million in 2013. The increase of $615.5 million from
2014 to 2015 was primarily due to the impact of the Norcraft acquisition. The $245.6 million decrease from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, partially offset by $30.8 million in higher capital
expenditures.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $416.9 million in 2015 compared to net cash used in financing activities of $(147.5)
million in 2014 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $4.1 million in 2013. The increase in cash provided of $564.4 million in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to lower share repurchases ($388.1 million decrease) and higher net
borrowings of $185.9 million, partially offset by an increase in dividends in 2015 compared to 2014 ($12.1 million increase). The $151.6 million change in cash used by financing activities from 2013 to 2014 was due to higher share repurchases (a
$387.7 million increase compared to 2013), four dividend payments in 2014 compared to three in 2013 ($27.5 million) and lower proceeds from the exercise of stock options ($21.8 million), partially offset by higher net borrowings ($282.5 million).



Pension Plans

Subsidiaries of Fortune Brands sponsor their respective defined benefit pension plans that are funded by a portfolio of investments maintained within our benefit
plan trust. In 2015 and 2014, we contributed $2.3 million and $1.5 million, respectively, to qualified pension plans. Due to higher interest rates and higher than expected returns on pension plan assets in 2013, we did not make any pension
contributions to qualified pension plans in 2013. In 2016, we expect to make pension contributions of approximately $1 million. As of December 31, 2015, the fair value of our total pension plan assets was $561.9 million, representing funding of
74% of the accumulated benefit obligation liability. For the foreseeable future, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet the minimum funding that may be required by the Pension Protection Act of 2006.

Foreign Exchange

We have operations in various foreign
countries, principally Mexico, Canada, China and France. Therefore, changes in the value of the related currencies affect our financial statements when translated into U.S. dollars.

Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments

The following table describes our obligations and
commitments to make future payments under contracts, such as debt and lease agreements, and under contingent commitments, such as debt guarantees, as of December 31, 2015.

(a)

Interest payments on long-term debt were calculated using the borrowing rate in effect on December 31, 2015.

(b)

Purchase obligations include contracts for raw material and finished goods purchases; selling and administrative services; and capital expenditures.

(c)

Pension and postretirement contributions cannot be determined beyond 2016.

Due to the uncertainty of the timing of settlement with taxing authorities, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of unrecognized tax benefits. Therefore, $38.2
million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2015 have been excluded from the Contractual Obligations table above. See Note 15, “Income Taxes,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report
on Form 10-K.

In addition to the contractual obligations and commitments listed and described above, we also had other commercial commitments for which
we are contingently liable as of December 31, 2015. Other corporate commercial commitments include standby letters of credit of $35.7 million, in the aggregate, all of which expire in less than one year, and surety bonds of $5.2 million, in the
aggregate, of which $5.1 million expire in less than one year. These contingent commitments are not expected to have a significant impact on our liquidity.



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of December 31, 2015, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to be material to our financial condition or results of operations.

Foreign Currency Risk

Certain anticipated transactions,
assets and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. Principal currencies hedged include the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso and the Chinese yuan. We regularly monitor our foreign currency exposures in order to maximize the overall
effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions.

Derivative Financial Instruments

In accordance with ASC requirements for Derivatives and Hedging, we recognize all derivative contracts as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet, and
the measurement of those instruments is at fair value. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge and is effective, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in
earnings in the same period. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and are recognized in the
consolidated statement of income when the hedged item affects earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings.

Net deferred currency gains of $3.8 million was reclassified into earnings for the year ended December 31, 2015. There was no impact of deferred currency gains/losses on earnings in 2014. Net deferred currency
gains of $2.3 million was reclassified into earnings for the year ended December 31, 2013. Based on foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2015, we estimate that $3.1 million of net currency derivative gains included in OCI as of
December 31, 2015 will be reclassified to earnings within the next twelve months.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes

In November
2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued final guidance that requires companies to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet instead of separating deferred taxes into current
and noncurrent amounts. While the guidance changes the way deferred taxes are classified on the balance sheet, companies are still required to offset deferred tax assets and liabilities for each taxpaying component within a tax jurisdiction. The
standard is effective starting January 1, 2017. We have early adopted this standard as of December 31, 2015. We have elected to apply the new standard prospectively and therefore we have not adjusted prior periods presented.

Simplifying Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments

In September 2015, the FASB issued a final standard that eliminates the requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to account for measurement-period
adjustments retrospectively. Instead, acquirers must recognize measurement-period adjustments during the period in which they determine the amounts, including the effect on earnings of any amounts they would have recorded in previous periods if the
accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The new standard is effective for the annual period beginning January 1, 2016 (calendar year 2016 for Fortune Brands).



Early application is permitted, however we elected not to early adopt. We do not expect this standard to have a material effect on our financial statements.

Simplifying Subsequent Measurement of Inventory

In July
2015, the FASB issued a final standard that simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventory by replacing lower of cost or market test under the current U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Under the current guidance
the subsequent measurement of inventory is measured at the lower of cost or market, where “market” may have multiple possible outcomes. The new guidance requires subsequent measurement of inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable
value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs to sell (completion, disposal, and transportation). This new standard is effective for the annual period beginning
January 1, 2017 (calendar year 2017 for Fortune Brands). Earlier application is permitted, however we elected not to early adopt. We do not expect this standard to have a material effect on our financial statements.

Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share

In May 2015, the FASB issued a final standard that eliminates the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy investments whose fair values are measured at net asset value. Instead, entities will be
required to disclose the fair values of such investments so that financial statement users can reconcile amounts reported in the fair value hierarchy table and the amounts reported on the balance sheet. The new guidance will be applied
retrospectively and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 (calendar year 2016 for Fortune Brands). Early adoption is permitted, however we elected not to early adopt. We do not expect this standard to have a material
effect on our financial statements.

Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs

In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2015-03, “Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.” This ASU
requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability, instead of as a deferred charge (i.e., as an asset). This new standard is effective for the annual
period beginning after December 15, 2015 (calendar year 2016 for Fortune Brands), and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted, however we elected not to early adopt. The guidance will be applied on a
retrospective basis. The adoption of this ASU will require us to reclassify approximately $3 million of debt issuance costs from a deferred asset to long-term debt as of March 31, 2016.

Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern

In August 2014, the
FASB issued ASU 2014-15, “Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.” This ASU provides guidance about management’s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an
entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. This amendment is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016 (calendar year 2016 for Fortune Brands), and for annual periods
and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. We elected not to early adopt. We do not expect this standard to have a material effect on our financial statements.

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts
with Customers.” This ASU clarifies the accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and specifies the



disclosures that an entity should include in its financial statements. Further, in August 2015, the FASB issued a standard, which clarified that the amendment is effective for annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (calendar year 2018 for Fortune Brands). We are assessing the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our significant accounting policies are
described in Note 2, “Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP.
Preparation of the financial statements requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reflected in the financial statements and revenues and expenses reported for the relevant reporting
periods. We believe the policies discussed below are the Company’s critical accounting policies as they include the more significant, subjective and complex judgments and estimates made when preparing our consolidated financial statements.

Allowances for Doubtful Accounts

Trade
receivables are recorded at the stated amount, less allowances for discounts, doubtful accounts and returns. The allowances for doubtful accounts represent estimated uncollectible receivables associated with potential customer defaults on
contractual obligations (usually due to customers’ potential insolvency) or discounts related to early payment of accounts receivables by our customers. The allowances include provisions for certain customers where a risk of default has been
specifically identified. In addition, the allowances include a provision for customer defaults on a general formula basis when it is determined that the risk of some default is probable and estimable, but cannot yet be associated with specific
customers. The assessment of the likelihood of customer defaults is based on various factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, historical collection experience and existing economic conditions. In accordance with this
policy, our allowance for doubtful accounts was $5.8 million and $5.4 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Inventories

Inventory provisions are recorded to reduce inventory to the lower of cost or market value for obsolete or slow moving inventory based on
assumptions about future demand and marketability of products, the impact of new product introductions, inventory levels and turns, product spoilage and specific identification of items, such as product discontinuance, engineering/material changes,
or regulatory-related changes.

Long-lived Assets

In accordance with ASC requirements for Property, Plant and Equipment, a long-lived asset (including amortizable identifiable intangible assets) or asset group
held for use is tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. When such events occur, we compare the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use
and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group to the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group. The cash flows are based on our best estimate of future cash flows derived from the most recent business projections. If this
comparison indicates that there is an impairment, the amount of the impairment is calculated based on fair value. Fair value is estimated primarily using discounted expected future cash flows on a market-participant basis.

In 2014, as a result of our decision to sell the Waterloo tool storage business, we recorded $9.1 million of pre-tax impairment charges in order to remeasure this
business at the estimated fair value less



costs to sell. These charges consisted of $8.1 million for fixed assets and $1.0 million for definite-lived intangible assets. In 2013, our Cabinets segment abandoned certain software developed
for internal use, which resulted in a pre-tax impairment charge of $21.2 million.

Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets

In accordance with ASC requirements for Intangibles—Goodwill and Other, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter, and written
down when impaired. An interim impairment test is performed if an event occurs or conditions change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below the carrying value.

We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill using a weighting of the income (80%) and market (20%) approaches. For the income approach, we use a
discounted cash flow model, estimating the future cash flows of the reporting units to which the goodwill relates and then discount the future cash flows at a market-participant-derived weighted-average cost of capital. In determining the estimated
future cash flows, we consider current and projected future levels of income based on management’s plans for that business; business trends, prospects and market and economic conditions; and market-participant considerations. Furthermore, our
cash flow projections used to assess impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets are significantly influenced by our projection for the continued recovery of the U.S. home products market, our annual operating plans finalized in the
fourth quarter of each year, and our ability to execute on various planned cost reduction initiatives supporting operating income improvements. Our projection for the U.S. home products market is inherently uncertain and is subject to a number of
factors, such as employment, home prices, credit availability, new home starts and the rate of home foreclosures. For the market approach, we apply market multiples for peer groups to the current operating results of the reporting units to determine
each reporting unit’s fair value. The Company’s reporting units are operating segments. When the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we measure and recognize the amount of the goodwill impairment loss,
if any. Impairment losses, limited to the carrying value of goodwill, represent the excess of the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of a reporting unit’s
goodwill is estimated based on a hypothetical allocation of each reporting unit’s fair value to all of its underlying assets and liabilities.

The
significant assumptions that are used to determine the estimated fair value for goodwill impairment testing included the following: third-party market forecasts of U.S. new home starts and home repair and remodel spending; management’s sales,
profit and cash flow forecasts; peer company EBITDA earnings multiples; the market-participant-based weighted-average cost of capital; and the perpetuity growth rate. Our estimates of reporting unit fair values are based on certain assumptions that
may differ from our historical and future actual operating performance. Specifically, assumptions related to growth in the new construction and repair and remodel segments of the U.S. home products markets drive our forecasted sales growth. The
market forecasts are developed using independent third-party forecasts from multiple sources. In addition, estimated future profit margins and cash flow consider our historical performance at similar levels of sales volume and management’s
future operating plans as reflected in annual and long-term plans that are reviewed and approved by management.

Purchased intangible assets other than
goodwill are amortized over their useful lives unless those lives are determined to be indefinite. The determination of the useful life of an intangible asset other than goodwill is based on factors including historical and tradename performance
with respect to consumer name recognition, geographic market presence, market share, and plans for ongoing tradename support and promotion, customer attrition rates, and other relevant factors. Certain of our tradenames have been assigned an
indefinite life as we currently anticipate that these tradenames will contribute cash flows to the Company indefinitely. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not



amortized, but are evaluated at least annually to determine whether the indefinite useful life is appropriate. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth
quarter, and whenever market or business events indicate there may be a potential impairment of that intangible. Impairment losses are recorded to the extent that the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value.
The significant assumptions that are used to determine the estimated fair value for indefinite-lived intangible asset testing are third-party market forecasts of U.S. new home starts and home repair and remodel spending; management’s sales and
profit margin forecasts; the market-participant weighted-average cost of capital; and the perpetuity growth rate. Impairment losses are recorded to the extent that the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value.
We measure fair value using the standard relief-from-royalty approach which estimates the present value of royalty income that could be hypothetically earned by licensing the brand name to a third party over the remaining useful life. We first
assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. Qualitative factors include changes in volume, customers and the industry. If it is deemed more likely than not that an
intangible asset is impaired, we will perform a quantitative impairment test.

In 2015, 2014 and 2013, we did not record any asset impairment charges in
operating income associated with goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets.

The events and/or circumstances that could have a potential negative
effect on the estimated fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived tradenames include: actual new construction and repair and remodel growth rates that lag our assumptions, actions of key customers, volatility of discount rates,
continued economic uncertainty, higher levels of unemployment, weak consumer confidence, lower levels of discretionary consumer spending and a decrease in royalty rates. We cannot predict the occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstances
that might adversely affect the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.

Defined Benefit Plans

We have a number of pension plans in the United States, covering many of the Company’s employees. In addition, the Company provides postretirement health care
and life insurance benefits to certain retirees.

We recognize changes in the fair value of pension plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in
excess of 10 percent of the greater of the fair value of pension plan assets or each plan’s projected benefit obligation (the “corridor”) in earnings immediately upon remeasurement, which is at least annually in the fourth quarter of
each year. Net actuarial gains and losses occur when actual experience differs from any of the assumptions used to value defined benefit plans or when assumptions change as they may each year. The primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and
losses are changes in the discount rate used to value obligations as of the measurement date and the differences between expected and actual returns on pension plan assets. This accounting method results in the potential for volatile and difficult
to forecast gains and losses. The pre-tax recognition of actuarial losses was $2.5 million, $13.7 million and $5.2 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The total net actuarial losses in accumulated other comprehensive income for all defined
benefit plans were $71.4 million as of December 31, 2015, compared to $77.7 million as of December 31, 2014. The $6.3 million change was primarily due to higher discount rates at December 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014.

We record amounts relating to these defined benefit plans based on various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed rates of return,
compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current economic conditions and trends. We believe that the
assumptions utilized in recording our obligations under our plans are reasonable based on our



experience and on advice from our independent actuaries; however, differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect our financial condition or results of
operations. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on the nature of the plans’ investments, our current asset allocation and our expectations for long-term rates of return. The weighted-average long-term expected rate of return
on pension plan assets for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was 6.8% and 7.4%, respectively. Compensation increases reflect expected future compensation trends. The discount rate used to measure obligations is based on a spot-rate
yield curve on a plan-by-plan basis that matches projected future benefit payments with the appropriate interest rate applicable to the timing of the projected future benefit payments. The bond portfolio used for the selection of the discount rate
is from the top quartile of bonds rated by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, and includes only non-callable bonds and those that are deemed to be sufficiently marketable with a Moody’s credit rating of Aa or higher. The
weighted-average discount rate for defined benefit liabilities as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 was 4.6% and 4.2%, respectively.

For
postretirement benefits, our health care trend rate assumption is based on historical cost increases and expectations for long-term increases. As of December 31, 2015, for postretirement medical and prescription drugs in the next year, our
assumption was an assumed rate of increase of 7.3% for pre-65 retirees and 8.2% for post-65 retirees, declining until reaching an ultimate assumed rate of increase of 4.5% per year in 2024. As of December 31, 2014, for postretirement
medical and prescription drugs in the next year, our assumption was an assumed rate of increase of 7.6% for pre-65 retirees and 7.5% for post-65 retirees, declining until reaching an ultimate assumed rate of increase of 4.5% per year in 2022.

Below is a table showing pre-tax pension and postretirement expenses, including the impact of actuarial gains and losses:

The actuarial losses in 2015 were due to lower asset returns partially offset by higher discount rates. The actuarial losses in
2014 were due to a reduction in the discount rates used to measure plan benefit obligations, as well as change to the new Society of Actuaries RP-2014 mortality tables and improvement index (approximately $48 million). The actuarial losses in 2013
were principally due to plan amendments to reduce retiree health benefits that decreased the benefit obligations. Discount rates in 2015 used to determine benefit obligations increased by an average of 40 basis points for pension benefits and an
average of 50 basis points for postretirement benefits. Discount rates in 2014 used to determine benefit obligations decreased by an average of 80 basis points for both pension benefits and postretirement benefits. Discount rates in 2013 used to
determine benefit obligations increased by an average of 80 basis points for pension benefits and increased by an average of 60 basis points for postretirement benefits. The changes in discount rates was due to changes in interest rates for the bond
portfolio that comprises our spot-rate yield curve. Our spot-rate yield curve is based on high quality bond interest rates. Our actual return on plan assets in 2015 was (2.1)% compared to an actuarial assumption of an average 6.8% expected return.
Our actual return on plan assets in 2014 was 9.8% compared to an actuarial assumption of an average 7.4% expected return.



Significant actuarial losses in future periods would be expected if discount rates decline, actual returns on plan assets are lower than our expected return, or a combination of both occurs.

A 25 basis point change in our discount rate assumption would lead to an increase or decrease in our pension and postretirement liability of
approximately $25 million. A 25 basis point change in the long-term rate of return on plan assets used in accounting for our pension plans would have a $1.4 million impact on pension expense. In addition, if required, actuarial gains and losses will
be recorded in accordance with our defined benefit plan accounting method as previously described. It is not possible to forecast or predict whether there will be actuarial gains and losses in future periods, and if required, the magnitude of any
such adjustment. These gains and losses are driven by differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions that are beyond our control, such as changes in interest rates and the actual return on pension plan assets.

Income Taxes

In accordance with ASC requirements for
Income Taxes, we establish deferred tax liabilities or assets for temporary differences between financial and tax reporting bases and subsequently adjust them to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences
reverse. We record a valuation allowance reducing deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.

We record
liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is recognition, where we evaluate whether an individual tax position has a likelihood of greater than 50% of being sustained upon examination based on the
technical merits of the position, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. For tax positions that are currently estimated to have a less than 50% likelihood of being sustained, no tax benefit is recorded. For tax
positions that have met the recognition threshold in the first step, we perform the second step of measuring the benefit to be recorded. The actual benefits ultimately realized may differ from our estimates. In future periods, changes in facts,
circumstances, and new information may require us to change the recognition and measurement estimates with regard to individual tax positions. Changes in recognition and measurement estimates are recorded in the consolidated statement of income and
consolidated balance sheet in the period in which such changes occur. As of December 31, 2015, we had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits pertaining to uncertain tax positions totaling $38.2 million. It is reasonably possible that the
unrecognized tax benefits may decrease in the range of $7.5 million to $12.5 million in the next 12 months primarily as a result of the conclusion of U.S. federal, state and foreign income tax proceedings.

Customer Program Costs

Customer programs and incentives
are a common practice in our businesses. Our businesses incur customer program costs to obtain favorable product placement, to promote sales of products and to maintain competitive pricing. Customer program costs and incentives, including rebates
and promotion and volume allowances, are accounted for in either “net sales” or the category “selling, general and administrative expenses” at the time the program is initiated and/or the revenue is recognized. The costs are
predominantly recognized in “net sales” and include, but are not limited to, volume allowances and rebates, promotional allowances, and cooperative advertising programs. These costs are recorded at the later of the time of sale or the
implementation of the program based on management’s best estimates. Estimates are based on historical and projected experience for each type of program or customer. Volume allowances are accrued based on management’s estimates of customer
volume achievement and other factors incorporated into customer agreements, such as new products, store sell-through, merchandising support, levels of returns and customer training. Management periodically reviews accruals for these rebates and
allowances, and adjusts



accruals when circumstances indicate (typically as a result of a change in volume expectations). The costs typically recognized in “selling, general and administrative expenses” include
product displays, point of sale materials and media production costs.

Litigation Contingencies

Our businesses are subject to risks related to threatened or pending litigation and are routinely defendants in lawsuits associated with the normal conduct of
business. Liabilities and costs associated with litigation-related loss contingencies require estimates and judgments based on our knowledge of the facts and circumstances surrounding each matter and the advice of our legal counsel. We record
liabilities for litigation-related losses when a loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss in accordance with ASC requirements for Contingencies. We evaluate the measurement of recorded liabilities each reporting period
based on the then-current facts and circumstances specific to each matter. The ultimate losses incurred upon final resolution of litigation-related loss contingencies may differ materially from the estimated liability recorded at any particular
balance sheet date. Changes in estimates are recorded in earnings in the period in which such changes occur.

Environmental Matters

We are involved in remediation activities to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws. Liabilities for remediation costs of each site are
based on our best estimate of undiscounted future costs, excluding possible insurance recoveries or recoveries from other third parties. Uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations, technology and information related to individual sites make
it difficult to develop estimates of environmental remediation exposures. Some of the potential liabilities relate to sites we own, and some relate to sites we no longer own or never owned. Several of our subsidiaries have been designated as
potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”) under “Superfund” or similar state laws. As of December 31, 2015, ten such instances have not been dismissed, settled or otherwise resolved. In the calendar year 2015, none of our
subsidiaries were identified as a PRP in any new instances and no instances were settled, dismissed or otherwise resolved. In most instances where our subsidiaries are named as a PRP, we enter into cost-sharing arrangements with other PRPs. We give
notice to insurance carriers of potential PRP liability, but very rarely, if ever, receive reimbursement from insurance for PRP costs. We believe that the cost of complying with the present environmental protection laws, before considering estimated
recoveries either from other PRPs or insurance, will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had accruals of $2.8 million, relating to environmental
compliance and clean up including, but not limited to, the above mentioned Superfund sites.

Item 7A. Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency
exchange rates and commodity prices. Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We do not enter into derivatives or other
financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We enter into financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The counterparties are major financial institutions.

Interest Rate Risk

A hypothetical 100 basis
point change in interest rates affecting the Company’s external variable rate borrowings as of December 31, 2015, would be $2.8 million on a pre-tax basis.



Foreign Exchange Rate Risk

We enter into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies, thereby limiting our risk that would otherwise result from changes in
exchange rates. The periods of the forward foreign exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the hedged transactions.

The estimated fair value of
foreign currency contracts represents the amount required to enter into offsetting contracts with similar remaining maturities based on quoted market prices.

The estimated potential loss under foreign exchange contracts from movement in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. As part of our
risk management procedure, we use a value-at-risk (“VAR”) sensitivity analysis model to estimate the maximum potential economic loss from adverse changes in foreign exchange rates over a one-day period given a 95% confidence level. The VAR
model uses historical foreign exchange rates to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods. The estimated maximum one-day loss in the fair value of the Company’s foreign currency exchange contracts using the VAR
model was $1.1 million at December 31, 2015. The 95% confidence interval signifies our degree of confidence that actual losses under foreign exchange contracts would not exceed the estimated losses. The amounts disregard the possibility that
foreign currency exchange rates could move in our favor. The VAR model assumes that all movements in the foreign exchange rates will be adverse. These amounts should not be considered projections of future losses, since actual results may differ
significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets. The VAR model is a risk analysis tool and should not be construed as an endorsement of the VAR model or the accuracy of the related assumptions.

Commodity Price Risk

We are subject to commodity price
volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, geopolitical and economic variables, and other unpredictable external factors. From time to time, we use derivative contracts to manage our exposure to commodity price volatility.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1.    Background and Basis of Presentation

The Company is a leading home and security products company with a portfolio of leading branded products used for residential home repair, remodeling, new construction and security applications. References to
(i) “Fortune Brands,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” refer to Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries as a whole, unless the context otherwise
requires, after giving effect to the spin-off of Fortune Brands from Fortune Brands, Inc. in 2011 and (ii) “Former Parent” refer to Fortune Brands, Inc.

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Fortune Brands and its majority-owned subsidiaries. The Company’s subsidiaries operate on a 52
or 53-week fiscal year.

The consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K were derived principally from the
consolidated financial statements of the Company. In May 2015, we acquired Norcraft Companies, Inc. (“Norcraft”). The financial results of Norcraft have been included in the Company’s consolidated statements of income and consolidated
statements of cash flow beginning in May 2015 and the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. On September 10, 2015, we completed the sale of Waterloo Industries, Inc. (“Waterloo”), our tool storage business.
Therefore, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) requirements, the results of operations of Waterloo through the date of sale, were classified and separately stated as discontinued operations in the accompanying
consolidated statements of income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. The assets and liabilities of Waterloo were classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of
December 31, 2014. In September 2014, we sold all of the shares of stock of Fortune Brands Windows, Inc., our subsidiary that owned and operated the Simonton windows business (“Simonton”). Therefore, in accordance with ASC
requirements, the results of operations of Simonton were reclassified and separately stated as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for 2014 and 2013. The cash flows from discontinued operations for 2015,
2014 and 2013 were not separately classified on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Information on Business Segments was revised to exclude these discontinued operations.

2.    Significant Accounting Policies

Use of Estimates

The presentation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
(“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results in future periods could differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less are included in cash and cash equivalents.

Allowances for Doubtful Accounts

Trade receivables are recorded at the stated amount, less allowances for discounts, doubtful
accounts and returns. The allowances for doubtful accounts represent estimated uncollectible receivables associated with potential customer defaults on contractual obligations (usually due to customers’ potential insolvency), or discounts
related to early payment of accounts receivables by our customers. The allowances include provisions for certain customers where a risk of default has been specifically identified. In addition, the allowances include a provision for customer
defaults on a general formula basis when it is determined the risk of some default is probable and estimable, but cannot yet be associated with specific customers. The



assessment of the likelihood of customer defaults is based on various factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, historical collection experience and existing economic
conditions. In accordance with this policy, our allowance for doubtful accounts was $5.8 million and $5.4 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Inventories

The majority of our inventories are accounted for using the first-in, first-out inventory method. Inventory provisions are recorded to reduce inventory to the lower of cost
or market value for obsolete or slow moving inventory based on assumptions about future demand and marketability of products, the impact of new product introductions, inventory levels and turns, product spoilage and specific identification of items,
such as product discontinuance, engineering/material changes, or regulatory-related changes.

We also use the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”)
inventory method in those product groups in which metals inventories comprise a significant portion of our inventories. LIFO inventories at December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $227.9 million (with a current cost of $243.1 million) and $197.6
million (with a current cost of $217.5 million), respectively.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and
equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation is provided, principally on a straight-line basis, over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Gains or losses resulting from dispositions are included in operating income. Betterments and renewals,
which improve and extend the life of an asset, are capitalized; maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred. Assets held for use to be disposed of at a future date are depreciated over the remaining useful life. Assets to be sold are
written down to fair value at the time the assets are being actively marketed for sale. Estimated useful lives of the related assets are as follows:

Buildings and leasehold improvements

15 to 40 years

Machinery and equipment

3 to 10 years

Software

3 to 7 years

Long-lived Assets

In accordance with ASC requirements for Property, Plant and Equipment, a long-lived
asset (including amortizable identifiable intangible assets) or asset group held for use is tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. When such events occur, we
compare the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group to the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group. The cash flows are based on our best estimate of
future cash flows derived from the most recent business projections. If this comparison indicates that there is an impairment, the amount of the impairment is calculated based on fair value. Fair value is estimated primarily using discounted
expected future cash flows on a market-participant basis.

Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets

In accordance
with ASC requirements for Intangibles — Goodwill and Other, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter, and written down when impaired. An interim impairment test is performed if an event occurs or conditions
change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below the carrying value.

We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill
using a weighting of the income (80%) and market (20%) approaches. For the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow model, estimating the future cash flows of the reporting units to which the goodwill relates, and then discounting
the future cash flows at a market-participant-derived weighted-average cost of capital. In determining the estimated future cash flows, we consider current and projected future levels of income based on



management’s plans for that business; business trends, prospects and market and economic conditions; and market-participant considerations. Furthermore, our projection for the U.S. home
products market is inherently subject to a number of uncertain factors, such as employment, home prices, credit availability, new home starts and the rate of home foreclosures. For the market approach, we apply market multiples for peer groups to
the current operating results of the reporting units to determine each reporting unit’s fair value. The Company’s reporting units are operating segments. When the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we
measure and recognize the amount of the goodwill impairment loss, if any. Impairment losses, limited to the carrying value of goodwill, represent the excess of the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of
that goodwill. The implied fair value of a reporting unit is estimated based on a hypothetical allocation of each reporting unit’s fair value to all of its underlying assets and liabilities.

Purchased intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their useful lives unless those lives are determined to be indefinite. The determination of the
useful life of an intangible asset other than goodwill is based on factors including historical and tradename performance with respect to consumer name recognition, geographic market presence, market share, and plans for ongoing tradename support
and promotion. Certain of our tradenames have been assigned an indefinite life as we currently anticipate that these tradenames will contribute cash flows to the Company indefinitely. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are
evaluated at least annually to determine whether the indefinite useful life is appropriate. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, and whenever market or business events indicate there may be a
potential impairment of that intangible. Impairment losses are recorded to the extent that the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value. We measure fair value using the standard relief-from-royalty approach
which estimates the present value of royalty income that could be hypothetically earned by licensing the brand name to a third party over the remaining useful life. We first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not
that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. Qualitative factors include changes in volume, customers and the industry. If it is deemed more likely than not that an intangible asset is impaired, we will perform a quantitative impairment
test.

The Company cannot predict the occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstances that might adversely affect the carrying value of
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Such events may include, but are not limited to, the impact of the economic environment; a material negative change in relationships with significant customers; or strategic decisions made in response
to economic and competitive conditions.

Defined Benefit Plans

We have a number of pension plans in the United States,
covering many of the Company’s employees. In addition, the Company provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to certain retirees.

We record amounts relating to these plans based on calculations in accordance with ASC requirements for Compensation — Retirement Benefits, which include various actuarial assumptions, including discount
rates, assumed rates of return, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. We recognize changes in the fair value of pension plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the
fair value of pension plan assets or each plan’s projected benefit obligation (the “corridor”) in earnings immediately upon remeasurement, which is at least annually in the fourth quarter of each year. We review our actuarial
assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current economic conditions and trends. The discount rate used to measure obligations is based on a spot-rate yield curve on a plan-by-plan basis that matches
projected future benefit payments with the appropriate interest rate applicable to the timing of the projected future benefit payments. The expected rate of return on plan



assets is determined based on the nature of the plans’ investments, our current asset allocation and our expectations for long-term rates of return. Compensation increases reflect expected
future compensation trends. For postretirement benefits, our health care trend rate assumption is based on historical cost increases and expectations for long-term increases. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing
benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the related employees. We believe that the assumptions utilized in recording
obligations under our plans, which are presented in Note 14, “Defined Benefit Plans,” are reasonable based on our experience and on advice from our independent actuaries; however, differences in actual experience or changes in the
assumptions may materially affect our financial position and results of operations. We will continue to monitor these assumptions as market conditions warrant.

Litigation Contingencies

Our businesses are subject to risks related to threatened or pending litigation and are routinely defendants in lawsuits associated with the normal conduct of
business. Liabilities and costs associated with litigation-related loss contingencies require estimates and judgments based on our knowledge of the facts and circumstances surrounding each matter and the advice of our legal counsel. We record
liabilities for litigation-related losses when a loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss in accordance with ASC requirements for Contingencies. We evaluate the measurement of recorded liabilities each reporting period
based on the then-current facts and circumstances specific to each matter. The ultimate losses incurred upon final resolution of litigation-related loss contingencies may differ materially from the estimated liability recorded at any particular
balance sheet date. Changes in estimates are recorded in earnings in the period in which such changes occur.

Income
Taxes

In accordance with ASC requirements for Income Taxes, we establish deferred tax liabilities or assets for temporary differences between financial and tax reporting bases and subsequently adjust them to reflect
changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. We record a valuation allowance reducing deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.

We record liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is recognition, where we evaluate whether an individual tax
position has a likelihood of greater than 50% of being sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. For tax positions that are currently estimated to
have a less than 50% likelihood of being sustained, no tax benefit is recorded. For tax positions that have met the recognition threshold in the first step, we perform the second step of measuring the benefit to be recorded. The actual benefits
ultimately realized may differ from our estimates. In future periods, changes in facts, circumstances, and new information may require us to change the recognition and measurement estimates with regard to individual tax positions. Changes in
recognition and measurement estimates are recorded in the consolidated statement of income and consolidated balance sheet in the period in which such changes occur. As of December 31, 2015, we had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits
pertaining to uncertain tax positions totaling $38.2 million. It is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits may decrease in the range of $7.5 million to $12.5 million in the next 12 months primarily as a result of the conclusion of
U.S. federal, state and foreign income tax proceedings.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recorded when persuasive evidence
that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Revenue is recorded net of applicable provisions for discounts, returns and allowances. We record estimates for
reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentives, including price discounts, volume-based incentives, promotions and cooperative advertising when revenue is recognized. Sales returns are based on historical returns, current trends and
forecasts of product demand.



Cost of Products Sold

Cost of products sold includes all costs to make products
saleable, such as labor costs, inbound freight, purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs and internal transfer costs. In addition, all depreciation expense associated with assets used to manufacture products and make them saleable is
included in cost of products sold.

Customer Program Costs

Customer programs and incentives are a common practice in our
businesses. Our businesses incur customer program costs to obtain favorable product placement, to promote sales of products and to maintain competitive pricing. Customer program costs and incentives, including rebates and promotion and volume
allowances, are accounted for in either “net sales” or the category “selling, general and administrative expenses” at the time the program is initiated and/or the revenue is recognized. The costs are predominantly recognized in
“net sales” and include, but are not limited to, volume allowances and rebates, promotional allowances, and cooperative advertising programs. These costs are recorded at the later of the time of sale or the implementation of the program
based on management’s best estimates. Estimates are based on historical and projected experience for each type of program or customer. Volume allowances are accrued based on management’s estimates of customer volume achievement and other
factors incorporated into customer agreements, such as new product purchases, store sell-through, merchandising support, levels of returns and customer training. Management periodically reviews accruals for these rebates and allowances, and adjusts
accruals when circumstances indicate (typically as a result of a change in volume expectations). The costs typically recognized in “selling, general and administrative expenses” include product displays, point of sale materials and media
production costs. The costs included in the “selling, general and administrative expenses” category were $43.2 million, $43.4 million and $43.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses include advertising costs; marketing costs;
selling costs, including commissions; research and development costs; shipping and handling costs, including warehousing costs; and general and administrative expenses. Shipping and handling costs included in selling, general and administrative
expenses were $184.6 million, $169.7 million and $161.2 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively

.

Advertising costs, which amounted to
$195.4 million, $200.4 million and $197.1 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, are principally expensed as incurred. Advertising costs include product displays, media production costs and point of sale materials. Advertising costs recorded
as a reduction to net sales, primarily cooperative advertising, were $63.2 million, $66.8 million and $56.8 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Advertising costs recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses were $132.2 million,
$133.6 million and $140.3 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Research and development expenses include product development, product
improvement, product engineering and process improvement costs. Research and development expenses, which were $48.7 million, $46.1 million and $50.8 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, are expensed as incurred.

Stock-based Compensation

Stock-based compensation expense, measured as the fair value of an award on the date of grant, is recognized
in the financial statements over the period that an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award. The fair value of each option award is measured on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value
of each performance award is based on the stock price at the date of grant and the probability of meeting performance targets. The fair value of each restricted stock unit granted is equal to the share price at the date of grant. See Note 13,
“Stock-Based Compensation,” for additional information.



Earnings Per Share

Earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income
attributable to Fortune Brands by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share include the impact of all potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the year. See Note
20, “Earnings Per Share,” for further discussion.

Foreign Currency Translation

Foreign currency balance sheet
accounts are translated into U.S. dollars at the actual rates of exchange at the balance sheet date. Income and expenses are translated at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period for the foreign subsidiaries where the local
currency is the functional currency. The related translation adjustments are made directly to a separate component of the “accumulated other comprehensive income” (“AOCI”) caption in equity. Transactions denominated in a currency
other than the functional currency of a subsidiary are translated into functional currency with resulting transaction gains or losses recorded in other expense, net.

Derivative Financial Instruments

In accordance with ASC requirements for Derivatives and Hedging, all derivatives are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet
and measurement of those instruments is at fair value. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge and is highly effective, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are
recognized in earnings in the same period. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded directly to a separate component of AOCI, and are recognized in the
consolidated statement of income when the hedged item affects earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings.

Net deferred currency gains of $3.8 million was reclassified into earnings for the year ended December 31, 2015. There was no impact of deferred currency gains/losses on earnings in 2014. Net deferred currency
gains of $2.3 million was reclassified into earnings for the years ended December 31, 2013. Based on foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2015, we estimate that $3.1 million of net currency derivative gains included in AOCI as of
December 31, 2015 will be reclassified to earnings within the next twelve months.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes

In November
2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued final guidance that requires companies to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet instead of separating deferred taxes into current
and noncurrent amounts. While the guidance changes the way deferred taxes are classified on the balance sheet, companies are still required to offset deferred tax assets and liabilities for each taxpaying component within a tax jurisdiction. The
standard is effective starting January 1, 2017. We have early adopted this standard as of December 31, 2015. We have elected to apply the new standard prospectively and therefore we have not adjusted prior periods presented.

Simplifying Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments

In September 2015, the FASB issued a final standard that eliminates the requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to account for measurement-period
adjustments retrospectively. Instead, acquirers must recognize measurement-period adjustments during the period in which they determine the amounts, including the effect on earnings of any amounts they would have recorded in previous periods if the
accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The new standard is



effective for the annual period beginning January 1, 2016 (calendar year 2016 for Fortune Brands). Early application is permitted, however we elected not to early adopt. We do not expect
this standard to have a material effect on our financial statements.

Simplifying Subsequent Measurement of Inventory

In July 2015, the FASB issued a final standard that simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventory by replacing lower of cost or market test under the current
GAAP. Under the current guidance the subsequent measurement of inventory is measured at the lower of cost or market, where “market” may have multiple possible outcomes. The new guidance requires subsequent measurement of inventory at the
lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs to sell (completion, disposal, and transportation). This new standard is effective for
the annual period beginning January 1, 2017 (calendar year 2017 for Fortune Brands). Earlier application is permitted, however we elected not to early adopt. We do not expect this standard to have a material effect on our financial statements.

Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share

In May 2015, the FASB issued a final standard that eliminates the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy investments whose fair values are
measured at net asset value. Instead, entities will be required to disclose the fair values of such investments so that financial statement users can reconcile amounts reported in the fair value hierarchy table and the amounts reported on the
balance sheet. The new guidance will be applied retrospectively and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 (calendar year 2016 for Fortune Brands). Early adoption is permitted, however we elected not to early adopt. We
do not expect this standard to have a material effect on our financial statements.

Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs

In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2015-03, “Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance
Costs.” This ASU requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability, instead of as a deferred charge (i.e., as an asset). This new standard is
effective for the annual period beginning after December 15, 2015 (calendar year 2016 for Fortune Brands), and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted, however we elected not to early adopt. The guidance
will be applied on a retrospective basis. The adoption of this ASU will require us to reclassify approximately $3 million of debt issuance costs from a deferred asset to long-term debt as of March 31, 2016.

Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, “Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.” This ASU provides guidance about management’s responsibility
to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. This amendment is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016 (calendar
year 2016 for Fortune Brands), and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted, however we elected not to early adopt. We do not expect this standard to have a material effect on our financial statements.



Revenue from Contracts with Customers

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers.” This ASU clarifies the accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and specifies the disclosures that an
entity should include in its financial statements. Further, in August 2015, the FASB issued a standard, which clarified that the amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (calendar year 2018 for
Fortune Brands), and annual and interim periods thereafter. We are assessing the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements.

3.    Balance Sheet Information

Supplemental information on our year-end consolidated
balance sheets is as follows:

4.    Acquisitions

In May 2015, we completed our tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Norcraft, a leading publicly-owned manufacturer of kitchen and bathroom cabinetry, for a total purchase price
of $648.6 million in cash. We financed the transaction using cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facilities. Net sales and operating income for this acquired business in the year ended December 31, 2015 were approximately $258
million and $28 million, respectively. Operating income included a $2.0 million charge related to an inventory purchase accounting adjustment to fair value. The results of operations of Norcraft are included in the Cabinets segment. We incurred
$15.1 million of Norcraft acquisition-related transaction costs in the year ended December 31, 2015. The goodwill expected to be deductible for income tax purposes is approximately $60.3 million.



The following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of assets acquired
and liabilities assumed as of the date of the acquisition.

(a)

Net assets exclude $15.5 million of cash transferred to the Company as the result of the Norcraft acquisition.

The preceding purchase price allocation has been determined provisionally and is subject to revision as additional information about the fair value of individual
assets and liabilities becomes available. Any change in the acquisition date fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities will change the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill.

Goodwill includes expected sales and cost synergies. Identifiable intangible assets consist of an indefinite-lived tradename of $150 million and customer
relationships of $210 million. The useful life of the customer relationships identifiable intangible asset is estimated to be 20 years.

The following
unaudited pro forma summary presents consolidated financial information as if Norcraft had been acquired on January 1, 2014. The unaudited pro forma financial information is based on historical results of operations and financial position of
the Company and Norcraft. The pro forma results include:

>

the effect of certain transactions recorded in historical financial statements of Norcraft including: the expense relating to Norcraft’s tax receivable
agreements settled upon the acquisition of Norcraft and the pro forma effect of a release of deferred tax valuation allowance,

>

estimated amortization of a definite-lived customer relationship intangible asset,

>

the estimated cost of the inventory adjustment to fair value,

>

interest expense associated with debt that would have been incurred in connection with the acquisition,

>

the reclassification of Norcraft transaction costs from 2015 to the first quarter of 2014, and

>

adjustments to conform accounting policies.

The unaudited pro forma financial information does not necessarily represent the results that would have occurred had the acquisition occurred on January 1,
2014. In addition, the unaudited pro forma information should not be deemed to be indicative of future results.



In March 2015, we acquired a cabinets component company for approximately $6 million in cash. This acquisition did not
have a material impact on our financial statements.

In December 2014, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Anafree
Holdings, Inc., the sole owner of Anaheim Manufacturing Company (“Anaheim”), which markets and sells garbage disposals, for $28.9 million in cash. We paid the purchase price using a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our
existing credit facilities. We completed our purchase price allocation in the first half of 2015 and as a result reclassified $17 million from goodwill to other identifiable assets. The results of operations of Anaheim are included in the Plumbing
segment.

In July 2014, we acquired all of the voting equity of John D. Brush & Co., Inc. (“SentrySafe”) for a purchase price of
$116.7 million in cash. The purchase price was funded from our existing credit facilities. This acquisition broadened our product offering of security products. The results of operations of SentrySafe are included in the Security segment.

These 2014 acquisitions were not material for the purposes of supplemental disclosure and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements.

In June 2013, we acquired Woodcrafters Home Products Holding, LLC (“WoodCrafters”), a manufacturer of bathroom vanities and tops,
for a purchase price of $302.0 million. We paid the purchase price using a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facilities. This acquisition greatly expanded our offerings of bathroom cabinetry products. The results
of operations of WoodCrafters are included in the Cabinets segment.

Substantially all of the acquired goodwill was tax deductible. Goodwill primarily
represents expected supply chain synergies. Identifiable intangible assets primarily consisted of customer relationships ($75.9 million) and technology ($9.6 million). The useful lives of these identifiable intangible assets are 18 years and 10
years, respectively.

The following unaudited pro forma summary presents consolidated financial information as if WoodCrafters had been acquired on
January 1, 2013. The unaudited pro forma financial information is based on historical results of operations and financial position of the Company and WoodCrafters. The pro forma results include adjustments for the impact of a preliminary
allocation of the purchase price and interest expense associated with debt that would have been incurred in connection with the acquisition. The unaudited pro forma financial information does not necessarily represent the results that would have
occurred had the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2013. In addition, the unaudited pro forma information should not be deemed to be indicative of future results.

5.    Discontinued Operations

In 2015, we completed the sale of Waterloo for approximately $14 million in cash, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. We recorded a pre-tax loss of $16.7 million as the result of this sale. Transaction and
other sale-related costs were approximately $2.8 million. The estimated tax benefit on the sale was $26.5 million with the after-tax gain of $7.0 million recorded within discontinued operations. The estimated tax benefit resulted primarily from a
tax loss in excess of the financial



reporting loss as a result of prior period nondeductible asset impairments. Waterloo is presented as a discontinued operation in our financial statements beginning January 1, 2013 and
through the date of sale in accordance with ASC 205 requirements. Prior to classifying Waterloo as a discontinued operation, it was reported in the Security segment.

In addition, in August 2014, we entered into a stock purchase agreement to sell the Simonton business for $130 million in cash. The sale was completed in September 2014. Simonton is presented as a discontinued
operation in the Company’s financial statements in accordance with ASC requirements. The 2014 income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, included a loss on sale of the Simonton business of $111.2 million as well as $14.1 million of
restructuring and impairment charges for Waterloo in order to remeasure this business at the estimated fair value less costs to sell. Simonton was previously reported in the Doors segment.

The following table summarizes the results of discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. The year ended December 31, 2015 on a pre-tax basis consists of Waterloo only,
however comparable periods in 2014 and 2013 include both Waterloo and Simonton.

The following table summarizes the major classes of assets and liabilities of Waterloo, which is reflected as a discontinued
operation on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014:



6.    Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets

We had goodwill of $1,755.3 million and $1,467.8 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase of $287.5 million was primarily due to
the acquisitions of Norcraft and Anaheim. The change in the net carrying amount of goodwill by segment was as follows:

(a)

Net of accumulated impairment losses of $399.5 million in the Doors segment.

We also had identifiable intangible assets, principally tradenames, of $996.7 million and $656.5 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The $356.4 million increase in gross identifiable
intangible assets was primarily due to the acquisition of Norcraft.

The gross carrying value and accumulated amortization by class of intangible assets
as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:

(a)

Accumulated amortization prior to the adoption of revised ASC requirements for Intangibles — Goodwill and Other Assets.

Amortizable intangible assets, principally tradenames and customer relationships, are subject to amortization over their estimated useful life, ranging from 3 to
30 years, based on the assessment of a number of factors that may impact useful life. These factors include historical tradename performance with respect to consumer name recognition, geographic market presence, market share, plans for ongoing
tradename support and promotion, customer attrition rates, and other relevant factors. We expect to record intangible amortization of approximately $26 million in 2016, $24 million in 2017, $22 million in 2018, $21 million in 2019 and $21 million in
2020.

We review indefinite-lived tradename intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, as well as whenever market or business
events indicate there may be a potential impact on a specific intangible asset. Impairment losses are recorded to the extent that the carrying value of the indefinite-



lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value. We measure fair value using the standard relief-from-royalty approach which estimates the present value of royalty income that could be
hypothetically earned by licensing the tradename to a third party over the remaining useful life.

In 2015, 2014 and 2013, we did not record any asset
impairment charges associated with goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets.

7.    Asset Impairment Charges

No asset impairment charges were recorded in 2015 and 2014 in operating income. In 2013, our Cabinets segment abandoned certain software developed
for internal use, which resulted in a pre-tax impairment charge of $21.2 million, which was recorded in operating income on the asset impairment charges line of the income statement and reduced property, plant and equipment.

In addition, in 2014, as a result of our decision to sell Waterloo, we recorded $9.1 million of pre-tax impairment charges in order to remeasure this business at
the estimated fair value less costs to sell. These charges consisted of $8.1 million for fixed assets and $1.0 million for definite-lived intangible assets. Refer to Note 5, “Discontinued Operations,” for additional information.

8.    External Debt and Financing Arrangements

In June 2015, we issued $900 million of unsecured senior notes (“Senior Notes”) in a registered public offering. The Senior Notes consist of two tranches: $400 million of five-year notes due 2020 with a
coupon of 3% and $500 million of ten-year notes due 2025 with a coupon of 4%. We used the proceeds from the Senior Notes offering to pay down our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. On December 31, 2015, the
outstanding amount of the Senior Notes, net of underwriting commissions and price discounts, was $891.6 million.

We have a $975 million committed
revolving credit facility, as well as a term loan in the initial amount of $525 million, both of which expire in July 2018. Both facilities can be used for general corporate purposes. On December 31, 2015 and 2014, our outstanding borrowings
under the revolving credit facility were zero and $145.0 million, respectively; the amounts outstanding under the term loan were $280.0 million and $525.0 million, respectively. The interest rates under these facilities are variable based on LIBOR
at the time of the borrowing and the Company’s leverage as measured by a debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio. Based upon the Company’s debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio, the Company’s borrowing rate could range from LIBOR + 1.0% to LIBOR +
2.0%. The credit facilities also include a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio requirement of 3.0 to 1.0. The Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio is defined as the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense. Adjusted EBITDA
is defined as consolidated net income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, losses from asset impairments, and certain other one-time adjustments. Consolidated Interest Expense is as disclosed in our
financial statements. The credit facilities also include a Maximum Leverage Ratio of 3.5 to 1.0 as measured by the ratio of our debt to Adjusted EBITDA. The Maximum Leverage Ratio is permitted to increase to 3.75 to 1.0 for three succeeding quarters
in the event of an acquisition. At December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with our debt covenant ratios.

At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the
current portion of long-term debt was zero and $26.3 million, respectively. We currently have uncommitted bank lines of credit in China, which provide for unsecured borrowings for working capital of up to $25.7 million in aggregate, of which $0.8
million and zero were outstanding, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. The weighted-average interest rates on these borrowings were 1.0%, 7.6% and 12.3% in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.



The components of external long-term debt were as follows:

Senior Notes payments during the next five years as of December 31, 2015 are zero in 2016 through 2019 and $400 million in
2020. Term loan amortization payments during the next five years as of December 31, 2015 are zero in 2016, $52.5 million in 2017, $227.5 million in 2018, zero in 2019 and 2020.

In our debt agreements, there are normal and customary events of default which would permit the lenders to accelerate the debt if not cured within applicable grace periods, such as failure to pay principal or
interest when due or a change in control of the Company. There were no events of default as of December 31, 2015.

9.    Financial Instruments

We do not
enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We principally use financial instruments to reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodities used as raw materials in our products. The principal
derivative financial instruments we enter into on a routine basis are foreign exchange contracts. Derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value. The counterparties to derivative contracts are major financial institutions. We are
subject to credit risk on these contracts equal to the fair value of these instruments. Management currently believes that the risk of incurring material losses is unlikely and that the losses, if any, would be immaterial to the Company.

Raw materials used by the Company are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, geopolitical and economic variables, and other
unpredictable external factors. From time to time, we enter into commodity swaps to manage the price risk associated with forecasted purchases of materials used in our operations. We account for these commodity derivatives as economic hedges or cash
flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of economic hedges are recorded directly into current period earnings. There were no material commodity swap contracts outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.

We enter into foreign exchange contracts primarily to hedge forecasted sales and purchases denominated in select foreign currencies, thereby limiting currency risk
that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. The periods of the foreign exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the forecasted transactions, which generally do not exceed 12 to 15 months subsequent to the latest balance sheet
date.

For derivative instruments that are designated as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting
loss or gain on the hedged item, are recognized on the same line of the statement of income. The effective portions of cash flow hedges are reported in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and are recognized in the statement of income when
the hedged item affects earnings. The ineffective portion of all hedges is recognized in current period earnings. In addition, changes in the fair value of all economic hedge transactions are immediately recognized in



current period earnings. Our primary foreign currency hedge contracts pertain to the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso and the Chinese yuan. The gross U.S. dollar equivalent notional amount of
all foreign currency derivative hedges outstanding at December 31, 2015 was $226.7 million, representing a net settlement receivable of $3.7 million. Based on foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2015, we estimate that $3.1 million of
net foreign currency derivative gains included in OCI as of December 31, 2015 will be reclassified to earnings within the next twelve months.

The
fair values of foreign exchange and commodity derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 were:

The effects of derivative financial instruments on the consolidated statements of income in 2015, 2014 and 2013 were:

For cash flow hedges that are effective, the amounts recognized in OCI were gains/(losses) of $6.7 million and $(1.3) million in
2015 and 2014, respectively. In the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges recognized in other expense, net, was insignificant.

10.    Fair Value Measurements

The carrying value and fair value of debt as of
December 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:

ASC requirements for Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to
valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels. Level 1 inputs, the highest priority, are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs reflect other than quoted prices included in level 1
that are either observable directly or



through corroboration with observable market data. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs due to little or no market activity for the asset or liability, such as internally-developed valuation
models. We do not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis that are level 3.

The estimated fair value of our term
loan and the current portion thereof is determined primarily using broker quotes, which are level 2 inputs. The estimated fair value of our Senior Notes is determined by using quoted market prices of our debt securities, which are level 1 inputs.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:

The principal derivative financial instruments we enter into on a routine basis are foreign exchange contracts. In addition, from
time to time, we enter into commodity swaps. Derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value.

In 2015 and 2014, we did not record
impairment charges in operating income. In 2013, we recorded pre-tax intangible asset impairment charges of $21.2 million, refer to Note 7, “Asset Impairment Charges,” for additional information. There were no losses for indefinite-lived
intangible assets in 2015, 2014 and 2013.

11.    Capital Stock

The Company has 750 million authorized shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share. The number of shares of common stock and treasury stock and the share activity for 2015 and 2014 were as follows:

In December 2015, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 14% to $0.16 per share of our common stock.

The Company has 60 million authorized shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share. At December 31, 2015, no shares of our preferred
stock were outstanding. Our Board of Directors has the authority, without action by the Company’s stockholders, to designate and issue our preferred



stock in one or more series and to designate the rights, preferences, limitations and privileges of each series of preferred stock, which may be greater than the rights of the Company’s
common stock.

In 2015, we repurchased 1,091,067 shares of outstanding common stock under the Company’s share repurchase programs at cost of $51.7
million. As of December 31, 2015, the Company’s total remaining share repurchase authorization under the remaining program was approximately $247.8 million. The share repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any
specific dollar amount or number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

12.    Accumulated Other
Comprehensive (Loss) Income

The reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income for the year ended December 31, 2015
and 2014 were as follows:

(a)

These accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income components are included in the computation of net periodic benefit cost. Refer to Note 14, “Defined
Benefit Plans,” for additional information.

(b)

These accumulated other comprehensive loss components are included in discontinued operations.



Total accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income consists of net income and other changes in business equity from
transactions and other events from sources other than shareholders. It includes currency translation gains and losses, unrealized gains and losses from derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, and defined benefit plan adjustments. The
after-tax components of and changes in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income were as follows:

13.    Stock-Based Compensation

As of December 31, 2015, we had awards outstanding under two Long-Term Incentive Plans, the Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) and the 2011
Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2011 Plan”, and together with the Plan — the “Plans”). During 2013, our stockholders approved the Plan, which provides for the granting of stock options, performance share awards, restricted
stock units, and other equity-based awards, to employees, directors and consultants. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 7 million shares of common stock remained authorized for issuance under the Plan. In addition, shares of common
stock may be automatically added to the number of shares of common stock that may be issued as awards expire, are terminated, cancelled or forfeited, or are used to satisfy withholding taxes with respect to existing awards under the Plans. No new
stock-based awards can be made under the 2011 Plan, but there are outstanding awards under the 2011 Plan that continue to vest and/or be exercisable. Upon the exercise or payment of stock-based awards, shares of common stock are issued from
authorized common shares.



Pre-tax stock-based compensation expense from continuing operations was as follows:

Compensation costs that were capitalized in inventory were not material.

Restricted Stock Units

Restricted stock units have been granted to officers and certain employees of the
Company and represent the right to receive unrestricted shares of Company common stock subject to continued employment. Restricted stock units granted to certain officers are also subject to attaining specific performance criteria. Compensation cost
is recognized over the service period. We calculate the fair value of each restricted stock unit granted by using the average of the high and low share prices on the date of grant. Restricted stock units generally vest ratably over a three-year
period.

A summary of activity with respect to restricted stock units outstanding under the Plans for the year ended December 31, 2015 was as
follows:

The remaining unrecognized pre-tax compensation cost related to restricted stock units at December 31, 2015 was approximately
$17.8 million, and the weighted-average period of time over which this cost will be recognized is 1.9 years. The fair value of restricted stock units that vested during 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $24.9 million, $31.1 million and $26.9 million,
respectively.

Stock Option Awards

Stock
options were granted to officers and select employees of the Company and represent the right to purchase shares of Company common stock subject to continued employment through each vesting date.

All stock-based compensation to employees is required to be measured at fair value and expensed over the requisite service period. We recognize compensation
expense on awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. Stock options granted under the Plans generally vest over a three-year period and have a maturity of ten years from the grant date.



The fair value of Fortune Brands options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model
with the assumptions shown in the following table:

The determination of expected volatility is based on a blended peer group volatility for companies in similar industries, at a
similar stage of life and with similar market capitalization because there is not sufficient historical volatility data for Fortune Brands common stock over the period commensurate with the expected term of stock options, as well as other relevant
factors. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the stock options. The expected term is the period over which our employees are expected to hold their options. It is based
on the simplified method from the Securities and Exchange Commission’s safe harbor guidelines. The dividend yield is based on the Company’s estimated dividend over the expected term. The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock
options granted under the Plans during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $11.58, $12.72 and $9.02, respectively.

A summary of
Fortune Brands stock option activity related to Fortune Brands and our Former Parent employees for the year ended December 31, 2015 was as follows:

Options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2015 were as follows:

(a)

At December 31, 2015, the aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding was $215.5 million.

(b)

At December 31, 2015, the weighted-average remaining contractual life of options exercisable was 4.7 years and the aggregate intrinsic value of options
exercisable was $203.3 million.

The remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested awards at December 31, 2015 was
$6.4 million, and the weighted-average period of time over which this cost will be recognized is



1.6 years. The fair value of options that vested during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $7.8 million, $9.8 million and $12.4 million, respectively. The intrinsic value
of Fortune Brands stock options exercised in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $78.0 million, $63.4 million and $97.1 million, respectively.

Performance Awards

Performance share awards were granted to officers and select employees of the Company
under the Plans and represent the right to earn shares of Company common stock based on the achievement of various segment or company-wide performance conditions, including cumulative diluted earnings per share, average return on invested capital,
average return on net tangible assets and cumulative operating income during the three-year performance period. Compensation cost is amortized into expense over the performance period, which is generally three years, and is based on the probability
of meeting performance targets. The fair value of each performance share award is based on the average of the high and low stock price on the date of grant.

The following table summarizes information about performance share awards as of December 31, 2015, as well as activity during the year then ended, based on the target award amounts in the performance share
award agreements:

The remaining unrecognized pre-tax compensation cost related to performance share awards at December 31, 2015 was
approximately $6.4 million, and the weighted-average period of time over which this cost will be recognized is 1.6 years. The fair value of performance share awards that vested during 2015 was $11.8 million.

Director Awards

Stock awards are used as part of the
compensation provided to outside directors under the Plan. Awards are issued annually in the second quarter. In addition, outside directors can elect to have director fees paid in stock or can elect to defer payment of stock. Compensation cost is
expensed at the time of an award based on the fair value of a share at the date of the award. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, we awarded 19,695, 22,654 and 24,672 shares of Company common stock to outside directors with a weighted average fair value on the
date of the award of $46.21, $40.01 and $36.47, respectively.

14.    Defined Benefit Plans

We have a number of pension plans in the United States, covering many of the Company’s employees, however most have been closed to new hires. The plans
provide for payment of retirement benefits, mainly commencing between the ages of 55 and 65, and also for payment of certain disability benefits. After meeting certain qualifications, an employee acquires a vested right to future benefits. The
benefits payable under the plans are generally determined on the basis of an employee’s length of service and/or earnings. Employer contributions to the plans are made, as



necessary, to ensure legal funding requirements are satisfied. Also, from time to time, we may make contributions in excess of the legal funding requirements.

In addition, the Company provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to certain retirees.

The accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of assets for all pension plans. The 2014 actuarial loss includes $0.9
million related to an acquired business.

Amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets consist of:

In the third quarter of 2015, we recognized actuarial losses of $6.1 million related to curtailment accounting due to the sale of
the Waterloo tool storage business in discontinued operations in addition to the $2.5 million of actuarial losses reflected below in net periodic benefit cost.

In the first quarter of 2014, we communicated our decision to amend certain postretirement benefit plans to reduce health benefits for certain current and retired employees. The reduction in accrued retiree benefit
plan liabilities was $15.3 million and we recorded actuarial losses of $0.6 million and prior service credits of $3.5 million.



In the first half of 2013, we communicated our decision to amend certain postretirement benefit plans to reduce health
benefits for certain current and retired employees. The impact of these changes was a reduction in accrued retiree benefit plan liabilities of $34.7 million in 2013, and we recognized actuarial losses of $4.0 million due to a decrease in the
discount rate and a resulting lower threshold for loss recognition because of the reduced postretirement obligation. Liability reductions resulting from these benefit reductions are recorded as amortization of prior service credits in net income in
accordance with accounting requirements. In addition, in the first quarter of 2013, we communicated to certain employees our decision to freeze an hourly pension plan by December 31, 2016. As a result, we remeasured our pension liability,
updating our pension measurement assumptions, and recorded a $20.0 million reduction in the liability. The curtailment charge associated with this pension freeze was insignificant. See Note 12, “Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss)
Income,” for information on the impact on accumulated other comprehensive income.

As of December 31 2015, we adopted the new Society of
Actuaries MP-2015 mortality tables, resulting in a decrease in our postretirement obligations of approximately $0.5 million, and a corresponding decrease in deferred actuarial losses in accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31
2014, we adopted the Society of Actuaries RP-2014 mortality tables, resulting in an increase in our postretirement obligations of approximately $48 million, and a corresponding increase in deferred actuarial losses in accumulated other comprehensive
income.

The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheets that have not yet been recognized as components of net
periodic benefit cost were as follows:

The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost over the
next fiscal year are amortization of net prior service credits related pension benefits of zero and postretirement benefits of $(5.5) million.



Components of net periodic benefit cost were as follows:

A reconciliation of Level 3 measurements as of December 31, 2015 was as follows:

Pension assets by major category of plan assets and the type of fair value measurement as of December 31, 2014 were as
follows:

A reconciliation of Level 3 measurements as of December 31, 2014 was as follows:



Our defined benefit plans owns a variety of investment assets. Level 2 assets include primarily pooled funds,
involving investments in fixed income and equity securities valued using net asset values of participation units held in common collective trusts, as reported by the managers of the trusts and as supported by the unit prices of actual purchase and
sale transactions. Level 2 plan assets also include an unregistered money market fund that invests in a variety of cash and cash equivalents. Level 3 plan assets include a hedge fund-of-funds and a real estate fund that invests primarily in direct
and indirect equity and debt investments in improved real properties, both of which are valued using the net asset value. Level 3 assets also include group annuity/insurance contracts valued at institutional evaluation prices consistent with
industry practices. Our investment strategy is to optimize investment returns through a diversified portfolio of investments, taking into consideration underlying plan liabilities and asset volatility. A Master Trust was established to hold the
assets of our domestic defined benefit plans. The defined benefit asset allocation policy of the trust allows for an equity allocation of 0% to 75%, a fixed income allocation of 25% to 100%, a cash allocation of up to 25% and other investments up to
20%. Asset allocations are based on the underlying liability structure. All retirement asset allocations are reviewed periodically to ensure the allocation meets the needs of the liability structure.

Our 2016 expected blended long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.8% was determined based on the nature of the plans’ investments, our current asset
allocation and projected long-term rates of return from pension investment consultants.

Estimated Future Retirement Benefit Payments

The following retirement benefit payments are expected to be paid:

Estimated future retirement benefit payments above are estimates and could change significantly based on differences between
actuarial assumptions and actual events and decisions related to lump sum distribution options that are available to participants in certain plans.

Defined Contribution Plan Contributions

We sponsor a
number of defined contribution plans. Contributions are determined under various formulas. Cash contributions by the Company related to these plans amounted to $18.3 million, $21.5 million and $18.7 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

A reconciliation of income taxes at the 35% federal statutory income tax rate to the income tax provision reported was
as follows:

The effective income tax rates for 2015, 2014 and 2013 were favorably impacted by the tax benefit attributable to the Domestic
Production Activity (Internal Revenue Code Section 199) Deduction, favorable tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, and a benefit associated with the various extensions of the U.S. research and development credit, offset by state and local taxes
and increases to uncertain tax positions. The benefit associated with the favorable tax rates in foreign jurisdictions is affected by overall allocation of income, rate changes and impact of foreign exchange rates. In 2015, the effective income tax
rate benefit from foreign tax rates was reduced, as compared to prior years, due to the overall allocation of income within foreign jurisdictions and an expiration of a favorable tax incentive that in total increased the effective foreign tax rate
by 6%. The 2015 effective income tax rate was unfavorably impacted by $2.4 million related to nondeductible acquisition costs. The effective tax rate in 2014 was favorably impacted by the release of valuation allowances related to state net
operating loss carryforwards of $4.1 million.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) was as follows:

The amount of UTBs that, if recognized as of December 31, 2015, would affect the Company’s effective tax rate was $27.8
million. It is reasonably possible that, within the next twelve months, total UTBs may decrease in the range of $7.5 million to $12.5 million primarily as a result of the conclusion of U.S. federal, state and foreign income tax proceedings.

We classify interest and penalty accruals related to UTBs as income tax expense. In 2015, we recognized an interest and penalty expense of
approximately $1.0 million. In 2014, we recognized an interest and penalty expense of approximately $0.5 million. In 2013, we recognized an interest and



penalty benefit of approximately $0.2 million. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had accruals for the payment of interest and penalties of $10.2 million and $10.7 million, respectively.

We file income tax returns in the U.S., various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is currently under examination by the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service (“IRS”) for the periods related to 2011 through 2012. We have tax years that remain open and subject to examination by tax authorities in the following major taxing jurisdictions: Canada for years after 2010, Mexico for
years after 2006 and China for years after 2011.

Income taxes in 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:

The components of net deferred tax assets (liabilities) as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:



In accordance with ASC requirements for Income Taxes, deferred taxes were classified in the consolidated balance
sheets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 as follows:

In accordance with the ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, issued by the FASB on November 20, 2015,
the Company has elected to adopt the provisions of the ASU, beginning with its year ended December 31, 2015. The Company has applied the provisions of this ASU on a prospective basis, and therefore, has not retrospectively adjusted its prior
periods’ classification of deferred taxes. See ‘Recently Issued Accounting Standards’ section in Note 2 “Significant Accounting Policies” for more discussion on this early adoption of the standard.

Included in the Company’s 2015 components of net deferred tax liabilities is an investment in partnership resulting from the purchase of Norcraft, whose
primary operating company is structured as a partnership.

As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had deferred tax assets relating to net
operating losses, capital losses, and other tax carryforwards of $39.9 million and $15.8 million, respectively, of which approximately $10.1 million will expire between 2016 and 2020, and the remainder which will expire in 2021 and thereafter.
Included in the tax loss carryforwards are net operating loss carryforwards acquired in the purchase of Norcraft.

The Company has provided a valuation
allowance to reduce the carrying value of certain of these deferred tax assets, as management has concluded that, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be fully realized.

The undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely reinvested were $270.1 million at December 31, 2015. A quantification of
the associated deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings has not been made, as the determination of such liability is not practicable.

In
October, 2011, we separated from our Former Parent. During 2012, we analyzed the subsidiary legal and capital structures inherited from our Former Parent to assess their compatibility with our strategies as a new independent company. Based on this
analysis, in the fourth quarter of 2012, we committed to a plan to reorganize certain foreign subsidiaries and adjust their capital structures to better align with our business strategy as a new independent company. As part of this plan, we
committed to a non-recurring remittance of certain foreign earnings and recorded an associated tax liability of $12.4 million. The remaining portion of this liability as of December 31, 2015 is $1.4 million. We have not provided deferred income
taxes on the remaining undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.

In general, under the Tax Allocation Agreement that we entered into with our
Former Parent, Fortune Brands is responsible for all taxes to the extent such taxes are attributable to the Home & Security business, and we agreed to indemnify our Former Parent for these taxes. Our Former Parent will be responsible for
all taxes to the extent such taxes are not attributable to the Fortune Brands business and our Former Parent has agreed to indemnify us for these taxes. Though valid as between the parties, the Tax Allocation Agreement will not be binding on the IRS
or other taxing authorities.



16.    Restructuring and Other Charges

Pre-tax restructuring and other charges for the year ended December 31, 2015 were:

(a)

“Other Charges” represent charges or gains directly related to restructuring initiatives that cannot be reported as restructuring under GAAP. Such
charges or gains may include losses on disposal of inventories, trade receivables allowances from exiting product lines, accelerated depreciation resulting from the closure of facilities, and gains and losses on the sale of previously closed
facilities.

(b)

Selling, general and administrative expenses

Restructuring and other charges in 2015 related to severance costs to relocate a plumbing manufacturing facility in China and severance costs and accelerated

and $29.0 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Product Warranties

We generally record warranty expense at the time of sale. We offer our customers various warranty terms based on the type of product that is sold. Warranty expense is determined based on historic claim experience
and the nature of the product category. The following table summarizes activity related to our product warranty liability for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.

18.    Information on Business Segments

We report our operating segments based on how operating results are regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker for making decisions about resource allocations to segments and assessing performance.
The Company’s operating segments and types of products from which each segment derives revenues are described below.

The Cabinets segment includes
custom, semi-custom and stock cabinetry for the kitchen, bath and other parts of the home under brand names including Aristokraft, Diamond, Kitchen Craft, Mid-Continent, Kitchen Classics, Schrock, Omega, Homecrest, Ultracraft and StarMark. In

19.    Quarterly Financial Data

Unaudited

(In millions, except per share amounts)

In 2015, we recorded pre-tax defined benefit plan actuarial losses of $2.5 million — $2.8 million ($1.8 million after tax or
$0.01 million per diluted share) in the third quarter, and $(0.3) million ($(0.2) million after tax or zero per diluted share) in the fourth quarter.

In 2014 and 2013, we recorded impairment charges of $1.6 million and $6.2 million, respectively, pertaining to different cost
method investments due to an other-than-temporary declines in the fair value of the investments. As a result of the impairments, the carrying value of the investments was reduced to zero and the Company is not subject to further impairment or
funding obligations with regard to this investment.



22.    Contingencies

Litigation

The Company is a defendant in lawsuits associated with the normal conduct of its businesses and
operations. It is not possible to predict the outcome of the pending actions, and, as with any litigation, it is possible that these actions could be decided unfavorably to the Company. The Company believes that there are meritorious defenses to
these actions and that these actions will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, and, where appropriate, these actions are being vigorously contested. Accordingly the
Company believes the likelihood of material loss is remote.

Environmental

Compliance with federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, did not have a material effect on capital
expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of Fortune Brands. Several of our subsidiaries have been designated as potentially responsible parties (“PRP”) under “Superfund” or similar state laws. As of December 31,
2015, ten such instances have not been dismissed, settled or otherwise resolved. In calendar year 2015, none of our subsidiaries were identified as a PRP in any new instances and no instances were settled, dismissed or otherwise resolved. In most
instances where our subsidiaries are named as a PRP, we enter into cost-sharing arrangements with other PRPs. We give notice to insurance carriers of potential PRP liability, but very rarely, if ever, receive reimbursement from insurance for PRP
costs. We believe that the cost of complying with the present environmental protection laws, before considering estimated recoveries either from other PRPs or insurance, will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or
financial condition. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had accruals of $2.8 million, relating to environmental compliance and clean up including, but not limited to, the above mentioned Superfund sites.

23.    Subsequent Event

On February
16, 2016, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $400 million of shares of the Company’s common stock over the two years ending February 16, 2018. The share repurchase programs do not obligate the
Company to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.
and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility
is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of
the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As described in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
appearing under Item 9A, management has excluded Norcraft from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 because they were acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations during 2015. We have
also excluded Norcraft from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Norcraft is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues represent 17% and 6%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement
amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

The
Company’s management has evaluated, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures

(b)

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and
with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on our evaluation under the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated
Framework

(2013) issued by the COSO, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2015. The Company acquired Norcraft Companies, Inc. (“Norcraft”) in May 2015,
and therefore as permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, we excluded Norcraft from the scope of our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. The
total assets and total revenues of Norcraft represented 17% and 6%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Company’s independent public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, as
stated in their report which appears herein.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
