contains certain “forward-looking statements” made pursuant to the safe harbor
provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), regarding expected capital spending,
expected pension contributions, the anticipated effects of recently issued accounting standards on our financial statements, planned business strategies, market potential, future financial performance and other matters. Statements that include the
words “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “projects,” “estimates,” “plans” and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as “will,”
“should,” “would,” “may” and “could” are generally forward-looking in nature and not historical facts. Where, in any forward-looking statement, we express an expectation or belief as to future results or
events, such expectation or belief is based on the current plans and expectations at the time this report is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) or, with respect to any documents incorporated by reference,
available at the time such document was prepared or filed with the SEC. Although we believe that these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, they are subject to numerous factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and
results to be materially different from those indicated in such statements. These factors include those listed in the section below entitled “Risk Factors.” Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any
forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events, new information or changes to future results over time or otherwise.

Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this Annual Report on Form

10-K

to “Fortune Brands,” the “Company,” “we,” “our”
or “us” refer to Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Our Company

We are a leading home and security products company that competes in attractive long-term growth markets in our product categories. With a foundation of
market-leading brands across a diversified mix of channels, and lean and flexible supply chains, as well as a tradition of strong product innovation and customer service, we are focused on outperforming our markets in both growth and returns, and
driving increased shareholder value. We have three business segments: Cabinets, Plumbing, and Doors & Security. We sell our products through a wide array of sales channels, including kitchen and bath dealers, wholesalers oriented toward
builders or professional remodelers, industrial and locksmith distributors,

“do-it-yourself”

remodeling-oriented home centers and other retail outlets. We
believe the Company’s impressive track record reflects the long-term attractiveness and potential of our categories and our leading brands. Despite increased pressures driven in part by tariffs, higher interest rates and inflation, our
performance demonstrates the strength of our operating model and our ability to generate profitable growth as sales volume increases and we leverage our structural competitive advantages to gain share in our categories.

Our Strategy

Build on leading business and brand
positions in attractive growth and return categories

.    We believe that we have leading market positions and brands in many of our product categories. In 2018, we expanded into the outdoor living market by acquiring
Fiber Composites LLC (“Fiberon”), a leading U.S. manufacturer of outdoor performance materials used in decking, railing and fencing products. The acquisition of Fiberon provides category expansion and product extension opportunities into
the outdoor living space for our Doors & Security segment. We continue to invest in targeted advertising and other strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing brand awareness and educating



consumers regarding the breadth, features and benefits of our product lines. For example, in the third quarter of 2018, Moen launched its new “Who designs for water” advertising and
brand campaign showcasing its appreciation for Earth’s most crucial resource, while inspiring consumers to look at water from a renewed viewpoint. We also strive to leverage our brands by expanding into adjacent product categories and continue
to develop new programs by working closely with our customers.

Continue to develop innovative products for
customers, designers, installers and consumers

.    Sustained investments in consumer-driven product innovation and customer service, along with our low cost structures, have contributed to our success in the marketplace
and creating consumer demand. In 2018, our Global Plumbing Group developed partnerships and investments in the “whole home” water space, including partnering with Flo Technologies. In 2018, MasterBrand Cabinets, which provides a wide range
of cabinets for the home, launched innovative new cabinet door designs, lighting systems, color palettes and features in a range of styles that allows consumers to create a custom kitchen look at an affordable price and introduced new, exclusive
laminate door and finish options across multiple price segments. We continue to provide channel support with responsive websites featuring our cabinet brands that drives consumers to our partner dealers. The

Therma-Tru

portfolio of

on-trend

door and glass collections continued to evolve to meet current and emerging architectural design trends including wider and taller door
styles, expanding panel configurations, as well as additional decorative, privacy and textured glass designs. Master Lock continued to be an innovation leader in security and safety products and services, driven by consumer and end user focused
insights with continued emphasis on electronic enabled solutions for enhanced capability and convenience. In 2018, we launched our Vault Enterprise software and suite of Bluetooth

®

enabled hardware for business, providing a convenient way for companies to control access, manage assets and improve accountability across many users simultaneously.
SentrySafe continued to provide a full line portfolio of quality security, fire and water resistant safes to help consumers and small business owners protect documents and valuables.

Expand in international markets

.    We expect to have opportunities to expand sales by further penetrating international markets, which represented approximately 16% of net sales
in 2018. We continue to develop our relationship with dealers and distributors and their Moen-branded stores throughout China. In our Cabinets segment, Kitchen Craft remained a leading cabinetry brand in Canada, while WoodCrafters provided a company
presence in Mexico. Within our Doors & Security segment, Master Lock continued to expand its presence in Europe and Asia, while

Therma-Tru

made inroads in Canada as consumers transitioned from
traditional entry door materials to more advanced and energy-efficient fiberglass doors.

Leverage our global supply
chains

.    We are using lean manufacturing,

design-to-manufacture

and distributive assembly techniques to make our supply chains more
flexible and improve supply chain quality, cost, response times and asset efficiency. We view our global supply chains and manufacturing presence as a strategic asset not only to support strong operating leverage as volumes increase, but also to
enable the profitable growth of new products, adjacent market expansion and international growth.

Enhance returns and deploy our cash flow to
high-return opportunities

.    We continue to believe our most attractive opportunities are to invest in profitable organic growth initiatives, pursue accretive strategic acquisitions,

non-controlling

equity investments, and joint ventures, and return cash to stockholders through a combination of dividends and repurchases of shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program. In
2018, we repurchased approximately 12 million shares of our outstanding common stock under the Company’s share repurchase programs for $695 million. In September 2018, we acquired Fiberon providing category expansion and product
extension opportunities into the outdoor living space for our Doors & Security segment.

Our Competitive Strengths

We believe our competitive strengths include the following:

Leading brands

.    We have leading brands in many of our product categories. We believe that established brands are meaningful to
both consumers and trade customers in their respective categories



and that we have the opportunity to, among other things, continue to expand many of our brands into adjacent product categories and international markets.

Strategic focus on attractive consumer-facing categories

.

We believe we operate in categories that, while very
competitive, are among the more attractive categories in the home products and security products markets. Some of the key characteristics that make these categories attractive in our view include the following:

>

product quality, innovation, fashion, finish, durability and functionality, which are key determinants of product selection in addition to price;

>

established brands, which are meaningful to both consumers and trade customers;

>

the opportunity to add value to a complex consumer purchasing decision with excellent service propositions, reliability of products, ease of installation and
superior delivery lead times;

>

the value our products add to a home, particularly with kitchen and bath remodeling and additions, the curb appeal offered by stylish entry door systems and the
expanding outdoor living market offered through our decking products;

>

favorable long-term trends in household formations that benefit the outlook for our markets over time;

>

the relatively stable demand for plumbing and security products; and

>

the opportunity to expand into adjacent categories.

Operational excellence

.    In 2018, we invested approximately $45 million to support long-term growth potential both in the U.S. and international markets. In addition, our
supply chains and low cost manufacturing structures allow us to adapt to challenging market conditions. We believe that margin improvement will continue to be driven predominantly by organic volume growth that can be readily accommodated by current
production capacity.

Commitment to innovation

.    We have a long track record of successful product and process
innovations that introduce valued new products and services to our customers and consumers. We are committed to continuing to invest in new product development and enhance customer service to strengthen our leading brands and penetrate adjacent
markets.

Diverse sales

end-use

mix

.    We sell in a variety of product
categories and sales channels in the U.S. home and security products markets. In addition, our exposure to changing levels of U.S. residential new home construction activity is balanced with

repair-and-remodel

activity, which comprised a substantial majority of the overall U.S. home products market and about

two-thirds

of our U.S. home products sales in
2018. We also benefit from a stable market for plumbing and security products and international sales growth opportunities.

Diverse sales
channels

.    We sell through a wide array of sales channels, including kitchen and bath dealers, wholesalers oriented to builders or professional remodelers, industrial and locksmith distributors,

“do-it-yourself”

remodeling-oriented home centers and other retail outlets. We also sell security products to locksmiths, industrial distributors and mass merchants.
We are able to leverage these existing sales channels to expand into adjacent product categories. In 2018, sales to our top ten customers represented less than half of total sales.

Decentralized business model

.    Our business segments are focused on distinct product categories and are responsible for their own performance. This structure enables each of our
segments to independently best position itself within each category in which it competes and reinforces strong accountability for operational and financial performance. Each of our segments focuses on its unique set of consumers, customers,
competitors and suppliers, while also sharing best practices.



Strong capital structure

.    We exited 2018 with a strong balance sheet. In
2018, we repurchased 12.0 million of our shares. As of December 31, 2018, we had $262.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and total debt was $2,334.0 million, resulting in a net debt position of $2,071.1 million. In
addition, we had $930.0 million available under our credit facility as of December 31, 2018.

Business Segments

In July 2018, we publicly announced an internal reorganization to combine our Doors and Security segments under common leadership to drive innovation, accelerate
product development, and enhance investments and business processes for the combined segment. In conjunction with the reorganization, we changed how our chief operating decision maker evaluates and allocates the resources across our businesses. As a
result, beginning in the third quarter of 2018, we have three business segments: Cabinets, Plumbing and Doors & Security. The following table shows net sales for each of these segments and key brands within each segment:

Our segments compete on the basis of innovation, fashion, quality, price, service and responsiveness to distributor, retailer and
installer needs, as well as

end-user

consumer preferences. Our markets are very competitive. Approximately 16% of 2018 net sales were to international markets, and sales to two of the Company’s customers,
The Home Depot, Inc. (“The Home Depot”) and Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (“Lowe’s”), each accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s net sales in 2018. Sales to all U.S. home centers in the aggregate were approximately
26% of net sales in 2018.

Cabinets.

Our Cabinets segment manufactures custom, semi-custom and stock cabinetry, as
well as vanities, for the kitchen, bath and other parts of the home through a regional supply chain footprint to deliver high quality cabinets and service to our customers. This segment sells a portfolio of brands that enables our customers to
differentiate themselves against competitors. This portfolio includes brand names such as Aristokraft, Diamond,

Mid-Continent,

Kitchen Craft, Schrock, Homecrest, Omega, Thomasville, Kemper, StarMark and
Ultracraft. Substantially all of this segment’s sales are in North America. This segment sells directly to kitchen and bath dealers, home centers, wholesalers and large builders. In aggregate, sales to The Home Depot and Lowe’s comprised
approximately 36% of net sales of the Cabinets segment in 2018. This segment’s competitors include Masco and American Woodmark, as well as a large number of overseas, regional and local suppliers.

Plumbing.

Our Plumbing segment manufactures or assembles and sells faucets, accessories, kitchen sinks and waste disposals,
predominantly under the Moen, ROHL, Riobel, Perrin & Rowe, Victoria + Albert and Shaws brands. Although this segment sells products principally in the U.S., China and Canada, this segment also sells in Mexico, Southeast Asia, Europe and
South America. Approximately 28% of 2018 net sales were to international markets. This segment sells directly through its own sales force and indirectly through independent manufacturers’ representatives, primarily to wholesalers, home centers,
mass merchandisers and industrial distributors. In aggregate, sales to The Home Depot and Lowe’s comprised approximately 23% of net sales of the Plumbing segment in 2018. This segment’s chief competitors include



Masco, Kohler, Spectrum Brands, LIXIL Group, InSinkErator (owned by Emerson Electronic Company) and imported private-label brands.

Doors

& Security.

Our Doors & Security segment manufactures and sells fiberglass and steel entry door systems under the

Therma-Tru

brand name, composite decking, railing and fencing under the Fiberon brand name, and urethane millwork under the Fypon brand name. It also manufactures, sources and distributes locks, safety and security
devices, and electronic security products under the Master Lock brand and fire resistant safes, security containers and commercial cabinets under the SentrySafe brand. This segment sells products principally in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Central
America, Japan and Australia. Approximately 14% of 2018 net sales were to international markets. This segment’s principal customers are home centers, hardware and other retailers, millwork building products and wholesale distributors, and
specialty dealers that provide products to the residential new construction market, as well as to the remodeling and renovation markets. In addition, it sells lock systems and fire resistant safes to locksmiths, industrial and institutional users,
and original equipment manufacturers. In aggregate, sales to The Home Depot and Lowe’s comprised approximately 19% of net sales of the Doors & Security segment in 2018.

Therma-Tru,

Fiberon and
Fypon brands compete with Masonite,

JELD-WEN,

Trex, Azek, Plastpro, Pella and various regional and local suppliers. The Master Lock brand competes with Abus, W.H. Brady, Hampton, Spectrum Brands, Allegion,
Assa Abloy and various imports. SentrySafe brands compete with Magnum, Fortress, Interlocks and

Stack-On.

Other
Information

Raw materials.

The table below indicates the principal raw materials used by each of our segments.
These materials are available from a number of sources. Volatility in the prices of commodities and energy used in making and distributing our products impacts the cost of manufacturing our products.

Raw Materials

Cabinets

Hardwoods (maple, cherry and oak), plywood and particleboard

Brass, zinc, resins, stainless steel, aluminum and copper

Doors & Security

Steel, resins, glass, wood, aluminum, insulating foam, brass and zinc

Intellectual property.

Product innovation and branding are important to the success of our
business. In addition to the brand protection offered by our trademarks, patent protection helps distinguish our unique product features in the market by preventing copying and making it more difficult for competitors to benefit unfairly from
our design innovation. We hold U.S. and foreign patents covering various features used in products sold within all of our business segments. Although each of our segments relies on a number of patents and patent groups that, in the aggregate,
provide important protections to the Company, no single patent or patent group is material to any of the Company’s segments.



Employees.

As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 25,300
full-time employees. Approximately 3,200 of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Employee relations are generally good.

Seasonality.

All of our operating segments traditionally experience lower sales in the first quarter of the year when new home
construction,

repair-and-remodel

activity and security buying are at their lowest. As a result of sales seasonality and associated timing of working capital
fluctuations, our cash flow from operating activities is typically higher in the second half of the year.

Environmental
matters.

We are involved in remediation activities to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws. Liabilities for remediation costs of each site are based on our best estimate of undiscounted
future costs, excluding possible insurance recoveries or recoveries from other third parties. Uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations, technology and information related to individual sites make it difficult to develop estimates of
environmental remediation exposures. Some of the potential liabilities relate to sites we own, and some relate to sites we no longer own or never owned. Several of our subsidiaries have been designated as potentially responsible parties
(“PRP”) under “Superfund” or similar state laws. As of December 31, 2018, ten such instances have not been dismissed, settled or otherwise resolved. In 2018, none of our subsidiaries were identified as a PRP in a
new instance and no instances were settled, dismissed or otherwise resolved. In most instances where our subsidiaries are named as a PRP, we enter into cost-sharing arrangements with other PRPs. We give notice to insurance carriers of potential PRP
liability, but very rarely, if ever, receive reimbursement from insurance for PRP costs. We believe that the cost of complying with the present environmental protection laws, before considering estimated recoveries either from other PRPs or
insurance, will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had accruals of $0.6 and $0.7 million, respectively, relating to environmental compliance
and cleanup including, but not limited to, the above mentioned Superfund sites.

Legal structure.

Fortune Brands
Home & Security, Inc. is a holding company that was initially organized as a Delaware corporation in 1988. Wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company include MasterBrand Cabinets, Inc., Fortune Brands Global Plumbing Group LLC, Fortune
Brands Doors, Inc. and Fortune Brands Storage & Security LLC. As a holding company, we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiaries. Accordingly, the rights of the Company, and thus the rights of our creditors

Item 1A.  Risk Factors.

There are inherent risks and uncertainties
associated with our business that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. Set forth below are descriptions of those risks and



uncertainties that we currently believe to be material, but the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business,
financial condition or operating results. If any of these risks materialize, our business, financial condition or operating results could suffer. In this case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your
investment.

Risks Relating to Our Business

Our business primarily relies on North American home improvement, repair and remodel and new home construction activity levels, all of which are
impacted by risks associated with fluctuations in the housing market. Downward changes in the general economy, the housing market or other business conditions could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial
condition.

Our business primarily relies on home improvement, repair and remodel, and new home construction activity levels, principally
in North America. The housing market is sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors, such as the level of employment, access to labor, consumer confidence, consumer income, government tax programs, availability of financing and
interest rate levels. Adverse changes in any of these conditions generally, or in any of the markets where we operate, could decrease demand and could adversely impact our businesses by: causing consumers to delay or decrease homeownership; making
consumers more price conscious resulting in a shift in demand to smaller, less expensive homes; making consumers more reluctant to make investments in their existing homes, including large kitchen and bath repair and remodel projects; or making it
more difficult to secure loans for major renovations.

We operate in very competitive consumer and trade brand categories.

The markets in which we operate are very competitive. Although we believe that competition in our businesses is based largely on product quality,
consumer and trade brand reputation, customer service and product features, as well as fashion trends, innovation and ease of installation, price is a significant factor for consumers as well as our trade customers. Some of our competitors may
resort to price competition to sustain or grow market share and manufacturing capacity utilization. Also, certain large customers continue to offer private-label brands that compete with some of our product offerings as a lower-cost alternative. We
also face increasing pressure from imported ‘flat pack’ cabinets. The strong competition that we face in all of our businesses may adversely affect our profitability and revenue levels, as well as our results of operations, cash flows and
financial condition.

Risks associated with our ability to improve organizational productivity and global supply chain efficiency and flexibility
could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

We regularly evaluate our organizational productivity and
global supply chains and assess opportunities to increase capacity, reduce costs and enhance quality. We may be unable to enhance quality, speed and flexibility to meet changing and uncertain market conditions, as well as manage cost inflation,
including wages, pension and medical costs. Our success depends in part on refining our cost structure and supply chains to promote consistently flexible and low cost supply chains that can respond to market changes to protect profitability and cash
flow or ramp up quickly and effectively to meet demand. Import tariffs could potentially lead to increases in prices of raw materials or components which are critical to our business. Failure to achieve the desired level of quality, capacity or cost
reductions could impair our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

We may not successfully develop new products or processes
or improve existing products or processes.

Our success depends on meeting consumer
needs and anticipating changes in consumer preferences with successful new products and product improvements. We aim to introduce products and new or



improved production processes proactively to offset obsolescence and decreases in sales of existing products. We may not be successful in product development and our new products may not be
commercially successful. In addition, it is possible that competitors may improve their products or processes more rapidly or effectively, which could adversely affect our sales. Furthermore, market demand may decline as a result of consumer
preferences trending away from our categories or trending down within our brands or product categories, which could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

Risks associated with global commodity and energy availability and price volatility, as well as the possibility of sustained inflation, could adversely
affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

We are
exposed to risks associated with global commodity price volatility arising from restricted or uneven supply conditions, the sustained expansion and volatility of demand from emerging markets, potentially unstable geopolitical and economic variables,
weather and other unpredictable external factors. We buy raw materials that contain commodities such as brass, zinc, steel, wood, and glass and petroleum-based products such as resins. In addition, our distribution costs are significantly impacted
by the price of oil and diesel fuel. Decreased availability and increased or volatile prices for these commodities, as well as energy used in making, distributing and transporting our products, could increase the costs of our products. While in the
past we have been able to mitigate the impact of these cost increases through productivity improvements and passing on increasing costs to our customers over time, there is no assurance that we will be able to offset such cost increases in the
future, and the risk of potentially sustained high levels of inflation could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While we may use derivative contracts to limit our short-term exposure to commodity price
volatility, the commodity exposures under these contracts could still be material to our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, in periods of declining commodity prices, these derivative contracts may have the
short-term effect of increasing our expenditures for these raw materials.

We manufacture, source and sell products internationally and are
exposed to risks associated with doing business globally.

We manufacture, source or
sell our products in a number of locations throughout the world, predominantly in the U.S., Canada, China, Europe and Mexico. Accordingly, we are subject to risks associated with potential disruption caused by changes in political, economic and
social environments, including civil and political unrest, terrorism, possible expropriation, local labor conditions, changes in laws, regulations and policies of foreign governments and trade disputes with the U.S., and U.S. laws affecting
activities of U.S. companies abroad. Risks inherent to international operations include: potentially adverse tax laws, unfavorable changes or uncertainty relating to trade agreements or importation duties, uncertainty regarding clearance and
enforcement of intellectual property rights, risks associated with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and difficulty enforcing contracts. While we hedge certain foreign currency transactions, a change in the value of the currencies will impact our
financial statements when translated into U.S. dollars. In addition, fluctuations in currency can adversely impact the cost position of our products in local currency, making it more difficult for us to compete. Our success will depend, in
part, on our ability to effectively manage our businesses through the impact of these potential changes. In addition, we source certain raw materials, components and finished goods from China where we have experienced higher manufacturing costs and
longer lead times due to currency fluctuations, higher wage rates, labor shortages and higher raw material costs.

Changes in government and
industry regulatory standards could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

Government regulations and policies pertaining to trade agreements, health and safety (including protection of employees as well as consumers), taxes and environmental concerns continue to emerge



domestically, as well as internationally. In particular, there may be additional tariffs or taxes related to our imported inputs and finished goods. It is necessary for us to comply with current
requirements (including requirements that do not become effective until a future date), and even more stringent requirements could be imposed on our products or processes in the future. Compliance with changes in taxes, tariffs and other regulations
may require us to alter our manufacturing and installation processes and our sourcing. Such actions could increase our capital expenditures and adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

Risks associated with strategic acquisitions and joint ventures could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial
condition.

We consider acquisitions and joint ventures as a means of enhancing
shareholder value. Acquisitions and joint ventures involve risks and uncertainties, including difficulties integrating acquired companies and operating joint ventures; difficulties retaining the acquired businesses’ customers and brands; the
inability to achieve the expected financial results and benefits of transactions; the loss of key employees from acquired companies; implementing and maintaining consistent standards, controls, policies and information systems; and diversion of
management’s attention from other business matters. Future acquisitions could cause us to incur additional debt or issue additional shares, resulting in dilution in earnings per share and return on capital.

Our inability to secure and protect our intellectual property rights could negatively impact revenues and brand reputation.

We have many patents, trademarks, brand names and trade names that are important to our business.
Unauthorized use of these intellectual property rights may not only erode sales of our products, but may also cause significant damage to our brand name and reputation, interfere with our ability to effectively represent the Company to our
customers, contractors and suppliers, and increase litigation costs. There can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our brands and trademark rights will prevent violations. In addition, existing patent, trade secret and trademark laws offer
only limited protection, and the laws of some countries in which our products are or may be developed, manufactured or sold may not fully protect our intellectual property from infringement by others. There can be no assurance that our efforts to
assess possible third party intellectual property rights will ensure the Company’s ability to manufacture, distribute, market or sell in any given country or territory. Furthermore, others may assert intellectual property infringement claims
against us or our customers.

Our businesses rely on the performance of wholesale distributors, dealers and other marketing arrangements and
could be adversely affected by poor performance or other disruptions in our distribution channels and customers.

We rely on a distribution network comprised of consolidating customers. Any disruption to the existing distribution channels could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The
consolidation of distributors or the financial instability or default of a distributor or one of its major customers could potentially cause such a disruption. In addition to our own sales force, we offer our products through a variety of
third-party distributors, representatives and retailers. Certain of our distributors, representatives or retailers may also market other products that compete with our products. The loss or termination of one or more of our major distributors,
representatives or retailers, the failure of one or more of our distributors, representatives or retailers to effectively promote our products, or changes in the financial or business condition of these distributors, representatives or retailers
could effect our ability to bring products to market.

Our pension costs and funding requirements could increase as a result of volatility in the
financial markets and changes in interest rates and actuarial assumptions.

Increases
in the costs of pension benefits may continue and negatively affect our business as a result of: the effect of potential declines in the stock and bond markets on the performance of our pension plan



assets; potential reductions in the discount rate used to determine the present value of our benefit obligations; and changes to our investment strategy that may impact our expected return on
pension plan assets assumptions. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates,
which may change based on economic conditions. Our accounting policy for defined benefit plans may subject earnings to volatility due to the recognition of actuarial gains and losses, particularly due to the change in the fair value of pension
assets and interest rates. Funding requirements for our U.S. pension plans may become more significant. However, the ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns and the impact
of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations.

Risks associated with the disruption of operations could adversely
affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

We manufacture
a significant portion of the products we sell. Any prolonged disruption in our operations, whether due to technical or labor difficulties, weather, lack of raw material or component availability, startup inefficiencies for new operations,
destruction of or damage to any facility (as a result of natural disasters, fires and explosions, use and storage of hazardous materials or other events) or other reasons, could negatively impact our profitability and competitive position and
adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

Our inability to obtain raw materials and finished goods in a
timely and cost-effective manner from suppliers could adversely affect our ability to manufacture and market our products.

We purchase raw materials to be used in manufacturing our products and also rely on third-party manufacturers as a source for finished goods. We typically do not enter into long-term contracts with our suppliers or
sourcing partners. Instead, most raw materials and sourced goods are obtained on a “purchase order” basis. In addition, in some instances we maintain single-source or limited-source sourcing relationships, either because multiple sources
are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance, quality, support, delivery, capacity or price considerations. Financial, operating or other difficulties encountered by our suppliers or sourcing partners or changes in our
relationships with them could result in manufacturing or sourcing interruptions, delays and inefficiencies, and prevent us from manufacturing or obtaining the finished goods necessary to meet customer demand. If we are unable to meet customer
demand, there could be an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

Our failure to attract and retain
qualified personnel and other labor constraints could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

Our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of qualified personnel at all levels, including our senior management team and other key employees. Their
motivation, skills, experience, contacts and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and administration. With low unemployment rates in the U.S., competition for qualified talent and attracting and retaining personnel in remote
locations could result in the failure to attract, motivate and retain personnel, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

Future tax law changes or the interpretation of existing tax laws may materially impact our effective income tax rate, the resolution of unrecognized tax benefits and cash tax payments.

Our businesses are subject to income taxation in the U.S., as well as internationally. We are routinely
audited by income tax authorities in many jurisdictions. Although we believe that the recorded tax estimates are reasonable and appropriate, there are significant uncertainties in these estimates. As a



result, the ultimate outcome from any audit could be materially different from amounts reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals. Future settlements of income tax audits may have a
material adverse effect on earnings between the period of initial recognition of tax estimates in our financial statements and the point of ultimate tax audit settlement. In addition, significant judgement is required in determining our provision
for income taxes. Our total income tax expense could be affected by changes in tax laws rates in the jurisdictions in which our businesses are subject to taxation, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax
laws or the interpretation of such laws by tax authorities.

Potential liabilities and costs from claims and litigation could adversely affect
our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

We are, from time
to time, involved in various claims, litigation matters and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business and that could have an adverse effect on us. These matters may include contract disputes, intellectual property
disputes, product recalls, personal injury claims, construction defects and home warranty claims, warranty disputes, environmental claims or proceedings, other tort claims, employment and tax matters and other proceedings and litigation, including
class actions. It is not possible to predict the outcome of pending or future litigation, and, as with any litigation, it is possible that some of the actions could be decided unfavorably and could have an adverse effect on our results of
operations, cash flows and financial condition.

We are subject to product safety regulations, recalls and direct claims for product liability that can
result in significant liability and, regardless of the ultimate outcome, can be costly to defend. As a result of the difficulty of controlling the quality of products or components sourced from other manufacturers, we are exposed to risks relating
to the quality of such products and to limitations on our recourse against such suppliers.

An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or
other acquired intangible assets could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.

The carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date. The carrying value of other intangible assets represents
the fair value of customer relationships, tradenames and other acquired intangible assets as of the acquisition date. Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized, but must be
evaluated for impairment by management at least annually. If the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, the goodwill is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a

non-cash

charge to earnings. If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is greater than its fair value, the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a

non-cash

charge
to earnings. Events or circumstances that could have a potential negative effect on the estimated fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived tradenames include: actual new construction and repair and remodel growth rates that fall below
our assumptions, actions of key customers, increases in discount rates, continued economic uncertainty, higher levels of unemployment, weak consumer confidence, lower levels of discretionary consumer spending, a decrease in royalty rates and decline
in the trading price of our common stock . If the value of goodwill or other acquired intangible assets is impaired, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.

We may experience delays or outages in our information technology systems and computer networks. We may be subject to breaches of our information technology
systems, which could damage our reputation and consumer relationships. Such breaches could subject us to significant financial, legal and operational consequences.

We, like most companies, may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions caused by delays or disruptions due to system updates,
natural disasters, malicious attacks, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic

break-ins,

or similar events or disruptions.
Our businesses may implement enterprise



resource planning systems or add applications to replace outdated systems and to operate more efficiently. We may not be able to successfully implement the projects without experiencing
difficulties. In addition, any expected benefits of implementing projects might not be realized or the costs of implementation might outweigh the benefits realized. In addition, information security risks have generally increased in recent years
because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks. We believe we devote appropriate resources to network security, data encryption, and other security measures to
protect our systems and data, but these security measures cannot provide absolute security. In the event of a breach, we would be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability, which could have an adverse effect on our business,
results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

There can be no assurance that we will have access to the capital markets on terms
acceptable to us.

From time to time we may need to access the long-term and
short-term capital markets to obtain financing. Although we believe that the sources of capital currently in place permit us to finance our operations for the foreseeable future on acceptable terms and conditions, our access to, and the availability
of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors, including, but not limited to: our financial performance, our credit ratings, the liquidity of the overall capital markets and the state of the economy,
including the U.S. housing market. There can be no assurance that we will have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to us. In addition, a prolonged global economic downturn may also adversely impact our access to long-term capital
markets, result in increased interest rates on our corporate debt, and weaken operating cash flow and liquidity. Decreased cash flow and liquidity could potentially adversely impact our ability to pay dividends, fund acquisitions and repurchase
shares in the future.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings.

The Company is a defendant in lawsuits that are ordinary routine litigation matters incidental to its businesses. It is not possible to predict the outcome of the
pending actions, and, as with any litigation, it is possible that these actions could be decided unfavorably to the Company. The Company believes that



there are meritorious defenses to these actions and that these actions will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial condition,
and, where appropriate, these actions are being vigorously contested. Accordingly, the Company believes the likelihood of material loss is remote.

Item 5.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.

Market Information, Dividends and Holders of Record

Our
common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “FBHS”.

In December 2018, our Board of
Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 10% to $0.22 per share of our common stock. Our Board of Directors will continue to evaluate dividend payment opportunities on a quarterly basis. There can be no assurance as to when and if
future dividends will be paid, or at what level, because the payment of dividends is dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.

On February 1, 2019, there were 9,946 record holders of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share. A substantially greater
number of holders of the Company’s common stock are “street name” or beneficial holders, whose shares of record are held by banks, brokers or other financial institutions.

Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers

Below are the repurchases of common
stock by the Company or any “affiliated purchaser” (as defined in

Stock Performance

The above graph compares the relative performance of our common stock, the S&P 500 Index and a Peer Group Index. This graph
covers the period from December 31, 2013 through December 31, 2018. This graph assumes $100 was invested in the stock or the index on December 31, 2013 and also assumes the reinvestment of dividends. The foregoing performance graph is
being furnished as part of this Annual Report on Form

10-K

solely in accordance with the requirement under Rule

14a-3(b)(9)

to furnish our stockholders with such
information, and therefore, shall not be deemed to be filed or incorporated by reference into any filings by the Company under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.

Peer Group Index.

The 2018 peer group is composed of the following publicly traded companies corresponding to the Company’s core businesses:

Armstrong World Industries, Inc., Fastenal Company, Leggett & Platt Incorporated, Lennox International Inc., Masco Corporation, Mohawk Industries, Inc., Newell Brands Inc., The Sherwin-Williams Company,
Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. and USG Corporation.

Calculation of Peer Group Index

The weighted-average total return of the entire peer group, for the period of December 31, 2013 through December 31, 2018, is calculated in the following
manner:

(1)

the total return of each peer group member is calculated by dividing the change in market value of a share of its common stock during the period,
assuming reinvestment of any dividends, by the value of a share of its common stock at the beginning of the period; and

(2)

each peer group member’s total return is then weighted within the index based on its market capitalization relative to the market capitalization of
the entire index, and the sum of such weighted returns results in a weighted-average total return for the entire Peer Group Index.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Introduction

This Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is a supplement to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and provides additional information on our business, recent developments, financial condition,
liquidity and capital resources, cash flows and results of operations. MD&A is organized as follows:

>

Overview:    This section provides a general description of our business, and a discussion of management’s general outlook regarding
market demand, our competitive position and product innovation, as well as recent developments we believe are important to understanding our results of operations and financial condition or in understanding anticipated future trends.

>

Basis of Presentation:    This section provides a discussion of the basis on which our consolidated financial statements were prepared.

>

Results of Operations:    This section provides an analysis of our results of operations for each of the three years ended December 31,
2018, 2017 and 2016.

>

Liquidity and Capital Resources:    This section provides a discussion of our financial condition and an analysis of our cash flows for each
of the three years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. This section also provides a discussion of our contractual obligations, other purchase commitments and customer credit risk that existed at December 31, 2018, as well as a
discussion of our ability to fund our future commitments and ongoing operating activities through internal and external sources of capital.

>

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates:    This section identifies and summarizes those accounting policies that significantly impact our
reported results of operations and financial condition and require significant judgment or estimates on the part of management in their application.

Overview

The Company is a leader in home and security products focused on the design, manufacture and sale of
market-leading branded products in the following categories: kitchen and bath cabinetry, plumbing and accessories, entry door systems, security products and outdoor performance materials used in decking, railing and fencing products.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, net sales based on country of destination were:

We believe the Company has certain competitive advantages including market-leading brands, a diversified mix of customer channels,
lean and flexible supply chains, a decentralized business model and a strong capital structure as well as a tradition of strong innovation and customer service. We are focused on outperforming our markets in growth, profitability and returns in
order to drive increased shareholder value. We believe the Company’s track record reflects the long-term attractiveness and potential of our categories and our leading brands. As consumer demand and the housing market continue to grow, we
expect the benefits of operating leverage and strategic spending to support increased manufacturing capacity and long-term growth initiatives will help us to continue to achieve profitable organic growth.



We believe our most attractive opportunities are to invest in profitable organic growth initiatives. We also
believe that as the market grows, we have the potential to generate additional growth from leveraging our cash flows and balance sheet strength by pursuing accretive strategic acquisitions,

non-controlling

equity investments, and joint ventures, and by returning cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and repurchases under our share repurchase program as explained in further detail under “Liquidity and Capital Resources”
below.

The U.S. market for our home products consists of spending on both new home construction and repair and remodel activities within existing
homes, with the substantial majority of the markets we serve consisting of repair and remodel spending. Continued growth in the U.S. market for our home products will largely depend on consumer confidence, employment, home prices, stable mortgage
rates and credit availability.

We may be impacted by fluctuations in raw materials, tariffs, transportation costs, foreign exchange rates and
promotional activity among our competitors. We strive to offset the potential unfavorable impact of these items with productivity improvements and price increases.

During the three years ended December 31, 2018, our net sales grew at a compounded annual rate of 6.2% as we benefited from an improving U.S. home products market, acquisitions, and growth in international
markets. Operating income grew at a compounded annual rate of 7.4% with consolidated operating margins improving from 10% in 2015 to 11% in 2018. Growth in operating income was primarily due to higher sales volume, changes to our portfolio of
businesses, control and leverage of our operating expenses and the benefits of productivity programs.

During 2018, the U.S. home products market grew
due to increases in new home construction and repair and remodel activities. We believe new housing construction experienced approximately 5% growth in 2018 compared to 2017 and spending for home repair and remodeling increased approximately 4%. In
2018, net sales grew 4% due to price increases to help mitigate cumulative raw material cost increases, the acquisitions in our Plumbing and Doors & Security segments, higher sales volume primarily resulting from U.S. home products market
growth, and the effect of favorable foreign exchange. In 2018, operating income decreased 12.8% due to unfavorable mix, asset impairment charges, higher employee-related costs and restructuring charges.

During 2017, the U.S. home products market grew due to increases in new home construction and repair and remodel activities. We believe new housing construction
experienced approximately 7% growth in 2017 compared to 2016 and spending for home repair and remodeling increased by approximately 5%. In 2017, net sales grew 6% and operating income increased 9% due to higher sales volume primarily resulting from
U.S. home products market growth, the acquisitions in our Plumbing segments, price increases to help mitigate cumulative raw material cost increases, the effect of favorable foreign exchange and productivity improvements.

During the fourth quarter of 2018, our Plumbing segment entered into strategic partnerships with several companies who incorporate emerging technology into
plumbing-related products, and at the same time acquired

non-controlling

equity interests in two of our partners. This includes an investment in Flo Technologies, Inc.

In September 2018, we issued $600 million of unsecured senior notes (“2018 Senior Notes”) in a registered public offering. The 2018 Senior Notes are
due in 2023 with a coupon rate of 4%. All other terms and conditions of the 2018 Senior Notes are substantially consistent with our other senior notes issued in June 2015 (“2015 Senior Notes”, and collectively with the 2018 Senior Notes,
the “Senior Notes”). We used the proceeds from the 2018 Senior Notes offering to pay down our revolving credit facility.

In September 2018,
we acquired 100% of the membership interests of Fiber Composites LLC (“Fiberon”), a leading U.S. manufacturer of outdoor performance materials used in decking, railing and fencing products



for a total purchase price of approximately $470.0 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. The acquisition of Fiberon provides category expansion and product extension
opportunities into the outdoor living space for our Doors & Security segment. We financed the transaction using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit and term loan facilities. Fiberon’s results of operations are
included in the Doors & Security segment from the date of acquisition.

In July 2018, we publicly announced an internal reorganization to
combine our historical Doors and Security segments under common leadership to drive innovation, accelerate product development, and enhance investments and business processes. In connection with the reorganization, we changed how our chief operating
decision maker evaluates and allocates the resources for the combined business. Reporting for the new Doors & Security segment began in the third quarter of 2018 and historical financial segment information has been restated to conform to
the new segment presentation.

In March 2018, the Company entered into a $350 million term loan for general corporate purposes that matures in
March 2019. In August 2018, the Company amended its existing $350 million term loan to increase the borrowings under the term loan from $350 million to $525 million. All terms and conditions on the amended term loan remain
the same as the previous $350 million term loan. Interest rates under the term loan are variable based on LIBOR at the time of the borrowing and the Company’s long-term credit rating and can range from LIBOR + 0.625% to LIBOR +
1.25%. Covenants under the term loan are the same as the existing $1.25 billion revolving credit agreement.

In October 2017, we acquired
Domotec Holdings Limited (“Victoria + Albert”), a

UK-based

premium brand of standalone bathtubs, sinks, tub fillers, faucets and other accessories. In July 2017, we acquired Shaws Since1897 Limited
(“Shaws”), a

UK-based

luxury plumbing products company that specializes in manufacturing and selling fireclay sinks and selling brassware and accessories. The total combined consideration paid was
approximately $146 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments and deferred acquisition payments. We financed both of the acquisitions using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. These transactions broadened
our plumbing portfolio.

During the third quarter of 2016, we announced the creation of GPG, which was designed to support the growth of multiple
plumbing brands with an enhanced set of products and brands, while leveraging Moen’s existing global supply chain and broad distribution network.

In September 2016, we acquired ROHL LLC (“ROHL”), a California-based luxury plumbing company and in a related transaction, we acquired TCL Manufacturing
Ltd, which gave us ownership of Perrin & Rowe, a UK manufacturer and designer of luxury kitchen and bathroom plumbing products. The total combined purchase price was approximately $166 million, subject to certain post-closing
adjustments. We financed both acquisitions using cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facility. These transactions broadened the plumbing portfolio and enhanced future growth opportunities.

In June 2016, we amended and restated our credit agreement to combine and rollover the existing revolving credit facility and term loan into a new standalone
$1.25 billion revolving credit facility. Terms and conditions of the credit agreement, including the total commitment amount, essentially remained the same as our previous credit assesment. The revolving credit facility will mature in June 2021
and borrowings thereunder will be used for general corporate purposes.

In May 2016, we acquired Riobel Inc (“Riobel”), a Canadian plumbing
company specializing in premium showroom bath and shower fittings, for a total purchase price of $94.6 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. We financed the transaction using cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit
facilities.

We revised our previously reported results in 2017 and 2016 to reflect our adoption of ASU

2017-07,

Presentation of
Net Periodic Pension and Postretirement Costs, and to reflect our new Doors & Security segment resulting from the reorganization we announced in July 2018.

Certain items had a significant impact on our results in 2018, 2017 and 2016. These included the acquisitions of Fiberon, Victoria + Albert, Shaws, Riobel, ROHL and Perrin & Rowe, restructuring and other
charges, asset impairment charges and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.



In 2018, financial results included:

>

the addition of the Fiberon acquisition in our Doors & Security segment,

>

asset impairment charges of $62.6 related to impairment of two indefinite-lived tradenames within our Cabinets segment which was primarily the result of changes
in the mix of revenue across our tradenames finalized during our annual planning process conducted during the fourth quarter, as well as restructuring actions announced during the third quarter,

>

restructuring and other charges of $35.4 million before tax ($26.9 million after tax), primarily related to costs associated with our initiatives to
consolidate our manufacturing footprint and product lines in our Cabinets segment and severance costs within all of our segments,

>

the impact of foreign exchange primarily due to movement in the Canadian Dollar, British Pound, Mexican Peso and Chinese Yuan, which had a favorable impact
compared to 2017, of approximately $9 million on net sales, approximately $6 million on operating income and approximately $6 million on net income and

>

the favorable impact of changes from

last-in,

first-out

(“LIFO”) to

first-in,

first-out

(“FIFO”) for product groups in which metals comprise a significant portion of inventory cost, which resulted in income of approximately
$7.3 million before tax ($5.5 million after tax).

>

During 2018, the Company completed its SAB 118 analysis with respect to income tax effects resulting from the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017
on December 22, 2017 (the “Tax Act”) As a result, the Company recorded a tax expense in the amount of $5.5 million in 2018.

In 2017, financial results included:

>

the benefit of the acquisitions in our Plumbing segment,

>

restructuring and other charges of $18.5 million before tax ($12.3 million after tax), primarily related to losses on disposal of inventory associated
with exiting a product line in our Doors & Security segment and exiting a customer relationship in our Cabinets segment, as well as severance costs within our Doors & Security, Plumbing and Cabinets segments,

>

impairment charge of $7.0 million pertaining to a cost method investment in a development stage home products company due to other-than-temporary decline in
its fair value,

>

the impact of foreign exchange primarily due to movement in the Canadian dollar, which had a favorable impact compared to 2016, of approximately $4 million
on net sales, approximately $5 million on operating income and approximately $4 million on net income and

>

an estimated net tax benefit of $25.7 million resulting from the of the Tax Act.

In 2016, financial results included:

>

the benefit of the acquisitions in our Cabinets and Plumbing segments,

>

restructuring and other charges of $19.3 million before tax ($13.6 million after tax), primarily associated with severance costs and charges associated
with the relocation of a manufacturing facility within our Doors & Security segment and

>

the impact of foreign exchange primarily due to movement in the Canadian dollar, which had an unfavorable impact compared to 2015, of approximately
$27 million on net sales, approximately $6 million on operating income and approximately $6 million on net income.

2018 Compared to 2017

Total Fortune Brands

Net sales

Net sales increased $201.8 million, or 3.8%. The increase was due to price increases to help mitigate cumulative raw material cost increases, higher
international sales, principally in China, our acquisitions



during 2017 and 2018 in our Plumbing and Doors & Security segments, higher sales volume primarily from the growth in the U.S. home products market, the benefit from new product
introductions and favorable foreign exchange of approximately $9 million. These benefits were partially offset by more moderate industry growth during the second half of 2018, unfavorable mix and higher promotions and rebates.

Cost of products sold

Cost of products sold increased
$167.4 million, or 5.0%, due to higher net sales, increased commodity costs, higher restructuring and other charges related to costs associated with our initiatives to consolidate and rationalize our manufacturing footprint and discontinue
certain product lines in our Cabinets segment, and higher amortization of the acquisition-related inventory fair value adjustment in our Plumbing and Doors & Security segments. These factors were partially offset by the benefit of
productivity improvements.

Selling, general and administrative expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $44.5 million, or 3.7%, due to higher employee-related costs, the impact from our acquisitions during 2017 and 2018 in our Plumbing and Doors &
Security segments and higher transportation costs partially offset by the benefit from restructuring actions.

Amortization of intangible assets

Amortization of intangible assets increased $4.4 million due to our acquisitions during 2017 and 2018 in our Plumbing and Doors &
Security segments offset by a decrease related to a definite-lived customer relationship intangible that was fully amortized during the second quarter of 2017.

Loss on sale of product line

In April 2017, we completed the sale of Field ID, our cloud-based inspection and
safety compliance software product line included in our Doors & Security segment. We recorded a

pre-tax

loss of $2.4 million as the result of this sale.

Asset impairment charges

Asset impairment charges of
$62.6 million in 2018 related to two indefinite-lived tradenames within our Cabinets segment. During the third quarter of 2018, we recognized an impairment of $27.1 million related to one tradename, which was primarily the result of
reduced revenue growth expectations associated with Cabinets operations in Canada, including the announced closure of Company-owned retail locations during the third quarter of 2018. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we recognized an impairment of
$35.5 million related to another tradename, which was primarily the result of lower than forecasted sales during the fourth quarter of 2018 as well as projected changes in the mix of revenue across our tradenames in future periods, including
the impact of more moderate industry growth expectations, which were finalized during our annual planning process conducted during the fourth quarter. Asset impairment charges of $3.2 million in the first quarter of 2017 related to our decision
to sell Field ID.

Restructuring charges

Restructuring charges of $24.1 million in 2018 primarily related to severance costs within all of our segments and costs associated with our initiatives to
consolidate our manufacturing footprint and product lines in our Cabinets segment. Restructuring charges of $8.3 million in 2017 primarily related to severance costs across all segments and charges associated with the relocation of a
manufacturing facility within our Cabinets segment.

Operating income

Operating income decreased $87.3 million or 12.8%. Operating income decreased due to unfavorable mix, asset impairment charges, higher employee-related costs and restructuring charges partially offset by



higher net sales, including the benefit from acquisitions in our Plumbing segment and productivity improvements.

Interest expense

Interest expense increased $25.1 million to $74.5 million due to higher average
borrowings to finance share repurchases and acquisitions and higher average interest rates.

Other income, net

Other income, net, was $16.3 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, compared to $1.7 million in the twelve months ended
December 31, 2017. The increase in other income, net, is primarily due to hedge gains associated with our September 2018 debt issuance, favorable foreign currency adjustments and various tax credits within our Plumbing business partially offset
by lower defined benefit plan income in 2018 ($3.0 million decrease). In addition, 2017 reflects a $7.0 million impairment charge related to a cost method investment.

Income taxes

The effective income tax rates for 2018 and 2017 were 27.4% and 25.1%, respectively. The 2018
effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by the corporate tax rate reduction from 35% to 21% under The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”). The 2018 effective income tax rate was unfavorably impacted by the repeal of the
Domestic Production Activity (Internal Revenue Code Section 199) Deduction, a valuation allowance increase ($3 million), an adjustment to the provisional net benefit recorded in 2017 under the Tax Act ($5.5 million), state and local taxes,
unfavorable tax rates in foreign jurisdictions ($3.5 million), and increases in uncertain tax positions ($4.1 million).

The 2017 effective income tax
rate was favorably impacted by the Tax Act. The effective income tax rate for 2017 was favorably impacted by a tax benefit related to share-based compensation ($23.9 million), the tax benefit attributable to the Domestic Production Activity
(Internal Revenue Code Section 199) Deduction ($10.9 million) and favorable tax rates in foreign jurisdictions ($8.3 million), partially offset by state and local taxes and increases to uncertain tax positions ($11.6 million).

The Tax Act made significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code including a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning
after December 31, 2017, generally providing for an exemption from federal income tax for dividends received from foreign subsidiaries, and imposing a

one-time

transition tax on the deemed repatriation of
cumulative foreign earnings and profits as of December 31, 2017. On December 22, 2017, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”) was issued, which deals with the application of U.S. GAAP to situations where a
registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. In accordance with SAB 118, we calculated our
best estimate of the impact of the Tax Act on our 2017 effective income tax rate. As a result, the Company recorded a provisional net benefit of $25.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which the Tax Act was enacted. This
provisional amount included an estimated reduction in the Company’s net deferred tax liabilities of $62.4 million resulting from the decrease in the federal income tax rate; an estimated deemed repatriation tax liability of
$28.5 million; and an estimated net increase to our provision for taxes on foreign earnings not considered permanently reinvested of $8.2 million. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company completed its analysis in conjunction with
the SAB 118 measurement period ending on December 22, 2018. The total tax provision impact for the year ended December 31, 2018 was an unfavorable adjustment of $5.5 million related primarily to certain deferred tax assets and
liabilities.

Income from continuing operations

Net income from continuing operations was $390.0 million in 2018 compared to $475.3 million in 2017. The decrease of $85.3 million was primarily due
to lower operating income.



Loss from discontinued operations

The loss from discontinued operations was $0.2 million and $2.6 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively and is related to the prior sale of the Waterloo tool storage and Simonton window businesses.

Results By Segment

Cabinets

Net sales decreased $48.5 million, or 2.0%, predominantly due to the impact of exiting a customer relationship and unfavorable mix. These
factors were partially offset by the benefit from new product introductions and price increases to help mitigate cumulative raw material cost increases.

Operating income decreased $123.7 million, or 46.3%, primarily due to lower net sales, tradename asset impairment charges of $62.6 million, higher
restructuring and other charges incurred to consolidate our manufacturing footprint and discontinue certain product lines and increased employee-related costs due to inflation, partially offset by the benefit from productivity improvements.

Plumbing

Net sales increased
$162.5 million, or 9.4% due to higher sales unit volume in the U.S. China and Canada, new product introductions across our distribution channels, the benefit from the 2017 acquisitions of Victoria + Albert and Shaws and price increases to help
mitigate cumulative raw material cost increases partially offset by higher rebates. Foreign exchange was favorable by approximately $5 million.

Operating income increased $16.8 million, or 4.7%, due to the higher net sales and benefits from productivity improvements. These benefits were partially
offset by commodity cost inflation, higher employee-related costs, unfavorable mix, amortization of the acquisition-related inventory fair value adjustments ($5.5 million) related to our 2017 acquisitions and increased marketing and advertising
costs. In addition, 2017 operating income reflects the impact of adopting ASU

2017-07

during 2018 and the reclassification of approximately $5.1 million from Plumbing operating income to other income,
net.

Doors & Security

Net sales
increased $87.8 million, or 8.0%, due to higher sales volume, resulting from the benefit from new product introductions, the acquisition of Fiberon in 2018, price increases to help mitigate cumulative raw material cost increases and the impact
of favorable foreign exchange, which were partly offset by increased

non-repeating

sales promotions and unfavorable mix.

Operating income increased $8.7 million, or 5.9%, due to higher net sales and an inventory valuation accounting change benefit of $12.8 million, which were partially offset by

non-repeating

sales promotions and inventory step up amortization related to the Fiberon acquisition.

Corporate

Corporate expenses decreased by $10.9 million mainly due to lower employee-related costs. In addition, 2017 corporate expense reflects the
impact of adopting ASU

2017-07

during the first quarter of 2018 and the related reclassification of approximately $4.5 million of 2017 income from Corporate expenses to other income, net.



2017 Compared to 2016

Total Fortune Brands

Net sales

Net sales increased $298.4 million, or 6.0%. The increase was due to higher sales volume primarily from improvement in U.S. market conditions for home
products, new product introductions, the benefit from the acquisitions in our Plumbing segment and price increases to help mitigate cumulative raw material cost increases as well as the benefit from favorable foreign exchange of approximately
$4 million. These benefits were partially offset by unfavorable mix, higher sales promotions, and sales rebates.

Cost of products sold

Cost of products sold increased $169.5 million, or 5.3%, due to higher net sales, including the impact of the acquisitions in our Plumbing
segment and raw material cost increases, partially offset by the benefit of productivity improvements.

Selling, general and administrative expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $61.4 million, or 5.4%, due to higher employee-related costs and advertising costs as
well as the impact of the acquisitions in our Plumbing segment.

Amortization of intangible assets

Amortization of intangible assets increased $3.6 million primarily due to the acquisitions in our Plumbing segment, partially offset by a decrease relating to
a definite-lived customer relationship intangible in our Doors & Security segment that was fully amortized during the second quarter of 2017.

Loss on sale of product line

In April 2017, we completed
the sale of Field ID, our cloud-based inspection and safety compliance software product line included in our Doors & Security segment. We recorded a

pre-tax

loss of $2.4 million as the result of
this sale.

Asset impairment charges

Asset
impairment charges of $3.2 million relate to our decision in the first quarter of 2017 to sell Field ID.

Restructuring charges

Restructuring charges of $8.3 million in 2017 primarily related to severance costs within all of our segments as well as charges associated with a plant
relocation in our Cabinets segment. Restructuring charges of $13.9 million in 2016 primarily related to the severance costs and charges associated with the relocation of a manufacturing facility within our Doors & Security segment.

Operating income

Operating income increased
$63.9 million or 10.3%. Operating income increased due to higher net sales, including the benefit from acquisitions in our Plumbing segment and productivity improvements. These benefits were partially offset by unfavorable mix, higher
employee-related costs, raw material, labor inflation and advertising costs. 2017 and 2016 were adjusted to reflect the impact of adopting ASU

2017-07

and reclassification of $9.6 million and
$14.1 million, respectively from operating income to other income, net.



Interest expense

Interest expense of $49.4 million was $0.3 million higher as compared to last year primarily due to higher average interest rates which was partially offset by lower average borrowings
and the absence of the

write-off

of debt issuance costs incurred in 2016.

Other income, net

Other income, net, was of $1.7 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $12.6 million in the twelve months
ended December 31, 2016. The decrease of $10.9 million was primarily due to a $7.0 million impairment charge in 2017 pertaining to a cost method investment and a decrease in defined benefit income of $4.5 million.

Income taxes

The effective income tax rates for 2017 and
2016 were 25.1% and 29.2% respectively. The 2017 effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by the Tax Act ($25.7 million). The effective income tax rates for 2017 and 2016 were favorably impacted by the tax benefit attributable to share-based
compensation (ASU

2016-09)

deduction ($23.9 million and $27.8 million, respectively), the Domestic Production Activity (Internal Revenue Code Section 199) deduction ($10.9 million and
$13.0 million, respectively) and favorable tax rates in foreign jurisdictions ($8.3 million and $7.6 million, respectively), offset by state and local taxes and increases to uncertain tax positions ($11.6 million and
$13.2 million, respectively).

Income from continuing operations

Net income from continuing operations was $475.3 million in 2017 compared to $412.4 million in 2016. The increase of $62.9 million was primarily due to higher operating income.

(Loss) income from discontinued operations

The loss from
discontinued operations of $2.6 million in 2017 primarily related to the prior sale of the Waterloo tool storage and Simonton window businesses. The income from discontinued operations of $0.8 million in 2016 included the effect of tax
adjustments relating to the Waterloo business.

Results By Segment

Cabinets

Net sales increased $69.3 million, or 2.9%, due to higher sales volume driven primarily by
continuing improvement in the U.S. home products market and the benefit from new product introductions, price increases to help mitigate cumulative raw material cost increases and a $3 million benefit from favorable foreign exchange. These
benefits were partially offset by unfavorable mix and higher sales promotions.

Operating income increased $9.4 million, or 3.6%, due to the
increase in net sales and productivity improvements. These benefits were partially offset by unfavorable mix, higher employee-related costs, higher labor inflation and higher transportation costs.

Plumbing

Net sales increased $186.4 million, or
12.1%, due to higher sales volume driven by continuing improvement in the U.S. home products market and the benefit from new product introductions, higher sales in international markets, principally China, and the benefit from the acquisitions of
Riobel, ROHL and Perrin & Rowe in 2016 as well as Shaws and Victoria + Albert in 2017. These benefits were partially offset by higher sales rebates.



Operating income increased $43.6 million, or 13.8%, due to higher net sales, productivity improvements and
favorable mix as well as a $4 million benefit from favorable foreign exchange. These benefits were partially offset by employee-related costs, higher raw materials costs and higher advertising costs. In addition, 2017 and 2016 operating income
reflects the impact of adopting ASU

2017-07

and reclassification of approximately $5.1 million and $11.4 million, respectively from operating income to other income, net.

Doors & Security

Net sales increased
$42.7 million, or 4.1%, due to higher sales volume, including the benefit from new product introductions, and price increases to help mitigate cumulative raw material cost increases. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of exiting
two security product lines in our commercial distribution channels.

Operating income increased $20.5 million, or 16.2%, primarily due to the
higher net sales, the benefits from productivity improvements, lower restructuring and other charges (approximately $6 million) relating to the completion in 2016 of a manufacturing facility relocation, favorable foreign exchange and the related
cost savings resulting from the facility relocation. In addition, 2017 and 2016 operating income reflects the impact of adopting ASU

2017-07

and reclassification of zero and $2.1 million, respectively
from operating income to other income, net.

Corporate

Corporate expenses increased by $9.6 million mainly due to the impairment of a long lived asset. In addition, 2017 and 2016 operating income reflects the impact of adopting ASU

2017-07

and reclassification of $4.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively from operating income to other income, net.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our primary liquidity needs are to support working
capital requirements, fund capital expenditures and service indebtedness, as well as to finance acquisitions, repurchase shares of our common stock and pay dividends to stockholders, as deemed appropriate. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash
on hand, cash flows from operating activities, availability under our credit facility and debt issuances in the capital markets. Our operating income is generated by our subsidiaries. There are no restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to
pay dividends or make other distributions to Fortune Brands. In December 2018, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 10% to $0.22 per share of our common stock. Our Board of Directors will continue to evaluate dividend
payment opportunities on a quarterly basis. There can be no assurance as to when and if future dividends will be paid, and at what level, because the payment of dividends is dependent on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows,
capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.

In September 2018, we issued $600 million of unsecured senior
notes (“2018 Senior Notes”) in a registered public offering. The 2018 Senior Notes are due in 2023 with a coupon rate of 4%. We used the proceeds from the Senior Notes offering to pay down our revolving credit facility. On
December 31, 2018, the outstanding amount of the 2018 Senior Notes, net of underwriting commissions, price discounts, and debt issuance costs, was $595.0 million.

In March 2018, the Company entered into a $350 million term loan for general corporate purposes that matures in March 2019. In August 2018, the Company amended its existing $350 million term loan to
increase the borrowings under the term loan from $350 million to $525 million. All terms and conditions on the amended term loan remain the same as the previous $350 million term loan. The amended term loan is for general
corporate purposes and matures in March 2019. At December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, amounts due under the term loan were $525.0 million and zero, respectively, which are included within short term debt in our consolidated
balance sheet. Interest rates under the term loan are variable



based on LIBOR at the time of the borrowing and the Company’s long-term credit rating and can range from LIBOR + 0.625% to LIBOR + 1.25%. Covenants under the term loan are the same as
the existing $1.25 billion revolving credit agreement. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants under this term loan.

We periodically review our portfolio of brands and evaluate potential strategic transactions to increase shareholder value. However, we cannot predict whether or when we may enter into acquisitions, joint ventures
or dispositions, make any purchases of shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program, or pay dividends, or what impact any such transactions could have on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, whether as a
result of the issuance of debt or equity securities, or otherwise. Our cash flows from operations, borrowing availability and overall liquidity are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including those described in the section “Item 1A.
Risk Factors.”

In June 2016, the Company amended and restated its 2011 credit agreement to combine and rollover the prior revolving credit
facility and term loan into a new standalone $1.25 billion revolving credit facility. This amendment and restatement of the credit agreement was a

non-cash

transaction for the Company. Terms and
conditions of the credit agreement, including the total commitment amount, essentially remained the same as under the 2011 credit agreement. The revolving credit facility will mature in June 2021 and borrowings thereunder will be used for general
corporate purposes. On December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, our outstanding borrowings under these facilities were $320.0 million and $615.0 million, respectively, all of which is included in long-term debt in our
consolidated balance sheet. Interest rates under the facility are variable based on LIBOR at the time of the borrowing and the Company’s long-term credit rating and can range from LIBOR + 0.9% to LIBOR + 1.5%. As of December 31, 2018, we
were in compliance with all covenants under this facility. As a result of the refinancing, we wrote off prepaid debt issuance costs of approximately $1.3 million as of June 30, 2016.

In June 2015, we issued $900 million of unsecured senior notes (“2015 Senior Notes”, and collectively with the 2018 Senior Notes, the “Senior
Notes”) in a registered public offering. The 2015 Senior Notes consist of two tranches: $400 million of five-year notes due in 2020 with a coupon rate of 3% and $500 million of

ten-year

notes
due in 2025 with a coupon rate of 4%. We used the proceeds from the 2015 Senior Notes offering to pay down our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. On December 31, 2018, the outstanding amount of the 2015 Senior Notes,
net of underwriting commissions, price discounts, and debt issuance costs, was $894.1 million.

On April 30, 2018, our Board of Directors
authorized the repurchase of up to $150 million of shares of our common stock over the two years ending April 30, 2020. On July 13, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $400 million of shares of our
common stock over the two years ending July 13, 2020. As of December 31, 2018, the Company’s total remaining share repurchase authorization under the repurchase programs was approximately $413.7 million. The share repurchase
programs do not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. In 2018, we repurchased 12.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock under the
Company’s share repurchase programs for $694.6 million.

We currently have uncommitted bank lines of credit in China, which provide for
unsecured borrowings for working capital of up to $23.5 million in aggregate as of both December 31, 2018 and 2017, of which zero were outstanding, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. The weighted-average interest rates on these
borrowings were 0%, 0% and 1.5% in 2018, 2017 and 2016 respectively.

Acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic partnerships in 2018, 2017 and 2016
include:

>

During the fourth quarter of 2018, our Plumbing segment entered into strategic partnerships with several companies which incorporate emerging technology into
plumbing-related products, and at the same time acquired

non-controlling

equity interests in two of our partners. This includes an investment in Flo Technologies, Inc. (“Flo”), a U.S. manufacturer of
a comprehensive water monitoring and

shut-off



system with leak detection and proactive leak detection technologies. Our investments in our strategic partners are recorded at cost, plus or minus any changes resulting from observable price
changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer.

>

In September 2018, we acquired 100% of membership interests of Fiberon, a leading U.S. manufacturer of outdoor performance materials used in decking, railing and
fencing products for a total purchase price of approximately $470.0 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. The acquisition of Fiberon provides category expansion and product extension opportunities for our Doors &
Security segment into the outdoor living space. The results of operations, subsequent to the closing of the acquisition, are included in the Doors & Security segment.

>

In October 2017, the Company acquired Victoria + Albert, a

UK-based

premium brand of standalone bathtubs, sinks, tub
fillers, faucets and other accessories. In July 2017, we acquired Shaws, a

UK-based

luxury plumbing products company that specializes in manufacturing and selling fireclay sinks, and selling brassware and
accessories. The combined consideration paid was approximately $146 million, including $19.9 million of additional purchase price consideration paid related to post-closing adjustments and deferred acquisition payments during the year
ended December 31, 2018. The combined consideration paid is subject to further deferred acquisition payments. The results of operations of the acquired companies are included in the Plumbing segment from the respective dates of acquisition. We
financed the transactions using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.

>

In September 2016, we acquired ROHL, a California-based luxury plumbing company. We also acquired Perrin & Rowe, a UK manufacturer and designer of
luxury kitchen and bathroom plumbing products. The total combined purchase price was approximately $166 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. We financed the transaction using cash on hand and borrowings under our existing
credit facility.

>

In May 2016, we acquired Riobel, a Canadian plumbing company for a purchase price of $94.6 million in cash, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. We
financed the transaction using cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facilities.

In 2018, we invested approximately
$45 million in incremental capacity to support long-term growth potential. We expect capital spending in 2019 to be in the range of $135 to $145 million.

On December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $262.9 million, of which $260.1 million was held at

non-U.S.

subsidiaries. We manage our global cash
requirements considering (i) available funds among the subsidiaries through which we conduct business, (ii) the geographic location of our liquidity needs, and (iii) the cost to access international cash balances. The repatriation of

non-U.S.

cash balances from certain subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences as we may be required to pay and record tax expense on those funds that are repatriated.

Our operating cash flows are significantly impacted by the seasonality of our businesses. We typically generate most of our operating cash flow in the third and
fourth quarters of each year.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $604.0 million in 2018 compared to $600.3 million in 2017
and $650.5 million in 2016. The $3.7 million increase in cash provided was due to lower build in working capital, primarily driven by lower accounts receivable balances and increases in accrued taxes. The $50.2 million decrease in
cash provided by operating activities from 2017 to 2016 was primarily due to higher build in working capital, primarily driven by higher inventory purchases in 2017, partially offset by a higher net income.

Net cash used in investing activities was $634.3 million in 2018 compared to $287.7 million in 2017 and $385.1 million in 2016. The increase in cash
used of $346.6 million from 2017 to 2018 was primarily due to a $341.0 million increase in cost of acquisitions. The decrease of $97.4 million from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to lower cost of acquisitions of $115.1 million,
partially offset by $15.7 million of higher capital expenditures.

Net cash used by financing activities was $6.8 million in 2018 compared to
$250.1 million in 2017 and $250.4 million in 2016. The decrease in net cash used of $243.3 million was primarily due to higher net borrowings in 2018 compared to 2017 ($751.2 million increase), partly offset by higher share
repurchases in 2018 compared to 2017 ($479.8 million increase).

Pension Plans

Subsidiaries of Fortune Brands sponsor their respective defined benefit pension plans that are funded by a portfolio of investments maintained within our benefit plan trust. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, we contributed
$10.0 million, $28.4 million and zero, respectively, to qualified pension plans. In 2019, we expect to make pension contributions of approximately $8.0 million. As of December 31, 2018, the fair value of our total pension plan
assets was $599.6 million, representing funding of 79% of the accumulated benefit obligation liability. For the foreseeable future, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet the minimum funding that may be required by the Pension
Protection Act of 2006.

Foreign Exchange

We
have operations in various foreign countries, principally Canada, China, Mexico, the United Kingdom, France, Australia and Japan. Therefore, changes in the value of the related currencies affect our financial statements when translated into
U.S. dollars.

Due to the uncertainty of the timing of settlement with taxing authorities, we are unable to make reasonably
reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of unrecognized tax benefits. Therefore, $83.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2018 have been excluded from the Contractual Obligations table above.

In addition to the contractual obligations and commitments listed and described above, we also had other commercial commitments for which we are contingently
liable as of December 31, 2018. Other corporate commercial commitments include standby letters of credit of $43.6 million, in the aggregate, all of which expire in less than one year, and surety bonds of $8.0 million, of which
$7.0 million matures in less than 1 year and $1.0 million matures in

1-3

years. These contingent commitments are not expected to have a significant impact on our liquidity.

Off-Balance

Sheet Arrangements

As of December 31, 2018, we did not have any

off-balance

sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to be material to our financial condition or results
of operations.

Foreign Currency Risk

Certain
anticipated transactions, assets and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. Principal currencies hedged include the Canadian dollar, British pound, the Mexican peso and the Chinese yuan. We regularly monitor our foreign currency exposures
in order to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. For additional information on this risk, see Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in this Annual Report on Form

10-K.

Derivative Financial Instruments

In accordance with ASC requirements for Derivatives and Hedging, we recognize all derivative contracts as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet, and the measurement of those instruments is at fair
value. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge and is effective, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the same period. If the derivative is
designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and are recognized in the consolidated statement of income when the hedged item
affects earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings. If the derivative is designated as an effective economic hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation, the changes in the
fair value of the derivative is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment section of OCI. Similar to foreign currency translation adjustments, these changes in fair value are recognized in earnings only when realized upon sale or upon
complete or substantially complete liquidation of the investment in the foreign entity.

Deferred currency gains/(losses) of $2.2 million,
$0.4 million and $(3.5) million (before tax impact) were reclassified into earnings for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Based on foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2018, we estimate that
$3.3 million of net currency derivative gain included in OCI as of December 31, 2018 will be reclassified to earnings within the next twelve months.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

The adoption of recent accounting standards, as discussed in Note 2,
“Recently Issued Accounting Standards,” to our Consolidated Financial Statements, has not had and is not expected to have a significant impact on our revenue, earnings or liquidity.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our significant accounting policies are
described in Note 2, “Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form

10-K.

The Consolidated



Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP. Preparation of the financial statements requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and
liabilities reflected in the financial statements and revenues and expenses reported for the relevant reporting periods. We believe the policies discussed below are the Company’s critical accounting policies as they include the more
significant, subjective and complex judgments and estimates made when preparing our consolidated financial statements.

Allowances for Doubtful
Accounts

Trade receivables are recorded at the stated amount, less allowances for discounts and doubtful accounts. The allowances for doubtful
accounts represent estimated uncollectible receivables associated with potential customer defaults on contractual obligations (usually due to customers’ potential insolvency) or discounts related to early payment of accounts receivables by our
customers. The allowances include provisions for certain customers where a risk of default has been specifically identified. In addition, the allowances include a provision for customer defaults on a general formula basis when it is determined that
the risk of some default is probable and estimable, but cannot yet be associated with specific customers. The assessment of the likelihood of customer defaults is based on various factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due,
historical collection experience and existing economic conditions. In accordance with this policy, our allowance for doubtful accounts was $3.7 million and $3.3 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Inventories

Inventory provisions are recorded to reduce
inventory to the net realizable dollar value for obsolete or slow moving inventory based on assumptions about future demand and marketability of products, the impact of new product introductions, inventory levels and turns, product spoilage and
specific identification of items, such as product discontinuance, engineering/material changes, or regulatory-related changes. In accordance with this policy, our inventory provision was $45.3 million and $45.0 million as of
December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Long-lived Assets

In accordance with ASC requirements for Property, Plant and Equipment, a long-lived asset (including amortizable identifiable intangible assets) or asset group held for use is tested for recoverability whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. When such events occur, we compare the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset
group to the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group. The cash flows are based on our best estimate of future cash flows derived from the most recent business projections. If this comparison indicates that there is an impairment, the
amount of the impairment is calculated based on fair value. Fair value is estimated primarily using discounted expected future cash flows on a market-participant basis.

Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets

In accordance with ASC requirements for Intangibles —
Goodwill and Other, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter, and written down when impaired. An interim impairment test is performed if an event occurs or conditions change that would more likely than not reduce the
fair value of the reporting unit below the carrying value.

We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill using a weighting of the income (80%) and
market (20%) approaches. For the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow model, estimating the future cash flows of the reporting units to which the goodwill relates and then discounting the future cash flows at a market-participant-derived
discount rate. In determining the estimated future cash flows, we consider current and projected future levels of income based on management’s plans for that business; business



trends, prospects and market and economic conditions; and market-participant considerations. Furthermore, our cash flow projections used to assess impairment of our goodwill and other intangible
assets are significantly influenced by our projection for the U.S. home products market, our annual operating plans finalized in the fourth quarter of each year, and our ability to execute on various planned cost reduction initiatives supporting
operating income improvements. Our projection for the U.S. home products market is inherently uncertain and is subject to a number of factors, such as employment, home prices, credit availability, new home starts and the rate of home foreclosures.
For the market approach, we apply market multiples for peer groups to the current operating results of the reporting units to determine each reporting unit’s fair value. The Company’s reporting units are operating segments, or one level
below operating segments when appropriate. When the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we measure and recognize the amount of the goodwill impairment loss based on that difference.

The significant assumptions that are used to determine the estimated fair value for goodwill impairment testing include the following: third-party market forecasts
of U.S. new home starts and home repair and remodel spending; management’s sales, operating income and cash flow forecasts; peer company EBITDA earnings multiples; the market-participant-based discount rate; and the perpetuity growth rate. Our
estimates of reporting unit fair values are based on certain assumptions that may differ from our historical and future actual operating performance. Specifically, assumptions related to growth in the new construction and repair and remodel segments
of the U.S. home products markets drive our forecasted sales growth. The market forecasts are developed using independent third-party forecasts from multiple sources. In addition, estimated future operating income and cash flow consider our
historical performance at similar levels of sales volume and management’s future operating plans as reflected in annual and long-term plans that are reviewed and approved by management.

Purchased intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their useful lives unless those lives are determined to be indefinite. The determination of the useful life of an intangible asset other than
goodwill is based on factors including historical tradename performance with respect to consumer name recognition, geographic market presence, market share, plans for ongoing tradename support and promotion, customer attrition rates, and other
relevant factors. Certain of our tradenames have been assigned an indefinite life as we currently anticipate that these tradenames will contribute cash flows to the Company indefinitely. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are
evaluated at least annually to determine whether the indefinite useful life is appropriate. We measure the fair value of identifiable intangible assets upon acquisition and we review for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, and whenever
market or business events indicate there may be a potential impairment of that intangible. Impairment losses are recorded to the extent that the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value. The significant
assumptions that are used to determine the estimated fair value for indefinite-lived intangible assets upon acquisition and subsequent impairment testing are forecasted revenue growth rates; the assumed royalty rate; and the market-participant
discount rate. Impairment losses are recorded to the extent that the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value. We measure fair value of our indefinite-lived tradenames using the standard relief-from-royalty
approach which estimates the present value of royalty income that could be hypothetically earned by licensing the brand name to a third party over the remaining useful life. The determination of fair value using this technique requires the use of
estimates and assumptions related to projected tradename revenue growth, the assumed royalty rate and the discount rate. We first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is
impaired. Qualitative factors include changes in volume, customers and the industry. If it is deemed more likely than not that an intangible asset is impaired, we will perform a quantitative impairment test.

In the third quarter of 2018, we recorded a

pre-tax

impairment charge of $27.1 million related to an indefinite-lived
tradename in our Cabinets segment. This charge was primarily the result of reduced revenue growth expectations associated with Cabinets operations in Canada, including the announced closure of Company-owned retail locations during the third quarter
of 2018. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we recorded a

pre-tax

impairment charge of $35.5 million related to another indefinite-lived



tradename in our Cabinets segment as part of our annual impairment testing performed in the fourth quarter. This charge was primarily the result of reduced revenue growth expectations identified
during our annual planning process conducted during the fourth quarter, which includes more moderate industry growth expectations. The fair values of the impaired tradenames were measured using the relief-from-royalty approach, which estimates the
present value of royalty income that could be hypothetically earned by licensing the tradename to a third party over their remaining useful life. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in estimating the fair value include estimated future
annual net sales for the tradename, assumed royalty rate, income tax rate, and a discount rate that reflects the level of risk associated with the tradename’s future sales and profitability. We selected the assumptions used in the financial
forecasts using historical data, supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions, estimated growth rates, and management plans. These assumptions represent level 3 inputs of the fair value hierarchy (refer to Note 10 “Fair Value
Measurements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form

10-K).

As of December 31, 2018, the carrying value of the tradenames that were impaired was
$152.0 million. A further reduction in the estimated fair value of these tradenames could trigger future impairments.

In 2017 and 2016, we did not
record any asset impairment charges in operating income associated with goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets.

Defined Benefit Plans

We have a number of pension plans in the United States, covering many of the Company’s employees. In addition, the Company provides
postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to certain retirees. Service cost for 2018 relates to benefit accruals in an hourly Union defined benefit plan in our Doors & Security segment. Benefit accruals under all other
defined benefit pension plans were frozen as of December 31, 2016.

We recognize changes in the fair value of pension plan assets and net actuarial
gains or losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the fair value of pension plan assets or each plan’s projected benefit obligation (the “corridor”) in earnings immediately upon remeasurement, which is at least annually
in the fourth quarter of each year. Net actuarial gains and losses occur when actual experience differs from any of the assumptions used to value defined benefit plans or when assumptions change as they may each year. The primary factors
contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value obligations as of the measurement date and the differences between expected and actual returns on pension plan assets. This accounting method results in the
potential for volatile and difficult to forecast gains and losses. The

pre-tax

recognition of actuarial (gains) losses was $3.8 million, $(0.5) million and $1.9 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016,
respectively. The total net actuarial losses in accumulated other comprehensive income for all defined benefit plans were $71.5 million as of December 31, 2018, compared to $67.4 million as of December 31, 2017.

We record amounts relating to these defined benefit plans based on various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed rates of return, compensation
increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current economic conditions and trends. We believe that the assumptions utilized in
recording our obligations under our plans are reasonable based on our experience and on advice from our independent actuaries; however, differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect our financial condition or
results of operations. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on the nature of the plans’ investments, our current asset allocation and our expectations for long-term rates of return. The weighted-average long-term expected rate
of return on pension plan assets for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was 6.0% and 6.4%, respectively. Compensation increases reflect expected future compensation trends. The discount rate used to measure obligations is based on a
spot-rate yield curve on a

plan-by-plan

basis that matches projected future benefit payments with the appropriate interest rate applicable to the timing of the projected
future benefit payments. The bond portfolio used for the selection of the discount rate is from the top quartile of bonds



rated by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, and includes only

non-callable

bonds and those that are deemed to be sufficiently
marketable with a Moody’s credit rating of Aa or higher. The weighted-average discount rate for defined benefit liabilities as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was 4.4% and 3.8%, respectively.

For postretirement benefits, our health care trend rate assumption is based on historical cost increases and expectations for long-term increases. As of
December 31, 2018, for postretirement medical and prescription drugs in the next year, our assumption was an assumed rate of increase of 6.9% for

pre-65

retirees and 8.0% for

post-65

retirees, declining until reaching an ultimate assumed rate of increase of 4.5% per year in 2027. As of December 31, 2017, for postretirement medical and prescription drugs in the next year, our
assumption was an assumed rate of increase of 7.1% for

pre-65

retirees and 8.4% for

post-65

retirees, declining until reaching an ultimate assumed rate of increase of
4.5% per year in 2026.

The actuarial losses in 2018 were principally due to lower asset returns. The actuarial gains in 2017 were principally due to our
normal

of prior year defined benefit plan liabilities. The actuarial losses in 2016 were principally due to the

re-measurement

relating to a retiree
medical plan. Discount rates in 2018 used to determine benefit obligations increased by an average of 60 basis points for pension benefits. Discount rates for 2018 postretirement benefits increased an average of 80 basis points. Discount rates in
2017 used to determine benefit obligations decreased by an average of 50 basis points for pension benefits. Discount rates for postretirement benefits remained the same in 2017 as in 2016. Discount rates in 2016 used to determine benefit obligations
decreased by an average of 30 basis points for pension benefits and an average of 70 basis points for postretirement benefits. Our actual return on plan assets in 2018 was (3.5)% compared to an actuarial assumption of an average 6.0% expected
return. Our actual return on plan assets in 2017 was 16.3% compared to an actuarial assumption of an average 6.4% expected return. Significant actuarial losses in future periods would be expected if discount rates decline, actual returns on
plan assets are lower than our expected return, or a combination of both occurs.

A 25 basis point change in our discount rate assumption would lead to
an increase or decrease in our pension and postretirement liability of approximately $23 million. A 25 basis point change in the long-term rate of return on plan assets used in accounting for our pension plans would have a
$1.5 million impact on pension expense. In addition, if required, actuarial gains and losses will be recorded in accordance with our defined benefit plan accounting method as previously described. It is not possible to forecast or
predict whether there will be actuarial gains and losses in future periods, and if required, the magnitude of any such adjustment. These gains and losses are driven by differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions that are
beyond our control, such as changes in interest rates and the actual return on pension plan assets.

In January 2018, we adopted ASU

2017-07,

which requires entities to present the defined benefit plan

non-service

related costs outside the operating income subtotal. The new guidance was applied
retrospectively in the consolidated statement of income. As a result, we reclassified $9.6 million and



$14.1 million of income from the operating income subtotal to other income, in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The retrospective impact of adopting ASU

2017-07

is as follows:

Income Taxes

In accordance
with ASC requirements for Income Taxes, we establish deferred tax liabilities or assets for temporary differences between financial and tax reporting bases and subsequently adjust them to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when
the temporary differences reverse. We record a valuation allowance reducing deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.

We record liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on a

two-step

process. The first step is recognition, where we evaluate whether an individual tax position has
a likelihood of greater than 50% of being sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. For tax positions that are currently estimated to have a less
than 50% likelihood of being sustained, no tax benefit is recorded. For tax positions that have met the recognition threshold in the first step, we perform the second step of measuring the benefit to be recorded. The actual benefits ultimately
realized may differ from our estimates. In future periods, changes in facts, circumstances, and new information may require us to change the recognition and measurement estimates with regard to individual tax positions. Changes in recognition and
measurement estimates are recorded in the consolidated statement of income and consolidated balance sheet in the period in which such changes occur. As of December 31, 2018, we had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits pertaining to
uncertain tax positions totaling $83.5 million. It is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits may decrease in the range of $1.4 million to $3.5 million in the next 12 months primarily as a result of the conclusion of
U.S. federal, state and foreign income tax proceedings.

The Tax Act made significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code including a reduction in
the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, generally providing for an exemption from federal income tax for dividends received from foreign subsidiaries, and imposing a

one-time

transition tax on the deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings and profits as of December 31, 2017. On December 22, 2017, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB
118”) was issued, which deals with the application of U.S. GAAP to situations where a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting
for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. In accordance with SAB 118, we calculated our best estimate of the impact of the Tax Act on our 2017 effective income tax rate. As a result, the Company recorded a provisional net benefit of
$25.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which the Tax Act was enacted. This provisional amount included an estimated reduction in the Company’s net deferred tax liabilities of $62.4 million resulting from the
decrease in the federal income tax rate; an estimated deemed repatriation tax liability of $28.5 million; and an estimated net increase to our provision for taxes on foreign earnings not considered permanently reinvested of $8.2 million.
In the quarter ended December 31, 2018, the Company completed its analysis in conjunction with the SAB 118 measurement period ending on December 22, 2018. The total tax provision impact for the year ended December 31, 2018 was an
unfavorable adjustment of $5.5 million related primarily to certain deferred tax assets and liabilities.

The Tax Act included a provision for
Global Intangible

Low-Taxed

Income (GILTI), the Company elected an accounting policy to treat GILTI as a period cost when incurred. The GILTI provision is effective for taxable years of foreign corporations
beginning after December 31, 2017.



Customer Program Costs

Customer programs and incentives are a common practice in our businesses. Our businesses incur customer program costs to obtain favorable product placement, to promote sales of products and to maintain competitive
pricing. We record estimates to reduce revenue for customer programs and incentives, which are considered variable consideration, and include price discounts, volume-based incentives, promotions and cooperative advertising when revenue is recognized
in order to determine the amount of consideration the Company will ultimately be entitled to receive. These estimates are based on historical and projected experience for each type of customer. In addition, for certain customer program incentives,
we receive an identifiable benefit (goods or services) in exchange for the consideration given and record the associated expenditure in selling, general and administrative expenses. Volume allowances are accrued based on management’s estimates
of customer volume achievement and other factors incorporated into customer agreements, such as new products, store sell-through, merchandising support, levels of returns and customer training. Management periodically reviews accruals for these
rebates and allowances, and adjusts accruals when circumstances indicate (typically as a result of a change in volume expectations). The costs typically recognized in “selling, general and administrative expenses” include product displays,
point of sale materials and media production costs.

Litigation Contingencies

Our businesses are subject to risks related to threatened or pending litigation and are routinely defendants in lawsuits associated with the normal conduct of business. Liabilities and costs associated with
litigation-related loss contingencies require estimates and judgments based on our knowledge of the facts and circumstances surrounding each matter and the advice of our legal counsel. We record liabilities for litigation-related losses when a
loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss in accordance with ASC requirements for Contingencies. We evaluate the measurement of recorded liabilities each reporting period based on the then-current facts and
circumstances specific to each matter. The ultimate losses incurred upon final resolution of litigation-related loss contingencies may differ materially from the estimated liability recorded at any particular balance sheet
date. Changes in estimates are recorded in earnings in the period in which such changes occur.

Environmental Matters

We are involved in remediation activities to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws. Liabilities for remediation costs of each site are
based on our best estimate of undiscounted future costs, excluding possible insurance recoveries or recoveries from other third parties. Uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations, technology and information related to individual sites make
it difficult to develop estimates of environmental remediation exposures. Some of the potential liabilities relate to sites we own, and some relate to sites we no longer own or never owned. Several of our subsidiaries have been designated as
potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”) under “Superfund” or similar state laws. As of December 31, 2018, ten such instances have not been dismissed, settled or otherwise resolved. In 2018, none of our
subsidiaries were identified as a PRP in a new instance and no instances were settled, dismissed or otherwise resolved. In most instances where our subsidiaries are named as a PRP, we enter into cost-sharing arrangements with other PRPs. We give
notice to insurance carriers of potential PRP liability, but very rarely, if ever, receive reimbursement from insurance for PRP costs. We believe that the cost of complying with the present environmental protection laws, before considering estimated
recoveries either from other PRPs or insurance, will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had accruals of $0.6 million and $0.7 million,
respectively, relating to environmental compliance and cleanup including, but not limited to, the above mentioned Superfund sites.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in interest
rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates



and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We
enter into financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The counterparties are major financial institutions.

Interest Rate Risk

A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates affecting the Company’s
external variable rate borrowings as of December 31, 2018, would be $8.5 million on a

pre-tax

basis.

Foreign Exchange Rate Risk

We enter into forward foreign
exchange contracts principally to hedge currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies, thereby limiting our risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. The periods of the forward foreign
exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the hedged transactions.

The estimated fair value of foreign currency contracts represents the amount
required to enter into offsetting contracts with similar remaining maturities based on quoted market prices.

The estimated potential loss under foreign
exchange contracts from movement in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. As part of our risk management procedure, we use a

value-at-risk

(“VAR”) sensitivity analysis model to estimate the maximum potential economic loss from adverse changes in foreign exchange rates over a

one-day

period given a 95% confidence level. The VAR model uses historical foreign exchange rates to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods. The estimated maximum

one-day

loss in the
fair value of the Company’s foreign currency exchange contracts using the VAR model was $0.8 million at December 31, 2018. The 95% confidence interval signifies our degree of confidence that actual losses under foreign exchange
contracts would not exceed the estimated losses. The amounts disregard the possibility that foreign currency exchange rates could move in our favor. The VAR model assumes that all movements in the foreign exchange rates will be adverse. These
amounts should not be considered projections of future losses, since actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets. The VAR model is a risk analysis tool and should not be construed as an endorsement
of the VAR model or the accuracy of the related assumptions.

Commodity Price Risk

We are subject to commodity price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, geopolitical and economic variables, and other unpredictable external factors. From time to time, we use derivative contracts to
manage our exposure to commodity price volatility.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1.    Background and Basis of Presentation

The Company is a leading home and security products company with a portfolio of leading branded products used for residential home repair, remodeling, new construction and security applications. References to
“Fortune Brands,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” refer to Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries as a whole, unless the context otherwise requires.

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form

10-K

have been derived from the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company’s consolidated financial statements are based on a fiscal year ending December 31. Certain of the
Company’s subsidiaries operate on a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending during the month of December. In December 2017, there were certain transactions that resulted in approximately $38 million of net cash outflows relating to payments made
to third parties in the normal course of business during the period between the

year-end

of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and the Company’s

year-end

(in 2018,
amounts were immaterial).

In September 2018, we acquired 100% of membership interests of Fiber Composites LLC (“Fiberon”), a leading U.S.
manufacturer of outdoor performance materials used in decking, railing and fencing products for a total purchase price of approximately $470.0 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. The acquisition of Fiberon provides category
expansion and product extension opportunities into the outdoor living space for our Doors & Security segment. The financial results were included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018 and in the
Company’s consolidated statements of income and statements of cash flow beginning in September 2018.

In July 2018, we publicly announced an
internal reorganization to combine our Doors & Security segments under common leadership to drive innovation, accelerate product development, and enhance investments and business processes. In connection with the reorganization, we changed
how our chief operating decision maker evaluates and allocates the resources for the combined business. Reporting for the new Doors & Security segment began in the third quarter of 2018 and historical financial segment information has been
restated to conform to the new segment presentation.

In October 2017, we acquired Victoria + Albert, a

UK-based

premium brand of standalone bathtubs, sink, tub fillers, faucets and other accessories. In July 2017, we acquired Shaws Since1897 Limited (“Shaws”), a

UK-based

luxury plumbing products company that
specializes in manufacturing and selling fireclay sinks and selling brassware and accessories in partnership with Perrin & Rowe. The financial results of both of the acquisitions were included in the Company’s December 31, 2018
and 2017 consolidated balance sheets and in the Company’s consolidated statements of income and statements of cash flow beginning in October 2017 and July 2017, respectively.

In September 2016, we acquired ROHL LLC (“ROHL”) and in a related transaction, we acquired TCL Manufacturing which gave us ownership of Perrin & Rowe Limited (“Perrin & Rowe”),
and in May 2016, we acquired Riobel Inc (“Riobel”). The financial results of ROHL, Perrin & Rowe and Riobel were included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and in the
Company’s consolidated statements of income and statements of cash flow beginning in September 2016 and May 2016, respectively.

The cash flows
from discontinued operations for 2018, 2017 and 2016 were not separately classified on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. Information on Business Segments was revised to exclude these discontinued operations.



2.    Significant Accounting Policies

Use of Estimates

The presentation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
(“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results in future periods could differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less are included in cash and cash equivalents.

Allowances for Doubtful Accounts

Trade receivables are recorded at the stated amount, less allowances for discounts and doubtful
accounts. The allowances for doubtful accounts represent estimated uncollectible receivables associated with potential customer defaults on contractual obligations (usually due to customers’ potential insolvency), or discounts related to early
payment of accounts receivables by our customers. The allowances include provisions for certain customers where a risk of default has been specifically identified. In addition, the allowances include a provision for customer defaults on a general
formula basis when it is determined the risk of some default is probable and estimable, but cannot yet be associated with specific customers. The assessment of the likelihood of customer defaults is based on various factors, including the length of
time the receivables are past due, historical collection experience and existing economic conditions. In accordance with this policy, our allowance for doubtful accounts was $3.7 million and $3.3 million as of December 31, 2018 and
2017, respectively.

Inventories

The majority of our inventories are accounted for using the

first-in,

first-out

(“FIFO”) inventory method. Inventory provisions are recorded to reduce inventory to the lower of cost or market value for obsolete or slow moving
inventory based on assumptions about future demand and marketability of products, the impact of new product introductions, inventory levels and turns, product spoilage and specific identification of items, such as product discontinuance,
engineering/material changes, or regulatory-related changes.

During the fourth quarter of 2018, we determined that it was preferable to change our
accounting policy from

last-in,

first-out

(“LIFO”) to FIFO for product groups in which metals comprise a significant portion of inventory cost. We believe this
change is preferable because it results in a uniform method to value our inventory across all our segments, improves comparability with our peers, and is expected to better reflect the current value of inventory on the consolidated balance sheets.
The change in costing method, which affected our Plumbing and Doors & Security segments, was recognized during the fourth quarter of 2018, by adjusting the cost of inventories to FIFO, resulting in a pretax benefit of approximately
$7.3 million ($5.5 million after tax) to Cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of income. The impact of this change is not material to our 2017 or 2016 results of operations or our financial position as of December 31,
2017, and therefore we did not retrospectively apply the change in accounting policy. LIFO inventories were zero and $245.6 million (with a current cost of $259.3 million) at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation is provided, principally on a
straight-line basis, over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Gains or losses resulting from dispositions are included in operating income. Betterments and renewals, which improve and extend the life of an asset, are capitalized; maintenance
and repair costs are expensed as incurred. Assets held for use to be disposed of at a future date are depreciated over the remaining useful life. Assets to be sold are written down to fair value at the time the assets are being actively marketed for
sale. Estimated useful lives of the related assets are as follows:

Buildings and leasehold improvements

15 to 40 years

Machinery and equipment

3 to 15 years

Software

3 to 7 years

Long-lived Assets

In accordance with ASC requirements for Property, Plant and Equipment, a long-lived
asset (including amortizable identifiable intangible assets) or asset group held for use is tested for



recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. When such events occur, we compare the sum of the undiscounted cash flows
expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group to the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group. The cash flows are based on our best estimate of future cash flows derived from the most recent
business projections. If this comparison indicates that there is an impairment, the amount of the impairment is calculated based on fair value. Fair value is estimated primarily using discounted expected future cash flows on a market-participant
basis.

During 2017, we recorded an impairment of $5.1 million related to a long lived asset to be disposed of in selling, general and
administrative expenses.

Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets

In accordance with ASC requirements for
Intangibles — Goodwill and Other, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter, and written down when impaired. An interim impairment test is performed if an event occurs or conditions change that would more likely
than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below the carrying value.

We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill using a weighting of the
income (80%) and market (20%) approaches. For the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow model, estimating the future cash flows of the reporting units to which the goodwill relates, and then discounting the future cash flows at a
market-participant-derived discount rate. In determining the estimated future cash flows, we consider current and projected future levels of income based on management’s plans for that business; business trends, prospects and market and
economic conditions; and market-participant considerations. Furthermore, our projection for the U.S. home products market is inherently subject to a number of uncertain factors, such as employment, home prices, credit availability, new home starts
and the rate of home foreclosures. For the market approach, we apply market multiples for peer groups to the current operating results of the reporting units to determine each reporting unit’s fair value. The Company’s reporting units are
operating segments, or one level below operating segments when appropriate. When the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we measure and recognize the amount of the goodwill impairment loss based on that
difference.

Purchased intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their useful lives unless those lives are determined to be
indefinite. The determination of the useful life of an intangible asset other than goodwill is based on factors including historical tradename performance with respect to consumer name recognition, geographic market presence, market share, and plans
for ongoing tradename support and promotion. Certain of our tradenames have been assigned an indefinite life as we currently anticipate that these tradenames will contribute cash flows to the Company indefinitely. Indefinite-lived intangible assets
are not amortized, but are evaluated at least annually to determine whether the indefinite useful life is appropriate. We measure the fair value of identifiable intangible assets upon acquisition and we review for impairment annually in the
fourth quarter, and whenever market or business events indicate there may be a potential impairment of that intangible asset. Impairment losses are recorded to the extent that the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its
fair value. We measure fair value using the standard relief-from-royalty approach which estimates the present value of royalty income that could be hypothetically earned by licensing the brand name to a third party over the remaining useful life.
The determination of fair value using this technique requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to the projected tradename revenue growth, the assumed royalty rate and the discount rate. We first assess qualitative factors to determine
whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. Qualitative factors include changes in volume, customers and the industry. If it is deemed more likely than not that an intangible asset is impaired, we will
perform a quantitative impairment test.

The events and/or circumstances that could have a potential negative effect on the estimated fair value of our
reporting units and indefinite-lived tradenames include: actual new construction and repair and remodel growth rates that fall below our assumptions, actions of key customers, increases in discount rates, continued economic uncertainty, higher
levels of unemployment, weak consumer confidence, lower levels of discretionary consumer spending and a decrease in royalty rates. We cannot predict the



occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstances that might adversely affect the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.

Investments in Equity Securities

In accordance with ASC requirements for Investments – equity securities, we account for

non-controlling

investments in equity securities at fair value, with any gains or losses recognized through other income and expense. Equity securities without readily determinable fair values are recorded at cost
minus impairment, plus or minus any changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer.

During the fourth quarter of 2018, our Plumbing segment entered into strategic partnerships with several companies who incorporate emerging technology into plumbing-related products, and at the same time acquired

non-controlling

equity interests in some of our partners. This includes an investment in Flo Technologies, Inc. (“Flo”), a U.S. manufacturer of a comprehensive water monitoring and

shut-off

system with leak detection and proactive leak detection technologies. Flo’s products are being rebranded to “Flo by Moen”, and our Plumbing segment will utilize its existing retail, wholesale
and builder networks to expand the reach of Flo’s technology.

As of December 31, 2018, all of our investments in our strategic partners do
not have readily determinable fair values. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the carrying value of our investments was $28.7 million and zero, respectively, which is included in other assets within our Consolidated Balance Sheet. There
were no impairments or other changes resulting from observable prices changes recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018. Impairments of $7.0 million were recorded within Other income, net within the Consolidated Statements of Income
during the year ended December 31, 2017 (see Note 22).

Defined Benefit Plans

We have a number of pension plans in
the United States, covering many of the Company’s employees. In addition, the Company provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to certain retirees. Service cost for 2018 relates to benefit accruals in an hourly Union
defined benefit plan in our Doors & Security segment. Benefit accruals under all other defined benefit pension plans were frozen as of December 31, 2016.

We record amounts relating to these plans based on calculations in accordance with ASC requirements for Compensation – Retirement Benefits, which include various actuarial assumptions, including discount
rates, assumed rates of return, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. We recognize changes in the fair value of pension plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of
the fair value of pension plan assets or each plan’s projected benefit obligation (the “corridor”) in earnings immediately upon remeasurement, which is at least annually in the fourth quarter of each year. We review our actuarial
assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current economic conditions and trends. The discount rate used to measure obligations is based on a spot-rate yield curve on a

plan-by-plan

basis that matches projected future benefit payments with the appropriate interest rate applicable to the timing of the projected future benefit payments. The expected rate of return on plan
assets is determined based on the nature of the plans’ investments, our current asset allocation and our expectations for long-term rates of return. Compensation increases reflect expected future compensation trends. For postretirement
benefits, our health care trend rate assumption is based on historical cost increases and expectations for long-term increases. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service
cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the related employees. We believe that the assumptions utilized in recording obligations under our plans, which are presented in
Note 15, “Defined Benefit Plans,” are reasonable based on our experience and on advice from our independent actuaries; however, differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect our financial
position and results of operations. We will continue to monitor these assumptions as market conditions warrant.

Insurance
Reserves

We provide for expenses associated with workers’ compensation and product liability obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The accruals are adjusted as new information
develops or circumstances change that would affect the estimated liability.



Litigation Contingencies

Our businesses are subject to risks related to threatened
or pending litigation and are routinely defendants in lawsuits associated with the normal conduct of business. Liabilities and costs associated with litigation-related loss contingencies require estimates and judgments based on our knowledge of
the facts and circumstances surrounding each matter and the advice of our legal counsel. We record liabilities for litigation-related losses when a loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss in accordance with ASC
requirements for Contingencies. We evaluate the measurement of recorded liabilities each reporting period based on the then-current facts and circumstances specific to each matter. The ultimate losses incurred upon final resolution of
litigation-related loss contingencies may differ materially from the estimated liability recorded at any particular balance sheet date. Changes in estimates are recorded in earnings in the period in which such changes occur.

Income Taxes

In accordance with ASC requirements for
Income Taxes, we establish deferred tax liabilities or assets for temporary differences between financial and tax reporting bases and subsequently adjust them to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences
reverse. We record a valuation allowance reducing deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.

We record
liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on a

two-step

process. The first step is recognition, where we evaluate whether an individual tax position has a likelihood of greater than 50% of being
sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. For tax positions that are currently estimated to have a less than 50% likelihood of being sustained, no
tax benefit is recorded. For tax positions that have met the recognition threshold in the first step, we perform the second step of measuring the benefit to be recorded. The actual benefits ultimately realized may differ from our estimates. In
future periods, changes in facts, circumstances, and new information may require us to change the recognition and measurement estimates with regard to individual tax positions. Changes in recognition and measurement estimates are recorded in the
consolidated statement of income and consolidated balance sheet in the period in which such changes occur. As of December 31, 2018, we had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits pertaining to uncertain tax positions totaling
$83.5 million. It is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits may decrease in the range of $1.4 million to $3.5 million in the next 12 months primarily as a result of the conclusion of U.S. federal, state and foreign
income tax proceedings.

The Tax Act made significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code including a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35%
to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, generally providing for an exemption from federal income tax for dividends received from foreign subsidiaries, and imposing a

one-time

transition
tax on the deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings and profits as of December 31, 2017. On December 22, 2017, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”) was issued, which deals with the application of U.S.
GAAP to situations where a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. In accordance with
SAB 118, we calculated our best estimate of the impact of the Tax Act on our 2017 effective income tax rate. As a result, the Company recorded a provisional net benefit of $25.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which the Tax
Act was enacted. This provisional amount included an estimated reduction in the Company’s net deferred tax liabilities of $62.4 million resulting from the decrease in the federal income tax rate; an estimated deemed repatriation tax
liability of $28.5 million; and an estimated net increase to our provision for taxes on foreign earnings not considered permanently reinvested of $8.2 million. In the quarter ended December 31, 2018, the Company completed its analysis
in conjunction with the SAB 118 measurement period ending on December 22, 2018. The total tax provision impact for the year ended December 31, 2018 was an unfavorable adjustment of $5.5 million related primarily to certain deferred
tax assets and liabilities.



The Tax Act included a provision for Global Intangible

Low-Taxed

Income
(GILTI), the Company elected an accounting policy to treat GILTI as a period cost when incurred. The GILTI provision is effective for taxable years of foreign corporations beginning after December 31, 2017.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue for the sale of goods based on its assessment of when control transfers to our
customers. Refer to Note 14 for additional information.

Cost of Products Sold

Cost of products sold includes all costs to
make products saleable, such as labor costs, inbound freight, purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs and internal transfer costs. In addition, all depreciation expense associated with assets used to manufacture products and make them
saleable is included in cost of products sold.

Customer Program Costs

Customer programs and incentives are a common
practice in our businesses. Our businesses incur customer program costs to obtain favorable product placement, to promote sales of products and to maintain competitive pricing. We record estimates to reduce revenue for customer programs and
incentives, which are considered variable consideration, and include price discounts, volume-based incentives, promotions and cooperative advertising when revenue is recognized in order to determine the amount of consideration the Company will
ultimately be entitled to receive. These estimates are based on historical and projected experience for each type of customer. In addition, for certain customer program incentives, we receive an identifiable benefit (goods or services) in exchange
for the consideration given and record the associated expenditure in selling, general and administrative expenses. Volume allowances are accrued based on management’s estimates of customer volume achievement and other factors incorporated into
customer agreements, such as new product purchases, store sell-through, merchandising support, levels of returns and customer training. Management periodically reviews accruals for these rebates and allowances, and adjusts accruals when
circumstances indicate (typically as a result of a change in volume expectations). The costs typically recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses include product displays, point of sale materials and media production costs. The costs
included in the selling, general and administrative expenses category were $66.5 million, $62.4 million and $44.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses include advertising costs; marketing costs;
selling costs, including commissions; research and development costs; shipping and handling costs, including warehousing costs; and general and administrative expenses. Shipping and handling costs included in selling, general and administrative
expenses were $215.9 million, $204.7 million and $197.0 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively

.

Advertising costs, which
amounted to $243.6 million, $233.2 million and $199.1 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, are principally expensed as incurred. Advertising costs paid to customers as pricing rebates include product displays, marketing
administration costs, media production costs and point of sale materials. Advertising costs recorded as a reduction to net sales, primarily cooperative advertising, were $72.4 million, $65.6 million and $52.5 million in 2018, 2017 and
2016, respectively. Advertising costs recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses were $171.2 million, $167.6 million and $146.6 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Research and development expenses include product development, product improvement, product engineering and process improvement costs. Research and development
expenses, which were $50.3 million, $50.7 million and $53.1 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, are expensed as incurred.

Stock-based Compensation

Stock-based compensation expense, measured as the fair value of an award on the date of grant, is recognized
in the financial statements over the period that an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award. The fair value of each option award is measured on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value
of each performance share



award is based on the average of the high and low share prices on the date of grant and the probability of meeting performance targets. The fair value of each restricted stock unit granted is
equal to the average of the high and low share prices on the date of grant. See Note 13, “Stock-Based Compensation,” for additional information.

Earnings Per Share

Earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to Fortune Brands by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the year. Diluted earnings per common share include the impact of all potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the year. See Note 21, “Earnings Per Share,” for further discussion.

Foreign Currency Translation

Foreign currency balance sheet accounts are translated into U.S. dollars at the actual rates of
exchange at the balance sheet date. Income and expenses are translated at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period for the foreign subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency. The related translation adjustments
are made directly to a separate component of the “accumulated other comprehensive income” (“AOCI”) caption in equity. Transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of a subsidiary are translated into
functional currency with resulting transaction gains or losses recorded in other expense, net.

Derivative Financial
Instruments

In accordance with ASC requirements for Derivatives and Hedging, all derivatives are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measurement of those instruments is at fair value. If the
derivative is designated as a fair value hedge and is highly effective, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the same period. If the derivative is
designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded directly to a separate component of AOCI, and are recognized in the consolidated statement of income when the hedged item affects
earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings.

Deferred currency gains/(losses) of
$2.2 million, $0.4 million and $(3.5) million (before tax impact) were reclassified into earnings for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Based on foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2018, we
estimate that $3.3 million of net currency derivative gains included in AOCI as of December 31, 2018 will be reclassified to earnings within the next twelve months.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU

2014-09,

which clarifies the accounting
for revenue arising from contracts with customers and specifies the disclosures that an entity should include in its financial statements. We adopted ASU

2014-09

as of January 1, 2018 and for periods
thereafter using the modified retrospective approach, which we applied to all contracts not completed as of January 1, 2018. The cumulative effect of adopting the new revenue standard was not material and no adjustment was recorded to retained
earnings. The comparative financial information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact in 2018 and we do not expect
it to have a material impact on revenue or net income on an ongoing basis.

A majority of our sales revenue continues to be recognized when products are
shipped from our facilities to our customers. Previously, for certain products, we recognized sales revenue at destination as we determined risks and rewards transferred at that point. We now recognize sales revenue for these customers at the
shipping point of the products consistent with the respective contractual terms.

See Note 14, “Revenue,” for further information.



Leases

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU

2016-02,

which requires lessees to recognize almost all leases on their balance sheet
as a

“right-of-use”

asset and lease liability but recognize related expenses in a manner similar to current accounting. The guidance also eliminates current
real estate-specific provisions for all entities. In January 2018, the FASB issued ASU

2018-01,

which clarifies the application of the new leases guidance to land easements. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU

2018-10

and ASU

2018-11,

which clarify certain guidance included in ASU

2016-02

and introduces a new optional transition method. The
standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 (calendar year 2019 for Fortune Brands) and earlier application is permitted.

We plan to adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2019 using the transition method introduced by ASU

2018-11,

which does not require revisions to comparative periods. We
will elect to implement the transition package of practical expedients permitted within the new standard, which among other things, allows us to carryforward the historical lease classification. In addition, we are electing the hindsight practical
expedient to determine the lease term. We will make an accounting policy election to not recognize leases with an initial term of less than twelve months on the balance sheet and we will recognize the related lease payments as expense in the
statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

While we are continuing to finalize our assessment of the impacts of
the standard, we have completed our scoping reviews, identified our significant leases by segment and by asset type, and made progress in developing accounting policies upon adoption of the standard. We have implemented an accounting system to
support the future state leasing process and input the data from substantially all of our existing leases into the system. We continue to refine our future process design as part of the overall system implementation. Upon adoption, we expect to
recognize a lease liability, with an offsetting increase to

right-of-use

assets ranging from $170 million to $200 million. Differences between the lease
liability and

right-of-use

asset, recognized are not expected to material. We do not expect the standard to materially affect our consolidated net income.

Presentation of Net Periodic Pension and Postretirement Cost

In March 2017, the FASB issued

ASU 2017-07, which

requires entities to present the service cost component of the net periodic benefit cost in the same income
statement line item(s) as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period. In addition, only the service cost component will be eligible for capitalization in assets. Companies will present the other components
(i.e., amortization of prior service cost/credits, interest cost, expected return on plan assets and actuarial gains/losses) separately from the line item(s) that includes the service cost and outside of any subtotal of operating income. We adopted
ASU

2014-09

as of January 1, 2018 and for periods thereafter using the retrospective approach. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial statements. See Note 15 for
further information.

Stock Compensation Scope of Modification Accounting

In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU

2017-09,

which clarifies when changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award must be accounted for as modifications. The
guidance provides a relief to entities that make

non-substantive

changes to their share-based payment awards and will result in fewer changes to the terms of an award being accounted for as modifications. We
adopted the new standard beginning January 1, 2018. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial statements.

Clarifying the Definition of a Business

In January 2017,
the FASB issued ASU

2017-01,

which changes the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluating when a set of transferred assets and activities is a business and therefore business



combination guidance would apply. The new standard requires an entity to evaluate if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable
asset (i.e., a business) or a group of similar identifiable assets (i.e., not a business). The guidance also requires a business to include at least one substantive process and narrows the definition of outputs (e.g., revenues with customers). We
adopted the new standard beginning January 1, 2018. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial statements.

Restricted Cash

In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU

2016-18,

according to which entities are no longer required to present transfers between cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. The prior
standard did not address the classification of activity related to restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows and this has resulted in diversity in cash flows presentation. We adopted the new standard beginning
January 1, 2018. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial statements.

Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets
Other Than Inventory

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU

2016-16,

which requires companies to account for
the income tax effects of intercompany sales and transfers of assets other than inventory (e.g., intangible assets) when the transfer occurs. Under the previous guidance companies were required to defer the income tax effects of intercompany
transfers of assets until the asset has been sold to an outside party or otherwise recognized (e.g., depreciated, amortized or impaired). We adopted the new standard beginning January 1, 2018 using a “modified retrospective” approach
(i.e., with a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings at adoption). The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial statements.

Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments

In September 2016, the FASB issued ASU

2016-15,

which changes how an entity classifies certain cash receipts and cash payments on its statement of cash flows. The key changes that may potentially impact our financial statements include the following: 1)
Cash payments for debt prepayment or extinguishment costs would be classified as financing cash outflows; 2) Contingent consideration payments that are not made within three months after the consummation of a business combination would be classified
as financing (if the payment is made up to the acquisition date fair value of liability) or operating outflows (if in excess of acquisition fair value) and cash payments made “soon after” the consummation of a business combination
generally would be classified as cash outflows from investing activities; 3) Insurance settlement proceeds would be classified based on the nature of the loss; and 4) Company-owned life insurance settlement proceeds would be presented as investing
cash inflows, and premiums would be classified as investing or operating cash outflows, or a combination of both. We retrospectively adopted the new standard beginning January 1, 2018. The adoption of this standard did not have a material
effect on our financial statements.

Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU

2016-01,

which requires entities to measure investments in unconsolidated entities
(other than those accounted for using the equity method of accounting) at fair value through the income statement. There will no longer be an

available-for-sale

classification (with changes in fair value reported in Other Comprehensive Income). In addition, the cost method is eliminated for equity investments without readily determinable fair values. We adopted the new standard beginning January 1,
2018. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial statements.

Clarifying Asset Derecognition Guidance and
Accounting for Partial Sales of Nonfinancial Assets

In February 2017, the FASB issued ASU

2017-05,

which
clarifies the scope and application of various standards for the sale of nonfinancial assets (e.g. PP&E including real estate, intangible assets, materials



and supplies). The standard distinguishes between a sale to a customer versus a

non-customer.

Sales to customers are within the scope of the new revenue
standard. It also clarifies a derecognition model for nonfinancial assets that do not represent a business. We adopted the new standard beginning January 1, 2018 consistent with the effective date for the new revenue recognition standard. The
adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial statements.

Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities

In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU

2017-12

which amends the current hedge accounting model. The new
standard eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and generally requires the entire change in the fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item (which
is consistent with our current practice). The change in fair value for qualifying cash flow and net investment hedges will be included in other comprehensive income (until they are reclassified into the income statement). The standard also eases
certain documentation and assessment requirements and modifies the accounting for components excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The standard is effective as of January 1, 2019. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to
have a material effect on our financial statements.

Financial Instruments — Credit Losses

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU

2016-13,

which changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other
instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. The new guidance applies to most financial assets measured at amortized cost, including trade and other receivables and loans as well as

off-balance-sheet

credit exposures (e.g., loan commitments and standby letters of credit). The standard will replace the “incurred loss” approach under the current guidance with an “expected
loss” model that requires an entity to estimate its lifetime “expected credit loss.” The standard is effective January 1, 2020 and early application is permitted beginning January 1, 2019. We are assessing the impact the
adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements.

Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU

2018-02,

“Income Statement — Reporting Comprehensive Income
(Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.” This guidance permits companies to reclassify to retained earnings the tax effects stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a result
of U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. This guidance is effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2019. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on our financial statements.

Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting

In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU

2018-07

which simplifies the accounting for share-based arrangements with
nonemployees. The new guidance generally aligns the accounting for share-based awards to nonemployees with the guidance for share-based awards to employees. The guidance is effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning
January 1, 2019. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on our financial statements.

Codification
Improvements

In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU

2018-09

which includes technical corrections,
clarifications, and other minor improvements to various areas including business combinations, fair value measurements and hedging. The transition and effective date guidance is based on the facts and circumstances of each amendment. Some of the
amendments in this standard were effective immediately, while others will be effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2019. Our adoption of the immediately effective pieces of this standard did not have a material
effect on our financial statements, nor do we expect the adoption of the other aspects of this standard to be material.



Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU

2018-13

which removes the requirement to disclose: 1) amount of and reasons for
transfers between Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy, 2) policy for timing of transfers between levels, and 3) valuation processes for Level 3 investments. In addition, this guidance modifies and adds other disclosure requirements,
which primarily relate to valuation of Level 3 assets and liabilities. The guidance is effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this
guidance to have a material effect on our financial statements.

Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU

2018-14

which removes several disclosure requirements, including the amount in AOCI
expected to be recognized in income over the next fiscal year and the effects of a 1% change in assumed health care cost trend rates and adds new disclosure requirements to explain reasons for significant gains and losses related to changes in the
benefit obligation for the period, and to disclose weighted-average interest crediting rates for plans with promised interest crediting rates. The guidance is effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2020, with early
adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on our financial statements.

Accounting for
Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU

2018-15

which aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to
develop or obtain

internal-use

software. Costs to obtain software, including configuration and integration with legacy IT systems, coding and testing, including parallel process phases are eligible for
capitalization under the new standard. In addition, activities that would be expensed include costs related to vendor demonstrations, determining performance and technology requirements and training activities. The standard is effective for the
Company’s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. We are assessing the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements.

2018 includes the impact of acquiring Fiberon. See Note 4 for additional information.

4.    Acquisitions and Dispositions

In September 2018, we acquired 100% of membership
interests of Fiber Composites LLC (“Fiberon”), a leading U.S. manufacturer of outdoor performance materials used in decking, railing and fencing products for a total purchase price of approximately $470.0 million, subject to certain
post-closing adjustments. The acquisition of Fiberon provides category expansion and product extension opportunities into the outdoor living space for our Doors & Security segment. Fiberon’s net sales and operating income in 2018 were
not material to the Company. We have not included pro forma financial information as it is immaterial to our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. We financed the transaction using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit
and term loan facilities. The results of operations are included in the Doors & Security segment from the date of the acquisition. We expect goodwill related to this acquisition to be deductible for income tax purposes.



The following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of the acquisition.

The preceding purchase price allocation has been determined provisionally and is subject to revision as additional information
about the fair value of individual assets and liabilities becomes available. We apply significant judgement in determining the estimates and assumptions used to determine the fair value of the identifiable intangible assets, including forecasted
revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates, discount rates and assumed royalty rates. The Company is in the process of finalizing valuations of certain tangible and intangible assets, including property, plant and equipment and identifiable
intangible assets. The provisional measurement of property, plant and equipment, identifiable intangible assets, and goodwill is subject to change. Any change in the acquisition date fair value of the acquired net assets will change the amount of
the purchase price allocable to goodwill.

Goodwill includes expected sales and cost synergies. Identifiable intangible assets primarily consist of
customer relationships and tradenames.

In October 2017, we acquired Victoria + Albert, a

UK-based

premium brand
of standalone bathtubs, sinks, tub fillers, faucets and other accessories. In July 2017, we acquired Shaws, a

UK-based

luxury plumbing products company that specializes in manufacturing and selling fireclay
sinks and selling brassware and accessories. The total combined consideration paid was approximately $146 million, including $19.9 million of additional purchase price consideration paid related to post-closing adjustments and deferred
acquisition payments during 2018. The combined consideration paid is subject to further deferred acquisition payments. Net sales and operating income in 2017 from these acquisitions were not material to the Company. We financed the transactions
using cash on hand and borrowings under our existing revolving and term loan credit facilities. The results of the operations are included in the Plumbing segment from the respective dates of acquisition. We do not expect any portion of goodwill to
be deductible for income tax purposes.

In April 2017, we completed the sale of Field ID, our cloud-based inspection and safety compliance software
product line included in our Doors & Security segment. We recorded a

pre-tax

loss of $2.4 million and a

pre-tax

impairment charge to write down the
long-lived assets included in this disposal group to fair value of $3.2 million as a result of this sale (See Note 7). The estimated tax expense on the sale was insignificant. Field ID did not qualify for presentation as a discontinued
operation in our financial statements.

5.    Discontinued Operations

In the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the loss on discontinued operations is primarily related to the prior sale of the Waterloo tool storage and
Simonton window businesses.



6.    Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets

We had goodwill of $2,080.3 million and $1,912.0 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase of $168.3 million was
primarily due to the acquisition of Fiberon in the Doors & Security segment as well as acquisition related adjustments in our Plumbing segment related to the acquisition of Victoria + Albert, partially offset by foreign translation
adjustments. The change in the net carrying amount of goodwill by segment was as follows:

December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The $117.9 million increase in gross identifiable intangible assets was primarily due to the acquisition of Fiberon in our Doors & Security segment partially offset by a tradename
impairment charges of $62.6 million in our Cabinets segment.

Amortizable intangible assets, principally customer relationships and patents/proprietary technology, are subject to amortization
on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life, ranging from 2 to 30 years, based on the assessment of a number of factors that may impact useful life. These factors include historical tradename performance with respect to consumer
name recognition, geographic market presence, market share, plans for ongoing tradename support and promotion, customer attrition rates, and other relevant factors. We expect to record intangible amortization of approximately $43 million in
2019, $42 million in 2020, $42 million in 2021, $40 million in 2022, and $39 million in 2023.

We review indefinite-lived tradename
intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, as well as whenever market or business events indicate there may be a potential impact on a specific intangible asset. Impairment losses are recorded to the extent that the carrying
value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value. We measure fair value using the standard relief-from-royalty approach which estimates the present value of royalty income that could be hypothetically earned by licensing the



tradename to a third party over the remaining useful life. The determination of fair value using this technique requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to projected tradename
revenue growth, the assumed royalty rate and the discount rate.

During 2018, we recognized asset impairment charges of $62.6 million related to
two indefinite-lived tradenames within our Cabinets segment. During the third quarter of 2018, we recognized an impairment of $27.1 million related to one tradename, which was primarily the result of reduced revenue growth expectations
associated with Cabinets operations in Canada, including the announced closure of Company-owned retail locations during the third quarter of 2018. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we recognized an impairment of $35.5 million related to
another tradename, which was primarily the result of lower than forecasted sales during the fourth quarter of 2018 as well as projected changes in the mix of revenue across our tradenames in future periods, including the impact of more moderate
industry growth expectations, which were finalized during our annual planning process conducted during the fourth quarter. The fair values of the impaired tradenames were measured using the relief-from-royalty approach, which estimates the present
value of royalty income that could be hypothetically earned by licensing the tradename to a third party over its remaining useful life. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in estimating the fair value include estimated future annual
net sales for the tradename, assumed royalty rate, income tax rate, and a discount rate that reflects the level of risk associated with the tradename’s future sales and profitability. We selected the assumptions used in the financial forecasts
using historical data, supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions, estimated growth rates, and management plans. These assumptions represent level 3 inputs of the fair value hierarchy (refer to Note 10). As of December 31, 2018,
the carrying value of the tradenames that were impaired was approximately $152.0 million. We did not record any asset impairment changes associated with goodwill or indefinite-lived assets in 2017 or 2016.

The events and/or circumstances that could have a potential negative effect on the estimated fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived tradenames
include: actual new construction and repair and remodel growth rates that fall below our assumptions, actions of key customers, increases in discount rates, continued economic uncertainty, higher levels of unemployment, weak consumer confidence,
lower levels of discretionary consumer spending, a decrease in royalty rates and decline in the trading price of our common stock. We cannot predict the occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstances that might adversely affect the
carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.

7.    Asset Impairment Charges

In January 2017, we committed to a plan to sell Field ID, our cloud-based inspection and safety compliance software product line included in our Doors &
Security segment. In accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 360, as a result of our decision to sell, during the first quarter of 2017 we recorded $3.2 million of

pre-tax

impairment charges to write down the long-lived assets included in this disposal group to fair value, based upon their estimated fair value less cost to sell. These charges consisted of approximately $3.0 million for definite-lived
intangible assets and $0.2 million for fixed assets. We completed the sale of Field ID in April 2017.

8.    External Debt
and Financing Arrangements

In September 2018, we issued $600 million of unsecured senior notes (“2018 Senior Notes”) in a registered
public offering. The 2018 Senior Notes are due in 2023 with a coupon rate of 4%. All other terms and conditions of the 2018 Senior Notes are substantially consistent with the 2015 Senior Notes. We used the proceeds from the 2018 Senior Notes
offering to pay down our revolving credit facility. On December 31, 2018, the net carrying value of the 2018 Senior Notes, net of underwriting commissions, price discounts, and debt issuance costs, was $595.0 million.

In June 2015, we issued $900 million of unsecured senior notes (“2015 Senior Notes”, and collectively with the 2018 Senior Notes, the “Senior
Notes”) in a registered public offering. The 2015 Senior Notes consist of two tranches: $400 million of five-year notes due in 2020 with a coupon rate of 3% and $500 million of

ten-year

notes
due in 2025 with a coupon rate of 4%. We used the proceeds from the 2015 Senior Notes



offering to pay down our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. On December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the net carrying value of the 2015 Senior Notes, net
of underwriting commissions, price discounts, and debt issuance costs, was $894.0 million and $892.6 million, respectively.

In March 2018,
the Company entered into a $350 million term loan for general corporate purposes that matures in March 2019. In August 2018, the Company amended its existing $350 million term loan to increase the borrowings under the term loan from
$350 million to $525 million. All other terms and conditions on the amended term loan remain the same as the previous $350 million term loan. Interest rates under the term loan are variable based on LIBOR at the time of the
borrowing and the Company’s long-term credit rating and can range from LIBOR + 0.625% to LIBOR + 1.25%. Covenants under the term loan are the same as the existing $1.25 billion revolving credit agreement. As of December 31,
2018, we were in compliance with all covenants under this term loan.

In June 2016, the Company amended and restated its credit agreement to combine and
rollover the 2011 revolving credit facility and term loan into a new standalone $1.25 billion revolving credit facility. The amendment and restatement was a

non-cash

transaction for the Company. Terms and
conditions of the credit agreement, including the total commitment amount, essentially remained the same. The revolving credit facility will mature in June 2021 and borrowings thereunder will be used for general corporate purposes. On
December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, our outstanding borrowings under this facility were $320.0 million and $615.0 million, respectively. At December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the current portion of long-term
debt under this facility was zero. Interest rates under the facility are variable based on LIBOR at the time of the borrowing and the Company’s long-term credit rating and can range from LIBOR + 0.9% to LIBOR + 1.5%. As of
December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants under this facility.

We currently have uncommitted bank lines of credit in China,
which provide for unsecured borrowings for working capital of up to $23.5 million in aggregate, of which zero were outstanding, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. The weighted-average interest rates on these borrowings were zero in 2018 and
2017.

2021 and $600 million in 2022 through 2023.

In our debt agreements, there are normal and customary events of default which would permit the
lenders to accelerate the debt if not cured within applicable grace periods, such as failure to pay principal or interest when due or a change in control of the Company. There were no events of default as of December 31, 2018.

9.    Financial Instruments

We do not
enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We principally use financial instruments to reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodities used as



raw materials in our products. The principal derivative financial instruments we enter into on a routine basis are foreign exchange contracts. Derivative financial instruments are recorded at
fair value. The counterparties to derivative contracts are major financial institutions. We are subject to credit risk on these contracts equal to the fair value of these instruments. Management currently believes that the risk of incurring material
losses is unlikely and that the losses, if any, would be immaterial to the Company.

Raw materials used by the Company are subject to price volatility
caused by weather, supply conditions, geopolitical and economic variables, and other unpredictable external factors. As a result, from time to time, we enter into commodity swaps to manage the price risk associated with forecasted purchases of
materials used in our operations. We account for these commodity derivatives as economic hedges or cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of economic hedges are recorded directly into current period earnings. There were no material commodity
swap contracts outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.

We enter into foreign exchange contracts primarily to hedge forecasted
sales and purchases denominated in select foreign currencies, thereby limiting currency risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. The periods of the foreign exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the forecasted
transactions, which generally do not exceed 12 to 15 months subsequent to the latest balance sheet date.

For derivative instruments that are designated
as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item, are recognized on the same line of the statement of income. The effective portions of cash flow hedges are reported in
other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and are recognized in the statement of income when the hedged item affects earnings. The changes in fair value for net investment hedges are recognized in the statement of income when realized upon sale
or upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of the investment in the foreign entity. The ineffective portion of all hedges is recognized in current period earnings. In addition, changes in the fair value of all economic hedge transactions
are immediately recognized in current period earnings. Our primary foreign currency hedge contracts pertain to the Canadian dollar, the British pound, the Chinese yuan and the Mexican peso. The gross U.S. dollar equivalent notional amount of all
foreign currency derivative hedges outstanding at December 31, 2018 was $345.3 million, representing a net settlement assets of $3.4 million. Based on foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2018, we estimate that
$3.3 million of net foreign currency derivative losses included in OCI as of December 31, 2018 will be reclassified to earnings within the next twelve months.

The fair values of foreign exchange and commodity derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 were:

2017 and 2016.

10.    Fair Value Measurements

ASC requirements for Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels. Level 1 inputs,
the highest priority, are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs reflect other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are either observable directly or through corroboration with observable
market data. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs due to little or no market activity for the asset or liability, such as internally-developed valuation models. We do not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring
basis that are level 3.

The carrying value and fair value of debt as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:

In December 2018, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 10% to $0.22 per share of our common stock.

The Company has 60 million authorized shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share. At December 31, 2018, no shares of our preferred
stock were outstanding. Our Board of Directors has the authority, without action by the Company’s stockholders, to designate and issue our preferred stock in one or more series and to designate the rights, preferences, limitations and
privileges of each series of preferred stock, which may be greater than the rights of the Company’s common stock.

In 2018, we repurchased
approximately 12.0 million shares of outstanding common stock under the Company’s share repurchase program at a cost of $694.6 million. As of December 31, 2018, the Company’s total remaining share repurchase authorization
under the remaining program was approximately $413.7 million. The share repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

13.    Stock-Based Compensation

As of December 31, 2018, we had awards outstanding under two Long-Term Incentive Plans, the Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) and the 2011
Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2011 Plan”, and together with the Plan—the “Plans”). Our stockholders approved the Plan in 2013, which provides for the granting of stock options, performance share awards, restricted stock
units, and other equity-based awards, to employees, directors and consultants. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 4.6 million shares of common stock remained authorized for issuance under the Plan. In addition, shares of common stock
may be automatically added to the number of shares of common stock that may be issued as awards expire, are terminated, cancelled or forfeited, or are used to satisfy the required withholding taxes with respect to existing awards under the Plans. No
new stock-based awards can be made under the 2011 Plan, but there are outstanding stock options under the 2011 Plan that continue to be exercisable. Upon the exercise or payment of stock-based awards, shares of common stock are issued from
authorized common shares.

Included in compensation costs are cash-settled restricted stock units of $0.9 million that are classified as a liability.
Compensation costs that were capitalized in inventory were not material.

Restricted Stock Units

Restricted stock units have been granted to officers and certain employees of the Company and represent the right to receive unrestricted shares of Company common
stock subject to continued employment through each vesting date. In addition, certain employees can elect to defer receipt of a portion of their RSU awards upon vesting. Compensation cost is recognized over the service period. We calculate the fair
value of each restricted stock unit granted by using the average of the high and low share prices on the date of grant. Restricted stock units generally vest ratably over a three-year period.

A summary of activity with respect to restricted stock units outstanding under the Plans for the year ended December 31, 2018 was as follows:

The remaining unrecognized

pre-tax

compensation cost related to restricted stock units at
December 31, 2018 was approximately $17.1 million, and the weighted-average period of time over which this cost will be recognized is 1.7 years. The fair value of restricted stock units that vested during 2018, 2017 and 2016 was
$22.2 million, $20.3 million and $16.4 million, respectively.

Stock Option Awards

Stock options were granted to officers and certain employees of the Company and represent the right to purchase shares of Company common stock subject to continued
employment through each vesting date.

All stock-based compensation to employees is required to be measured at fair value and expensed over the
requisite service period. We recognize compensation expense on awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. Stock options granted under the Plans generally vest over a three-year period and have a maturity
of ten years from the grant date.



The fair value of Fortune Brands options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing
model with the assumptions shown in the following table:




Current expected dividend yield

1.3%

1.4%

1.4%

Expected volatility

30.0%

Risk-free interest rate

2.6%

1.9%

1.3%

Expected term

5 years

5.5 years

5.5 years

The determination of expected volatility is based on a blended peer group volatility for companies in similar industries, at a
similar stage of life and with similar market capitalization. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the stock options. The expected term is the period over which our
employees are expected to hold their options. The expected term was determined based on the historical employee exercise behavior and the contractual term of the options. The dividend yield is based on the Company’s estimated dividend over the
expected term. The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options granted under the Plans during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $14.14, $13.49 and $12.70, respectively.

respectively.



Performance Awards

Performance share awards were granted to officers and certain employees of the Company and represent the right to earn

shares of Company common stock based on the achievement of company-wide

non-GAAP

performance conditions, including cumulative diluted earnings per share, average return on invested capital, average return on net tangible assets and cumulative EBITDA during the three-year performance
period. Compensation cost is amortized into expense over the performance period, which is generally three years, and is based on the probability of meeting performance targets. The fair value of each performance share award is based on the average
of the high and low stock price on the date of grant.

The following table summarizes information about

performance share awards as of
December 31, 2018, as well as activity during the year then ended. The number of performance share awards granted are shown below at the target award amounts:

(218,912 shares).

Director Awards

Stock awards
are used as part of the compensation provided to outside directors under the Plan. Awards are issued annually in the second quarter. In addition, outside directors can elect to have director fees paid in stock or can elect to defer payment of stock.
Compensation cost is expensed at the time of an award based on the fair value of a share at the date of the award. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, we awarded 19,109, 15,311 and 16,471 shares of Company common stock to outside directors with a weighted
average fair value on the date of the award of $54.93, $63.43 and $57.37, respectively.

14.    Revenue

Our principal performance obligations are the sale of kitchen and bath cabinets, faucets and accessories, fiberglass and steel entry-door systems and locks, safes,
safety, security devices and decking (collectively, “goods” or “products”). We recognize revenue for the sale of goods based on our assessment of when control transfers to our customers. For the majority of our sales, we
recognize revenue at the point in time when we ship product from our facilities to our customers. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods to our customers. Payment terms on our
product sales normally range from 30 to 90 days. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that we collect are excluded from revenue. The expected costs associated with our contractual warranties will continue to be recognized as expense when the
products are sold. See Note 18, “Product Warranties,” for further discussion.

We record estimates to reduce revenue for customer programs and
incentives, which are considered variable consideration, and include price discounts, volume-based incentives, promotions and cooperative advertising when revenue is recognized in order to determine the amount of consideration the Company



will ultimately be entitled to receive. These estimates are based on historical and projected experience for each type of customer. In addition, for certain customer program incentives, we
receive an identifiable benefit (goods or services) in exchange for the consideration given and record the associated expenditure in selling, general and administrative expenses.

We account for shipping and handling costs that occur after the customer has obtained control of a product as a fulfillment activity (i.e., as an expense) rather than as a promised service (i.e., as a revenue
element). These costs are classified within selling, general and administrative expenses.

Settlement of our outstanding accounts receivable balances is
normally within 30 to 90 days of the original sale transaction date. Obligations arise for us from customer rights to return our goods for any reason, including among others, product obsolescence, stock rotations,

trade-in

agreements for newer products and upon termination of a customer contract. We estimate future product returns at the time of sale based on historical experience and record a corresponding refund
obligation, which amounted to $14.8 million as of December 31, 2018. Refund obligations are classified within other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Return assets related to the refund obligation are measured at the
carrying amount of the goods at the time of sale, less any expected costs to recover the goods and any expected reduction in value. Return assets are classified within other current assets and were approximately $2.3 million as of
December 31, 2018.

The Company disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers into (i) major sales distribution channels in the U.S. and
(ii) total sales to customers outside the U.S. market as these categories depict the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows that are affected by economic factors. The following table disaggregates our consolidated
revenue by major sales distribution channels for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Practical Expedients

Incremental costs of obtaining a
contract include only those costs the Company incurs that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained. These costs are required to be recognized as assets and amortized over the period that the related goods or services
transfer to the customer. As a practical expedient, we expense as incurred costs to obtain a contract when the expected amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses.

15.    Defined Benefit Plans

We have a number of pension plans in the United States, covering many of the Company’s employees, however these plans have been closed to new hires. The
plans provide for payment of retirement benefits, mainly commencing between the ages of 55 and 65. After meeting certain qualifications, an employee



acquires a vested right to future benefits. The benefits payable under the plans are generally determined on the basis of an employee’s length of service and/or earnings. Employer
contributions to the plans are made, as necessary, to ensure legal funding requirements are satisfied. Also, from time to time, we may make contributions in excess of the legal funding requirements. Service cost for 2018 relates to benefit
accruals in an hourly Union defined benefit plan in our Doors & Security segment. Benefit accruals under all other defined benefit pension plans were frozen as of December 31, 2016.

In addition, the Company provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to certain retirees.

In the first quarter of 2013, the Company communicated a plan amendment to reduce health benefits to certain retired employees. Due
to the risk of litigation at the time of the initial communication, the Company elected to defer the full recognition of the benefit arising from the plan amendment. Following a favorable court decision in the first quarter of 2016, the Company
determined that it would realize the benefit from the plan amendment. As a result, the Company performed a

re-measurement

of the affected retiree plan liability as of March 31, 2016. This remeasurement
resulted in a $10.7 million reduction of accrued retiree benefit plan liabilities and a corresponding increase in prior service credits. In accordance with accounting requirements, the liability reduction from this remeasurement is recorded as
amortization of prior service credits in net income. In addition, we recorded a $0.9 million actuarial loss during the first quarter of 2016.

In January 2018, we adopted ASU

2017-07,

which requires entities to present the defined benefit plan

non-service

related costs outside the operating income subtotal. The new guidance was applied retrospectively in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. As a result, we reclassified



$9.6 million and $14.1 million of income from the operating income subtotal to other income, in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The retrospective
impact of adopting ASU

2017-07

Our defined benefit plans Master Trust own a variety of investment assets. All of these investment assets, except for group
annuity/insurance contracts are measured using net asset value per share as a practical expedient per ASC 820. Following the retrospective adoption of ASU

2015-07

(Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820):
Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share) we excluded all investments measured using net asset value per share in the amount of $576.0 million and $633.3 million as of December 31, 2018
and 2017, respectively, from the tabular fair value hierarchy disclosure.

The terms and conditions for redemptions vary for each class of the
investment assets valued at net asset value per share as a practical expedient. Real estate assets may be redeemed quarterly with a 45 day redemption notice period. Investment assets in multi-strategy hedge funds may be redeemed semi-annually with a
95 day redemption notice period. Equity, fixed income and cash and cash equivalents have no specified redemption frequency and notice period and may be redeemed daily. As of December 31, 2018 we do not have an intent to sell or otherwise
dispose of these investment assets at prices different than the net asset value per share.

Our investment strategy is to optimize investment returns
through a diversified portfolio of investments, taking into consideration underlying plan liabilities and asset volatility. The defined benefit asset allocation policy of the plans allow for an equity allocation of 0% to 75%, a fixed income
allocation of 25% to 100%, a cash allocation of up to 25% and other investments of up to 20%. Asset allocations are based on the underlying liability structure. All retirement asset allocations are reviewed periodically to ensure the allocation
meets the needs of the liability structure.

Our 2019 expected blended long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.0% was determined based on the
nature of the plans’ investments, our current asset allocation and projected long-term rates of return from pension investment consultants.

The 2018 effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by the corporate tax rate reduction from 35% to 21% under The Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”). The 2018 effective income tax rate was unfavorably impacted by the repeal of the Domestic Production Activity (Internal Revenue Code Section 199) Deduction, a valuation allowance increase, an
adjustment to the provisional net benefit recorded in 2017 under the Tax Act, state and local taxes, unfavorable tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, and increases in uncertain tax positions.

The 2017 effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by the Tax Act. The effective income tax rates for 2017 and 2016 were favorably impacted by a tax benefit related to share-based compensation, the tax
benefit attributable to the Domestic Production Activity (Internal Revenue Code Section 199) Deduction and favorable tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by state and local taxes and increases to uncertain tax positions.

The Tax Act made significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code including a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years
beginning after December 31, 2017, generally providing for an exemption from federal income tax for dividends received from foreign subsidiaries, and imposing a

one-time

transition tax on the deemed
repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings and profits as of December 31, 2017. On December 22, 2017, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”) was issued,



which deals with the application of U.S. GAAP to situations where a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable
detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. In accordance with SAB 118, we calculated our best estimate of the impact of the Tax Act on our 2017 effective income tax rate. As a result, the Company recorded a
provisional net benefit of $25.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which the Tax Act was enacted. This provisional amount included an estimated reduction in the Company’s net deferred tax liabilities of
$62.4 million resulting from the decrease in the federal income tax rate; an estimated deemed repatriation tax liability of $28.5 million; and an estimated net increase to our provision for taxes on foreign earnings not considered
permanently reinvested of $8.2 million. In the quarter ended December 31, 2018, the Company completed its analysis in conjunction with the SAB 118 measurement period ending on December 22, 2018. The total tax provision impact for the
year ended December 31, 2018 was an unfavorable adjustment of $5.5 million related primarily to certain deferred tax assets and liabilities.

The Tax Act included a provision for Global Intangible

Low-Taxed

Income (GILTI). The Company elected an accounting policy
to treat GILTI as a period cost when incurred. The GILTI provision is effective for taxable years of foreign corporations beginning after December 31, 2017.

The amount of UTBs that, if recognized as of December 31, 2018, would affect the Company’s effective tax rate was
$64.3 million. It is reasonably possible that, within the next twelve months, total UTBs may decrease in the range of $1.4 million to $3.5 million primarily as a result of the conclusion of U.S. federal, state and foreign income tax
proceedings.

We classify interest and penalty accruals related to UTBs as income tax expense. In 2018, we recognized an interest and penalty expense of
approximately $2.2 million. In 2017, we recognized an interest and penalty expense of approximately $2.0 million. In 2016, we recognized an interest and penalty expense of approximately $1.1 million. At December 31, 2018 and
2017, we had accruals for the payment of interest and penalties of $14.4 million and $11.8 million, respectively.

We file income tax returns
in the U.S., various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is open and subject to examination for tax years 2016 and subsequent by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). In addition to the U.S., we have tax years that remain
open and subject to examination by tax authorities in the following major taxing jurisdictions: Canada for years after 2013, Mexico for years after 2012 and China for years after 2014.

As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had deferred tax assets relating to net operating losses, capital losses, and
other tax carryforwards of $21.2 million and $25.6 million, respectively, of which approximately $7.1 million will expire between 2019 and 2023, and the remainder of which will expire in 2024 and thereafter.

The Company has provided a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of certain of these deferred tax assets, as management has concluded that, based on the
available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be fully realized.

Under the Tax Act, the accumulated
foreign earnings and profits of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 are subject to a deemed repatriation tax and should not be subject to additional



U.S. federal income tax upon an actual repatriation of those earnings. As a result, the Company has recorded an estimated tax liability of $9.3 million for foreign and state taxes that would
be payable on a distribution of those earnings and profits.

We have not provided for deferred taxes on the remaining book over tax outside basis
differences of our foreign subsidiaries. The outside basis differences of foreign subsidiaries considered indefinitely reinvested totaled approximately $128.1million at December 31, 2018. The associated deferred tax liability on this basis
difference is less than $5 million.

In the year ended December 31, 2018, the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges recognized in
other items, net, was $3.8 million and insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.

During 2017, we recorded an impairment
charge of $7.0 million pertaining to a cost method investment in a development stage home products company due to an other-than-temporary decline in its fair value. As a result of the impairment, the carrying value of the investment was reduced
to zero and the Company is not subject to further impairment or funding obligations with regard to this investment.

23.    Contingencies

Litigation

The Company is a defendant in lawsuits that are ordinary routine litigation matters incidental to its businesses. It is not possible to predict the
outcome of the pending actions, and, as with any litigation, it is



possible that these actions could be decided unfavorably to the Company. The Company believes that there are meritorious defenses to these actions and that these actions will not have a material
adverse effect upon the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, and, where appropriate, these actions are being vigorously contested. Accordingly the Company believes the likelihood of material loss is remote.

Environmental

Compliance with federal, state
and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, did not have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of Fortune Brands.
Several of our subsidiaries have been designated as potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”) under “Superfund” or similar state laws. As of December 31, 2018, ten such instances have not been dismissed, settled or
otherwise resolved. In 2018, none of our subsidiaries were identified as a PRP in a new instance and no instances were settled, dismissed or otherwise resolved. In most instances where our subsidiaries are named as a PRP, we enter into
cost-sharing arrangements with other PRPs. We give notice to insurance carriers of potential PRP liability, but very rarely, if ever, receive reimbursement from insurance for PRP costs. We believe that the cost of complying with the present
environmental protection laws, before considering estimated recoveries either from other PRPs or insurance, will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. At December 31, 2018 and 2017,
we had accruals of $0.6 million and $0.7 million, respectively, relating to environmental compliance and cleanup including, but not limited to, the above mentioned Superfund sites.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the

Board of Directors and Shareholders of Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017,

and the related consolidated statements of
income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows

for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2018 appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2018 based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018

in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in
all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Company’s
management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.
federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in
accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or
fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated

financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated

financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such
procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that
a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As described in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting, management has excluded Fiber Composites LLC (“Fiberon”) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting



as of December 31, 2018 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2018. We have also excluded Fiberon from our audit of internal control over financial
reporting. Fiberon is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent 2% and 0.7%, respectively, of the related
consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Definition and Limitations of Internal
Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

(a)

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

The Company’s management has evaluated, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and 15d-15(e)

under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that
evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2018.

(b)

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f).

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control

— Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the



Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on our evaluation under the framework in

Internal Control

— Integrated
Framework

(2013) issued by the COSO, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2018. The Company acquired Fiber Composites LLC (“Fiberon”) in September
2018 and therefore, as permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, we excluded Fiberon from the scope of our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018.
The total assets and total revenues of Fiberon represent 2.0% and 0.7%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statements amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Company’s independent public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, as stated in their report which appears herein.

(c)

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

There have not been any changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company’s fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2018 that have materially affected, or
are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
