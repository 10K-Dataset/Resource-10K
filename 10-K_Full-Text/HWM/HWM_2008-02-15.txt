PART I

Item 1.    Business.

Description of the Business

Information describing Alcoa’s businesses can be found in the Annual Report at the indicated pages:

*

Excluding captions, charts, diagrams and related notes.

Overview

Alcoa is the world leader in the production and management of primary aluminum, fabricated aluminum, and alumina combined, through its active and
growing participation in all major aspects of the industry: technology, mining, refining, smelting, fabricating, and recycling. Aluminum is a commodity that is traded on the London Metal Exchange (LME) and priced daily based on market supply and
demand. Aluminum and alumina represent approximately three-fourths of Alcoa’s revenues, and the price of aluminum influences the operating results of Alcoa. Nonaluminum



products include precision castings, industrial fasteners, consumer products, food service and flexible packaging products, plastic closures, and electrical
distribution systems for cars and trucks. Alcoa’s products are used worldwide in aircraft, automobiles, commercial transportation, packaging, consumer products, building and construction, and industrial applications.

Alcoa is a global company operating in 44 countries. Based upon the country where the point of sale occurred, North America and Europe generated 57% and 25%,
respectively, of Alcoa’s sales. In addition, Alcoa has investments and activities in Australia, Brazil, China, Iceland, Jamaica, Guinea, and Russia, all of which present opportunities for substantial growth. Governmental policies and other
economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, affect the results of operations in these countries.

Alcoa’s operations consist of six worldwide segments: Alumina, Primary Metals, Flat-Rolled Products, Extruded and End Products, Engineered Solutions, and Packaging and Consumer.

The Alumina segment primarily consists of a series of affiliated operating entities referred to as Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals (AWAC). Alcoa owns 60% and Alumina
Limited owns 40% of these individual entities. For more information on AWAC, see Exhibit Nos. 10 (a) through 10(f)(1) to this report.

Recent
Developments

In October 2007, Alcoa announced that it had reviewed strategic alternatives related to its Electrical and Electronic Solutions
business (formerly the Alcoa Fujikura Limited wire harness business) and approved a targeted restructuring plan to improve future returns and profitability.

In November 2007, Alcoa completed the sale of its automotive castings business to Compass Automotive Group, LLC, a portfolio company of Monomoy Capital Partners, L.P. The Alcoa business had 2006 revenues of approximately $150 million and
employed approximately 530 employees in two operating locations: Fruitport, MI and Farsund, Norway. Alcoa will continue to operate its other automotive businesses globally, including its facility in Soest, Germany.

In December 2007, Alcoa agreed to sell its packaging and consumer businesses to New Zealand’s Rank Group Limited for $2.7 billion in cash. The transaction is
expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter 2008. Alcoa’s packaging and consumer businesses include Closure Systems International, Consumer Products, Flexible Packaging and Reynolds Food Packaging. These businesses generated
approximately $3.3 billion in revenues in 2007 and employed approximately 9,300 employees in 22 countries around the world. Alcoa will continue to operate its flat-rolled can sheet products business serving the packaging market.

On February 1, 2008, Alcoa announced that the company joined with the Aluminum Corporation of China to acquire 12% of the U.K. common stock of Rio Tinto plc (RTP) for
approximately $14 billion. Of this amount, Alcoa contributed $1.2 billion on February 6, 2008. The investment was made through a special purpose vehicle called Shining Prospect Pte. Ltd. (SPPL), which is a private limited liability company, created
for the purpose of acquiring the RTP shares. The RTP shares were purchased on the open market through an investment broker.

Bauxite Interests

Aluminum is one of the most plentiful elements in the earth’s crust. Aluminum is produced primarily from bauxite, an ore containing aluminum
in the form of aluminum oxide, commonly referred to as alumina. Aluminum is made by extracting alumina from bauxite and then removing oxygen from the alumina. Alcoa processes most of the bauxite that it mines into alumina. The company obtains
bauxite from resources held by AWAC, from the company’s interests in the countries listed in the chart below, and under both long-term and short-term contracts and mining leases. In 2007, Alcoa consumed 34.8 million metric tons (mt) of
bauxite from its own resources, 5.9 million mt from related third



parties and 3.5 million mt from unrelated third parties. Alcoa’s present sources of bauxite are sufficient to meet the forecasted requirements of
its alumina refining operations for the foreseeable future. The following table provides information regarding the company’s bauxite interests:

Alcoa Active Bauxite Interests



Alcoa also has interests at the following locations that are bauxite resources or
do not currently produce bauxite: Cape Bougainville and Mitchell Plateau in Australia and Juruti in Brazil (currently scheduled for completion in late 2008 and expected to initially produce 2.6 million mt per year (mtpy)) as well as Brownsberg,
Coermotibo DS, Lely Mountains, and Nassau, all in eastern Suriname.


AofA is part of the AWAC group of companies and is owned 60% by Alcoa and 40% by
Alumina Limited.


Brazilian mineral legislation does not establish the duration of mining
concessions. The concession remains in force until the complete exhaustion of the deposit. The company estimates that (i) the concessions at Poços de Caldas will last at least until 2020 and (ii) the concessions at Trombetas will
last until 2046. Depending, however, on actual and future needs, the rate at which the deposits are explored and government approval, the concessions may be extended to (or expire at) a later (or an earlier) date.


Aluminio holds an 8.6% interest, Abalco S.A. (Abalco) holds a 4.6% interest and
Alcoa World Alumina LLC (AWA LLC) holds a 5% interest in MRN. Abalco and AWA LLC are both part of the AWAC group of companies and are owned 60% by Alcoa and 40% by Alumina Limited. MRN is jointly owned with affiliates of Rio Tinto Alcan Inc.
(formerly Alcan Inc.), Companhia Brasileira de Aluminio, Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, BHP Billiton Plc (BHP Billiton) and Norsk Hydro. Aluminio, Abalco, and AWA LLC purchase bauxite from MRN under long-term supply contracts.


AWA LLC owns a 45% interest in Halco (Mining), Inc. Halco owns 100% of Boké
Investment Company, a Delaware company, which owns 51% of CBG. The Guinean Government owns 49% of CBG, which has the exclusive right through 2038 to develop and mine bauxite in certain areas within a 10,000 square-mile perimeter in northwestern
Guinea.


AWA LLC has a bauxite purchase contract with CBG that will provide Alcoa with
bauxite through 2011.


This entity is part of the AWAC group of companies and is owned 60% by Alcoa and
40% by Alumina Limited.


Clarendon Alumina Production Ltd. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Government
of Jamaica.


In addition to the other named Suriname interests, Lelydorp was an active site
until the mine was exhausted and closed in February 2007. While mining rights at Caramacca extend until 2012 and rights at the remaining Suriname locations extend until 2033, it is likely that all Suriname bauxite resources will also be exhausted
within the next several years. Alcoa is evaluating alternate sources of bauxite including resources located in western Suriname.



Alumina Refining Facilities and Capacity

Alcoa is the world’s leading producer of alumina. Alcoa’s alumina refining facilities and its worldwide alumina capacity are shown in the following table:

Alcoa Worldwide Alumina Refining Capacity


Nameplate capacity is an estimate based on design capacity and normal operating efficiencies and does not necessarily
represent maximum possible production.


The figures in this column reflect Alcoa’s share of production from these facilities. For facilities owned by AWAC
entities, Alcoa takes 100% of the production.


This entity is part of the AWAC group of companies and is owned 60% by Alcoa and 40% by Alumina Limited.


In 2004, Alcoa received the Western Australian Government’s environmental approval for its previously announced
Pinjarra alumina refinery efficiency upgrade, which increased production at the facility by 657,000 mtpy. Full production was achieved in the fourth quarter of 2006. Ramp up to full production at the Pinjarra refinery was impacted in December 2006
and 2007 due to a power failure at the refinery and de-bottlenecking requirements related to the upgrade.


The named company or an affiliate holds this interest.


In August 2007, production at the Clarendon refinery was temporarily curtailed as part of safety precautionary measures
in advance of Hurricane Dean. The bauxite mine and refinery suffered little damage from the storm, but the refinery was temporarily shut down due to loss of power. The Rocky Point port from which Jamalco ships alumina sustained substantial damage
and required significant repairs, as well as temporary logistical support for shipping alumina while repair work was completed. Repair work included preparing storage for alumina which resulted in limiting production from the facility to 50 percent
of capacity. Alcoa declared force majeure to its customers. The refinery has restarted and is expected to achieve pre-shutdown production levels in the 2008 first quarter. The port has been temporarily repaired and shipments are currently being made
from that facility. Permanent repairs to the port are expected to be completed during 2008.


Production at Point Comfort was temporarily affected during the first quarter 2007 due to a general labor disturbance in
Guinea that closed the port from which the Guinea Boké mine supplies this facility with bauxite.

In January 2005, Alcoa and the
Government of the Republic of Ghana announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), under which the parties would evaluate the possible development of an integrated aluminum industry in Ghana, including bauxite mining, alumina
refining, aluminum production, and rail transportation infrastructure upgrades. The parties are no longer pursuing the contemplated projects.



In September 2005, Alcoa announced that its Board of Directors approved plans to make further investments in the
company’s Brazilian “upstream” operations. Investments include (i) a 2.1 million mtpy expansion of the Alumar consortium alumina refinery in São Luís, state of Maranhão (expected to increase the
refinery’s current capacity to approximately 3.5 million mtpy in 2009, with Alcoa’s share of the total facility output more than doubling to 1.89 million mtpy based on its 54% ownership stake through Aluminio and AWAC) and
(ii) the modernization of the Poços de Caldas aluminum smelter, in the state of Minas Gerais.

In November 2005, Alcoa World Alumina LLC (AWA
LLC) and Rio Tinto Alcan Inc. announced the signing of a Basic Agreement with the Government of Guinea that sets forth the framework for development of a 1.5 million mtpy alumina refinery in Guinea. The Basic Agreement was approved by the Guinean
National Assembly in May of 2006 and was promulgated into law by decree of the President of Guinea in July of 2006.

In April 2006, AWAC signed an MOU with
Vietnam National Coal-Minerals Industries Group (Vinacomin) under which the parties will explore the feasibility of creating a joint venture to develop a bauxite mine and alumina refinery in the Dak Nong province of Vietnam. The cooperation between
AWAC and Vinacomin is subject to approval by the Government of Vietnam. The Government of Vietnam issued a Master Plan for the aluminum industry in November 2007. The investment model stipulated in the Master Plan is a Joint Stock Company. If
established, the venture would be 51% owned by Vinacomin, with the ownership share of AWAC to be agreed.

In September 2006, Alcoa received environmental
approval from the Government of Western Australia for expansion of the Wagerup alumina refinery to a maximum capacity of 4.7 million mtpy, a potential increase of over 2 million mtpy. This approval includes a variety of environmental
conditions that must be satisfied before Alcoa can seek construction approval for the project. The environmental approval paves the way for Alcoa to proceed to the next stage of project design, the feasibility study. The pre-feasibility phase of the
project has been extended into 2008.

In 2007, Jamalco completed the Early Works Program at its Clarendon, Jamaica refinery, which added 146,000 mtpy of
production, increasing the total capacity to 1.421 million mtpy. As a result of the Early Works Program, AWAC’s ownership in Jamalco has increased to approximately 55%, with the Government of Jamaica owning approximately 45%.

The 1.5 million mtpy planned expansion of Jamalco’s Clarendon, Jamaica refinery is subject to supply of natural gas by the Government of Jamaica and acceptable
market conditions. As of December 31, 2007, AWAC has capitalized approximately $84 million of engineering costs related to this project (Alcoa’s share of these costs is approximately $50 million).



Primary Aluminum Facilities and Capacity

The company’s primary aluminum smelters and their respective capacities are shown in the following table:

Alcoa
Worldwide Smelting Capacity


Nameplate capacity is an estimate based on design capacity and normal operating efficiencies and does not necessarily
represent maximum possible production.


The figures in this column reflect Alcoa’s share of production from these facilities.


Figures include the minority interest of Alumina Limited in facilities owned by AofA. From these facilities, Alcoa takes
100% of the production allocated to AofA.


In March 2006, Aluminio completed a 30% expansion of the capacity of its share of the São Luís (Alumar)
aluminum smelter, increasing Aluminio’s share of smelting capacity there by 62,000 mtpy and Aluminio’s share of smelter output from 53.66% to 60%.




Owned through Rio Tinto Alcan Inc. subsidiary Pechiney Reynolds Quebec, Inc.


In April 2007, Alcoa began production at its new Fjarðaál aluminum smelter in east Iceland. Full
production is expected to be achieved in the 2008 first quarter.


The Warrick facility currently has one idled potline.


At the end of 2005, all production was temporarily curtailed at the Eastalco smelter located in Frederick, Maryland. In
July 2006, Alcoa acquired the minority interest in this smelter from Mitsui & Co. Ltd. resulting in Alcoa owning 100% of the facility.


The Badin, North Carolina facility has been idled since August 2002. In addition, one of the two idled potlines was
fully decommissioned in 2007 and will not be returned to service. The decommissioning has reduced Nameplate and Alcoa Consolidated Capacities by 60,000 mtpy.


A power line failed during a severe storm at Tennessee Operations in April 2007. Although full power was
quickly restored, one of the two potlines, representing approximately 107,000 mpty, remained idle until late May 2007. Production on the line increased throughout 2007 and is expected to be fully restored by the end of the first quarter of

.


In May 2007, one potline was temporarily idled at Rockdale, Texas. The restart of the line was completed during the
fourth quarter of 2007.


In July 2006, Alcoa acquired the minority interest in the Intalco smelter from Mitsui & Co. Ltd. resulting in
Alcoa owning 100% of the facility. Intalco had been operating at one-third of its capacity but re-energized a second of its three potlines in February 2007, increasing annual production to approximately 190,000 mtpy.


Wenatchee is operating at approximately one-half of its capacity.

Alcoa currently has 452,000 mtpy of idle capacity against total Alcoa Consolidated Capacity of 4,573,000 mtpy.

In February 2006, Alcoa signed an Agreement in Principle with the Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago to build a 341,000 mtpy aluminum smelter in the
Cap-de-Ville area in southwestern Trinidad. This agreement followed the signing of an MOU in May 2004 for participation by Alcoa in the development of an aluminum industry in Trinidad and Tobago. In December 2006, the Government advised Alcoa of its
intention to relocate the smelter. Although the parties had expected to resume negotiations in 2007, they have not done so.

Alcoa and the Government of
Iceland have begun detailed feasibility studies for the development of a 250,000 mtpy aluminum smelter at Bakki near Húsavík in north Iceland. Additionally, separate MOU agreements between Alcoa and Landvirkjun and Alcoa and Landsnet
covering development of power generation and transmission for this smelter project were signed in May 2006. If the feasibility studies prove the viability of the proposed smelter, it is expected that ground would not be broken before 2010.

In May 2007, Alcoa and Greenland Home Rule Cabinet entered into an MOU regarding cooperation on a feasibility study for an aluminum smelter with a 340,000
mtpy capacity in Greenland. The MOU also encompasses a hydroelectric power system and related infrastructure improvements, including a port. Under the MOU, the parties will begin site selection, environmental studies, engineering assessments, and
other aspects of the project. If the viability of the project is proved, ground breaking for the hydroelectric power system would be expected in 2010 and for the smelter in 2012.

In September 2007, Alcoa opened a new 280,000 mtpy anode plant in Mosjøen, Norway. The facility, built together with Elkem Aluminium ANS which has a 36% share in the plant, will produce anodes for Alcoa’s
Fjarðaál, Iceland and Elkem Aluminium ANS’ Mosjøen, Norway smelters. Anodes were delivered to both smelters during the third quarter of 2007. Elkem Aluminium ANS is a partnership owned 50% by Alcoa and 50% by Orkla ASA,
through Orkla’s subsidiary Elkem AS, as further described in the “Joint Ventures and Investments” section below.

In January 2008, Alcoa and
the Brunei Economic Development Board signed an MOU to enable more detailed studies into the feasibility of establishing a modern, gas-powered aluminum smelter in Brunei Darussalam. The MOU extends a memorandum signed originally in 2003. Phase one
of the feasibility study will determine scope and dimensions of the proposed facility, power-delivery strategy, location, as well as an associated port and infrastructure. At completion of phase one, the parties will determine whether a more
detailed phase two study is warranted. If completed, it is expected that the smelter would have an initial operating capacity of 360,000 mtpy with the potential for future increase.



Alcoa owns interests in the following primary aluminum facilities that are accounted for on the equity or cost basis
method. The capacity associated with these facilities is not included in Alcoa’s consolidated capacity.


Nameplate capacity is an estimate based on design capacity and normal operating efficiencies and does not necessarily
represent maximum possible production.


In 2003, the smelter at the Tema facility was idled due to shortage of available power. As of year-end 2005, two
potlines had been restarted. Throughout 2006, however, the smelter operated at approximately 38% capacity due to limited power availability resulting from low water levels at Lake Volta. In April 2007, the facility was fully idled again. Ghana
continues to be subject to power limitations and future production of the smelter will be subject to energy availability.

Energy

Alcoa produces aluminum from alumina by an electrolytic process requiring large amounts of electric power. Electric power accounts for
approximately 30% of the company’s primary aluminum costs. Alcoa generates approximately 24% of the power used at its smelters worldwide and generally purchases the remainder under long-term arrangements. The paragraphs below summarize the
sources of power and the long-term power arrangements for Alcoa’s smelters.

North America – Electricity

The company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Alcoa Power Generating Inc. (APGI), generates approximately 25% of the power requirements for Alcoa’s North American
smelters. The company generally purchases the remainder under long-term contracts. APGI owns and operates two hydroelectric projects, Tapoco and Yadkin, consisting of eight dams under Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) licenses. APGI
hydroelectric facilities provide electric power for the aluminum smelters at Alcoa, Tennessee and Badin, North Carolina. The Tennessee smelter also purchases power from the Tennessee Valley Authority under a contract that extends to 2010.

APGI received a renewed 40-year FERC license for the Tapoco project in 2005. The relicensing process is well underway for the Yadkin hydroelectric project
license that is up for renewal in 2008. In May 2007, APGI filed with FERC a Relicensing Settlement Agreement with the majority of the interested stakeholders that broadly resolved open issues. The National Environmental Policy Act process is
underway, with a draft environmental impact statement having been issued in September 2007. This process is expected to be completed during 2008, with a new project license issued shortly thereafter. With the Badin smelter idled, power generated
from APGI’s Yadkin system is largely being sold to an affiliate, Alcoa Power Marketing LLC, and then sold into the wholesale market.

In the Pacific
Northwest, Alcoa has a contract with Chelan County Public Utility District (Chelan PUD) located in the State of Washington that is sufficient to supply about half of the capacity of the Wenatchee smelter through October 2011. In December 2007, the
Chelan PUD Commissioners approved the terms of an agreement under which Alcoa and Chelan PUD would enter into a new contract beginning in November 2011 and running through October 2028 under which Alcoa would receive approximately 25% of the
hydropower output of Chelan PUD’s Rocky Reach and Rock Island dams. Definitive agreements are expected to be finalized in the course of the year. In addition, Alcoa has a



contract through September 2011 with the Bonneville Power Administration under which Alcoa is receiving financial benefits to reduce the cost of power
purchased from the market to partially operate the Intalco smelter.

The company, through APGI, generates substantially all of the power used at its
Warrick smelter using nearby coal reserves. In May 2005, Alcoa acquired mining rights to the nearby Friendsville, Illinois coal reserves and subsequently hired Vigo Coal Company, Inc to manage and operate the mine. The mine is producing
approximately one million tons of coal per year, 45% of the Warrick power plant’s requirements. The balance of the coal used is purchased principally from local Illinois basin coal producers pursuant to term contracts of varying duration. In
April 2001, under the terms of an operating agreement, the company assumed from Vectren (formerly Southern Indiana Gas & Electric Company) operation of the power plant that supplies the Warrick smelter. In July 2005, Alcoa announced its plans to
invest approximately $525 million at the Warrick power plant to improve environmental performance and operational efficiency, as well as to lower costs. This project is well underway.

Power for the Rockdale smelter was historically generated by company-owned generating units and TXU Generation Company LP (TXU)-owned generating units, both of which used lignite supplied by the company’s Sandow
Mine. Upon completion of lignite mining in the Sandow Mine in 2005, lignite supply transitioned to the company-owned Three Oaks Mine. The company retired its three wholly-owned generating units in late 2006, and transitioned to an arrangement under
which TXU supplies all of the Rockdale smelter’s electricity requirements under a long-term power contract that does not expire until at least the end of 2038, with the parties having the right to terminate the contract after 2013 if there has
been an unfavorable change in law or after 2025 if the cost of the electricity exceeds the market price. In August 2007, TXU and Alcoa closed on the definitive agreements under which TXU will construct, own and operate a new circulating fluidized
bed power plant adjacent to the existing Sandow Unit Four Power Plant, and in September 2007, on the sale of the Three Oaks Mine to TXU.

In the northeast,
the purchased power contracts for both the Massena East and Massena West smelters in New York expire not earlier than June 30, 2013, following their extension in 2003 for 10 years upon New York Power Authority (NYPA) having relicensed its St.
Lawrence-FDR Hydro Project. In December 2007, Alcoa and NYPA reached agreement in principle on a new energy contract to supply the Massena East and Massena West smelters for 30 years, beginning on July 1, 2013. Work on a definitive agreement is
underway.

The Deschambault and Bécancour smelters in Quebec purchase electricity under long-term contracts with Hydro-Quebec that expire in 2014,
subject to extension provisions. The smelter located in Baie Comeau, Quebec purchases approximately 65% of its power needs under the Hydro-Quebec contract and receives the remainder from a 40%-owned hydroelectric generating company, Manicouagan
Power Company.

The Mt. Holly smelter in South Carolina purchases electricity from Santee Cooper under a contract that expires December 31, 2015,
subject to certain extension provisions.

At the end of 2005, all production was temporarily curtailed at the Eastalco smelter located in Frederick,
Maryland. The curtailment coincided with the expiration of the smelter’s power contract on December 31, 2005, as a competitively-priced replacement power supply could not be obtained. Alcoa continues efforts to find an alternative power
source for Eastalco.

Australia – Electricity

Power is generated from extensive brown coal deposits covered by a long-term mineral lease held by AofA, and that power currently provides approximately 40% of the electricity for the company’s smelter in Point
Henry, Victoria. The State Electricity Commission of Victoria provides the remaining power for this smelter and all power for the Portland smelter, under contracts with AofA that extend to 2014 and 2016, respectively.

Brazil – Electricity

The Alumar smelter is
supplied by Eletronorte (Centrais Elétricas do Norte do Brasil S.A.) through a long-term power purchase agreement expiring in June 2024. Eletronorte has supplied the Alumar smelter from the beginning of its operations in 1984.



Aluminio participates in a consortium that owns the Machadinho hydroelectric power plant in southern Brazil, which began
to generate power at full capacity in 2002. Aluminio receives its share of the plant’s output, which is sufficient to cover 55% of its operating needs at the Poços de Caldas smelter. In January 2007, Aluminio exercised pre-emptive rights
to acquire an additional ownership interest of 4.67% in Machadinho. This additional investment provides an additional 15 megawatts of assured energy. This transaction was approved by the Brazilian Energy Agency, antitrust regulators, and other third
parties. In September 2007, Aluminio’s ownership interest of 31.89% was reduced by 0.9% due to the admission of a new investor to the Machadinho consortium.

Aluminio also has a 42.18% interest in Energética Barra Grande S.A. – BAESA, which built the Barra Grande hydroelectric power plant in southern Brazil. Barra Grande began operating in November 2005, and reached full generating
capacity in 2006. Aluminio’s share of the project covers a substantial portion of its remaining needs at the Poços de Caldas smelter.

With
Machadinho and Barra Grande, Aluminio’s current power self-sufficiency is approximately 40%, to meet a total energy demand of approximately 690 megawatts from Brazilian primary plants.

Aluminio is also participating in a number of other Brazilian hydropower projects. Two of these projects have received the Environmental Installation License from the
Federal Government and started construction in 2007:

•

Estreito

, northern Brazil – Aluminio’s share is 25.49%

•

Serra do Facão

, in the southeast of Brazil – Aluminio’s share is 34.97%

Serra do Facão and Estreito generation of power is expected to begin in 2010.

A third project, Pai Querê in southern Brazil (Aluminio share is 35.00%), is still in the process of obtaining necessary environmental licenses.

If these projects are completed, the power will be used in Aluminio’s smelters or sold into the Brazilian grid.

In
December 2007, Aluminio concluded the sale of its 42% participation in ETAU, a Brazilian company that holds and operates an electric transmission line in southern Brazil.

Europe – Electricity

The company purchases electricity for its smelters at Portovesme and Fusina, Italy in the
recently deregulated market, under contracts expiring in December 2009 for both locations. A new law went into effect on May 14, 2005, that extends through December 2010 the special tariff conditions applicable to the Italian smelters. That
measure provides a competitive power supply to the primary aluminum industry and is not considered state aid by the Italian Government. However, in July 2006 the European Union (EU) opened an ongoing investigation into whether this provision should
be considered unlawful state aid, which may not be compatible with European legislation. It is Alcoa’s understanding that the Italian Government’s continuation of the electricity tariff was done in conformity with all applicable laws and
regulations. While Alcoa believes that any additional cost would only be assessed prospectively from the date of the decision of the EU Commission (EC) on this matter, it is possible that the EC could rule that the assessment must be retroactively
applied to January 2006. A decision by the EC is not expected until late in 2008. On November 29, 2006, Alcoa filed an appeal before the European Court of First Instance seeking the annulment of the decision of the EC to open the investigation
alleging that such decision did not follow the applicable procedural rules. This appeal, which may be withdrawn by Alcoa at any time, is expected to be resolved late in 2008, as well.

The company’s smelters at San Ciprián, La Coruña and Avilés, Spain purchase electricity from the power grid at the lowest applicable industrial tariff rate under regulations expiring in
January 2009. On January 25, 2007, the EC announced that it has opened an investigation to establish whether the regulated electricity tariffs granted by Spain comply with EU state aid rules. Alcoa has been operating in Spain for more than nine
years under a power supply



structure approved by the Spanish Government in 1986, an equivalent tariff having been granted in 1983. The investigation is limited to the year 2005 and it
is focused both on the energy-intensive consumers and the distribution companies. It is Alcoa’s understanding that the Spanish tariff system for electricity is in conformity with all applicable laws and regulations, and therefore no state aid
is present in that tariff system. A decision by the EC is not expected until late 2008. If the EC’s investigation concludes that the regulated electricity tariffs for industries are unlawful, Alcoa will have an opportunity to challenge the
decision in the EU courts.

Iceland – Electricity

As noted above, Alcoa’s new Fjarðaál smelter in eastern Iceland began operation in 2007. Central to those operations is a 40-year power contract under which Landsvirkjun, the Icelandic national power
company, built the Kárahnjúkar dam and power project, and supplies competitively priced electricity to the smelter. First power was supplied to the Fjarðaál smelter in April 2007, and with the completion of the
Kárahnjúkar project in late 2007, the smelter is now ramping up to full production, expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2008.

Minority Interests – Electricity

The smelters in Ghana, Norway and Venezuela, in which Alcoa has only an equity
stake and is not the operational manager, have made a variety of electricity purchase arrangements, through their respective managing or majority partners. Power for the smelter in Ghana is provided under an interim power rate agreement with the
Volta River Authority. The other contracts are up for renewal at various times, the majority of them in the period from 2011 to 2020.

Canada & U.S. – Natural Gas

In order to supply its refineries and smelters in the U.S. and Canada, the company generally
procures natural gas on a competitive bid basis from a variety of sources including producers in the gas production areas and independent gas marketers. For Alcoa’s larger consuming locations in Canada and the U.S., the gas commodity as well as
interstate pipeline transportation is procured to provide increased flexibility and reliability. Contract pricing for gas is typically based on a published industry index or New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) price. The company may choose to
reduce its exposure to NYMEX pricing by hedging a portion of required natural gas consumption.

Australia – Natural Gas

AofA holds a 20% equity interest in a consortium that bought the Dampier-to-Bunbury natural gas pipeline in October 2004. This pipeline transports gas
from the northwest gas fields to Alcoa’s alumina refineries and other users in the Southwest of Western Australia. AofA uses gas to co-generate steam and electricity for its alumina refining processes at the Kwinana, Pinjarra and Wagerup
refineries.



Sources and Availability of Raw Materials

The major purchased raw materials in 2007 for each of the company’s segments are listed below.

Other materials generally are purchased from third party suppliers under competitively-priced supply contracts or
bidding arrangements. The company believes that the raw materials necessary to its business are and will continue to be available.

Joint Ventures
and Investments

The company’s principal alliances and joint ventures are included in its “upstream” operating segments (alumina
and primary metals) as shown in the tables above relating to those segments.



Alcoa’s other significant joint ventures and investments are as follows:

Alcoa Bohai Aluminum Industries Company Limited.

In October 2005, Alcoa inaugurated a restructured joint venture with China International Trust & Investment
(CITIC), its equity partner, to produce aluminum rolled products in Qinghuangdao, China. Alcoa is the managing partner in the new venture, holding a 73% stake, with CITIC holding a 27% stake. The joint venture operates existing aluminum cold rolling
and foil facilities and is undertaking a major expansion, which includes a hot rolling mill and related equipment. The expansion is expected to start at 40,000 tons in 2008 and reach full capacity of 150,000 tons in 2010.

Alcoa Kunshan Aluminum Products Company Ltd.

In September 2006, Alcoa completed the acquisition of its 70% interest in the aluminum brazing sheet venture in
Kunshan City, China. Alcoa is the managing partner in the venture, with the remaining 30% shares held by Shanxi Yuncheng Engraving Group. Kunshan Aluminum is designed to produce 50,000 mtpy of aluminum brazing sheet primarily for the Asian
automotive market. It is the third flat-rolled products facility managed by Alcoa in China including those owned and operated by Alcoa Bohai Aluminum Industries Company Limited and Alcoa (Shanghai) Aluminum Products Limited.

Elkem Aluminium ANS.

This Norwegian partnership is owned 50% by Alcoa and 50% by Elkem AS, one of Norway’s largest industrial companies and a leading
supplier of metals and materials, with Elkem as managing partner. The partnership is the second largest aluminum producer in Norway and operates two smelters: Mosjøen and Lista. These facilities supply extrusion billets, rolling ingots and
foundry ingots to leading rolling mills, extrusion plants and foundries in Europe.

In 2007, Alcoa formed or sold the following joint ventures and
investments:

Aluminum Corporation of China Limited (Chalco).

In November 2001, Alcoa entered into a strategic alliance with Chalco and its parent
company, Aluminum Corporation of China (Chinalco). Under this alliance, in 2001 Alcoa became a strategic investor in Chalco’s global offering and listing on the New York Stock Exchange and The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. Chinalco is the
largest shareholder in Chalco and Alcoa was the largest holder of the shares of Chalco listed on stock exchanges outside China. In September 2007, Alcoa disposed of its interest in Chalco through a placement of the shares.

Orkla ASA (Orkla) and SAPA AB (Sapa).

In 2006, Alcoa and Orkla signed a letter of intent to create a joint venture with Orkla’s subsidiary Sapa, to be
majority owned and operated by Sapa, to combine Alcoa’s soft alloy extrusion business with Sapa’s extruded aluminum business. Alcoa’s soft alloy extrusion business then operated 22 facilities in eight countries; Sapa’s profiles
business consisted of 18 facilities in 12 countries. This transaction was completed in the second quarter of 2007. Alcoa will continue to own and operate its hard alloy extrusion business which serves the aerospace, automotive, and selected other
markets.

Patents, Trade Secrets and Trademarks

The company believes that its domestic and international patent, trade secret and trademark assets provide it with a significant competitive advantage. The company’s rights under its patents, as well as the products made and sold under
them, are important to the company as a whole and, to varying degrees, important to each business segment. The patents owned by Alcoa generally concern particular products or manufacturing equipment or techniques. Alcoa’s business as a whole is
not, however, materially dependent on any single patent, trade secret or trademark.

The company has a number of trade secrets, mostly regarding
manufacturing processes and material compositions that give many of its businesses important advantages in their markets. The company continues to strive to improve those processes and generate new material compositions that provide additional
benefits.

The company also has a number of domestic and international registered trademarks that have significant recognition at the consumer level, and
others that have significant recognition within the markets that are served. Examples include



Alcoa and the Alcoa Symbol for aluminum products, Howmet metal castings, Huck

®

fasteners, Kawneer
building panels and Dura-Bright

®

surface treatments. Presto

®

storage bags, Cut-Rite

®

wax paper, Baco

®

household wraps, Reynolds

®

plastic wrap and Reynolds Wrap

®

aluminum foil are expected to be assigned to Rank Group Limited upon completion of its purchase of Alcoa’s packaging and consumer business. The company’s rights under its trademarks
are important to the company as a whole and, to varying degrees, important to each business segment.

Competitive Conditions

Alcoa is subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of its aluminum and nonaluminum businesses. Competitors include a variety of both U.S. and non-U.S.
companies in all major markets. Price, quality and service are the principal competitive factors in Alcoa’s markets. Where aluminum products compete with other materials – such as steel and plastics for automotive and building
applications; magnesium, titanium, composites and plastics for aerospace and defense applications; steel, plastics and glass for packaging applications – aluminum’s diverse characteristics, particularly its light weight, recyclability and
flexibility, are also significant factors. For Alcoa’s segments that market products under Alcoa’s brand names, brand recognition and brand loyalty also play a role.

Research and Development

Alcoa, a technology leader in the aluminum industry, engages in research and
development programs that include process and product development, and basic and applied research. Expenditures for R&D activities were $249 million in 2007, $213 million in 2006 and $192 million in 2005.

Most of the major process areas within the company have a Technology Management Review Board (TMRB) consisting of members from various worldwide locations. Each TMRB is
responsible for formulating and communicating a technology strategy for the corresponding process area, developing and managing the technology portfolio and ensuring the global transfer of technology. Certain business units alternatively conduct
these activities and research and development programs within the worldwide business unit, supported by the Alcoa Technical Center. Technical personnel from the TMRBs, the Technical Center and such business units also participate in the
corresponding Market Sector Lead Teams. In this manner, research and development activities are aligned with corporate and business unit goals.

During
2007, the company continued work on new developments for a number of strategic projects in all business segments. In Primary Metals, progress was made on inert anode technology. Progress has been successful in many respects as a result of full pot
testing of anode assemblies, although there remain technical and cost targets to achieve. Technical targets include optimization of pot operating conditions and maintenance of metal purity. If the technology proves to be commercially feasible, the
company believes that it would be able to convert its existing potlines to this new technology, resulting in significant operating cost savings. The new technology would also generate environmental benefits by reducing and eliminating certain
emissions, especially carbon dioxide. No timetable has been established for commercial use. Progress was also made on carbothermic projects, which if commercially feasible may reduce capital and energy costs, as well as provide environmental
benefits related to waste reduction.

In the semi-fabrication businesses, new alloys including Aluminum-Lithium (Al Li) and a very high strength alloy were
developed and applied to aerospace products. The combined Al Li alloy development and application was awarded the global R&D 100 award, given annually by R&D magazine to the world’s 100 most significant innovations, for its enabling
ability to significantly reduce aircraft weight. In the manufacturing arena, the “simultaneous multi-alloy casting” process was developed with plans to commercialize it in 2008. The company has also moved from the research and development
stage to “pilot scale” on its continuous cast-rolled products process. In addition, a number of low grade scrap use technologies were developed and implemented providing both cost and environmental benefits.

A number of products were commercialized in 2007 such as those included in the “Dura Bright

®

wheels with XBR™ Technology” brand and “Reynobond

®

brand products co-branded with Kevlar

®

-” brand products, unique surface sheet



for the consumer electronics market, lightweight armor applications for the defense market and high performance products for the oil and gas markets. For the
aerospace market, new multi-material technologies have been developed to compete effectively with composites.

The company currently has at least 60 new
products in various development stages. As a result of product development and technological advancement, the company continues to pursue patent protection in jurisdictions throughout the world.

Environmental Matters

Information relating to environmental
matters is included in three areas of the Annual Report: under Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, under the heading “Environmental Matters” on pages 35 and 36, in Note A to the
financial statements under the caption “Environmental Expenditures” on pages 50 through 54, and in Note Y to the financial statements beginning on page 77.

Employees

Total worldwide employment at year-end 2007 was 107,000 employees in 44 countries. About 60,000
of these employees are represented by labor unions. The company believes that relations with its employees and any applicable union representatives generally are good.

In the United States, 14,000 employees are represented by various labor unions. The master collective bargaining agreement between Alcoa and the United Steelworkers covering 14 locations and approximately 9,000 United
States employees is scheduled to expire on May 31, 2010. There are 43 other collective bargaining agreements in the United States with varying expiration dates. Various collective bargaining agreements with varying expiration dates cover about
23,000 employees in Europe, 9,000 employees in Mexico, 7,000 employees in South America, 4,000 employees in Australia and 3,000 employees in Canada.

Cautionary Statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995

Forward-Looking Statements

This report and the portions of the Annual Report incorporated by reference herein contain (and oral communications made by Alcoa may contain) statements that relate to
future events and expectations and, as such, constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include those containing such words as “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,”
“hopes,” “targets,” “should,” “will,” “will likely result,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “projects” or other words of similar meaning. All statements that address Alcoa’s
expectations or projections about the future, including statements about Alcoa’s strategy for growth, cost reduction goals, expenditures and financial results, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on Alcoa’s
estimates, assumptions and expectations of future events and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements of Alcoa to be different from those expressed or implied in the
forward-looking statements. Therefore, Alcoa cannot guarantee that these estimates, assumptions and expectations are accurate or will be realized. Alcoa disclaims any intention or obligation (other than as required by law) to update or revise any
forward-looking statements.

Item 1A.  Risk Factors.

In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report and in Management’s
Discussion and Analysis in the Annual Report, the following are some of the important factors that could cause Alcoa’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements:



Alcoa is subject to cyclical fluctuations in LME prices, economic conditions generally, and aluminum end-use markets.

The aluminum industry is highly cyclical, with prices subject to worldwide market forces of supply and demand and other influences. Prices can be
volatile. Alcoa uses contractual arrangements with customers, as well as forward, futures and options contracts, to manage its exposure to the volatility of LME-based prices as market conditions warrant from time to time, and is product and segment
diversified. However, Alcoa’s results of operations could be affected by material adverse changes in economic or aluminum industry conditions generally or in the markets served by Alcoa, including the transportation, building and construction,
distribution, packaging, industrial gas turbine and other markets.

Alcoa’s operations consume substantial amounts of energy; profitability may
decline if energy costs rise or if energy supplies are interrupted.

Alcoa consumes substantial amounts of energy in its operations. Although Alcoa
generally expects to meet the energy requirements for its alumina refineries and primary aluminum smelters from internal sources or from long-term contracts, the following could affect Alcoa’s results of operations:

•

significant increases in electricity costs rendering smelter operations uneconomic;

•

significant increases in natural gas prices;

•

unavailability of electrical power or other energy sources due to droughts, hurricanes or other natural causes;

•

unavailability of energy due to energy shortages resulting in insufficient supplies to serve consumers;

•

interruptions in energy supply due to equipment failure or other causes; or

•

curtailment of one or more refineries or smelters due to inability to extend energy contracts upon expiration or negotiate new arrangements on cost-effective terms.

Alcoa’s profitability could be adversely affected by increases in the cost of raw materials.

Alcoa’s results of operations will be affected by increases in the cost of raw materials, including caustic soda, calcined petroleum coke and resins, and freight
costs associated with transporting raw materials to refining and smelting locations, in addition to energy. Alcoa may not be able to offset fully the effects of higher raw material costs or energy costs through price increases, productivity
improvements or cost reduction programs.

Union disputes and other employee relations issues could adversely affect Alcoa’s financial results.

Some of Alcoa’s employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying
durations and expiration dates. Alcoa may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the United States and other countries when they expire. In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a
strike or work stoppage at Alcoa’s facilities in the future. Alcoa may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements. Any such work stoppages (or potential work
stoppages) could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.

Alcoa may not be able to successfully implement its growth strategy.

Alcoa has an organic growth strategy focused on its “upstream” businesses. Significant expansion or growth projects are in various stages of
development or negotiation in several countries including Australia, Brazil, Brunei, Greenland, Guinea, Iceland, Jamaica and Trinidad. These projects may not be completed or may be completed at higher cost than expected due to shortages of labor or
materials, inability to obtain energy sources at competitive rates, inability to negotiate favorable contracts, inability to finance the construction of projects at favorable rates of interest, currency fluctuations, political unrest, regulatory
developments and commercial risks, including but not limited to adverse developments in the global supply and demand for alumina and aluminum.



As part of its strategy for growth, Alcoa has made and may continue to make acquisitions and divestitures and form
strategic alliances. There can be no assurance that these will be completed or beneficial to Alcoa or that targeted completion dates will be met.

Alcoa’s operations are exposed to business and operational risks, changes in conditions and events beyond its control in the countries in which it operates.

Alcoa has investments, activities and expansion projects in numerous countries outside the U.S. and in emerging markets, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, member countries of the European Union, Ghana,
Greenland, Guinea, Iceland, India, Jamaica, Korea, Mexico, Norway, Russia, Suriname, and Vietnam. Changes in the laws or governmental policies in the countries in which Alcoa operates could affect its business in such countries and Alcoa’s
results of operations.

Alcoa is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, as well as inflation and other economic
factors in the countries in which it operates.

Economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest
rates, and competitive factors in the countries in which Alcoa operates, could affect its revenues, expenses and results of operations. Changes in the valuation of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, particularly the Brazilian real, Canadian
dollar, Euro and Australian dollar, may affect profitability as some important raw materials are purchased in other currencies, while products generally are sold in U.S. dollars.

The influence of China may negatively impact our results in the event of a slowdown in consumption.

The Chinese
market has become a significant source of global demand for commodities. China now represents in excess of 25 percent of aluminum demand. China’s demand for aluminum has more than doubled in the last five years. Consequently, in response
to its increased demand for commodities, China is increasingly seeking self-sufficiency in key commodities, including investments in additional developments in other countries. These investments may impact future demand and supply balances and
prices.

Alcoa faces significant price competition from other aluminum producers and end-use markets for certain Alcoa products that are highly
competitive, such that customers may be willing to accept substitutes for products sold by Alcoa.

The markets for most aluminum products are highly
competitive. In addition, aluminum competes with other materials, such as steel, plastics, composites, and glass, among others, for various applications in Alcoa’s key markets. See also “Competitive Conditions” above. The willingness
of customers to accept substitutions for the products sold by Alcoa, the ability of large customers to exert leverage in the marketplace to affect the pricing for fabricated aluminum products, or other developments by or affecting Alcoa’s
competitors or customers could affect Alcoa’s results of operations.

Further metals industry consolidation could impact our business.

The metals industry has experienced consolidation over the past several years and there may be further industry consolidation in the future. Although
current industry consolidation has not negatively impacted our business, further consolidation in the aluminum industry could possibly have negative impacts that we cannot reliably predict.



Alcoa could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition of a significant customer or
customers.

A significant downturn in the business or financial condition of a key customer or customers supplied by Alcoa could affect Alcoa’s
results of operations in a particular period. Alcoa’s customers may experience delays in the launch of new products due to technical and design difficulties and if Alcoa is not successful in replacing business lost from such customers,
profitability may be adversely affected.

Alcoa may not be able to successfully implement its productivity and cost-reduction initiatives.

Alcoa has undertaken and may continue to undertake productivity and cost-reduction initiatives to improve performance, including deployment of
company-wide business process models, such as the Alcoa Business System and the Alcoa Enterprise Business Solution, an initiative designed to build a common global infrastructure across Alcoa for data, processes and supporting software. There can be
no assurance that these initiatives will be completed or beneficial to Alcoa or that any estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized.

Alcoa may not be able to successfully develop and implement new technology initiatives.

Alcoa is working on new developments in advanced
smelting process technologies, including inert anode and carbothermic technology, in addition to multi-alloy casting processes. There can be no assurance that such technologies will be commercially feasible or beneficial to Alcoa.

Alcoa is subject to a broad range of environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may be exposed to substantial costs and
liabilities associated with such laws.

Alcoa’s operations worldwide are subject to numerous complex and increasingly stringent environmental laws
and regulations. The costs of complying with such environmental laws and regulations, including participation in assessments and cleanups of sites, as well as internal voluntary programs, are significant and will continue to be so for the
foreseeable future. Alcoa’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by certain environmental matters, including remediation costs and damages related to several sites.

Climate change, climate change regulations and greenhouse effects may adversely impact our operations and markets.

Energy is a significant input in a number of Alcoa’s operations. There is growing recognition that energy consumption is a contributor to global warming, greenhouse
effects and potentially climate change.

A number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory change in response
to the potential impacts of climate change. There is also current and emerging regulation, such as the mandatory renewable energy target in Australia, or potential carbon trading regimes that will affect energy prices. Alcoa will likely see changes
in the margins of greenhouse gas-intensive assets and energy-intensive assets as a result of regulatory impacts in the countries in which the company operates. These regulatory mechanisms may be either voluntary or legislated and may impact
Alcoa’s operations directly or indirectly through customers. Inconsistency of regulations may also change the attractiveness of the locations of some of the company’s assets. Assessments of the potential impact of future climate change
regulation are uncertain, given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in countries in which Alcoa operates.

The potential physical impacts of
climate change on the company’s operations are highly uncertain, and will be particular to the geographic circumstances. These may include changes in rainfall patterns, water shortages, changing sea levels, changing storm patterns and
intensities, and changing temperature levels. These effects may adversely impact the cost, production and financial performance of Alcoa’s operations.



Alcoa may be exposed to significant legal proceedings, investigations or changes in law.

Alcoa’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by new or increasingly stringent laws, regulatory requirements or
interpretations or significant legal proceedings or investigations adverse to Alcoa, including product liability, safety and health and other claims.

Alcoa could be required to make additional contributions to its defined benefit pension plans as a result of adverse changes in interest rates and the capital markets.

Alcoa’s estimates of liabilities and expenses for pensions and other postretirement benefits incorporate significant assumptions including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability, the long-term
rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce (salary increases, medical costs, retirement age and mortality). Alcoa’s results of operations, liquidity or shareholders’ equity in a particular
period could be affected by a decline in the rate of return on plan assets, the rate used to discount the future estimated liability or changes in employee workforce assumptions.

Unexpected events may increase Alcoa’s cost of doing business or disrupt Alcoa’s operations.

Unexpected
events, including fires or explosions at facilities, natural disasters, war or terrorist activities, unplanned outages, supply disruptions, or failure of equipment or processes to meet specifications, may increase the cost of doing business or
otherwise impact Alcoa’s financial performance. Further, existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events.

The above list of important factors is not all-inclusive or necessarily in order of importance.

Item 1B.  Unresolved Staff Comments.

Facilities that serve multiple product categories may be listed in more than one segment.

Alcoa’s principal office is located at 390 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10022-4608. Alcoa’s corporate center is located at 201 Isabella Street,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15212-5858. The Alcoa Technical Center for research and development is located at 100 Technical Drive, Alcoa Center, Pennsylvania 15069.

Alcoa leases some of its facilities; however, it is the opinion of management that the leases do not materially affect the continued use of the properties or their values.



Alcoa believes that its facilities are suitable and adequate for its operations. Although no title examination of
properties owned by Alcoa has been made for the purpose of this report, the company knows of no material defects in title to any such properties. See Notes H and N to the financial statements for information on properties, plants and equipment and
lease expense.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings.

In the ordinary course of its business, Alcoa is involved in a number of lawsuits
and claims, both actual and potential, including some that it has asserted against others. While the amounts claimed may be substantial, the ultimate liability cannot now be determined because of the considerable uncertainties that exist. It is
possible that results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be materially affected by certain contingencies. Management believes, however, that the disposition of matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material
adverse effect on the financial position of the company.

Environmental Matters

Alcoa is involved in proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, also known as Superfund (CERCLA) or analogous state provisions regarding the usage, disposal, storage or
treatment of hazardous substances at a number of sites in the U.S. The company has committed to participate, or is engaged in negotiations with federal or state authorities relative to its alleged liability for participation, in clean-up efforts at
several such sites.

As previously reported, since 1989, Alcoa has been conducting investigations and studies of the Grasse River, adjacent to Alcoa’s
Massena, New York plant site, under order from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued under Section 106 of CERCLA. Sediments and fish in the river contain varying levels of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB). In early 2002, Alcoa
submitted a revised Analysis of Alternatives Report to EPA. This Report identified potential remedial actions related to PCB contamination of the river, including additional remedial alternatives that may be required by EPA. It also reflected
certain recent studies and investigations on the river, including pilot tests of sediment capping techniques and other remediation technologies. The range of costs associated with the remedial alternatives evaluated in the 2002 Report was between $2
million and $525 million. Alcoa believes that rational, scientific analysis supports a remedy involving the containment of sediments in place via natural or man-made processes. Because the selection of the $2 million alternative (natural recovery)
was considered remote, the company adjusted the reserve for the Grasse River in 2002 to $30 million representing the low end of the range of possible alternatives, as no single alternative could be identified as more probable than the others. In
June 2003, based on then recent river observations, EPA requested that Alcoa gather additional field data to assess the potential for sediment erosion from winter river ice formation and breakup so that it could be factored into the range of
remedial alternatives being considered. The results of these additional studies, submitted in a report to EPA in April of 2004, suggest that this phenomenon has the potential to occur approximately every 10 years and may impact sediments in certain
portions of the river under all remedial scenarios. Those evaluations were submitted to EPA along with a proposal to perform additional pilot remedial studies in the river. In May 2004, EPA approved Alcoa’s proposed Remedial Options Pilot Study
(ROPS) that includes sediment removal and capping, the installation of an ice control structure, and significant monitoring. At the same time, Alcoa adjusted the reserve for the river to include the $35 million estimated cost of the ROPS, in
addition to the $30 million previously reserved. Most of the construction work for the ROPS was completed in 2005 with monitoring proposed through 2008. The findings from the ROPS program and from these additional investigations will be incorporated
into a revised Analysis of Alternatives Report that is expected to be submitted in 2008. EPA will use this information to develop a remedy for the river. With the exception of the natural recovery remedy, none of the existing alternatives in the
2002 Analysis of Alternatives Report is more probable than the others and the results of the ROPS are necessary to revise the scope and estimated cost of many of the current alternatives. EPA’s ultimate selection of a remedy could result in
additional liability. Alcoa may be required to record a subsequent reserve adjustment at the time EPA’s Record of Decision is issued, which is expected in 2009 or later.



As previously reported, representatives of various U.S. federal and state agencies and a Native American tribe, acting in
their capacities as trustees for natural resources, have asserted that Alcoa and Reynolds Metals Company (Reynolds) may be liable for loss or damage to such resources under federal and state law based on Alcoa’s and Reynolds’ operations at
their Massena, New York and St. Lawrence, New York facilities. While formal proceedings have not been instituted, the company continues to actively investigate these claims. The company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a
range of reasonably possible loss.

As previously reported, in September 1998, Hurricane Georges struck the U.S. Virgin Islands, including the St. Croix
Alumina, L.L.C. facility on the island of St. Croix. The wind and rain associated with the hurricane caused material at the location to be blown into neighboring residential areas. Various clean-up and remediation efforts were undertaken by or on
behalf of St. Croix Alumina, L.L.C. A Notice of Violation was issued by the Division of Environmental Protection of the Department of Planning and Natural Resources of the Virgin Islands Government, and has been contested by the company. A civil
suit was commenced in the Territorial Court of the Virgin Islands by certain residents of St. Croix in February 1999 seeking compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief for alleged personal injuries and property damages associated with
“bauxite or red dust” from the St. Croix Alumina, L.L.C. facility. The suit, which has been removed to the District Court of the Virgin Islands, names St. Croix Alumina, L.L.C., Alcoa Inc. and Glencore Ltd. as defendants, and in August
2000 was accorded class action treatment. The class is defined to include persons in various defined neighborhoods who “suffered damages and/or injuries as a result of exposure during and after Hurricane Georges to red dust and red mud blown
during Hurricane Georges.” All of the defendants have denied liability, and discovery and other pretrial proceedings have been underway since 1999. In October 2003, the defendants received plaintiffs’ expert reports. These reports also
claim that the material blown during Hurricane Georges consisted of bauxite and red mud, and contained crystalline silica, chromium and other substances. The reports go on to claim, among other things, that the population of the six subject
neighborhoods as of the 2000 census (a total of 3,730 people) has been exposed to toxic substances through the fault of the defendants, and hence will be able to show entitlement to lifetime medical monitoring as well as other compensatory and
punitive relief. These opinions have been contested by the defendants’ expert reports, that state, among other things, that plaintiffs were not exposed to the substances alleged and that in any event the level of alleged exposure does not
justify lifetime medical monitoring. In August 2005, Alcoa and St. Croix Alumina, L.L.C. moved to decertify the plaintiff class, and in March 2006, the assigned magistrate judge issued a recommendation that class certification be maintained for
liability issues only, and that the class be decertified after liability issues have been resolved. This recommendation has been adopted by the assigned district judge. Alcoa and St. Croix Alumina, L.L.C. have turned over this matter to their
insurance carriers who are providing a defense. Glencore Ltd. is jointly defending the case with Alcoa and St. Croix Alumina, L.L.C. and has a pending motion to dismiss. The company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range
of reasonably possible loss.

As previously reported, on September 26, 2003, EPA Region VI filed an Administrative Complaint, Compliance Order and
Notice of Opportunity for Hearing against the Wichita Falls, Texas facility of Howmet Corporation (Howmet) for violations of hazardous waste regulations relating to shipments of used potassium hydroxide to a fertilizer manufacturer from 1997 until
2000. The Complaint proposes a penalty of $265,128. In addition, EPA ordered Howmet to cease sending used potassium hydroxide to fertilizer manufacturers or employing used potassium hydroxide in any use constituting disposal and to certify
compliance with hazardous waste regulations within 30 days. On October 22, 2003, EPA Region II issued an almost identical Complaint, Compliance Order and Notice of Opportunity for Hearing against Howmet’s Dover, New Jersey facility,
seeking $180,021 in penalties. Howmet filed its Answers to EPA Region VI’s and EPA Region II’s Complaints. Howmet’s Answers denied the substance of EPA’s Complaints, requested that no penalties be imposed and requested Hearings
on both the hazardous waste allegations and the Compliance Orders. On April 25, 2005, the administrative Court granted EPA’s motions for partial accelerated decision with respect to both cases, finding that Howmet violated the cited
regulatory provisions alleged in the Complaint and moved the case to the penalty phase. The Court rejected Howmet’s interlocutory appeal of this decision on May 16, 2005. On September 2, 2005, EPA and Howmet stipulated to a penalty
amount of $309,091 for the consolidated matters should the finding of liability be upheld and Howmet appealed the administrative Court’s decision to the Environmental Appeals Board on September 28, 2005. On May 24, 2007, the
Environmental Appeals Board upheld the administrative Court’s liability



finding against Howmet and assessed the parties’ stipulated penalty of $309,091. On July 23, 2007, Howmet appealed the Environmental Appeals Board
decision to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.

As previously reported, in May 2005

,

Alcoa World Alumina LLC and St.
Croix Alumina, L.L.C. were among the defendants listed in a lawsuit brought by the Commissioner of the Department of Planning and Natural Resources, Dean Plaskett, in his capacity as Trustee for Natural Resources of the Territory of the United
States Virgin Islands in the District Court of the Virgin Islands, Division of St. Croix. The complaint seeks damages for alleged injuries to natural resources caused by alleged releases from an alumina refinery facility in St. Croix that was owned
by St. Croix Alumina, L.L.C. from 1995 to 2002. Also listed in the lawsuit are previous and subsequent owners of the alumina refinery and the owners of an adjacent oil refinery. Claims are brought under CERCLA, U.S. Virgin Islands law, and common
law. The plaintiff has not specified in the complaint the amount it seeks in damages. The defendants have filed motions to dismiss and, in September 2006, filed a motion for an order staying discovery pending resolution of those motions. All of
these motions are pending and discovery has not begun. In September 2007, the court asked the parties to brief the issue of whether the natural resource provisions of the federal Superfund law preempted territorial statutory and common law claims in
the case. The parties have complied. In October 2007, the plaintiff and St. Croix Renaissance Group, L.L.L.P. (SCRG) filed a joint Agreement and Consent Decree to resolve SCRG’s liability in the lawsuit, along with any CERCLA liability it may
have with respect to the facility. The remaining defendants each filed objections to the Agreement and Consent Decree. This litigation is in its preliminary stages and the company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range of
reasonably possible loss.

As previously reported, in August 2005, Dany Lavoie, a resident of Baie Comeau in the Canadian Province of Quebec, filed a
Motion for Authorization to Institute a Class Action and for Designation of a Class Representative against Alcoa Canada Inc., Alcoa Limitee, Societe Canadienne de Metaux Reynolds Limitee and Canadian British Aluminum in the Superior Court of Quebec
in the District of Baie Comeau. Plaintiff seeks to institute the class action on behalf of a putative class consisting of all past, present and future owners, tenants and residents of Baie Comeau’s St. Georges neighborhood. He alleges that
defendants, as the present and past owners and operators of an aluminum smelter in Baie Comeau, have negligently allowed the emission of certain contaminants from the smelter, specifically Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons or “PAHs”, that
have been deposited on the lands and houses of the St. Georges neighborhood and its environs causing damage to the property of the putative class and causing health concerns for those who inhabit that neighborhood. If allowed to proceed as a class
action, plaintiff seeks to compel additional remediation to be conducted by the defendants beyond that already undertaken by them voluntarily, seeks an injunction against further emissions in excess of a limit to be determined by the court in
consultation with an independent expert, and seeks money damages on behalf of all class members. A hearing on plaintiff’s motion for class certification was held on April 24-26, 2007. On May 23, 2007, the court issued its ruling which
granted the motion in part and authorized a class action suit to include only people who suffered property damage or personal injury damages caused by the emission of PAHs from the smelter. On September 13, 2007, the plaintiff filed its claim
against the original defendants, which the court had authorized in May. This litigation is in its preliminary stages and the company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss.

As previously reported, on December 5, 2005, Alcoa received service of a lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York and
styled as Margaret George, et al., v. General Motors Corporation and Alcoa Inc., Docket No. 05-CV-1482. The complaint alleges personal injury and damages arising from exposure to PCB released from the defendants’ industrial facilities in
Massena, New York and seeks certification of a class of plaintiffs comprised of individual Mohawk Indians residing on the Akwesane Territory, a Mohawk Indian Reservation, situated along the St. Lawrence River in the United States and Canada. The
suit alleges that approximately 12,000 individuals reside on the reservation. The company is investigating the allegations and has filed an answer denying liability. The defendants’ substantial defenses to liability have now become evident to
plantiffs, facilitating settlement negotiations based on cost of defense valuations. A settlement is likely and an appropriate reserve has been established.

As previously reported, in January 2006, in Musgrave v. Alcoa, et al, Warrick Circuit Court, County of Warrick, Indiana; 87-C01-0601-CT-0006, Alcoa Inc. and a subsidiary were sued by an individual, on behalf of himself and all persons
similarly situated, claiming harm from alleged exposure to waste that had been disposed in designated pits at



the Squaw Creek Mine in the 1970s. During February 2007, class allegations were dropped and the matter now proceeds as an individual claim.

Also as previously reported, in October 2006, in Barnett, et al. v. Alcoa and Alcoa Fuels, Inc., Warrick Circuit Court, County of Warrick, Indiana; 87C01-0601-PL-499,
forty-one plaintiffs sued Alcoa Inc. and a subsidiary, asserting claims similar to the Musgrave matter, discussed above. On November 19, 2007, Alcoa Inc. and its subsidiary filed motions to dismiss both the Musgrave and Barnett cases. The
Musgrave and Barnett matters are in their preliminary stages and the company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss.

As previously reported, on April 5, 2006, Alcoa was notified by the Court of Venice (Tribunal di Venezia) that Alcoa Trasformazioni S.r.l., Fusina site (Venice), was sued by the Italian Minister of Environment
and Minister of Public Works for an alleged liability for environmental damages. The plaintiffs asserted that Alcoa, as present owner of the site contaminated by previous activities, had the duty to act promptly to prevent the site from
contaminating the Venice Lagoon and its surrounding natural resources. Alcoa Trasformazioni denies responsibility for the pre-existing condition and for failing to eliminate or circumscribe the pollution which was already the object of initiatives
by the public authorities and a clear duty of the previous owner and plant seller. Alcoa has sued Alumix and Efim (the sellers of the Fusina site) before the Court of Rome for indemnification against any liability related to the pollution of former
Alumix sites, purchased by Alcoa in 1996. Plaintiffs seek compensation for damages to the environment plus costs of installing a physical barrier along the plant’s border with the Lagoon. This litigation is in its preliminary stages and the
company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss.

As previously reported, in December 2006, St.
Croix Alumina, L.L.C. was sued by the Commissioner of the Department of Planning and Natural Resources (DPNR), U.S. Virgin Islands, in the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands, Division of St. Croix. The plaintiff alleges violations of the Coastal
Zone Management Act and a construction permit issued thereunder. The complaint seeks a civil fine of $10,000 under the Coastal Zone Management Act, civil penalties of $10,000 per day for alleged intentional and knowing violations of the Coastal Zone
Management Act, exemplary damages, costs, interest and attorney’s fees, and “other such amounts as may be just and proper.” This litigation is in its preliminary stages and the company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to
estimate a range of reasonably possible loss.

As previously reported, in December 2006, St. Croix Alumina, L.L.C. (SCA), along with unaffiliated prior and
subsequent owners, were sued by the Commissioner of the DPNR, U.S. Virgin Islands, in the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands, Division of St. Croix. This second suit alleges violations by the defendants of certain permits and environmental
statutes said to apply to the facility. The complaint seeks the completion of certain actions regarding the facility, a civil fine from each defendant of $10,000 under the Coastal Zone Management Act, civil penalties of $50,000 per day for each
alleged violation of the Water Pollution Control Act, $10,000 per day for alleged intentional and knowing violations of the Coastal Zone Management Act, exemplary damages, costs, interest and attorney’s fees, and “other such amounts as may
be just and proper.” In October 2007, Plaintiff and defendant SCRG entered into a settlement agreement resolving claims against SCRG. Plaintiff filed a notice of dismissal with the court, and the court entered an order dismissing SCRG on
November 2, 2007. SCA objected to the dismissal and requested that the court withdraw its order, and the parties have briefed SCA’s objection and request. A decision from the court is pending. This litigation is in its preliminary stages
and the company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss.

As previously reported, on January 22,
2007, the City of Point Comfort, Texas filed suit against Alcoa World Alumina LLC (AWA) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Victoria Division. Served on January 31, 2007, the suit alleges that air emissions
from AWA’s Point Comfort facility have caused personal injury and property damage to the city and its residents. The complaint seeks injunctions prohibiting operation and unspecified damages. The parties are currently engaged in settlement
discussions. This litigation is in its preliminary stages and the company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss.



Other Matters

As
previously reported, along with various asbestos manufacturers and distributors, Alcoa and its subsidiaries as premises owners are defendants in several hundred active lawsuits filed on behalf of persons alleging injury predominantly as a result of
occupational exposure to asbestos at various company facilities. In addition, an Alcoa subsidiary company has been named, along with a large common group of industrial companies, in a pattern complaint where the company’s involvement is not
evident. Since 1999, several thousand such complaints have been filed. To date, the subsidiary has been dismissed from almost every case that was actually placed in line for trial. Alcoa, its subsidiaries and acquired companies, all have had
numerous insurance policies over the years that provide coverage for asbestos based claims. Many of these policies provide layers of coverage for varying periods of time and for varying locations. Alcoa believes that between its reserves and
insurance it is adequately covered for its known asbestos exposure related liabilities. The costs of defense and settlement have not been and are not expected to be material to the financial condition of the company.

As previously reported, during the first quarter of 2005, in the context of an informal investigation being conducted by the staff of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) relating to certain trade payables financing, the company received a request for the voluntary provision of documents and related information concerning the classification and disclosure of certain trade accounts payable
transactions for periods beginning after December 31, 2002 that involve, directly or indirectly, an intermediary. The SEC staff has advised the company that the inquiry should not be construed as an indication by the SEC or its staff that any
violations of law have occurred, or as an adverse reflection upon any person or security. During the second quarter of 2005, Alcoa completed its production of documents and information in response to the SEC’s request. The company has had no
further contact from the SEC since that time. Accordingly, the company now considers this matter closed.

As previously reported, in the 2006 second
quarter, Alcoa Aluminio S.A. (Alcoa Aluminio) received a Notice of Violation and Fine from Brazil’s Federal Revenue Department seeking payment of an isolated fine for alleged non-anticipation of payment of annual Corporate Income (CI) and
Social Contribution Taxes (SCT), calculated under the presumed monthly taxable income mechanism. The claim was based on Alcoa Aluminio not qualifying for the alternative method of anticipation of payment of CI and SCT used by the company, consisting
of calculating such anticipations based on the actual taxable income mechanism, in accordance with applicable legislation. The claim sought payment of Brazilian real $669 million and encompassed fiscal years from 2000 to 2005. On September 4,
2006, a favorable first administrative level decision was rendered finding the claim against Alcoa Aluminio to be without merit. On September 12, 2007, a favorable second administrative level decision was rendered finding the claim against
Alcoa Aluminio to be without merit. In early January 2008, the Federal Revenue Department informed Alcoa that the claim against Alcoa has been fully cancelled. Accordingly, the company now considers this matter closed.

As previously reported, on July 20, 2006, the European Commission (EC) announced that it has opened an investigation to establish whether an extension of the
regulated preferential electricity tariff granted by Italy to some energy intensive industries complies with European Union state aid rules. The new Italian power tariff modifies the preferential tariff that was in force until December 31, 2005
and extends it through 2010. Alcoa has been operating in Italy for more than 10 years under a power supply structure approved by the EC in 1996. That measure, like the new one, was based on Italian state legislation that provides a competitive power
supply to the primary aluminum industry and is not considered state aid by the Italian Government. The EC’s announcement states that it has doubts about the measure’s compatibility with European Union legislation and concerns about
distortion of competition in the European market of primary aluminum, where energy is an important part of the production costs. The opening of an in-depth investigation gives interested parties the opportunity to comment on the proposed measures.
It does not prejudge the outcome of the procedure. It is Alcoa’s understanding that the Italian Government’s continuation of the electricity tariff was done in conformity with all applicable laws and regulations. Alcoa believes that the
total potential impact from a loss of the tariff would be approximately $20 million (pre-tax) per month in higher power costs at its Italian smelters. The estimated total potential impact has increased since 2006 due predominantly to the weakening
of the U.S. dollar, as the liability would be payable in Euros in the event of a negative outcome. While Alcoa believes that any additional



cost would only be assessed prospectively from the date of the EC’s decision on this matter, it is possible that the EC could rule that the assessment
must be retroactively applied to January 2006. If the EC’s investigation concludes that extension of the regulated preferential electricity tariff is unlawful, Alcoa will follow through with the appeal it filed before the Court of First
Instance in Luxembourg in November of 2006 in response to the investigation.

As previously reported, on November 17, 2006, in Curtis v. Alcoa Inc.,
Civil Action No. 3:06cv448 (E.D. Tenn.), a class action was filed by plaintiffs representing approximately 13,000 retired former employees of Alcoa or Reynolds Metals Company and spouses and dependents of such retirees alleging violation of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) and the Labor-Management Relations Act by requiring plaintiffs, beginning January 1, 2007, to pay health insurance premiums and increased co-payments and co-insurance for certain
medical procedures and prescription drugs. Plaintiffs allege these changes to their retiree health care plans violate their rights to vested health care benefits. Plaintiffs additionally allege that Alcoa has breached its fiduciary duty to
plaintiffs under ERISA by misrepresenting to them that their health benefits would never change. Plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief, back payment of benefits and attorneys’ fees. Alcoa has consented to treatment of
plaintiffs’ claims as a class action. During the fourth quarter, following briefing and argument, the court ordered consolidation of the plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction with trial, certified a plaintiff class, bifurcated and
stayed the plaintiffs’ breach of fiduciary duty claims, struck the plaintiffs’ jury demand, but indicated it would use an advisory jury, and set a trial date of September 17, 2008. Alcoa estimates that, in the event of an unfavorable
outcome, the maximum exposure would be an additional postretirement benefit liability of approximately $300 million and approximately $40 million (includes an interest cost component) of expense annually, on average, for the next 11 years. Alcoa
believes that it has valid defenses and intends to defend this matter vigorously. However, as this litigation is in its preliminary stages, the company is unable to predict the outcome.

As previously reported, on January 25, 2007, the EC announced that it has opened an investigation to establish whether the regulated electricity tariffs granted by Spain comply with EU state aid rules. Alcoa has
been operating in Spain for more than nine years under a power supply structure approved by the Spanish Government in 1986, an equivalent tariff having been granted in 1983. The investigation is limited to the year 2005 and it is focused both on the
energy-intensive consumers and the distribution companies. The investigation provided 30 days to any interested party to submit observations and comments to the EC. With respect to the energy-intensive consumers, the EC is opening the investigation
on the assumption that prices paid under the tariff in 2005 were lower than the pool price mechanism, therefore being, in principle, artificially below market conditions. Alcoa has submitted comments in which the company has provided evidence that
prices paid by energy-intensive consumers were in line with the market, in addition to various legal arguments defending the legality of the Spanish tariff system. Therefore, it is Alcoa’s understanding that the Spanish tariff system for
electricity is in conformity with all applicable laws and regulations, and therefore no state aid is present in that tariff system. While Alcoa believes that any additional cost would only be assessed for the year 2005, it is possible that the EC
could extend its investigation to later years. Alcoa believes that the total potential impact from an unfavorable decision would be approximately $11 million (pre-tax) for 2005. If the EC’s investigation concludes that the regulated electricity
tariffs for industries are unlawful, Alcoa will have an opportunity to challenge the decision in the EU courts.

Includes the 2004 Alcoa Stock Incentive Plan (approved by shareholders in April 2004) (2004 ASIP), Alcoa Stock Incentive
Plan (approved by shareholders in 1999) and the former Alcoa Long Term Stock Incentive Plan (last approved by shareholders in 1992 and amendments thereto approved by shareholders in 1995). Table amounts are comprised of the following:

•

5,593,071 stock awards

•

1,032,559 performance share awards (396,625 granted at target)


The 2004 ASIP authorizes, in addition to stock options, other types of stock-based awards in the form of stock
appreciation rights, contingent stock, performance shares and performance units and stock or other awards. The shares that remain available for issuance under the 2004 ASIP may be issued in connection with any one of these awards. Included in the
2004 ASIP approved plan were additional share reserves of 30 million stock options and stock appreciation rights and 10 million for other awards. In addition, the 2004 ASIP provides the following are available to grant under the 2004 ASIP:
(i) shares subject to awards under the 2004 ASIP or prior plan that are forfeited, settled for cash, expire or otherwise terminate without issuance of shares and (ii) shares tendered in payment of the purchase price of an option award
under the 2004 ASIP or prior plan or tendered or withheld to pay required withholding taxes. Table amounts are comprised of the following:

•

35,289,553 stock options and stock appreciation rights

•

4,380,302 other awards


In connection with its acquisitions of Alumax, Cordant Technologies Inc., Howmet and Reynolds, Alcoa assumed stock
options outstanding under these companies’ stock option plans. An aggregate of 1,469,223 shares of Alcoa common stock are to be issued upon exercise of the outstanding options. The options have a weighted-average exercise price of $30.63. No
grants of stock options under these plans have been made since the year of Alcoa’s acquisition of the particular company, nor will any such grants be made in the future.


The Alcoa Fee Continuation Plan for Non-Employee Directors, adopted in 1990, provided fee continuation payments for
persons who met a minimum service requirement as a non-employee director. Each of the eligible participants (ten at December 31, 2007) was entitled to receive such cash and stock payments for life upon retirement from the Board based upon the
cash retainer fee for directors and an annual stock grant under the company’s former Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors. In 1995, the Board froze future annual payments to eligible directors at a maximum of $30,000 and 2,000 shares (or a
lesser proportion based on service). In 2006, the Plan was amended to provide that all payments would be made in cash rather than stock and cash, at the equivalent value of the payments the eligible participants would have received in stock and
cash. Prior to the 2006 Amendment, Alcoa’s practice had been to use treasury shares for the share payments. All current fees and other compensation for directors are outlined under the caption “Director Compensation” of the Proxy
Statement.
