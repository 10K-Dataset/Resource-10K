                                     PART 1

ITEM 1 - BUSINESS

A. O.  Smith  Corporation  is a 125 year old  diversified  manufacturer  serving
customers  worldwide.  The company is  organized  according  to the  products it
offers and under this  organizational  structure  has three  segments,  Electric
Motor  Technologies,  Water Systems  Technologies and Storage and Fluid Handling
Technologies, which is categorized as "Other" for segment reporting purposes.

The company's Electric Motor Technologies segment produces fractional horsepower
and  hermetic  electric  motors.  The Water  Systems  Technologies  Segment is a
leading  manufacturer  of residential and commercial gas, oil and electric water
heating  systems.  The Other  operations  consist of businesses that manufacture
reinforced  thermosetting  resin  piping as well as liquid and dry bulk  storage
systems.  Financial  information  regarding the company's  business  segments is
provided  in Note  13 to the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  which  appear
elsewhere herein.

On July 1, 1998, the company acquired the assets of General  Electric  Company's
domestic  compressor  motor  business  from the GE Industrial  Controls  Systems
Division  for  $126  million.   The  compressor   motor   business   contributed
approximately $53 million to 1998 sales.

Formerly, the company was also in the automotive products business but sold this
segment in 1997.

The following table  summarizes  sales by segment for the company's  operations.
This segment summary and all other information  presented in this section should
be read in conjunction with the Consolidated  Financial Statements and the Notes
thereto, which appear elsewhere herein.




                                   Years Ended December 31 (dollars in millions)

Electric Motor Technologies

Segment  sales  increased  $89.3  million or almost 23 percent in 1998 to $480.0
million and represented 52 percent of total company sales. The increase in sales
in  1998  was  primarily  due to the  acquisition  of  the GE  compressor  motor
business.

The Electric Motor  Technologies  segment consists of the A. O. Smith Electrical
Products  Company  which   manufactures   fan  motors  used  in  furnaces,   air
conditioners and blowers, as well as fractional  horsepower motors used in other
consumer  products  and jet pump  motors  sold to  manufacturers  of home  water
systems,  swimming pools, hot tubs and spas.  Hermetic motors are sold worldwide
to   manufacturers   of  compressors  and  are  used  in  air  conditioning  and
refrigeration systems. Sales to the heating,  ventilating,  air conditioning and
refrigeration market account for approximately 60 percent of the unit's sales.

In addition to selling its products  directly to OEMs,  the company also markets
its products  through a  distributor  network,  which sells to both OEMs and the
related after-market. The company estimates that approximately 60 percent of the
market is derived from the less cyclical replacement business with the remainder
being impacted by general business conditions in the new construction market.

The segment's  principal products are sold in competitive markets with its major
competitors being Emerson Electric, General Electric,  Magnetek, Inc., Fasco and
Jakel and vertically integrated customers.

WATER SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGIES

The Water Systems  Technology segment consists of the A. O. Smith Water Products
Company  which had 1998 sales of $294.8  million,  approximately  three  percent
higher  than 1997  sales of $287.5  million  and  represented  approximately  32
percent of total company sales.

Residential  sales in 1998 were $166  million  or  approximately  56  percent of
segment revenues. The company markets residential gas and electric water heaters
through a network of plumbing  wholesalers in the United States. The majority of
the company's sales are in the less cyclical replacement market although the new
housing  market is also an important  portion of the business.  The  residential
water heater market remains highly  competitive.  A. O. Smith competes with four
other  manufacturers  in supplying over 90 percent of market  requirements.  The
principal  competitors  in  the  Water  Systems  residential  market  are  Rheem
Manufacturing, State Industries, The American Water Heater Group (formerly SABH,
Inc.) and Bradford-White.

The company also markets  commercial  water heating systems through a network of
plumbing  wholesalers  in the United  States and  Canada.  A. O.  Smith's  Water
Systems  Technologies is the largest  manufacturer of commercial  water heaters.
Commercial  water  heating  systems  are used in a wide  range  of  applications
including schools, nursing homes, hospitals, prisons, hotels, motels, laundries,
restaurants,  stadiums, amusement parks, car washes and other large users of hot
water.  The commercial  market is  characterized  by competition  from a broader
range of products and  competitors  than occurs in the residential  market.  The
majority of  commercial  sales are derived  from the less  cyclical  replacement
market with the remainder being impacted by general  business  conditions in the
commercial building construction market.

In 1995,  Water  Systems  Technologies  established  a joint  venture with China
NanjingYuhuan  Corporation to manufacture instantaneous and storage type heaters
for the Chinese market.  A. O. Smith acquired the partner's  interest during the
fourth  quarter  of 1998 and  will  begin  reporting  the  Chinese  subsidiary's
financial results on a consolidated basis during 1999.






OTHER

The Other segment includes Storage and Fluid Handling  Technologies and provides
world-wide  solutions for  effectively  storing  liquids and a wide range of dry
materials;   as  well  as  high  performance  piping  systems  that  safely  and
effectively  contain  and  convey  corrosive,  abrasive  or  related  materials.
Significantly lower sales of fluid handling products and slightly lower sales of
storage products combined for an eight-percent decline in total segment sales to
$142.8 million compared with the $154.7 million recorded in 1997.

The  Engineered  Storage  Products  business  sells storage tanks to industrial,
municipal,   agricultural   liquid  and  dry  bulk  storage  markets.   Nineteen
ninety-eight sales of storage products were $90.8 million. The company's storage
products are sold in competitive markets that include concrete,  site welded and
bolted  tanks.  Principal  competitors  include  Columbian  Steel Tank  Company,
Permastore LTD., Pittsburg Tank and Tower Company Inc. and Natgun Corporation.

Fiberglass  Products  manufactures  reinforced  thermosetting  resin  piping and
fittings used to carry  corrosive  materials.  Sales of fluid handling  products
were $52.0 million in 1998. Typical applications include chemical and industrial
process and waste stream piping, high and low pressure oil field pipe and tubing
and underground  gasoline  service  station piping.  Products are sold through a
network of distributors.

In 1995,  Fiberglass  Products  formed a joint  venture  with Harbin  Composites
Corporation  of  Harbin,  China to supply  fiberglass  pipe to the  Chinese  oil
industry. The company is a majority owner of the venture, which began production
in 1997, and acquired its partner's interest in early 1999.

Principal fluid handling products are sold in competitive markets with its major
competitors being Ameron Corporation, Fibercast Company, Environ Corporation and
Total Containment Corporation.






RAW MATERIAL

Raw materials for the company's  operations,  which consist  primarily of steel,
copper and aluminum,  are generally  available from several  sources in adequate
quantities.  The company  hedges the majority of its annual  purchases of copper
and aluminum to protect against price volatility.

SEASONALITY

There is no significant seasonal pattern to the company's consolidated quarterly
sales and earnings.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

In order to improve  competitiveness  by generating  new products and processes,
the company conducts research and development at its Corporate Technology Center
in  Milwaukee,  Wisconsin  as well as at its  operating  unit  locations.  Total
expenditures   for  research  and  development  in  1998,  1997  and  1996  were
approximately $17.8 million, $17.2 million and $17.3 million, respectively.

The company owns and uses in its  businesses  various  trademarks,  trade names,
patents,  trade secrets and  licenses.  While a number of these are important to
the  company,  it does  not  consider  a  material  part of its  business  to be
dependent on any one of them.

EMPLOYEES

The company and its  subsidiaries  employed  approximately  9,700 persons in its
operations as of December 31, 1998.

BACKLOG

Due  to  the  nature  of the  company's  products  and  their  relatively  short
production cycles, none of its operations sustain significant backlogs.

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS

The company's  operations are governed by a variety of federal,  state and local
laws intended to protect the environment. While environmental considerations are
a  part  of  all   significant   capital   expenditures,   compliance  with  the
environmental  laws has not had a material  effect and is not expected to have a
material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position
of the company. See Item 3.

FOREIGN SALES

Total export sales of continuing  operations from the U.S. were $ 64 million,  $
64 million and $52 million in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.








ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES

The company  manufactures its products in 33 plants worldwide.  These facilities
have an aggregate floor space of 4,946,520 square feet,  consisting of 3,737,210
square  feet owned by the  company and  1,209,310  square feet of leased  space.
Fifteen of the  company's  facilities  are foreign  plants  including the Harbin
joint venture with 1,346,250  square feet of space, of which 428,786 square feet
are leased.


The principal equipment at the company's facilities consist of presses, welding,
machining,  slitting and other metal fabricating equipment, winding machines and
furnace and painting equipment.  The company regards its plants and equipment as
well-maintained and adequate for its needs. Multishift operations are used where
necessary.

In addition to its manufacturing  facilities,  the company's World  Headquarters
and Corporate Technology Center are located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It also has
offices in Alsip,  Illinois; El Paso, Texas; Irving, Texas; London,  England and
Beijing, China.





ITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The company is  involved in various  unresolved  legal  actions,  administrative
proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of its business  involving product
liability,  property  damage,  insurance  coverage,  patents  and  environmental
matters  including the disposal of hazardous waste.  Although it is not possible
to predict with certainty the outcome of these  unresolved  legal actions or the
range of possible loss or recovery,  the company believes these unresolved legal
actions will not have a material effect on its financial  position or results of
operations.  A more detailed  discussion of these matters  appears in Note 12 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

ITEM 4 - SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No matters were  submitted to a vote of the security  holders  during the fourth
quarter of 1998.

ITEM 6 - SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA
(Dollars in Thousands, except per share amounts)







ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
         OF OPERATIONS

FINANCIAL REVIEW
A. O. Smith Corporation  achieved record earnings from continuing  operations in
1998 of $44.5 million or $1.84 per diluted share  compared with $37.6 million or
$1.33 per diluted  share in 1997.  The  Electric  Motor  Technologies  and Water
Systems Technologies platforms established new sales records in 1998. Details of
individual segment performance will be discussed later in this section.

Working  capital at  December  31,  1998 was $155.2  million  compared  with the
company's  working  capital of $237.8 million and $103.4 million at December 31,
1997 and  1996,  respectively.  The  company  purchased  General  Electric  (GE)
Company's  Scottsville,  Kentucky  compressor  motor business for $125.6 million
during the third quarter of 1998. The reduction in cash and cash  equivalents by
$108.2 million during 1998 was primarily  attributable to the  acquisition.  The
majority of the increases to receivables and inventory accounts during 1998 were
a result of the  acquisition  and the buyout of the partner in our Chinese water
heater  joint  venture in late 1998.  The  majority  of the  increase in working
capital in 1997 was due to the net cash  proceeds  received from the sale of the
company's automotive products business.

Capital  expenditures  were $27.9 million in 1998 compared with $44.9 million in
1997 and $37.8  million in 1996.  The drop in capital  spending  during 1998 was
principally due to lower capital expenditures in the Electric Motor Technologies
business.  The company  expects that cashflow from  operations  will  adequately
cover 1999 capital expenditures.

The  company's  two  joint  ventures  in the  People's  Republic  of China  were
established in the fourth quarter of 1995. The company  invested $7.1 million in
these joint ventures during 1998 compared with $13.7 million in 1997.

Long-term debt increased  $30.2 million from $101.0 million at December 31, 1997
to $131.2  million at December 31, 1998.  In  conjunction  with the  Scottsville
acquisition,  the  company  issued  $30  million  in senior  notes  under a loan
facility with The Prudential  Insurance Company of America.  The notes mature in
2018 and carry an interest rate of 6.66%. As a result,  the company's  leverage,
as measured by total debt to total capital, edged up to 25.3% at the end of 1998
versus 21.0% at the end of 1997.

The company  repurchased  1,188,450 shares of its common stock during 1998 under
its stock  repurchase  program.  Since the program's  inception in January 1997,
approximately 8.4 million shares have been repurchased.

During  1998,  the  company  split its stock  3-for-2 in the form of a 50% stock
dividend on its common stock. The stock dividend  increased the number of Common
stock and Class A common stock shares  outstanding to approximately 23.3 million
shares. A. O. Smith  Corporation has paid dividends for 59 consecutive  years. A
total of $.47 per share was paid in 1998 versus $.45 in 1997.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Sales from  continuing  operations in 1998 were $917.6 million  surpassing  1997
sales of $832.9  million by almost $85 million,  or more than ten  percent.  The
majority of the increase in sales was attributable to the acquisition in July of
GE's domestic  compressor  motor business.  The higher 1998 sales also benefited
from a full year of sales  from the  acquisition  of UPPCO,  a  manufacturer  of
subfractional  horsepower  C-frame  electric  motors  made in  March  1997 and a
resurgence in the domestic air  conditioning  market.  The strong electric motor
sales in 1998 combined with moderate growth in sales of commercial water heating
equipment more than offset declines in sales of fiberglass pipe and storage tank
products.  Sales in 1997 increased  approximately $52 million compared with 



1996 sales of $781.2 million, primarily as a result of $57 million of additional
sales  associated with the  aforementioned  acquisition of UPPCO. 

The  company's  gross profit margin for  continuing  operations in 1998 was 20.4
percent,  essentially  the same as the 20.5  percent  margin  in 1997 and a full
percentage  point less than the 1996  margin of 21.4  percent.  The  unfavorable
trend in margin from 1996 to 1997 was due to the lower  margin  associated  with
subfractional  motors as well as the pricing  concessions that were prevalent in
the water heater industry.

Sales for the  Electric  Motor  Technologies  segment  in 1998  increased  $89.3
million  or almost 23  percent  to a record  $480.0  million  from 1997 sales of
$390.7 million. Sales in 1996 were $337.1 million. Most of the increase in sales
in 1998 was due to the previously discussed compressor motor acquisition and the
recognition of a full year of sales from the 1997 UPPCO acquisition.  Sales were
also  bolstered  by a recovery in the hermetic  motor  business  resulting  from
improvement in the heating,  ventilating and air  conditioning  industry (HVAC).
The increase in sales from 1996 to 1997 was due to the acquisition of UPPCO.

Earnings for the Electric Motor Technologies  segment in 1998 were $55.7 million
or almost 24 percent higher than the $45.0 million  earned in 1997.  Earnings in
1996 were $42.4 million.  The continuing  improvement in earnings over this time
period resulted primarily from the higher sales volume.

Sales for the Water Systems  Technologies segment increased modestly from $287.5
million in 1997 to $294.8  million in 1998.  Sales in 1996 were $291.3  million.
The growth in 1998 sales resulted from higher sales of commercial  water heaters
resulting  from  a  strong  commercial   construction  market  and  an  expanded
commercial product offering as well as record sales performance by the segment's
European  operations.  Sales in 1997 declined  from the levels  achieved in 1996
primarily as a result of lower industry unit volumes and prices for  residential
products.

Earnings for Water Systems  Technologies  have remained fairly constant over the
past three years. The favorable impact of improving commercial sales and ongoing
cost reduction  activities have been offset by an aggressive pricing environment
in  the  residential  market  segment,  as  well  as  costs  to  start  up a new
manufacturing   facility  and  develop  distributor  channels  for  its  Chinese
operation.  During  the fourth  quarter of 1998,  the  company  acquired  the 20
percent share owned by its partner in the Chinese  operation and established the
Nanjing operation as a wholly foreign owned enterprise.

Sales for the Other  segment  declined  from  $154.7  million  in 1997 to $142.8
million in 1998.  Sales in 1996 were $152.8  million.  Weakness in the petroleum
production and chemical  markets caused by low oil and chemical  prices resulted
in reduced capital spending in these  industries and an associated  reduction in
demand  for  storage  tanks  and   fiberglass   pipe.   Earnings  in  1998  were
significantly lower than 1997 due to the lower volume.

Selling,  general, and administrative (SG&A) expense in 1998 was $106.6 million,
about equal to the prior two years.  Relative to sales,  SG&A  dropped  steadily
from a 1996 level of 13.7  percent to 11.6 percent in 1998.  Higher  general and
administrative  expense  associated  with the  aforementioned  acquisitions  was
offset  by  a  reduction  in  general  corporate  expenses  resulting  from  the
divestiture of the company's  automotive products business in April 1997 as well
as cost reduction activities at the operating units.

Interest  expense was $6.9 million in 1998  compared  with $7.8 million and $8.1
million in 1997 and 1996,  respectively.  The lower interest expense in 1998 was
the result of slightly  lower  interest  rates and  increased  interest  amounts
associated with major plant and equipment expenditures being capitalized.




Interest  income in 1998 was $3.8  million,  or $5.2 million less than 1997,  as
marketable  securities were liquidated to fund the $126 million compressor motor
acquisition  and the  repurchase  of slightly  more than one  million  shares of
common stock.

The company's  effective tax rate in 1998 was 34.7 percent and was equivalent to
the 1997 rate.  The 1996 tax rate was 37.0 percent.  The lower rates in 1998 and
1997 resulted from the utilization of state loss carry-forwards  associated with
liquidated  subsidiaries and research and development tax credits.  Consolidated
earnings from  continuing  operations in 1998 increased 18.5 percent to a record
$44.5  million  compared  with 1997 earnings of $37.6  million,  reflecting  the
favorable impact of the Electric Motor Technologies acquisitions and improvement
in certain of its markets.  Diluted  earnings per share of $1.84 in 1998 were 38
percent higher than the $1.33 earned in 1997 and include the positive  effect of
additional share  repurchases  made during the year.  Earnings per share in 1996
amounted to $.79.

Outlook
For 1999,  the company  expects the  difficulties  at its Storage and Fiberglass
Products businesses to persist and is cautiously optimistic about the market for
the products of its Water Systems  business  segment.  The company  believes the
Electric  Motors  business  will  improve  over  1998 as it  benefits  from  the
incremental  business of the compressor  motor  acquisition as well as the "Tier
One" supply agreement signed with York International in July 1998.

The company continues to aggressively pursue accretive  acquisitions such as the
UPPCO C-Frame motor business and the previously discussed Scottsville compressor
motor business.  The company  considers the pursuit of such acquisitions to be a
very important  element in its strategy for growth,  especially  considering the
slower near term  prospects of its  non-motor  businesses.  Although the company
believes 1999 earnings, excluding acquisitions,  will increase over 1998 levels,
accretive  acquisitions  will be  required  to achieve  its target of 15 percent
annual growth in earnings per share. The company  recently  indicated that it is
comfortable with analyst  estimates for 1999 ranging between $1.95 and $2.05 per
share.

OTHER MATTERS

Year 2000
The  company  continues  its  efforts  begun  several  years ago to address  its
potential Year 2000 (Y2k) issues. It has organized its activities to prepare for
Y2k  under  a   company-wide   plan  that  involves   four  steps:   Assessment,
Modification, Testing and Implementation.

The  company's  business  segments  operate  independently  of each other.  Each
business  segment has a core of  full-time  individuals  who have been  assigned
specific Y2k responsibilities in addition to their regular assignments.  The Y2k
readiness project is a company-wide effort and is monitored centrally.

The  assessment  phase  is  complete  and  the  modification  phase  is  nearing
completion. Key customers, vendors and service providers have been queried about
their Y2k readiness and their  responses are being analyzed.  Follow-up  efforts
have commenced to obtain feedback from critical suppliers.

The testing and implementation phases for renovated information  technology (IT)
systems are underway.  Implementation  of all new and renovated systems that are
Y2k compliant should be completed by the end of the first quarter of 1999.
Testing should be completed by the end of 1999.



The company  anticipates  that it will be Y2k  compliant by the end of 1999 with
respect to internal IT and non-IT  systems and does not  anticipate any material
adverse effect on its business operations, products or financial prospects.

Costs  specifically  associated with  renovating  software for Y2k readiness are
funded through operating cash flows and expensed as incurred.  Y2k-related costs
have not had a material effect on the company's financial position or results of
operations.  The  company  expects to incur total  costs of  approximately  $2.0
million on the Y2k problem of which the remaining costs are estimated to be $500
thousand.  Costs of  replacing  some of the  company's  systems  with  Year 2000
compliant  systems have been  capitalized as these new systems were acquired for
business  reasons  and not to  remediate  Y2k  problems,  if any,  in the former
systems.

The company  believes that all critical IT and non-IT systems and processes will
be Y2k compliant  and allow the company to continue  operations in the Year 2000
and beyond  with no  material  impact on its  financial  position  or results of
operations.  Unanticipated  problems  including  but not  limited  to,  critical
suppliers and business  partners not meeting their  commitments  to be Y2k ready
and the loss of critical  skilled  personnel,  could  result in an  undetermined
financial risk.

As part of its  ongoing  Year 2000  Project,  business  continuity  plans may be
expanded by the middle of 1999 for potential  contingencies  regarding currently
unforeseen Y2k problems.

Environmental
The company's  operations  are governed by a number of federal,  state and local
environmental  laws  concerning  the  generation  and  management  of  hazardous
materials,  the discharge of pollutants  into the environment and remediation of
sites  owned  by  the  company  or  third  parties.  The  company  has  expended
substantial  financial  and  managerial  resources  complying  with  such  laws.
Expenditures related to environmental  matters were not material in 1998 and are
not  expected to be material in any single year.  Although the company  believes
that its  operations are in compliance  with such laws and maintains  procedures
designed  to  maintain  compliance,  there are no  assurances  that  substantial
additional  costs for  compliance  will not be incurred in the future.  However,
since the same laws govern the company's competitors,  the company should not be
placed at a competitive disadvantage.

Market Risk
The company is exposed to various types of market risks,  primarily currency and
certain  commodities.  The  company  monitors  its  risks  in  such  areas  on a
continuous basis and,  generally enters into futures  contracts to minimize such
exposures  for  periods of less than one year.  The  company  does not engage in
speculation  in  its  derivatives   strategies.   Further  discussion  regarding
derivative  instruments  is  contained in Note 1 to the  Consolidated  Financial
Statements.

Commodity  risks  include raw  material  price  fluctuations.  The company  uses
futures  contracts to fix the cost of its expected  needs with the  objective of
reducing risk.  Futures  contracts are purchased over time periods and at volume
levels which  approximate  expected usage. At December 31, 1998, the company had
commodity futures contracts  amounting to approximately $38 million of commodity
purchases. A hypothetical 10 percent change in the underlying commodity price of
such contracts would have a potential impact of $3.8 million. It is important to
note that gains and losses from the company's  future contract  activities would
be offset by gains and losses in the underlying commodity purchase  transactions
being hedged.

In addition,  the company  enters into  foreign  currency  forward  contracts to
minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies. At December 31, 1998, the
company had foreign currency contracts outstanding of approximately $31 million.
Assuming a hypothetical 10 percent  movement in the respective  currencies,  the
potential  foreign  exchange  gain or loss  associated  with the change in rates



would amount to $3.1 million. It is important to note that gains and losses from
the company's forward contract activities would be offset by gains and losses in
the underlying transactions being hedged.

The majority of the company's debt is at fixed rates with insurance companies at
various  maturities.  The interest  income on the company's cash  equivalents is
subject to short term rate  fluctuations.  Due to the short-term  nature of cash
investments  and the  majority  of debt being held at fixed  rates,  the company
would not expect interest rate  fluctuations to have a material impact on future
earnings or cash flows.

Forward Looking Statements
Certain statements in this report are forward-looking  statements.  Although the
company  believes that its  expectations  are based upon reasonable  assumptions
within the bounds of its  knowledge of its  business,  there can be no assurance
that its financial goals will be realized. Although a significant portion of the
company's sales are derived from the replacement of previously installed product
and such sales are therefore less volatile,  numerous  factors may affect actual
results  and may cause  results to differ  materially  from those  expressed  in
forward-looking  statements  made by or on behalf  of the  company.  Among  such
numerous  factors the company  includes the  continued  growth of the  worldwide
heating,  ventilating and air conditioning market; the weather and its impact on
the heating and air conditioning market; the pricing environment for residential
water heaters;  capital spending trends in the oil,  petrochemical  and chemical
markets; and the successful development of the company's business in China.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.     Organization and Significant Accounting Policies

Organization.  A. O. Smith  Corporation  is a diversified  manufacturer  serving
customers  world-wide.  The company's  major product lines  include:  fractional
horsepower,  subfractional horsepower and hermetic electric motors;  residential
and commercial water heaters;  fiberglass  piping systems and water waste water,
and dry storage  systems.  The company's  products are manufactured and marketed
primarily in North America.  The company has two plants in Europe and two plants
in China.  Original  equipment  manufacturers  are the largest  customers of the
electric motor  technologies  unit.  Water heaters are  distributed  principally
through a diverse  network of plumbing  wholesalers.  Fiberglass  piping is sold
through  a  network  of  distributors  to the  service  station  market  and the
petroleum production industry as well as the chemical/industrial market. Storage
tanks are sold  through a  network  of  dealers  to  municipalities,  industrial
concerns and farmers.

Consolidation and basis of presentation.  The consolidated  financial statements
include the accounts of the company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.

Investment in joint  ventures.  At December 31, 1997, the company  accounted for
its two joint ventures in the People's Republic of China on the equity method as
the local venture partners held certain  participating rights. In December 1998,
the company bought out its partner in one of the joint ventures (see Note 3) and
accordingly, the company has consolidated this entity at December 31, 1998 while
continuing to account for the other joint venture on the equity method.

Use of estimates.  The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with
generally accepted  accounting  principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts  reported in the accompanying  financial
statements and notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair values.  The carrying  amounts of cash and cash  equivalents,  receivables,
trade  payables and long-term  debt  approximated  fair value as of December 31,
1998 and 1997.

Foreign currency  translation.  For all  subsidiaries  outside the United States
with the  exception  of  Mexico,  the  company  uses the local  currency  as the
functional currency. For these operations, assets and liabilities are translated
into U.S.  dollars at year-end  exchange  rates and  revenues  and  expenses are
translated  at  weighted  average  exchange  rates.  The  resulting  translation
adjustments are recorded as a separate component of stockholders'  equity. Gains
and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in net earnings.

Cash and cash equivalents.  The company considers all highly liquid investments,
generally  with a maturity  of three  months or less when  purchased  to be cash
equivalents.  Cash  equivalents,  consisting  principally of money market funds,
totaled  $26.9  million at December  31, 1998 and $140  million at December  31,
1997. The cost of these securities are considered to be "available for sale" for
financial reporting purposes.

Inventory valuation. Inventories are carried at lower of cost or market. Cost is
determined on the last-in,  first-out (LIFO) method for a significant portion of
domestic  inventories.  Inventories  of foreign  subsidiaries  and  supplies are
determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.

Property, plant and equipment. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost.
Depreciation is computed primarily by the straight-line method.

Goodwill.  Goodwill,  representing  the  excess  of  cost  over  net  assets  of
businesses acquired, is stated at cost and is amortized on a straight-line basis
over the estimated periods  benefited ranging from 15 to 40 years.  Amortization
charged to operations amounted to $2.9 million,  $1.4 million and $.5 million in
1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.





1.     Organization and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Impairment of long-lived assets. Property,  plant and equipment,  investments in
joint ventures,  other long-term assets and goodwill are reviewed for impairment
whenever  events or changes in  circumstances  indicate that the carrying amount
may not be recoverable.  If the sum of the expected  undiscounted  cash flows is
less than the carrying value of the related asset or group of assets,  a loss is
recognized for the  difference  between the fair value and carrying value of the
asset or group of assets. Such analyses necessarily involve judgment.

Derivative  instruments.  The company  enters into futures  contracts to fix the
cost of certain raw material  purchases,  principally copper and aluminum,  with
the  objective  of  minimizing  cost  risk  due  to  market  fluctuations.   Any
differences  between the  company's  fixed price and current  market  prices are
included as part of the inventory cost when the contracts mature. As of December
31, 1998, the company had contracts covering the majority of its expected copper
and a portion of its expected  aluminum  requirements  for 1999.  These  futures
contracts  limit the impact from both favorable and  unfavorable  price changes.
The effect of these  programs was not material to the results of operations  for
the three years ended December 31, 1998.

As a result of having various foreign operations,  the company is exposed to the
effect of foreign  currency rate  fluctuations  on the U.S.  dollar value of its
foreign subsidiaries. Further, the company and its subsidiaries conduct business
in various  foreign  currencies.  To minimize the effect of fluctuating  foreign
currencies  on its income,  the company  enters into  foreign  currency  forward
contracts.  The contracts are used to hedge known foreign currency  transactions
on a continuing basis for periods consistent with the company's exposures.

The company does not engage in  speculation.  The difference  between market and
contract  rates is  recognized  in the same period in which gains or losses from
the transactions being hedged are recognized.  The contracts, which are executed
with major  financial  institutions,  generally  mature  within one year with no
credit loss anticipated for failure of the counterparties to perform.

The following table  summarizes,  by currency,  the  contractual  amounts of the
company's forward exchange contracts.

The contracts in place at December 31, 1998 and 1997  amounted to  approximately
80 percent of the  company's  anticipated  subsequent  year  exposure  for those
currencies hedged.

Revenue recognition.  The company recognizes revenue upon shipment of product to
the customer.

Research and development.  Research and development costs are charged to expense
as incurred  and amounted to  approximately  $17.8,  17.2 and $17.3  million for
continuing operations during 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.






1.     Organization and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Environmental  remediation costs. The company accrues for losses associated with
environmental   obligations   when  such  losses  are  probable  and  reasonably
estimable.  Costs of estimated  future  expenditures are not discounted to their
present value. Recoveries of environmental  remediation costs from other parties
are recorded as assets when their receipt is probable. The accruals are adjusted
as facts and circumstances change.

Stock  split.  On June 9,  1998 the  company's  Board of  Directors  declared  a
three-for-two stock split of the company's Class A Common Stock and Common Stock
in the form of a stock dividend to  stockholders  of record on July 31, 1998 and
payable on August 17, 1998. All references in the financial statements to number
of shares outstanding,  price per share, per share amounts and stock option plan
data have been restated to reflect the split.

Earnings per share of common stock..  The numerator for the calculation of basic
and diluted  earnings per share is net earnings.  The following table sets forth
the  computation  of basic  and  diluted  weighted  average  shares  used in the
earnings per share calculations:

Reclassifications.  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform
to the 1998 presentation.

New accounting standards.  During 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued  SFAS  No.  133,  "Accounting  for  Derivative  Instruments  and  Hedging
Activities" (the Statement), which is required to be adopted for years beginning
after June 15, 1999.  The  Statement  will require the company to recognize  all
derivatives  in the  balance  sheet at fair value.  The  company  will adopt the
Statement no later than January 1, 2000 and  estimates  that the effect will not
be material to its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

During  1998,  the  Accounting  Standards  Executive  Committee  of the American
Institute of Certified  Public  Accountants  issued two  Statements  of Position
(SOP) that are applicable to the company - SOP 98-1,  "Accounting  for the Costs
of Computer  Software  Developed  or Obtained  for  Internal  Use" and SOP 98-5,
"Reporting on the Costs of Start-up Activities".  SOP 98-1 requires that certain
computer  software costs be capitalized  and SOP 98-5 requires costs of start-up
activities to be expensed as incurred. Since the company currently complies with
the  requirements of SOP 98-1 and SOP 98-5,  these  pronouncements  will have no
impact.

2.     Acquisitions

On July 1,  1998,  the  company  acquired  certain  assets of  General  Electric
Company's domestic  compressor motor business  (Scottsville) for $125.6 million.
On  March  31,  1997,  the  company  acquired  UPPCO,  Incorporated  (UPPCO),  a
manufacturer of subfractional  C-frame electric motors, for approximately  $60.9
million.  On December 6, 1995, the company acquired the stock of Peabody TecTank
Inc.  (TecTank),  a manufacturer  of dry bulk storage tanks,  for  approximately
$19.1 million,  which included a final purchase price adjustment of $1.1 million
in 1996.  The  acquisitions  were  accounted  for using the  purchase  method of
accounting  and,  accordingly,  the financial  statements  include the operating
results of the  acquisitions  from their  respective  dates of acquisition.  The
purchase  prices have been allocated to the assets  acquired and the liabilities
assumed based upon their respective fair values at the date of acquisition.  The
excess of the  purchase  prices  over the fair  values of net  assets  acquired,
$92.6, $46.2 and $7.0 million for Scottsville,  UPPCO and TecTank, respectively,
have been recorded as goodwill.





2.     Acquisitions (continued)

As  discussed in Note 1, the company  purchased  its  partner's  interest in its
water systems  venture in December 1998. The excess of the  consideration  paid,
including the distribution to the partner of certain  inventories and equipment,
over the fair values of the assets  acquired  amounted  to $5.3  million and has
been recorded as goodwill.

On a pro  forma  basis,  the  unaudited  consolidated  results  from  continuing
operations assuming the acquisition of Scottsville and UPPCO occurred on January
1, 1997 follows:

Earnings                                           47,841         40,749

The  pro-forma  results have been prepared for  informational  purposes only and
include  adjustments  to  depreciation  expense of acquired plant and equipment,
amortization of goodwill,  increased  interest  expense on acquisition  debt and
certain other adjustments,  together with related income tax effects of all such
adjustments.   Anticipated   efficiencies  from  the  consolidation  of  certain
manufacturing  activities  and  anticipated  lower material costs related to the
consolidation  of purchasing have been excluded from the amounts included in the
pro forma  operating  results.  These  pro-forma  results  do not  purport to be
indicative  of the  results  of  operations  that would  have  occurred  had the
purchases  been made as of the  beginning  of the  periods  presented  or of the
results of operations that may occur in the future.

3.     Discontinued Operations

On April 18, 1997, the company sold its automotive products business,  excluding
its Mexican  automotive  affiliate,  for $710 million.  On October 1, 1997,  the
company sold the remainder of its  automotive  business with the sale of its 40%
interest in its Mexican  affiliate  (Metalsa)  for $63  million.  The  operating
results  of the  automotive  businesses  prior to their  disposition  have  been
reported  separately as discontinued  operations in the  accompanying  financial
statements.  Net sales of the  discontinued  operations  were  $296.2 and $863.0
million for the period  ended April 18, 1997 and year ended  December  31, 1996,
respectively.

Liabilities of the discontinued business at December 31, 1998 and 1997 consisted
primarily of employee obligations and other retained liabilities net of deferred
income taxes.  Certain  expenses were allocated to the  discontinued  operations
through the date of sale, including interest expense,  which was allocated based
on the  ratio  of  net  assets  of  the  discontinued  operations  to the  total
consolidated net assets of the company.

The company has a $100 million  multi-year  revolving  credit  agreement  with a
group of nine banks which  expires  June 30,  2001.  At its option,  the company
maintains either cash balances or pays fees for bank credit and services.

On July 1, 1998,  the company  issued $30  million in senior  notes under a loan
facility with the Prudential  Insurance Company of America.  The notes mature in
2018 and carry an interest rate of 6.66%.






7.     Long-Term Debt and Lease Commitments (continued)

The company's  credit  agreement and term loans contain  certain  conditions and
provisions  which  restrict the company's  payment of dividends.  Under the most
restrictive  of  these  provisions,  retained  earnings  of $65.8  million  were
unrestricted as of December 31, 1998.

Borrowings  under the bank credit lines are  supported by the  revolving  credit
agreement and  accordingly,  have been classified as long-term.  It has been the
company's  practice to renew or replace the revolving  credit agreement so as to
maintain  the  availability  of debt on a  long-term  basis and to  provide  100
percent backup for its bank credit lines borrowings.

Long-term debt,  maturing  within each of the five years  subsequent to December
31,  1998,  is  as  follows:  1999-$4.6;  2000-$9.6;   2001-$11.1;   2002-$13.3;
2003-$11.7 million.

Future minimum  payments under  noncancelable  operating  leases from continuing
operations  total $40.1  million and are due as follows:  1999-$8.6;  2000-$6.3;
2001-$5.4; 2002-$4.0; 2003-$3.3; and thereafter- $12.5 million. Rent expense for
continuing  operations,  including  payments under operating leases,  was $14.3,
$12.9 and $12.1 million in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

Interest paid by the company for continuing  and  discontinued  operations,  was
$6.4, $13.0 and $15.1 million in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

8.     Stockholders' Equity

The company's authorized capital consists of 3 million shares of Preferred Stock
$1 par  value,  14  million  shares of Class A Common  Stock $5 par value and 60
million shares of Common Stock $1 par value. The Common Stock has equal dividend
rights  with  Class A Common  Stock  and is  entitled,  as a class,  to elect 25
percent of the board of  directors  and has  1/10th  vote per share on all other
matters.

During 1998, 1997 and 1996,  19,914,  10,950 and 63,665 shares of Class A Common
Stock were converted into Common Stock, respectively.  Regular dividends paid on
the Class A Common and Common Stock amounted to $.47, $.45 and $.44 per share in
1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

On January 27, 1997, the company's Board of Directors approved the repurchase of
up to 3 million  shares of Common Stock.  On June 10, 1997 and December 9, 1997,
the Board  authorized  the  repurchase  of up to $80  million  and $50  million,
respectively,  of  additional  Common Stock.  During 1998 and 1997,  the company
purchased  4,800 and 21,750  shares of Class A Common  Stock and  1,183,650  and
7,211,063 shares of Common Stock, respectively. At December 31, 1998, 31,740 and
9,226,036  shares of Class A Common Stock and Common Stock,  respectively,  were
held as treasury  stock.  At December 31, 1997,  26,940 and 8,089,341  shares of
Class A Common  Stock and  Common  Stock,  respectively,  were held as  treasury
stock.

9.     Stock Options

The  company  has two  Long-Term  Executive  Incentive  Compensation  Plans  for
granting of  nonqualified  and incentive  stock options to key employees.  These
plans have terminated except as to outstanding  options. The company will submit
a proposal to  stockholders  in 1999 for approval to reserve an  additional  1.5
million  shares  of  Common  Stock  under a new  Long-Term  Executive  Incentive
Compensation Plan (2000 Plan).  Options become exercisable one year from date of
grant and,  for active  employees,  expire  ten years  after date of grant.  The
number of shares available for granting of options at December 31, 1997 and 1996
was 221,550 and 396,600,  respectively.  Options as to 55,800 shares  granted in
1998 under the 2000 Plan are subject to approval by the stockholders.





9. Stock Options (continued)

Changes in option shares, all of which are Common Stock, were as follows:


During 1998,  an executive  elected to defer the gain related to the exercise of
107,100  options.  As a result,  the  executive  deferred  the receipt of 79,870
shares of Common Stock for which the company's obligation to issue the shares is
included within Stockholders' Equity.

The following table summarizes weighted-average information by range of exercise
prices for stock options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 1998:

                                                                                
SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation,"  encourages,  but does
not require  companies  to record  compensation  cost for  stock-based  employee
compensation  plans at fair value.  The company has chosen to continue  applying
Accounting  Principles  Board  Opinion No. 25,  "Accounting  for Stock Issued to
Employees,"  and related  interpretations  in  accounting  for its stock  option
plans. Accordingly, because the number of shares is fixed and the exercise price
of the stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date
of grant , no compensation  expense has been recognized.  Had compensation  cost
been determined based upon the fair value at the grant date for awards under the
plans based on the






9.     Stock Options (continued)

provisions of SFAS No. 123, the  company's  pro forma  earnings and earnings per
share from continuing operations would have been as follows:

The  weighted-average  fair value per option at the date of grant  during  1998,
1997 and 1996 using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, was $6.26, $7.51 and
$4.97, respectively. Assumptions were as follows:

10.    Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefits

The company provides retirement benefits for all United States employees and has
several  foreign  pension  plans,  none of which are  material to the  company's
financial  position.  Plan assets consist  primarily of marketable  equities and
debt  securities.   The  company  also  has  several  unfunded  defined  benefit
post-retirement  plans  covering  certain  hourly and salaried  employees  which
provide medical and life insurance benefits from retirement to age 65.

The following  tables  present the changes in benefit  obligation,  plan assets,
funded status and major assumptions used to determine these amounts for domestic
pension and post-retirement plans.







10.    Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefits (continued)


                                        
Net  periodic  benefit  cost  is  determined  using  the  assumptions  as of the
beginning of the year. The funded status is determined  using the assumptions as
of the end of the year.

Pursuant to the agreement to sell the automotive  products  business,  the buyer
assumed the  obligations for all  post-retirement  benefits other than pensions.
The company  retained all existing pension assets as well as all pension benefit
obligations earned through the closing date.  Accordingly,  investment return on
these  assets and interest  cost on the  obligation  subsequent  to the sale are
included in the  calculation  of net  periodic  pension  income,  whereas,  such
amounts prior to the sale are excluded as they were  allocated to the components
of discontinued operations pension expense.  Subsequent to the closing date, the
buyer assumed the  responsibility for pension service earned by active employees
of the automotive business.

Accrued  post-retirement  benefit cost is included in the  consolidated  balance
sheet in the accounts shown below:

December 31 (dollars in thousands)          1998               1997
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Accrued liabilities                       $  1,631          $  1,631
Post retirement benefit obligation          17,417            16,756
                                            ------            ------
Accrued postretirement benefit cost        $19,048          $ 18,387
                                            ======           =======

The company does not provide post-retirement health care benefits beyond age 65.
Certain hourly employees retiring after January 1, 1996 are subject to a maximum
annual  benefit and  salaried  employees  hired after  December 31, 1993 are not
eligible for  post-retirement  medical  benefits.  As a result, a one percentage
point  change in the health  care cost  trend rate would not have a  significant
effect on the amounts reported.

The company  has a defined  contribution  profit  sharing  and  retirement  plan
covering  salaried  nonunion  employees  which  provides  for  annual  corporate
contributions of 35 percent to 140 percent of qualifying  contributions  made by
participating  employees.  The amount of the company's contribution in excess of
35  percent  is  dependent  upon  the  company's  profitability.  The  company's
contribution,  including  amounts for discontinued  operations  through the sale
date, was $3.5, $3.5 and $5.3 million for 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.





11.    Income Taxes

The  components  of the  provision  for income taxes for  continuing  operations
consisted of the following:

                                                  ======     ======      ======

The tax  provision  differs  from the  statutory  U.S.  federal  rate due to the
following items:

Years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands)    1998       1997         1996

The domestic and foreign components of income from continuing  operations before
income taxes were as follows:

Years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands)     1998       1997        1996
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Domestic                                         $68,491    $58,740     $43,527
Foreign                                            4,472      2,916       2,696
                                                  ------     ------      ------

                                                 $72,963    $61,656     $46,223
                                                  ======     ======      ======

Total taxes paid by the company  amounted to $6.5,  $133.6 and $29.9  million in
1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

No provision for U.S. income taxes has been made on the  undistributed  earnings
of foreign  subsidiaries  as such  earnings  are  considered  to be  permanently
invested.  At December 31, 1998, the  undistributed  earnings  amounted to $14.7
million.  It is not practical to determine  the income tax liability  that would
result had such earnings been repatriated.  In addition, no provision or benefit
for U. S. income taxes have been made on foreign currency  translation  gains or
losses.






11.    Income Taxes (continued)

The approximate  tax effects of temporary  differences of assets and liabilities
between  income tax and financial  reporting for  continuing  operations  are as
follows:


These deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as
current or long-term  based on the balance sheet  classification  of the related
assets and liabilities as follows:

December 31 (dollars in thousands)               1998               1997

12.    Litigation and Insurance Matters

The company is  involved in various  unresolved  legal  actions,  administrative
proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of its business  involving product
liability,  property  damage,  insurance  coverage,  patents  and  environmental
matters  including the disposal of hazardous waste.  Although it is not possible
to predict with certainty the outcome of these  unresolved  legal actions or the
range of possible loss or recovery,  the company believes these unresolved legal
actions will not have a material effect on its financial  position or results of
operations.   The  following   paragraphs   summarize   noteworthy  actions  and
proceedings.

A  lawsuit  for  damages  and  declaratory  judgments  in the  Circuit  Court of
Milwaukee  County,  State of  Wisconsin,  in which the company is  plaintiff  is
pending against three insurance  companies for failure to pay in accordance with
liability insurance policies issued to the company.  The insurers have failed to
pay,  in full or in part,  certain  judgments,  settlements  and  defense  costs
incurred in connection with closed lawsuits alleging damages for economic losses
claimed to have arisen out of alleged defects in Harvestore  animal feed storage
equipment ("underlying claims"). In October 1998, the Wisconsin Appellate Court,
First  District,  entered an order which  reversed  the  decision of the Circuit
Court  which had  granted  the  company  partial  summary  judgment  against two
insurance  companies  with  respect  to  three  of the  underlying  claims.  The
company's  petition to the Wisconsin  Supreme Court to accept its appeal of this
decision was denied in January 1999 and the Appellate Court remanded the case to
the trial court with  directions to grant  summary  judgment in favor of the two
insurance  companies with respect to the subject  underlying claims. The lawsuit
is continuing  in the trial court with respect to the balance of the  underlying
claims  brought by the company  against  those two  insurance  companies and the
third insurance company.  While the company has, in part, assumed  applicability
of this coverage,  an adverse  judgment  should not be material to its financial
condition.




12.    Litigation and Insurance Matters (continued)

When  the  United  States  Environmental  Protection  Agency  ("EPA")  or  state
environmental  agencies  (collectively  "Regulatory  Agencies")  determine  that
hazardous  substances  have  been  released  to the  environment  at a  site  (a
"Contaminated  Site"),  they may designate parties they believe have contributed
hazardous  materials to the site as potentially  responsible  parties  ("PRPs").
Under  applicable  environmental  laws,  each  PRP  that  contributed  hazardous
substances to a  Contaminated  Site may be jointly and severally  liable for the
costs associated with cleaning up the site.  Typically,  PRPs negotiate with the
relevant  Regulatory  Agencies  regarding the selection and  implementation of a
plan to clean up the site and the terms of the PRPs' involvement in the process.
PRPs also negotiate with each other regarding  allocation of each PRP's share of
the clean up costs.

As part of its routine business operations, the company disposes of and recycles
or reclaims  certain  industrial  waste  materials,  chemicals  and  solvents at
disposal and recycling  facilities which are licensed by appropriate  Regulatory
Agencies and are owned and operated by third  parties  unrelated to the company.
The  company is  currently  involved  as a PRP in  judicial  and  administrative
proceedings  initiated  on behalf of  Regulatory  Agencies  seeking  to clean up
eleven such  Contaminated  Sites and to recover costs they have incurred or will
incur as to those sites. The company has also been designated a PRP with respect
to a former mining site in Colorado which is a  Contaminated  Site being cleaned
up by the EPA. The company  held the majority of the stock of a Colorado  mining
company for a period of time from 1935 to 1942.  Estimates  of clean up costs at
this site have exceeded $150,000,000. The company maintains that its status as a
stockholder  does not confer any liability on it for remediation of the site and
accordingly has not participated in remediation.  Nonetheless,  it is monitoring
the EPA's  actions with respect to the site.  While it is impossible to rule out
any EPA action,  the company  believes it has valid defenses to any liability at
this site and will vigorously  defend any claims made against it with respect to
the site.

It is impossible at this time to estimate the total cost of remediation  for the
twelve  Contaminated  Sites,  or the  company's  ultimate  share of those costs,
primarily because the sites are in various stages of the remediation process and
issues remain open at many sites concerning the selection and  implementation of
the final remedy, the cost of that remedy and the company's  liability at a site
relative to the liability and viability of the other PRPs.  Other  uncertainties
are based upon the current status of the law.

Expenditures and reserves related to cleaning up the environment at Contaminated
Sites have not been material to the company in any single year,  including  1998
and, based on information known to the company,  are not expected to be material
to the  company in any single year in the  future.  The company has  established
reserves  for  these  matters  in a manner  that is  consistent  with  generally
accepted  accounting  principles for costs  associated  with such clean ups when
those  costs  are  capable  of being  reasonably  estimated.  To the best of the
company's knowledge, the reserves it has established and insurance proceeds that
are available to the company are sufficient to cover the company's  liability at
the known Contaminated Sites. The company further believes its insurers have the
financial  ability to pay any such  covered  claims and there are viable PRPs at
each of the sites  which  have the  financial  ability  to pay their  respective
shares of liability at the sites.

With respect to non-environmental claims, the company has self-insured a portion
of its product  liability loss exposure and other business risks for many years.
The company has  established  reserves  which it believes  are adequate to cover
incurred  claims.  For the year ended  December  31,  1998,  the company had $60
million of third-party  product  liability  insurance for  individual  losses in
excess of $1.5 million and for aggregate losses in excess of $10 million.






13.    Operations by Segment

The  company   reevaluates  its  exposure  on  claims   periodically  and  makes
adjustments to its reserves as appropriate.

In 1998,  the company  adopted SFAS No. 131,  "Disclosures  about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related  Information,"  which supersedes SFAS No. 14,  "Financial
Reporting  for  Segments  of a  Business  Enterprise,  replacing  the  "Industry
segment"  approach  with the  "management"  approach.  The  management  approach
designates  the  internal  organization  that is used by  management  for making
operating  decisions  and assessing  performance  as the source of the company's
reportable  segments.  SFAS No. 131 also requires disclosures about products and
services, geographic areas and major customers. The adoption of SFAS No. 131 did
not affect  results of  operations  or financial  position but did result in the
restatement of the historical segment information presented for 1997 and 1996.

The  company  is  organized  based on the  products  it offers  and  under  this
organizational   structure  has  two   reportable   segments:   Electric   Motor
Technologies and Water System  Technologies,  with other insignificant  segments
being   aggregated  as  "Other".   The  Electric  Motor   Technologies   segment
manufactures fan motors used in furnaces,  air conditioners and blowers, as well
as fractional  horsepower  motors used in other  consumer  products and jet pump
motors sold to manufacturers of home water systems, swimming pools, hot tubs and
spas. In addition, the Electric Motor Technologies segment manufactures hermetic
motors which are sold  worldwide to  manufacturers  of  compressors  used in air
conditioning and  refrigeration  systems,  as well as  subfractional  horsepower
motors  used  in   appliances,   builders'   products  and  a  number  of  other
applications.  The Water Systems Technologies  segment manufactures  residential
gas and electric water heaters as well as commercial  water heating systems used
in a wide  range  of  applications  including  hotels,  laundries,  car  washes,
factories  and  large  institutions.  The  other  segment  is  comprised  of two
operating  segments;  one manufactures  fiberglass  piping systems and the other
manufactures  liquid and dry bulk storage  systems.  Neither of these  operating
segments represented a minimum of ten percent of total segment revenues,  assets
or profits in 1998 and are not projected to achieve these thresholds in the near
future.

The accounting  policies of the segments are the same as those  described in the
"Summary of Significant  Accounting  Policies"  outlined in Note 1. Intersegment
sales have been  excluded  from segment  revenues and are  immaterial.  Earnings
before  interest  and taxes  (EBIT),  as adjusted  for the pretax  equity in the
losses of the company's  joint  ventures,  is used to measure the performance of
the segments and allocate resources.
