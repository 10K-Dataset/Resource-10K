PART 1

ITEM 1 - BUSINESS

Our company is comprised of
two reporting segments: North America and Rest of World. Our Rest of World segment is primarily comprised of China, Europe and India. Both segments manufacture and market comprehensive lines of residential and commercial gas, gas tankless and
electric water heaters. Both segments primarily manufacture and market in their respective regions of the world. Our North America segment also manufactures and globally markets specialty commercial water heating equipment, condensing and
non-condensing boilers and water systems tanks. Primarily for Asia, our Rest of World segment also manufactures and markets water treatment products. We also market in-home air purification products in China.

On August 22, 2011, we sold our Electrical Products business (EPC) to Regal Beloit Corporation (RBC) for approximately $760 million in cash and
approximately 2.83 million shares of RBC common stock valued at $140.6 million as of that date. Due to the sale, EPC has been reflected as a discontinued operation in the accompanying financial information for all periods presented.

The following table summarizes our sales from continuing operations. This summary and all other information presented in this section should be read in
conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appear in Item 8 in this document.

NORTH AMERICA

Sales in our North America segment increased 5.0 percent or $81.3 million in 2015 compared with the prior year. The sales increase in 2015 was the result of
price increases in the U.S. and Canada for residential and commercial water heaters and higher volumes of commercial water heaters and condensing commercial boilers in the U.S. Lower volumes of U.S. residential water heaters and lower water heater
sales in Canada, primarily due to a decline in the value of the Canadian dollar of approximately thirteen percent versus the U.S. dollar, partially offset these favorable factors. Our Lochinvar brand, which we acquired in August 2011, incrementally
added approximately $143 million of sales in 2012 compared to 2011. Approximately 40 percent of Lochinvar-branded sales consist of residential and commercial water heaters while the remaining 60 percent of Lochinvar-branded sales consist primarily
of boilers and related parts.

We serve residential and commercial end markets in North America with a broad range of products including:

Water heaters

. Our residential and commercial water heaters come in sizes ranging from 2.5 gallon (point-of-use) models to 12,500 gallon products with
varying efficiency ranges. We offer electric, natural gas, gas tankless and liquid propane models as well as solar tank units. Our North American residential water heater sales in 2015 were approximately $1.1 billion or 62 percent of North America
sales. Typical applications for our water heaters include residences, restaurants, hotels and motels, office buildings, laundries, car washes and small businesses.

Boilers.

Our residential and commercial boilers range in size from 40,000 British Thermal Units (BTUs) to 5.0 million BTUs. Our commercial boilers
are used primarily in space heating applications for hospitals, schools, hotels and other large commercial buildings.

Other.

Our North America
segment also manufactures expansion tanks, commercial solar water heating systems, swimming pool and spa heaters, and related products and parts.

A
significant portion of the sales in our North America segment is derived from the replacement of existing products.

We are the largest manufacturer and
marketer of water heaters in North America, and we have a leading share in both the residential and commercial markets. In the commercial market, we believe our comprehensive product line including boilers



and our high-efficiency products give us a competitive advantage in this portion of the water heating industry. Our wholesale distribution channel includes more than 1,200 independent wholesale
plumbing distributors with more than 4,400 selling locations serving residential and commercial end markets. We also sell our residential water heaters through the retail channel. In this channel, our customers include five of the seven largest
national hardware and home center chains, including long-standing exclusive relationships with both Lowe’s and Sears. Our boiler distribution channel is primarily comprised of manufacturer representative firms.

Our Lochinvar brand is one of the leading brands of residential and commercial boilers in the U.S.

Our energy efficient product offerings continue to be a sales driver for our business. Our Cyclone product family and our condensing boilers continue to be an
option for commercial customers looking for high efficiency water and space heating with a short payback period through energy savings. We offer residential heat pump, condensing tank-type and tankless water heaters in North America, as well as
other higher efficiency water heating solutions to round out our energy efficient product offerings.

We sell our water heating products in highly
competitive markets. We compete in each of our targeted market segments based on product design, reliability, quality of products and services, advanced technologies, product performance, maintenance costs and price. Our principal water heating and
boiler competitors in North America include Rheem, Bradford White, Rinnai, Aerco and Navien. Numerous other manufacturing companies also compete.

REST OF WORLD

Sales in our Rest of World segment
increased 12.7 percent, or $97.8 million, in 2015 compared with the prior year. A 13.7 percent increase in sales in China to $789.2 million was the primary source of the increase. Excluding the impact from the stronger U.S. dollar, China sales
increased 16.1 percent in 2015.

We have operated in China for 20 years. In that time, we have been aggressively expanding our presence while building A.
O. Smith brand recognition in the Chinese residential and commercial markets. The Chinese water heater market is predominantly comprised of electric wall-hung, solar and gas tankless water heaters. We believe we are one of the leading suppliers of
water heaters to the residential market in China, with a broad product offering including electric, gas, gas tankless, heat pump and solar units as well as combi boilers. Primarily for Asia, we also manufacture and market water treatment products.
We also market air purification products primarily for the residential market in China.

We sell water heaters in more than 8,000 retail outlets in China,
of which over 2,000 exclusively sell our products. Our water treatment products and air purification products are sold in over 5,500 and 1,200 retail outlets in China, respectively. Our online sales continue to grow in China and in 2015 reached $140
million.

In 2008, we established a sales office in India and began importing products specifically designed for India from our China operations. We began
manufacturing water heaters in India in 2010. Our sales in India were $15.9 million in 2015 compared with $15.1 million in 2014.

Our primary competitor
in China is Haier Appliances, a Chinese company, but we also compete with Midea in the electric water heater and water treatment markets and Rinnai and Noritz in the gas tankless and solar water heater markets. Additionally, we compete with numerous
other Chinese private and state-owned water heater and water treatment companies in China. In India, we compete in the water heater and water treatment markets. We compete with Bajaj and MTS-Racold in the water heater market and Eureka Forbes and
Kent in the water treatment market.

In addition, we sell water heaters in the European and Middle Eastern markets and water treatment products in Turkey,
all of which combined comprised less than seven percent of total Rest of World sales in 2015.

RAW MATERIALS

Raw materials for our manufacturing operations, primarily consisting of steel, are generally available in adequate quantities. A portion of our customers are
contractually obligated to accept price changes based on fluctuations in steel prices. There has been volatility in steel costs over the last several years.



RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

To improve our competitiveness by generating new products and processes, we conduct research and development at our Corporate Technology Center in Milwaukee,
Wisconsin, at our Global Engineering Center in Nanjing, China, and at our operating locations. Our total expenditures for research and development in 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $73.7 million, $67.9 million and $57.8 million, respectively.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

We own and use in our businesses
various trademarks, trade names, patents, trade secrets and licenses. We do not believe that our business as a whole is materially dependent upon any such trademark, trade name, patent, trade secret or license. However, our trade name is important
with respect to our products, particularly in China, India and the U.S.

EMPLOYEES

We employed approximately 13,400 employees as of December 31, 2015, primarily non-union.

BACKLOG

Due to the short-cycle nature of our businesses,
none of our operations sustains significant backlogs.

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS

Our operations are governed by a variety of federal, foreign, state and local laws intended to protect the environment. Compliance with environmental laws has
not had and is not expected to have a material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position of our company. See Item 3.

ITEM 1A – RISK FACTORS

You should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the documents
incorporated by reference, before making an investment decision regarding our common stock. If any of the events contemplated by the following risks actually occurs, then our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be
materially adversely affected. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties below are not the only risks facing our company.

•

The effects of the global economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our business

The
global economy is still showing signs of stress, and could stall or reverse the course of any recovery. If this were to occur it could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending patterns which could result in decreased demand for the products
we sell, a delay in purchases, increased price competition, or slower adoption of energy efficient water heaters and boilers which could negatively impact our profitability and cash flows. In addition, a deterioration in current economic conditions,
including credit market conditions, could negatively impact our vendors and customers, which could result in an increase in bad debt expense, customer and vendor bankruptcies, interruption or delay in supply of materials, or increased material
prices, which could negatively impact our ability to distribute, market and sell our products and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

•

A portion of our business could be affected by a slowdown in the transition of the Chinese economy to a consumer driven ecomony

Our sales growth in China has averaged approximately 19 percent per year over the past three years and we anticipate sales growth of approximately 15 percent
in local currency in 2016. We continue to expand capacity for water heating and water treatment products in China to meet local demand. If a slowdown in the transition to a more consumer driven economy or the rate urbanization was to stall, it could
adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

•

Sales growth of our Lochinvar-branded products could stall resulting in lower than expected revenues and earnings

The compound annual growth rate of revenues of our Lochinvar-branded products has been approximately ten percent per year since our acquisition of Lochinvar,
largely due to the transition in the boiler industry in the U.S. from lower efficiency, non-condensing boilers to higher efficiency, condensing boilers as well as new product introductions. In 2003, approximately five percent of the boilers sold in
the U.S. were condensing boilers and by 2013, the percentage had grown to approximately 40 percent. Our Lochinvar brand is a leader in residential and commercial condensing boilers. We expect the transition to continue, which we believe would result
in approximately ten percent sales growth in Lochinvar-branded products in 2016 and annually for the foreseeable future after 2016 in conjunction with new product introductions. If the transition to higher efficiency, condensing boilers stalls as a
result of lower energy costs, another recession occurs, or our competitors’ technologies surpass our technology, our growth rate could be lower than expected.

•

A material loss, cancellation, reduction, or delay in purchases by one or more of our largest customers could harm our business

Net sales to our five largest customers represented approximately 38 percent of our sales in 2015. We expect that our customer concentration will continue for
the foreseeable future. Our concentration of sales to a relatively small number of customers makes our relationship with each of these customers important to our business. We cannot assure that we will be able to retain our largest customers. Some
of our customers may shift their purchases to our competitors in the future. The loss of one or more of our largest customers, any material reduction or delay in sales to these customers, our inability to successfully develop relationships with
additional customers, or our inability to execute on pricing actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

•

A portion of our business could be adversely affected by a decline in new residential and commercial construction or a decline in replacement related volume

The recovery in residential and commercial construction activity in North America remains fragile and construction could decline again after showing
improvements in 2015. We believe that the majority of the market we serve is for replacement of existing products and replacement related volume growth was strong in 2013 and 2014 before declining in 2015. Changes in replacement volume and in the
construction market could negatively affect us.



•

A failure in our implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system could disrupt our business

We depend on information technology to record and process customers’ orders, manufacture and ship products in a timely manner, and maintain the financial
accuracy of our business records. We are in the midst of implementing a global enterprise resource planning system that is core to our efforts to redesign and deploy new processes and migrate to a common information system across our plants over a
period of several years. There is no certainty that this system will deliver the expected benefits. Implementation may impact our ability to process transactions accurately and efficiently, which could increase costs and thereby impact profitability
or otherwise impact our business. In addition, the failure to either deliver the application on time, or anticipate the necessary readiness and training needs, could lead to business disruption and loss of customers and revenue and profit.

•

We increasingly sell our products and operate outside the U.S., which may present additional risks to our business

Approximately 40 percent of our net sales in 2015 were attributable to products sold outside of the U.S., primarily in China and Canada and to a lesser extent
in Europe and India. Approximately 8,100 of our 13,400 employees as of December 31, 2015 were located in China. At December 31, 2015, approximately $458 million of our cash and marketable securities balances were located in China.
International operations generally are subject to various risks, including political, religious, and economic instability, local labor market conditions, the imposition of foreign tariffs and other trade restrictions, the impact of foreign
government regulations, the effects of income taxes, governmental expropriation, the imposition or increases in withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries, labor relations problems, the imposition of
environmental or employment laws, or other restrictions by foreign governments and differences in business practices. Unfavorable changes in the political, regulatory, and business climate could have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows or our ability to repatriate funds to the U.S. As of December 31, 2015, approximately $645 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries. We
would incur a cost to repatriate these funds to the U.S. and have recorded a liability of approximately $48 million associated with the repatriation of a portion of those funds.

•

Because we participate in markets that are highly competitive, our revenues and earnings could decline as we respond to competition

We sell all of our products in highly competitive markets. We compete in each of our targeted markets based on product design, reliability, quality of products
and services, advanced technologies, product performance, maintenance costs and price. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, research and development and distribution resources than we have, and some are
increasingly expanding beyond their existing manufacturing or geographic footprints. Consumer purchasing behavior may shift to distribution channels, including e-commerce, which is a rapidly developing area. Development of a successful

e-commerce

strategy involves significant time, investment and resources. We cannot assure that our products and services will continue to compete successfully with those of our competitors or that we will be able to
retain our customer base or improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers, all of which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

•

Our international operations are subject to risks related to foreign currencies

We have
significant operations outside of the U.S., primarily in China and Canada and to a lesser extent Europe and India, and therefore, hold assets, incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
The financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars in our consolidated financial statements. As a result, we are subject to risks associated with operating in foreign countries, including fluctuations in currency
exchange rates and interest rates, or hyperinflation in some foreign countries. Furthermore, typically our products are priced in foreign countries in local currencies. As a result, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the local
currencies of our foreign markets has had and would continue to have a negative effect on our profitability. In addition to currency translation risks, we incur a currency transaction risk whenever one of our subsidiaries enters into either a
purchase or sale transaction using a currency different from the operating subsidiaries’ functional currency. The majority of our foreign currency transaction risk is a result of our Canadian water heater operations. These risks may hurt our
reported sales and profits in the future or negatively impact revenues and earnings translated from foreign currencies into U.S. dollars.



•

If we are unable to develop product innovations and improve our technology and expertise, we could lose customers or market share

Our success may depend on our ability to adapt to technological changes in the water heating, boiler and water treatment industries. If we are unable to timely
develop and introduce new products, or enhance existing products, in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements or demands, our competitiveness could be materially and adversely affected. Our ability to develop and successfully
market new products and to develop, acquire, and retain necessary intellectual property rights is essential to our continued success, but cannot reasonably be assured.

•

Changes in regulations or standards could adversely affect our business

Our products are subject
to a wide variety of statutory, regulatory and industry standards and requirements related to, among other items, energy efficiency, environmental emissions, labeling and safety. While we believe our products are currently efficient, safe and
environment-friendly, a significant change to regulatory requirements, whether federal, foreign, state or local, or to industry standards, could substantially increase manufacturing costs, impact the size and timing of demand for our products, or
put us at a competitive disadvantage, any of which could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

•

Our business may be adversely impacted by product defects

Product defects can occur through our
own product development, design and manufacturing processes or through our reliance on third parties for component design and manufacturing activities. We may incur various expenses related to product defects, including product warranty costs,
product liability and recall or retrofit costs. While we maintain a reserve for product warranty costs based on certain estimates and our knowledge of current events and actions, our actual warranty costs may exceed our reserve, resulting in current
period expenses and a need to increase our reserves for warranty charges. In addition, product defects and recalls may diminish the reputation of our brand. Further, our inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product
line or the temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market. Any of these events may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

•

Acquisitions have contributed to our financial results and we may not be able to identify or complete future acquisitions, which could adversely affect our future growth

Acquisitions we have made have positively impacted our results of operations. While we will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions and intend to use a
significant portion of our available capital for future acquisitions, we may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions, obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms, utilize cash flows from
operations, obtain regulatory approval for certain acquisitions, or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future. If we complete any future acquisitions, then we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses or operate them
profitably or accomplish our strategic objectives for those acquisitions. If we complete any future acquisitions in new geographies, our unfamiliarity with local regulations and market customs may impact our ability to operate them profitably or
achieve our strategic objectives for those acquisitions. Our level of indebtedness may increase in the future if we finance acquisitions with debt, which would cause us to incur additional interest expense and could increase our vulnerability to
general adverse economic and industry conditions and limit our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing. The impact of future acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and
cash flows.

•

Our operations could be adversely impacted by material price volatility and supplier concentration

The market prices for certain raw materials we purchase, primarily steel, have been volatile. Significant increases in the cost of any of the key materials we
purchase could increase our cost of doing business and ultimately could lead to lower operating earnings if we are not able to recover these cost increases through price increases to our customers. Historically, there has been a lag in our ability
to recover increased material costs from customers, and that lag could negatively impact our profitability. In addition, in some cases we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for some of the raw materials and components we require in the
manufacture of our products. A significant disruption or termination of the supply from one of these suppliers could delay sales or increase costs which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and
cash flows.



•

We are subject to regulation of our international operations that could adversely affect our business and results of operations

Due to our global operations, we are subject to many laws governing international relations, including those that prohibit improper payments to government
officials and restrict where we can do business, what information or products we can supply to certain countries and what information we can provide to a non-U.S. government, including but not limited to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the
U.S. Export Administration Act. Violations of these laws may result in criminal penalties or sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

•

Our results of operations may be negatively impacted by product liability lawsuits and claims

Our water heating and boiler products expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture, sale and use of our
products. While we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance, we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms, that this insurance will provide adequate protection against
potential liabilities or that our insurance providers will be able to ultimately pay all insured losses. In addition, we self-insure a portion of product liability claims. A series of successful claims against us could materially and adversely
affect our reputation and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

•

Retention of key personnel is important to our business

Attracting and retaining talented
employees is important to the continued success of our business. Failure to retain key personnel, particularly on the leadership team, would have a material effect on our business and our ability to execute our business strategies in a timely and
effective manner.

•

An inability to adequately maintain our information systems and their security, as well as to protect data and other confidential information, could adversely affect our business and reputation

In the ordinary course of business, we collect and store sensitive data and information, including our proprietary and regulated business information and that
of our customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information about our employees. Our information systems, like those of other companies, are susceptible to outages due to natural disasters, power loss,
telecommunications failures, viruses, break-ins and similar events, or breaches of security. We continue to take steps to maintain and improve data security and address these risks and uncertainties by implementing security technologies, internal
controls, network and data center resiliency and recovery processes. However, any operations failure or breach of security from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats could lead to the loss or disclosure of both our and our customers’
financial, product and other confidential information and could result in regulatory actions and have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation.

•

Our underfunded pension plans require future pension contributions which could limit our flexibility in managing our company

Due to the significant negative investment returns in 2008, flat returns in 2015 and falling interest rates in recent years, the projected benefit obligations
of our defined benefit pension plans exceeded the fair value of the plan assets by approximately $134 million at December 31, 2015. U.S. employees hired after January 1, 2010 have not participated in our defined benefit plan, and benefit
accruals for the majority of current salaried and hourly employees ended on December 31, 2014. We are forecasting that we will not be required to make a contribution to the plan in 2016, and we do not plan to make any voluntary contributions.
However, we cannot provide any assurance that contributions will not be required in the future. Among the key assumptions inherent in our actuarially calculated pension plan obligation and pension plan expense are the discount rate and the expected
rate of return on plan assets. If interest rates and actual rates of return on invested plan assets were to decrease significantly, our pension plan obligations could increase materially. The size of future required pension contributions could
result in us dedicating a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to making the contributions which could negatively impact our flexibility in managing the company.

•

We have significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and an impairment of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets could cause a decline in our net worth

Our total assets include significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Our goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess of
the purchase prices we paid over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets we acquired.



We assess whether there has been impairments in the value of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each calendar year or sooner if triggering events
warrant. If future operating performance at our businesses does not meet expectations, we may be required to reflect non-cash charges to operating results for goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments. The recognition of an
impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material. A significant reduction in our
stockholders’ equity due to an impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets may affect our ability to maintain the debt-to-capital ratio required under our existing debt arrangements. We have identified the valuation of goodwill
and indefinite-lived intangible assets as a critical accounting policy. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies—Goodwill and Indefinite-lived
Intangible Assets” included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Certain members of the founding family of our company and trusts for their benefit have the ability to influence all matters requiring stockholder approval

We have two classes of common equity: our Common Stock and our Class A Common Stock. The holders of Common Stock currently are entitled, as a class, to
elect only one-third of our board of directors. The holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled, as a class, to elect the remaining directors. Certain members of the founding family of our company and trusts for their benefit (Smith Family)
have entered into a voting trust agreement with respect to shares of our Class A Common Stock and shares of our Common Stock they own. As of December 31, 2015, these members of the Smith Family own approximately 61.0 percent of the total
voting power of our outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and Common Stock, taken together as a single class, and approximately 95.6 percent of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our Class A Common Stock, as a separate
class. Due to the differences in the voting rights between shares of our Common Stock and shares of our Class A Common Stock, the Smith Family is in a position to control to a large extent the outcome of matters requiring a stockholder vote,
including the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or approval of transactions involving a change of control. This ownership position may increase if other members of the Smith Family enter into the voting trust
agreement, and the voting power relating to this ownership position may increase if shares of our Class A Common Stock held by stockholders who are not parties to the voting trust agreement are converted into shares of our Common Stock. The
voting trust agreement provides that, in the event one of the parties to the voting trust agreement wants to withdraw from the trust or transfer any of its shares of our Class A Common Stock, such shares of our Class A Common Stock are
automatically exchanged for shares of our Common Stock held by the trust to the extent available in the trust. In addition, the trust will have the right to purchase the shares of our Class A Common Stock and our Common Stock proposed to be
withdrawn or transferred from the trust. As a result, the Smith Family members that are parties to the voting trust agreement have the ability to maintain their collective voting rights in our company even if certain members of the Smith Family
decide to transfer their shares.



ITEM 1B - UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

None.

ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES

Properties utilized by us at December 31, 2015 were as follows:

North America

In this segment we have 12
manufacturing plants located in five states and two non-U.S. countries, of which ten are owned directly by us or our subsidiaries and two are leased from outside parties. The terms of leases in effect at December 31, 2015 expire between 2016
and 2025.

Rest of World

In this segment we
have six manufacturing plants located in four non-U.S. countries, of which three are owned directly by us or our subsidiaries and three are leased from outside parties. Initial lease terms generally provide for minimum terms of one to six years and
have one or more renewal options. The terms of leases in effect at December 31, 2015 expire between 2016 and 2020.

Corporate and General

We consider our plants and other physical properties to be suitable, adequate, and of sufficient productive capacity to meet the requirements of
our business. The manufacturing plants operate at varying levels of utilization depending on the type of operation and market conditions. The executive offices of the company, which are leased, are located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

ITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are involved in various unresolved legal actions, administrative proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business involving product liability,
property damage, insurance coverage, exposure to asbestos and other substances, patents and environmental matters, including the disposal of hazardous waste. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal
actions or the range of possible loss or recovery, we believe, based on past experience, adequate reserves and insurance availability, that these unresolved legal actions will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of
operations. A more detailed discussion of certain of these matters appears in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

ITEM 4 – MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES

Not applicable.

Stock Repurchases. In 2013, our Board of Directors approved adding 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock to an existing discretionary share repurchase authority. In 2014, our board of directors authorized the purchase of an
additional 3,500,000 shares of our Common Stock. In 2015, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of an additional 2,000,000 shares of our Common Stock. Under the share repurchase program, our Common Stock may be purchased through a
combination of Rule 10b5-1 automatic trading plan and discretionary purchases in accordance with applicable securities laws. The number of shares purchased and the timing of the purchase will depend on a number of factors, including share price,
trading volume and general market conditions, as well as on working capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors, including alternative investment opportunities. The stock repurchase authorization remains effective until
terminated by our Board of Directors which may occur at any time, subject to the parameters of any Rule 10b5-1 automatic trading plan that we may then have in effect. In 2015, we repurchased 1,908,237 shares at an average price of $67.14 per share
and at a total cost of $128.1 million. As of December 31, 2015, there were 2,589,756 shares remaining on the existing repurchase authorization.

ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

Our company
is comprised of two reporting segments: North America and Rest of World. Our Rest of World segment is primarily comprised of China, Europe and India. Both segments manufacture and market comprehensive lines of residential and commercial gas, gas
tankless and electric water heaters. Both segments primarily manufacture and market in their respective region of the world. Our North America segment also manufactures and globally markets specialty commercial water heating equipment, condensing
and non-condensing boilers and water systems tanks. Primarily for Asia, our Rest of World segment also manufactures and markets water treatment products. We also market in-home air purification products in China.

In 2015, our North America segment sales were $1,703.0 million and our Rest of World segment sales were $866.1 million. Sales of our products in China grew
significantly in 2015, increasing 13.7 percent over 2014. Excluding the impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar, sales in China increased 16.1 percent in 2015. We expect sales in 2016 in China to grow at a rate of approximately 15 percent in local
currency, as we believe overall water heater market growth, geographic expansion, market share gains, growth in water treatment products and air purification products and improved product mix will contribute to our growth. Price increases for
residential and commercial water heaters and higher volumes of commercial water heaters and condensing commercial boilers contributed to 2015 sales increases in our North America segment. Partially offsetting these factors was a decline in
residential water heater volumes in the U.S. The 13 percent decline in the value of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar during 2015 also negatively impacted sales. We expect North America residential and commercial water heater industry unit
to show modest growth in 2016. Lochinvar-branded products contributed $296.0 million to our net sales in 2015, and we expect ten percent sales growth of Lochinvar-branded products in 2016, driven by the U.S. industry transition to higher efficiency
products and our introduction of new products; particularly condensing boilers. Approximately 40 percent of Lochinvar-branded product sales consist of residential and commercial water heaters while the remaining 60 percent of Lochinvar-branded
product sales consist primarily of boilers and related parts.

Our stated acquisition strategy includes a number of our water-related strategic
initiatives. We will look to continue to grow our core residential and commercial water heating, boiler and water treatment businesses throughout the world. We will also continue to look for opportunities to add to our existing operations in the
high growth regions of China and India demonstrated by our introduction of air purification products in China in 2015.

Consistent with our stated
strategy to expand our core product offering, we acquired Lochinvar in 2011. Lochinvar, one of the leading manufacturers of residential and commercial boilers in the U.S., fit squarely within our stated strategic growth initiative to expand our core
water heating business. In 2013, approximately 40 percent of boilers sold in the U.S. were condensing boilers, compared with five percent in 2003. Our Lochinvar brand is a leading brand of higher efficiency, condensing boilers. We expect the
transition in the U.S. to higher efficiency boilers will continue into the foreseeable future.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Our sales in 2015 were a record $2,536.5 million surpassing 2014 sales of $2,356.0 million by 7.7 percent. Excluding the impact from the strengthening U.S.
dollar against the Canadian and Chinese currencies, our sales grew over nine percent in 2015. The increase in sales was due to higher prices in North America, higher sales of Lochinvar-branded products and commercial water heaters in the U.S., as
well as continued demand for our water heating and water treatment products in China. Sales in China grew 13.7 percent in 2015. Excluding the impact from the stronger U.S. dollar, China sales increased 16.1 percent in 2015. Our sales in 2014 were
higher than 2013 sales of $2,153.8 million by 9.4 percent. The increase in 2014 in sales was attributable to higher volumes of water heaters and boilers in the U.S. and higher sales of water heaters and water treatment products in China. Sales of
water heaters and water treatment products in China grew 18.4 percent to $694.0 million in 2014 compared to 2013.

Our gross profit margin in 2015
increased to 39.8 percent from 36.5 percent in 2014. The higher margin in 2015 was due to price increases in the U.S. and Canada, higher U.S. sales of commercial boilers and commercial water heaters which have higher margins, lower steel costs and a
reduction in pension-related costs. Our gross profit margin in 2014 increased slightly from 35.9 percent in 2013, primarily due to higher volumes of water heaters and boilers in the U.S., partially offset by higher material costs in the U.S., as
well as higher volumes of water heaters and water treatment products in the China.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $38.6
million higher in 2015 than in 2014. The increase in SG&A expenses in 2015 to $610.7 million was primarily due to higher selling and engineering costs in support of increased volumes in China as well as higher costs associated with the 2015
launch of air purification products in China which more than offset



lower pension costs in the U.S. SG&A expenses were $47.6 million higher in 2014 than in 2013 primarily due to higher selling and advertising costs in support of increased volumes in North
America and China and approximately $9 million of incremental enterprise resource planning system (ERP) implementation costs.

On March 28, 2013, our
Board of Directors approved a plan to transfer residential water heater production from our Fergus, Ontario plant to our other North American facilities. The majority of our production was consolidated in the second quarter of 2013. As a result of
the capacity rationalization, we incurred pre-tax restructuring and impairment expenses of $22.0 million in 2013 related to employee severance costs, impairments of assets and equipment relocation costs. In addition, included in operating earnings
in 2013 is a pre-tax gain of $11.0 million resulting from a settlement with a former supplier related to previous overcharges and warranty costs.

Pension
expense in 2015 was $0.1 million compared to $28.6 million in 2014 and $27.9 million in 2013. The significant decrease in pension expense in 2015 compared to prior years was due to the sunset of our pension plan for the majority of our employees on
December 31, 2014. In 2015, we began making additional Company contributions to a defined contribution plan in lieu of benefits earned in our pension plan.

Interest expense was $7.4 million in 2015 compared to $5.7 million in 2014. Interest expense in 2013 was also $5.7 million. The higher interest expense in
2015 was primarily related to interest rates on term notes in the amount of $75 million issued in January 2015 that were higher than the interest rate on the revolving credit facility that it replaced as well as higher overall debt levels related to
share repurchases.

Other income was $10.8 million in 2015 compared to $5.2 million in 2014 and $3.8 million in 2013. The increases in other income in
2015 and 2014 were primarily due to higher interest income compared to the preceding year.

Our effective tax rate was 29.7 percent in 2015, compared with
27.5 percent in 2014 and 28.2 percent in 2013. The higher effective tax rate in 2015 was primarily due to a change in geographic earnings mix as compared to the prior year.

North America

Our North America segment sales
were $1,703.0 million in 2015 or $81.3 million higher than sales of $1,621.7 million in 2014. The sales increase in 2015 resulted from higher prices in the U.S. and Canada and higher volumes of commercial water heaters and condensing commercial
boilers in the U.S., partially offset by lower residential volumes in the U.S. and an unfavorable currency impact in Canada. Sales in 2014 were $101.7 million higher than sales of $1,520.0 million in 2013. The sales increase in 2014 was primarily
due to higher volumes of water heaters and boilers in the U.S., which were partially offset by lower water heaters sales in Canada, primarily due to a decline in the value of the Canadian dollar of approximately seven percent versus the U.S. dollar.

North America operating earnings were $339.9 million in 2015 compared to operating earnings of $238.7 million and $211.9 million in 2014 and 2013,
respectively. Operating margins were 20.0 percent, 14.7 percent and 13.9 percent in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The significantly higher operating earnings and operating margin in 2015 were primarily due to higher prices in the U.S. and
Canada, higher sales of Lochinvar-branded products and commercial water heaters in the U.S., lower steel costs and lower pension costs which more than offset lower residential water heater volumes in the U.S. Higher operating earnings in 2014
compared to 2013 were primarily due to higher volumes in the U.S. which were partially offset by higher material costs and approximately $9 million of incremental ERP implementation costs.

Rest of World

Sales in our Rest of World segment
in 2015 were $866.1 million or $97.8 million higher than sales of $768.3 million in 2014. Sales in China increased approximately $95 million due to higher demand for water heaters, approximately $35 million of incremental sales of water treatment
products and approximately $9 million in sales of our newly launched in-home air purification products. Sales in China grew 13.7 percent in 2015. Excluding the impact from the stronger U.S. dollar, China sales increased 16.1 percent in 2015. Sales
for our Rest of World segment in 2014 were $100.3 million higher than sales of $668.0 million in 2013 due to an 18.4 percent increase in sales in China, driven by increased demand for water heaters and water treatment products and a higher priced
product mix that was partially offset by lower sales in India resulting from weakness in the housing market and the termination of a co-branding relationship with our largest distributor.

Rest of World operating earnings were $113.0 million in 2015 compared to operating earnings of $106.7 million and $88.0 million in 2014 and 2013,
respectively. Segment operating margins were 13.0 percent in 2015 as compared to 13.9 percent and 13.2 percent in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Higher operating earnings in 2015 were primarily due to higher sales in China and lower steel costs that
were partially offset by lower sales of highly profitable commercial water heaters in China, increased SG&A expenses and approximately $1.5 million of higher losses in India as compared to 2014. China earnings were reduced by approximately $2.5
million due to currency translation. Higher selling and engineering costs in China as well as higher



SG&A costs associated with the 2015 launch of air purification products were the primary drivers for the decreased operating margin in 2015 as compared to 2014. Higher operating earnings and
margins in 2014 as compared to 2013 were due to higher sales of water heaters and water treatment products in China as well as a higher priced product mix as a result of product introductions with higher value features which was partially offset by
larger losses in India. Losses in India were $7.5 million in 2014, including approximately $1 million of product development and advertising expenses in advance of our 2015 launch of water treatment products.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our working capital was
$802.1 million at December 31, 2015 compared with $713.8 million and $614.7 million at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. Cash generated in China and sales-related increases in accounts receivable and inventory
levels explain the majority of the increase in both 2015 and 2014. As of December 31, 2015, essentially all of the $645.2 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries. We would incur a cost
to repatriate these funds to the U.S. and have an accrual of $47.9 million for the repatriation of a portion of these funds.

Cash provided by operating
activities during 2015 was $344.4 million compared with $263.9 million during 2014 and $279.6 million during 2013. The improvement in cash flows in 2015 was primarily due to higher earnings from operations and lower outlays for working capital
driven primarily by increases in accounts payable balances in China. Higher earnings in 2014 were more than offset by higher outlays for working capital. We expect cash provided by operating activities in 2016 to be approximately $320 million.

Our capital expenditures were $72.7 million in 2015, $86.1 million in 2014 and $97.7 million in 2013. Included in 2015 capital expenditures were approximately
$16 million related to our ERP implementation and approximately $19 million related to capacity expansion in China and the U.S. to support growth. Included in 2014 capital expenditures was approximately $31 million related to our ERP implementation.
Included in 2013 capital expenditures was approximately $45 million in China and India for the construction of a second water heater manufacturing plant in Nanjing, China and to continue the expansion of our manufacturing plant near Bangalore,
India. Also included in 2013 capital expenditures was approximately $19 million related to the ERP implementation. We project 2016 capital expenditures will be between $120 and $130 million and depreciation and amortization expense in 2016 will be
approximately $70 million. We expect capital spending in 2016 to include approximately $8 million related to our ERP implementation and approximately $40 million related to the initial phase of a new water treatment manufacturing facility in China
as we will outgrow capacity in a leased facility in the next few years.

In December 2012, we completed a $400 million multi-currency five year revolving
credit facility with a group of eight banks. The facility has an accordion provision which allows it to be increased up to $500 million if certain conditions (including lender approval) are satisfied. Borrowing rates under the facility are
determined by our leverage ratio. The facility requires us to maintain two financial covenants, a leverage ratio test and an interest coverage test, and we were in compliance with the covenants as of December 31, 2015. The facility backs up
commercial paper and credit line borrowings, and it expires on December 12, 2017. As a result of the long-term nature of this facility, the commercial paper and credit line borrowings, as well as drawings under the facility are classified as
long-term debt.

At December 31, 2015, we had available borrowing capacity of $253.0 million under this facility. We believe that the combination of
cash, available borrowing capacity and operating cash flow will provide sufficient funds to finance our existing operations for the foreseeable future.

In January 2015, we issued $75 million of fixed rate term notes to an insurance company. Principal payments commence in 2020 and the notes mature in 2030. The
notes have an interest rate of 3.52 percent. We used proceeds of the notes to pay down borrowings under our revolving credit facility.

Our total debt
increased to $249.0 million at December 31, 2015 compared with $223.8 million at December 31, 2014, as our cash flows generated in the U.S were more than offset by our share repurchase activity. As a result, our leverage, as measured by
the ratio of total debt to total capitalization, was 14.7 percent at the end of 2015 compared with 13.9 percent at the end of 2014.

Our U.S. pension plan
continues to meet all funding requirements under ERISA regulations. We were not required to make a contribution to our pension plan in 2015 and we did not make any voluntary contributions. We forecast that we will not be required to make a
contribution to the plan in 2016 and we do not plan to make any voluntary contributions in 2016. For further information on our pension plans, see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

During 2015, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of an additional 2,000,000 shares of our Common Stock. In 2015, we repurchased 1,908,237 shares at
an average price of $67.14 per share and a total cost of $128.1 million. At December 31,



2015, a total of 2,589,756 shares remained on the existing repurchase authorization. Depending on factors such as stock price, working capital requirements and alternative investment
opportunities, we expect to spend approximately $150 million on stock repurchase activity in 2016.

We have paid dividends for 76 consecutive years with
payments increasing each of the last 24 years. We paid total dividends of $0.76 per share in 2015 compared with $0.60 per share in 2014. In January 2016, we increased our dividend by 26 percent and anticipate paying total dividends of $0.96 per
share in 2016.

As of December 31, 2015, our liability for uncertain income tax positions was $2.6 million. Due to the high degree of
uncertainty regarding timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid.

We utilize blanket purchase orders to communicate expected annual requirements to many of our suppliers. Requirements under blanket purchase orders generally
do not become committed until several weeks prior to our scheduled unit production. The purchase obligation amount presented above represents the value of commitments that we consider firm.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2015, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 740,

Income Taxes

(issued under Accounting Standards No. (ASN) 2015-17). This amendment requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified
as noncurrent in the statement of financial position. The amendment is effective for periods beginning January 1, 2016 and allows for either prospective adoption or retrospective adoption. We expect the adoption of amended ASC 740 to impact the
classification of deferred taxes on our consolidated balance sheet.

In April 2015, the FASB amended ASC 835-30,

Interest - Imputation of Interest

(issued under ASN 2015-03). This amendment to ASC 835-30 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability,
consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs is not affected by this amendment. The amendment is effective for periods beginning January 1, 2016 and requires using a retrospective approach. We
do not expect the adoption of amended ASC 835-30 to have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASC 606-10,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

(issued under ASN 2014-09). ASC 606-10 will replace all existing revenue recognition guidance when effective. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one year deferral of the effective date, with application
permitted as of the original effective date, or periods beginning January 1, 2017. Either full retrospective adoption or modified retrospective adoption is allowed under ASC 606-10. We are in the process of determining whether the adoption of
ASC 606-10 will have an impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our accounting policies are described in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Also as disclosed in Note 1, the preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires the use of estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be
material to the financial statements.



The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include
estimates associated with the evaluation of the impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, as well as significant estimates used in the determination of liabilities related to warranty activity, product liability and pensions.
Various assumptions and other factors underlie the determination of these significant estimates. The process of determining significant estimates is fact-specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience and trends, and in some
cases, actuarial techniques. We monitor these significant factors and adjustments are made as facts and circumstances dictate. Historically, actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using the estimates described above.

Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets

In
conformity with U.S. GAAP, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. We perform impairment reviews for our
reporting units using a fair-value method based on management’s judgments and assumptions. The fair value represents the estimated amount at which a reporting unit could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties on an
arm’s-length basis. The estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including recorded goodwill. We are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
assets become impaired. Any impairment review is, by its nature, highly judgmental as estimates of future sales, earnings and cash flows are utilized to determine fair values. However, we believe that we conduct annual thorough and competent
valuations of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and that there has been no impairment in goodwill or indefinite-lived assets in 2015.

Product warranty

Our products carry warranties that
generally range from one to ten years and are based on terms that are generally accepted in the market. We provide for the estimated cost of product warranty at the time of sale. The product warranty provision is estimated based upon warranty loss
experience using actual historical failure rates and estimated costs of product replacement. The variables used in the calculation of the provision are reviewed on a periodic basis. At times, warranty issues may arise which are beyond the scope of
our historical experience. We provide for any such warranty issues as they become known and estimable. While our warranty costs have historically been within calculated estimates, it is possible that future warranty costs could differ significantly
from those estimates. The allocation of the warranty liability between current and long-term is based on the expected warranty liability to be paid in the next year as determined by historical product failure rates.

Product liability

Due to the nature of our products, we
are subject to product liability claims in the normal course of business. We maintain insurance to reduce our risk. Most insurance coverage includes self-insured retentions that vary by year. In 2015, we maintained a self-insured retention of $7.5
million per occurrence with an aggregate insurance limit of $125.0 million per occurrence.

We establish product liability reserves for our self-insured
retention portion of any known outstanding matters based on the likelihood of loss and our ability to reasonably estimate such loss. There is inherent uncertainty as to the eventual resolution of unsettled matters due to the unpredictable nature of
litigation. We make estimates based on available information and our best judgment after consultation with appropriate advisors and experts. We periodically revise estimates based upon changes to facts or circumstances. We also use an actuary to
calculate reserves required for estimated incurred but not reported claims as well as to estimate the effect of adverse development of claims over time. At December 31, 2015, our reserve for product liability was $38.7 million.

Pensions

We have significant pension benefit costs that
are developed from actuarial valuations. The valuations reflect key assumptions regarding, among other things, discount rates, expected return on plan assets, retirement ages, and years of service. Consideration is given to current market
conditions, including changes in interest rates in making these assumptions. Our assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 7.75 percent in 2015 and 2014. The discount rate used to determine net periodic pension costs decreased to 4.05
percent in 2015 from 4.85 percent in 2014. For 2016, our expected return on plan assets is 7.50 percent and our discount rate is 4.40 percent.

In
developing our expected return on plan assets, we evaluate our pension plan’s current and target asset allocation, the expected long-term rates of return of equity and bond indices and the actual historical returns of our pension plan. Our
plan’s target allocation to equity managers is approximately 50 percent, with the remainder allocated primarily to bond managers and a small allocation to private equity managers and real estate managers. Our actual asset allocation as of
December 31, 2015,



was 47 percent to equity managers, 39 percent to bond managers, nine percent to real estate managers and five percent to private equity managers. We regularly review our actual asset allocation
and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Our pension plan’s historical ten-year and 25-year compounded annualized returns are 6.1 percent and 9.5 percent, respectively. We believe that
with our target allocation and the expected long-term returns of equity and bond indices as well as our actual historical returns, our 7.50 percent expected return on plan assets for 2016 is reasonable.

The discount rate assumptions used to determine future pension obligations at December 31, 2015 and 2014 were based on the AonHewitt AA Only Above Median
yield curve, which was designed by AonHewitt to provide a means for plan sponsors to value the liabilities of their postretirement benefit plans. The AA Only Above Median yield curve represents a series of annual discount rates from bonds with AA
minimum average rating as rated by Moody’s Investor Service, Standard &Poor’s and Fitch Ratings. We will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions at least annually, and we will adjust the assumptions as necessary.

As of December 31, 2015, we changed the method we used to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic pension benefit cost for our
pension plan and post-retirement benefit plan. The change will result in an approximate $7 million decrease in the service and interest components in 2016.

As a result, we estimate that we will recognize pension income of approximately $7 million in 2016 compared to $0.1 million of pension expense in 2015. We
estimate that costs associated with our replacement retirement plan in 2016 will be approximately $6 million, consistent with 2015. We made changes to our pension plan including closing the plan to new entrants effective January 1, 2010, and
the sunset of our plan for the majority of our employees on December 31, 2014 which significantly decreased pension expense beginning in 2015. Lowering the expected return on plan assets by 25 basis points would increase our net pension expense
for 2015 by approximately $1.8 million. Lowering the discount rate by 25 basis points would decrease our 2015 net pension expense by approximately $0.3 million.

Outlook

Despite volatile conditions in China, we
continue to expect strong, profitable sales growth in China in 2016 at the rate of approximately 15 percent in local currency terms. We continue to experience strong consumer demand for our water heating and water treatment products in China, and
our new air purification products have been well received by Chinese consumers. In the U.S. we expect the transition from non-condensing, lower efficiency boilers to condensing, higher efficiency boilers to continue in 2016, which combined with new
products, should allow sales growth of Lochinvar-branded products to continue at ten percent. We expect modest growth in commercial and residential water heater volumes in North America driven by modest assumptions for new construction and steady
replacement demand. Other income is expected to be approximately $5 million lower in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to expected lower interest rates than last year on cash deposits in China. We anticipate ERP implementation related costs
will be approximately $9 million higher or approximately $25 million in 2016 due to the increase in the number of scheduled go-live events in 2016. We also expect our effective tax rate to be between 30.5 percent and 31 percent due to a change in
geographic earnings mix.

Combining all these factors, we expect sales growth of between nine and ten percent in local currency terms and between seven
and eight percent in U.S. dollars in 2016 and earnings to be in the range of $3.40 to $3.55 per share for 2016.

OTHER MATTERS

Environmental

Our operations are governed by a number of
federal, foreign, state, local and environmental laws concerning the generation and management of hazardous materials, the discharge of pollutants into the environment and remediation of sites owned by the company or third parties. We have expended
financial and managerial resources complying with such laws. Expenditures related to environmental matters were not material in 2015 and we do not expect them to be material in any single year. We have reserves associated with environmental
obligations at various facilities and we believe these reserves are sufficient to cover reasonably anticipated remediation costs. Although we believe that our operations are substantially in compliance with such laws and maintain procedures designed
to maintain compliance, there are no assurances that substantial additional costs for compliance will not be incurred in the future. However, since the same laws govern our competitors, we should not be placed at a competitive disadvantage.



Market Risk

We are exposed to various types of market risks, primarily currency. We monitor our risks in such areas on a continuous basis and generally enter into forward
contracts to minimize such exposures for periods of less than one year. We do not engage in speculation in our derivatives strategies. Further discussion regarding derivative instruments is contained in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies. At December 31, 2015, we had
net foreign currency contracts outstanding of $79.8 million. Assuming a hypothetical ten percent movement in the respective currencies, the potential foreign exchange gain or loss associated with the change in rates would amount to $8.0 million.
Gains and losses from our forward contract activities will be offset by gains and losses in the underlying transactions being hedged.

Our earnings
exposure related to movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating-rate debt instruments that are determined by short-term money market rates. At December 31, 2015, we had $147.0 million in outstanding floating-rate
debt with a weighted-average interest rate of 1.3 percent at year end. A hypothetical ten percent annual increase or decrease in the year-end average cost of our outstanding floating-rate debt would result in a change in annual pre-tax interest
expense of approximately $0.2 million.

Forward-Looking Statements

This filing contains statements that the company believes are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of words such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “believe,”

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Organization and Significant Accounting Policies

Organization.

A. O. Smith Corporation (A. O. Smith or the Company) is comprised of two reporting segments: North America and Rest of
World. The Rest of World segment is primarily comprised of China, Europe and India. Both segments manufacture and market comprehensive lines of residential and commercial gas, gas tankless and electric water heaters. Both segments primarily
manufacture and market in their respective regions of the world. The North America segment also manufactures and globally markets specialty commercial water heating equipment, condensing and non-condensing boilers and water system tanks. Primarily
for Asia, the Rest of World segment also manufactures and markets water treatment products. The Company also markets in-home air purification products in China.

Consolidation.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries after elimination of
intercompany transactions.

Except when otherwise indicated, amounts reflected in the financial statements or the notes thereto relate to the
Company’s continuing operations.

Use of estimates

. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States (U.S.) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair value of financial instruments.

The carrying amounts of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, receivables, floating rate debt and trade
payables approximated fair value as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, due to the short maturities or frequent rate resets of these instruments. The fair value of term notes with insurance companies was approximately $104.4 million as of
December 31, 2015 compared with the carrying amount of $102.0 million for the same date. The fair value of term notes with insurance companies was approximately $45.5 million as of December 31, 2014 compared with the carrying amount of
$43.3 million for the same date. The fair value is estimated based on current rates offered for debt with similar maturities.

Foreign currency
translation.

For all subsidiaries outside the U.S., with the exception of its Mexican operation and its Dutch non-operating companies, the Company uses the local currency as the functional currency. For those operations using a functional
currency other than the U.S. dollar, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at weighted-average exchange rates. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded
as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. The Mexican operation and the Dutch non-operating companies use the U.S. dollar as the functional currency. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in net earnings and
were not significant in 2015, 2014 or 2013.

Cash and cash equivalents

. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of
three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.

Marketable securities

. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with
maturities greater than 90 days when purchased to be marketable securities. At December 31, 2015, the Company’s marketable securities consisted of bank time deposits with original maturities ranging from 180 days to 12 months and are
primarily located at investment grade rated banks in China.

Inventory valuation.

Inventories are carried at lower of cost or market. Cost is
determined on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for a majority of the Company’s domestic inventories, which comprise 66 percent and 63 percent of the Company’s total inventory at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Inventories of foreign subsidiaries, the remaining domestic inventories and supplies are determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.

Property, plant and equipment.

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed primarily by the straight-line method. The
estimated service lives used to compute depreciation are generally 25 to 50 years for buildings, three to 20 years for equipment and three to 15 years for software. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred.



1.

Organization and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Goodwill and other intangibles.

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but
are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis. Separable intangible assets, primarily comprised of customer relationships, that are not deemed to have an indefinite life are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives which
range from ten to 25 years.

Impairment of long-lived and amortizable intangible assets.

Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the
related asset or group of assets, a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the asset or group of assets. Such analyses necessarily involve significant judgment.

Product warranties.

The Company’s products carry warranties that generally range from one to ten years and are based on terms that are consistent
with the market. The Company records a liability for the expected cost of warranty-related claims at the time of sale. The allocation of the warranty liability between current and long-term is based on expected warranty claims to be paid in the next
year as determined by historical product failure rates.

The following table presents the Company’s product warranty liability activity in 2015 and
2014:

Derivative instruments.

The Company utilizes certain derivative instruments to enhance its ability to manage currency
as well as raw materials price risk. The Company does not enter into contracts for speculative purposes. The fair values of all derivatives are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets. The change in a derivative’s fair value is recorded
each period in current earnings or accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCI), depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and if so, the type of hedge transaction. See Note 12, “Derivative
Instruments” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for disclosure of the Company’s derivative instruments and hedging activities.

Fair Value Measurements.

Accounting Standard Codification

(

ASC) 820

Fair Value Measurements

, among other things, defines fair value,
establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value on either a recurring basis or nonrecurring basis. ASC 820 clarifies that fair value is an exit
price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on
assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, ASC 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as
follows: (Level 1) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level 2) inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and (Level 3) unobservable inputs in which there is
little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are based on
the market approach which are prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.

Assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis are as follows (dollars in millions):

1.

Organization and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Revenue recognition.

The Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of title, which occurs upon shipment
of the product to the customer except for certain export sales where transfer of title occurs when the product reaches the customer destination.

Contracts and customer purchase orders are used to determine the existence of a sales arrangement. Shipping documents are used to verify shipment. The Company
assesses whether the selling price is fixed or determinable based upon the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. The Company assesses collectability based on the
creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer’s payment history. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $6.0 million and $3.7 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Reserves for customer returns for defective product are based on historical experience with similar types of sales. Accruals for rebates and incentives
are based on pricing agreements and are tied to sales volume. Changes in such accruals may be required if future returns differ from historical experience or if actual sales volume differs from estimated sales volume. Rebates and incentives are
recognized as a reduction of sales.

Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in net sales and the related costs are included in cost
of products sold.

Advertising.

The majority of advertising costs are charged to operations as incurred and amounted to $102.2 million, $94.0
million and $78.0 million during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Included in total advertising costs are expenses associated with store displays for water heater and water treatment products in China that are amortized over 12 to 24 months which
totaled $27.4 million, $22.6 million and $17.9 million during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Research and development.

Research and
development costs are charged to operations as incurred and amounted to $73.7 million, $67.9 million and $57.8 million during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Environmental costs.

The Company accrues for costs associated with environmental obligations when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable.
Costs of estimated future expenditures are not discounted to their present value. Recoveries of environmental costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is considered probable. The accruals are adjusted as facts and
circumstances change.

Stock-based compensation.

The Company follows ASC 718

Compensation - Stock Compensation

. Compensation cost is
recognized using the straight-line method over the vesting period of the award. ASC 718 also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow. Excess tax deductions of $10.4
million, $2.4 million and $4.8 million were recognized as cash flows provided by financing activities in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Income
taxes.

The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, in accordance with ASC 740

Income Taxes

, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of
temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to
taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.

The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by
the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being
realized upon settlement.



1.

Organization and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Earnings per share of common stock.

The Company is not required to use the two-class method of
calculating earnings per share since its Class A Common Stock and Common Stock have equal dividend rights. The numerator for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is net earnings. The following table sets forth the computation
of basic and diluted weighted-average shares used in the earnings per share calculations:

On April 15, 2013, the Company’s stockholders approved a proposal to increase the Company’s authorized shares
of Common Stock and the Company’s Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock split of the Company’s Class A Common Stock and Common Stock (including treasury shares) in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend to stockholders of
record on April 30, 2013 and payable on May 15, 2013. All references in the financial statements and footnotes to the number of shares outstanding, price per share, per share amounts and stock based compensation data have been recast to
reflect the split for all periods presented.

Reclassifications.

Certain amounts from prior years have been reclassified to conform with current
year presentation.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 740,

Income Taxes

(issued under
Accounting Standards No. (ASN) 2015-17). This amendment requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent in the statement of financial position. The amendment is effective for periods beginning January 1, 2016 and
allows for either prospective adoption or retrospective adoption. The Company expects the adoption of amended ASC 740 to impact the classification of deferred taxes on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.

In April 2015, the FASB amended ASC 835-30,

Interest - Imputation of Interest

(issued under ASN 2015-03). This amendment to ASC 835-30 requires that
debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt
issuance costs is not affected by this amendment. The amendment is effective for periods beginning January 1, 2016 and requires using a retrospective approach. The Company does not expect the adoption of amended ASC 835-30 to have a material
impact on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASC 606-10,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

(issued
under ASN. 2014-09). ASC 606-10 will replace all existing revenue recognition guidance when effective. On July 9, 2015, the FASB approved a one year deferral of the effective date, with application permitted as of the original effective date,
or periods beginning January 1, 2017. Either full retrospective adoption or modified retrospective adoption is allowed under ASC 606-10. The Company is in the process of determining whether the adoption of ASC 606-10 will have an impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

2.

Acquisition

On February 14, 2013, the Company acquired 100 percent of the shares of MiM Isitma Sogutma Havalandirma ve Aritma Sistemleri San. Tic.
A.S. (MiM), a privately-held Turkish water treatment company. The addition of MiM expanded the Company’s product offerings and gave the Company access to Eastern Europe and the Black Sea region water treatment markets. MiM is included in the
Rest of World segment.

The Company paid an aggregate cash purchase price of $4.0 million, net of cash received of $1.9 million. In addition, the Company
assumed debt of $1.7 million and recorded contingent consideration of $1.1 million, the fair value of the contingent payment due to the former owners of MiM if certain targets are met for growth in sales, gross profits and operating profits through
2017.

The fair value of the purchase price resulted in an allocation to acquired intangible assets totaling $4.3 million of which $2.4 million was
assigned to customer lists which are being amortized over ten years.



2.

Acquisition (continued)

MiM’s results of operations have been included in the Company’s financial statements from
February 14, 2013, the date of acquisition. Revenues and pre-tax results associated with MiM included in results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 were not material to the Company’s net sales or pre-tax earnings.

3.

Restructuring, Impairment and Settlement Income

On March 28, 2013, the Company announced the move of manufacturing operations from its Fergus, Ontario facility to other North American
facilities. In 2013, the Company recognized $22.0 million of pre-tax restructuring and impairment expenses, comprised of impairment charges related to long-lived assets totaling $9.2 million, severance costs of $7.5 million, equipment relocation
costs of $2.9 million and inventory obsolescence costs totaling $2.4 million, as well as a corresponding $5.6 million income tax benefit related to the expenses related to this move. The majority of the consolidation of operations occurred in the
second quarter of 2013.

On March 11, 2013, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with a former supplier of a North American subsidiary
regarding previous overcharges and warranty costs. The terms of the settlement agreement resulted in an $11.0 million cash payment to the Company, a pre-tax gain of $11.0 million and $4.2 million of income tax expense.

The restructuring, impairment and settlement income activities are included in the Company’s North America segment.

On January 15, 2015, the Company issued $75 million in term notes to an insurance company. Principal payments commence in
2020 and the notes mature in 2030. The notes have an interest rate of 3.52 percent. The proceeds of the notes were used to pay down borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facility.

The Company has a $400 million multi-year multi-currency revolving credit agreement with a group of eight banks, which expires on December 12, 2017. The
facility has an accordion provision which allows it to be increased up to $500 million if certain conditions (including lender approval) are satisfied. Borrowings under the Company’s bank credit lines and commercial paper borrowings are
supported by the revolving credit agreement. As a result of the long-term nature of this facility, the commercial paper and credit line borrowings are classified as long-term debt at December 31, 2015 and 2014. At its option, the Company either
maintains cash balances or pays fees for bank credit and services.

Scheduled maturities of long-term debt within each of the five years subsequent to
December 31, 2015 are as follows:

Stockholders’ Equity

The Company’s authorized capital consists of three million shares of Preferred Stock $1 par value, 14 million shares of
Class A Common Stock $5 par value, and 120 million shares of Common Stock $1 par value. The Common Stock has equal dividend rights with Class A Common Stock and is entitled, as a class, to elect one-third of the Board of Directors and
has 1/10th vote per share on all other matters. Class A Common Stock is convertible to Common Stock on a one for one basis.

There were 135,088
shares during 2015, 272,184 shares during 2014 and 85,792 shares during 2013, of Class A Common Stock converted into Common Stock. Regular dividends paid on the A. O. Smith Corporation Class A Common Stock and Common Stock amounted to
$0.76, $0.60 and $0.46 per share in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

In 2013, the Company’s Board of Directors approved adding 2,000,000 shares of
Common Stock to an existing discretionary share repurchase authority. In 2014, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the purchase of an additional 3,500,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock. In 2015, the Company’s Board of
Directors authorized the purchase of an additional 2,000,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock. Under the share repurchase program, the Company’s Common Stock may be purchased through a combination of a Rule 10b5-1 automatic trading
plan and discretionary purchases in accordance with applicable securities laws. The number of shares purchased and the timing of the purchase will depend on a number of factors, including share price, trading volume and general market conditions, as
well as on working capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors, including alternative investment opportunities. The share repurchase authorization remains effective until terminated by the Board of Directors which may occur
at any time, subject to the parameters of any Rule 10b5-1 automatic trading plan that the Company may then have in effect. In 2015, the Company purchased 1,908,237 shares at a total cost of $128.1 million. As of December 31, 2015, there were
2,589,756 shares remaining on the existing repurchase authorization. In 2014, the Company purchased 2,154,783 shares at a cost of $103.8 million. In 2013, the Company purchased 1,771,066 shares at a cost of $73.7 million.

At December 31, 2015, a total of 65,190 and 7,340,173 shares of Class A Common Stock and Common Stock, respectively, were held as treasury stock. At
December 31, 2014, a total of 65,190 and 5,889,073 shares of Class A Common Stock and Common Stock, respectively, were held as treasury stock.

Stock Based Compensation

The Company adopted the A. O. Smith Combined Incentive Compensation Plan (the “Plan”) effective January 1, 2007. The Plan was
reapproved on April 16, 2012. The Plan is a continuation of the A. O. Smith Combined Executive Incentive Compensation Plan which was originally approved by shareholders in 2002. The number of shares available for granting of options or share
units at December 31, 2015, was 1,994,172. Upon stock option exercise or share unit vesting, shares are issued from treasury stock.

Total stock
based compensation expense recognized in 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $8.8 million, $10.8 million and $10.5 million, respectively.



10.

Stock Based Compensation (continued)

Stock options

The stock options granted in 2015, 2014 and 2013 have three year pro rata vesting from the dates of grant. Stock options are issued at exercise prices equal to
the fair value of Common Stock on the date of grant. For active employees, all options granted in 2015, 2014 and 2013 expire ten years after date of grant. Stock option compensation recognized in 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $4.0 million, $4.9 million
and $4.5 million, respectively. Included in the stock option expense recognized in 2015, 2014 and 2013 is expense associated with the accelerated vesting of stock option awards for certain employees who either are retirement eligible or become
retirement eligible during the vesting period.

Stock Based Compensation (continued)

The weighted-average fair value per option at the date of grant during 2015, 2014 and 2013, using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model, was $17.17, $16.55 and $12.57, respectively. Assumptions were as follows:

The expected life is based on historical exercise behavior and the projected exercises of unexercised stock options. The risk
free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect on the date of grant for the respective expected life of the option. The expected dividend yield is based on the expected annual dividends divided by the grant date market value
of the Company’s Common Stock. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s Common Stock.

Stock
Appreciations Rights (SARs)

Certain non-U.S.-based employees are granted SARs. Each SAR award grants the employee the right to receive cash equal to
the excess of the share price of the Common Stock on the date that a participant exercises such right over the grant date price of the stock. SARs granted in the year ended December 31, 2015 have three year pro rata vesting from the date of
grant. SARs are issued at exercise prices equal to the fair value of Common Stock on the date of grant and expire ten years from the date of grant. Compensation expense for SARs is remeasured at each reporting period based on the estimated fair
value on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, using assumptions similar to stock option awards. SARs are subsequently remeasured at each interim reporting period based on a revised Black-Scholes value. In 2015, the Company
granted 13,115 cash-settled SARs and no SARs were exercisable. Stock based compensation expense attributable to SARS was minimal in 2015.

Restricted
stock and share units

Participants may also be awarded shares of restricted stock or share units under the Plan. The Company granted 76,096, 110,691
and 144,696 share units under the plan in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

The share units were valued at $4.7 million, $5.1 million and $5.0 million
at the date of issuance in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and will be recognized as compensation expense ratably over the three-year vesting period; however, included in share based compensation is expense associated with the accelerated vesting
of share unit awards for certain employees who either are retirement eligible or become retirement eligible during the vesting period. Compensation expense of $4.8 million, $5.9 million and $6.0 million was recognized in 2015, 2014 and 2013,
respectively. Certain non-U.S.-based employees receive the cash value of vested shares at the vesting date in lieu of shares.

A summary of share unit
activity under the plan is as follows:

Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefits

The Company provides retirement benefits for all U.S. employees including benefits for employees of previously owned businesses which were
earned up to the date of sale. The Company also has two foreign pension plans, neither of which is material to the Company’s financial position.

The
Company has a defined contribution plan which matches 100 percent of the first one percent of contributions made by participating employees and matches 50 percent of the next five percent of employee contributions. The Company also has defined
contribution plans for certain hourly employees which provide for matching Company contributions.

The Company also has a defined benefit plan for
salaried employees and its non-union hourly workforce. In 2009, the Company announced U.S. employees hired after January 1, 2010, would not participate in the defined benefit plan, and benefit accruals for the majority of current salaried and
hourly employees sunset on December 31, 2014. Beginning in 2015, an additional Company contribution is being made to the defined contribution plan in lieu of benefits earned in a defined benefit plan. The Company also has defined benefit and
contribution plans for certain union hourly employees.

The Company has unfunded defined-benefit post-retirement plans covering certain hourly and
salaried employees that provide medical and life insurance benefits from retirement to age 65. Certain hourly employees retiring after January 1, 1996, are subject to a maximum annual benefit and salaried employees hired after December 31,
1993, are not eligible for post-retirement medical benefits.

The Company amended its pension plan in 2014 to offer a one-time opportunity to pay pension
benefits to former employees in a lump sum. These amendments did not have a significant impact on the plan. Former employees eligible for the voluntary lump sum payment option are generally those who are vested participants of the pension plan who
terminated employment prior to January 1, 2014 and who have not yet started receiving monthly payments of their pension benefits. Eligible participants had until October 31, 2014 to make their election. For the approximately 2,700 former
employees who made the election, the Company made payments of approximately $50 million in December 2014 and funded the payments from existing pension plan assets. The Company did not incur any non-cash charges related to settling this liability as
the payments did not exceed settlement thresholds.

As of December 31, 2015, the Company changed the method used to estimate the service and interest
components of net periodic benefit cost for its pension plan and its postretirement benefit plan. This change compared to the previous method will result in a decrease in the service and interest components for pension cost in 2016. Historically,
the Company estimated the service and interest cost components utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. The Company has elected to utilize
an approach that discounts the individual expected cash flows underlying the service cost and interest cost using the applicable spot rates derived from the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected
cash flows. This change was made to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates.

This change does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations but will reduce the service and interest cost for the pension plan. The Company
has accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate that is inseparable from a change in accounting principle and accordingly has accounted for it prospectively beginning January 1, 2016.

The estimated net actuarial loss and prior service cost for the pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other
comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost during 2016 are $16.7 million and $(1.1) million, respectively. The estimated net actuarial loss and prior year service cost for the post-retirement benefit plans that will be amortized from
accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost during 2016 are $0.2 million and $(0.4) million, respectively. As permitted under ASC 715, the amortization of any prior service cost was previously determined using a straight-line
amortization of the cost over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plan. Beginning in 2015 the amortization occurs over the average remaining life expectancy of participants expected to receive
benefits under the plan as permitted under ASC 715.

The 2015 and 2014 after tax adjustments for additional minimum pension liability resulted in
other comprehensive gain of $1.0 million and $1.6 million, respectively.

Assumptions

In developing the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, the Company evaluated its pension plan’s target and actual asset allocation
and expected long-term rates of return of equity and bond indices. The Company also considered its pension plan’s historical ten-year and 25-year compounded annualized returns of 6.1 percent and 9.5 percent, respectively.

The Company’s investment policies employ an approach whereby a diversified blend of equity and bond investments is used
to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk. Equity investments are diversified across domestic and non-domestic stocks, as well as growth, value, and small to large capitalizations. Bond investments include corporate
and government issues, with short-, mid- and long-term maturities, with a focus on investment grade when purchased. The Company’s target allocation to equity managers is between 45 to 55 percent with the remainder allocated primarily to bonds
and a small allocation to real estate, private equity managers and cash. Investment and market risks are measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through regular investment portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements and periodic
asset/liability studies.

The Company’s actual asset allocations are in line with target allocations. The Company regularly reviews its actual asset
allocation and periodically rebalances its investments to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate.

There was no Company stock included in
plan assets at December 31, 2015.

Cash Flows

The Company was not required to and did not make any contributions in 2015 and is not required to make a contribution in 2016.

Derivative instruments

ASC 815

Derivatives and Hedging

, as amended, requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value
and establishes criteria for designation and effectiveness of the hedging relationships. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as a part of a hedging
relationship and, further, on the type of hedging relationship. For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, the Company must designate the hedging instrument, based upon the exposure hedged, as a fair
value hedge, cash flow hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.

The Company designates that all of its hedging instruments are cash
flow hedges. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge (i.e., hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk), the effective portion of the gain or
loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive loss, net of tax, and is reclassified into earnings in the same line item associated with the forecasted transaction and in the same period or periods during which
the hedged transaction affects earnings. The amount by which the cumulative change in the value of the hedge more than offsets the cumulative change in the value of the hedged item (i.e., the ineffective portion) is recorded in earnings, net of tax,
in the period the ineffectiveness occurs.

The Company utilizes certain derivative instruments to enhance its ability to manage currency exposure as well
as raw materials price risk. Derivative instruments are entered into for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. The Company does not enter into contracts for
speculative purposes. The contracts are executed with major financial institutions with no credit loss anticipated for failure of the counterparties to perform.

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts

The Company is
exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of certain subsidiaries. The Company utilizes foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts to manage the volatility
associated with foreign currency purchases, sales and certain intercompany transactions in the normal course of business. Principal currencies for which the Company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts include the British pound, Canadian
dollar, Euro and Mexican peso.

Gains and losses on these instruments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, until the
underlying transaction is recorded in earnings. When the hedged item is realized, gains or losses are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to the statement of earnings. The assessment of effectiveness for forward contracts is based
on changes in the forward rates. These hedges have been determined to be effective.

The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss for cash flow
hedges will be reclassified into earnings no later than December 31, 2016.

Commodity Futures Contracts

In addition to entering into supply arrangements in the normal course of business, the Company also enters into futures contracts to fix the cost of certain
raw material purchases, principally copper, with the objective of minimizing changes in cost due to market price fluctuations. The hedging strategy for achieving this objective is to purchase commodities futures contracts on the open market of the
London Metals Exchange (LME) or over the counter contracts based on the LME.

The minimal after-tax loss of the effective portion of the contracts as of
December 31, 2015 was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and will be reclassified into cost of products sold in the periods in which the underlying transactions are recorded in earnings. The effective portion of the contracts will
be reclassified within one year. Commodity hedges outstanding at December 31, 2015 total approximately 1.7 million pounds of copper.

The impact
of derivative contracts on the Company’s financial statements is as follows:

Income Taxes (continued)

Total income taxes paid by the Company amounted to $97.5 million, $88.9 million, and $70.2 million in 2015,
2014 and 2013, respectively.

As of December 31, 2015, the Company has $47.9 million accrued for its estimate of the tax costs due upon repatriation
of undistributed foreign earnings it considers to be not permanently reinvested. At December 31, 2015, the Company had undistributed foreign earnings of $875.9 million, of which $691.9 million are considered permanently reinvested. No U.S.
income tax provision or foreign withholding tax provisions have been made on foreign earnings that remain permanently reinvested. The Company considers permanently reinvested earnings outside the U.S. on the basis of estimates that future domestic
cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs and its specific plans for reinvestment of foreign subsidiary earnings. In addition, no provision or benefit for U.S. income taxes has been made on foreign currency translation
gains or losses. As of December 31, 2015, $645.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries.

The tax effects of temporary differences of assets and liabilities between income tax and financial reporting are as follows:

The Company believes it is more likely than not that it will realize the current and long-term deferred tax assets through the
reduction of future taxable income. Significant factors the Company considered in determining the probability of the realization of the deferred tax assets include historical operating results and expected future earnings.

The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate is $0.5 million. The Company
recognizes potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. At December 31, 2015 there was an immaterial amount of interest and penalties accrued. It is anticipated there will be no
decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits in 2016. The Company’s U.S. federal income tax returns for 2014 and 2015 are subject to audit. The Company is subject to state and local income tax audits for tax years 2000-2015. The
Company is subject to non-U.S. income tax examinations for years 2007-2015.

14.

Commitments and Contingencies

The Company is a potentially responsible party in judicial and administrative proceedings seeking to clean up sites which have been
environmentally impacted. In each case the Company has established reserves, insurance proceeds and/or a potential recovery from third parties. The Company believes any environmental claims will not have a material effect on its financial position
or results of operations.

The Company is subject to various claims and pending lawsuits for product liability and other matters arising out of the
conduct of the Company’s business. With respect to product liability claims, the Company has self-insured a portion of its product liability loss exposure for many years. The Company has established reserves and has insurance coverage which it
believes are adequate to cover incurred claims. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had $125 million of product liability insurance for individual losses in excess of $7.5 million. The Company periodically reevaluates
its exposure on claims and lawsuits and makes adjustments to its reserves as appropriate. The Company believes, based on current knowledge, consultation with counsel, adequate reserves and insurance coverage that the outcome of such claims and
lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

15.

Operations by Segment

The Company is comprised of two reporting segments: North America and Rest of World. The Rest of World segment is primarily comprised of
China, Europe and India. Both segments manufacture and market comprehensive lines of residential and commercial gas, gas tankless and electric water heaters. Both segments primarily manufacture and market in their respective regions of the world.
The North America segment also manufactures and globally markets specialty commercial water heating equipment, condensing and non-condensing boilers and water system tanks. Primarily for Asia, the Rest of World segment also manufactures and markets
water treatment products. The Company also markets in-home air purification products in China.



15.

Operations by Segment (continued)

The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the “Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies” outlined in Note 1. Operating earnings, defined by the Company as earnings before interest, taxes, general corporate and corporate research and development expenses, were used to measure the performance of the
segments.

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule
13a-15(f). Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on this evaluation, our management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2015, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited our consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of
internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 as stated in their report which is included herein.



Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

In 2015, we continued the implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning system. This

multi-year

initiative is being conducted in phases and includes modifications to the design and operation of controls over financial reporting. We are testing internal controls over financial reporting for design effectiveness prior to the implementation of
each phase, and we have monitoring controls in place over the implementation of these changes

Except as described above, there have been no changes in
our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules

13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Securities and Exchange Act) during the year ended
December 31, 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

A. O. Smith Corporation

We have audited A. O. Smith Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in
Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). A. O. Smith Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in
all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, A. O. Smith Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2015, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States), the consolidated balance sheets of A. O. Smith Corporation as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2015, and our report dated February 17, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
