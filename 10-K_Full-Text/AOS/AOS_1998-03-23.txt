                                     PART I

   ITEM 1 - BUSINESS

   A. O. Smith Corporation, a Delaware corporation organized in 1916, its
   subsidiaries and its affiliates are engaged in three business segments. 
   These segments are Electric Motor Technologies, Water Systems Technologies
   and Storage & Fluid Handling Technologies.

   The company's Electric Motor Technologies segment produces fractional
   horsepower and hermetic electric motors.  The Water Systems Technologies
   Segment is a leading manufacturer of residential and commercial gas, oil,
   and electric water heating systems.  Storage & Fluid Handling Technologies
   manufactures reinforced thermosetting resin piping, agricultural,
   industrial and municipal liquid and dry bulk storage systems.  Financial
   information regarding the company's business segments is provided in Note
   13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements which appear elsewhere herein.

   On April 18, 1997 the company sold its Automotive Products Company to
   Tower Automotive, Inc. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
   Statements, entitled "Discontinued Operations" which appears elsewhere
   herein.

   On March 31 1997, the company acquired the business of UPPCO, Inc., a
   privately held manufacturer of sub-fractional horsepower electric motors
   with 1997 sales since the date of acquisition of approximately $57
   million.

   The following table summarizes sales by segment for the company's
   operations.  This segment summary and all other information presented in
   this section should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial
   Statements and the Notes thereto which appear elsewhere herein.

   ELECTRIC MOTOR TECHNOLOGIES

   Segment sales increased by $53.6 million or approximately 16 percent in
   1997 to $390.7 million and represented 47 percent of total company
   continuing sales.  The increase in sales in 1997 was due to the
   acquisition of UPPCO.

   The Electric Motor Technologies segment includes the A. O. Smith
   Electrical Products Company which manufactures fan motors used in
   furnaces, air conditioners, and blowers, as well as fractional horsepower
   motors used in other consumer products and jet pump motors sold to
   manufacturers of home water systems, swimming pools, hot tubs and spas. 
   Hermetic motors are sold worldwide to manufacturers of compressors and are
   used in air conditioning and refrigeration systems.  Sales to the heating,
   ventilating, air conditioning and refrigeration market account for
   approximately 59 percent of the unit's sales.

   In addition to selling its products directly to OEMs, the company also
   markets its products through a distributor network which sells to both
   OEMs and the related after-market.  The company estimates that
   approximately 60 percent of the market is derived from the less cyclical
   replacement business with the remainder being impacted by general business
   conditions in the new construction market.

   The segment's principal products are sold in competitive markets with its
   major competitors being Emerson Electric, General Electric, Magnetek,
   Inc., Fasco, and Jakel and vertically integrated customers.

   WATER SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGIES

   The Water Systems Technology segment includes the A. O. Smith Water
   Products Company which had 1997 sales of $287.5 million, approximately 1
   percent lower than 1996 sales of $291.3 million and represented
   approximately 35 percent of total company sales.

   Residential sales in 1997 were $166 million or approximately 57 percent of
   segment revenues.  The company markets residential gas and electric water
   heaters through a network of plumbing wholesalers in the United States. 
   The majority of the company's sales are in the less cyclical replacement
   market although the new housing market is an important portion of the
   business as well.  The residential water heater market remains highly
   competitive. A. O. Smith competes with four other manufacturers in
   supplying over 90 percent of market requirements.  The principal
   competitors in the Water Systems segment are Rheem Manufacturing, State
   Industries, The American Water Heater Group (formerly SABH, Inc.) and
   Bradford-White.

   The company also markets commercial water heating systems through a
   network of plumbing wholesalers in the United States and Canada. A.O.
   Smith's Water Systems Technologies segment is the largest manufacturer of
   commercial water heaters.  Commercial water heating systems are used in a
   wide range of applications including schools, nursing homes, hospitals,
   prisons, hotels, motels, laundries, restaurants, stadiums, amusement
   parks, car washes, and other large users of hot water.  The commercial
   market is characterized by competition from a broader range of products
   and competitors than occurs in the residential market.

   A significant portion of the company's commercial and residential business
   is derived from the less cyclical replacement market with the remainder
   being impacted by general business conditions in the new construction
   market.

   In 1995 Water Systems established a joint venture with Nanjing Water
   Heater Company of China to manufacture instantaneous and storage type
   heaters for the Chinese market.  A.O. Smith is a majority owner of the
   venture, which began operation in 1996.

   STORAGE & FLUID HANDLING TECHNOLOGIES

   The Storage & Fluid Handling segment provides world-wide solutions for
   effectively storing liquids and a wide range of dry materials; as well as
   high performance piping systems that safely and effectively contain and
   convey corrosive, abrasive or related materials. Higher sales of fluid
   handling products more than offset a decline in storage products, and as a
   result, 1997 sales rose slightly to $154.7 million compared with 1996
   sales of $152.8 million.

   Engineered Storage Products manufactures industrial, municipal and
   agricultural liquid and dry bulk storage products.  1997 sales of storage
   products were $93.1 million.  The company's storage products are sold in
   competitive markets that include concrete, site welded, and bolted tanks.
   Principal competitors include Columbian Steel Tank Company, Permastore
   LTD., Pittsburg Tank and Tower Company Inc. and Natgun Corporation.

   Fiberglass Products manufactures reinforced thermosetting resin piping and
   fittings used to carry corrosive materials.  Sales of fluid handling
   products were $61.6 million in 1997.  Typical applications include
   chemical and industrial process and waste steam piping, high and low
   pressure oil field pipe and tubing, and underground gasoline service
   station piping.  Products are sold through a network of distributors.

   Fiberglass Products has formed a joint venture with Harbin Composites
   Corporation of Harbin, China to supply fiberglass pipe to the Chinese oil
   industry. The company is a majority owner of the new venture, which began
   production in 1996.

   Principal fluid handling products are sold in competitive markets with its
   major competitors being Ameron Corporation, Fibercast Company, Environ
   Corporation, and Total Containment Corporation.

   RAW MATERIAL

   Raw materials for the company's operations, which consist primarily of
   steel, copper, and aluminum, are generally available from several sources
   in adequate quantities.  The company hedges the majority of its annual
   purchases of copper and aluminum to protect against price volatility.

   SEASONALITY

   There is no significant seasonal pattern to the company's consolidated
   quarterly sales and earnings.  

   RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

   In order to improve competitiveness by generating new products and
   processes, the company conducts research and development at its Corporate
   Technology Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin as well as at its operating unit
   locations. Total expenditures for research and development in 1997, 1996,
   and 1995 were approximately $17.2 million, $17.3 million, and $15.0
   million, respectively.

   The company owns and uses in its businesses various trademarks, trade
   names, patents, trade secrets, and licenses.  While a number of these are
   important to the company, it does not consider a material part of its
   business to be dependent on any one of them.

   EMPLOYEES

   The company and its subsidiaries employed approximately 8,400 persons in
   its operations as of December 31, 1997.

   BACKLOG

   Normally, none of the company's operations sustain significant backlogs.

   ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS

   The company's operations are governed by a variety of federal, state and
   local laws intended to protect the environment.  While environmental
   considerations are a part of all significant capital expenditures,
   compliance with the environmental laws has not had a material effect and
   is not expected to have a material effect upon the capital expenditures,
   earnings, or competitive position of the company.  See Item 3.

   FOREIGN SALES

   Total export sales of continuing operations from the U.S. were $ 64
   million, $ 52 million, and $ 49 million in 1997, 1996, and 1995,
   respectively.  The increase in sales in 1997 compared with prior years was
   attributable to the acquisition of UPPCO.                   


   ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES

   The company manufactures its products in 33 locations worldwide.  These
   facilities have an aggregate floor space of 4,658,641 square feet,
   consisting of 3,425,891 square feet owned by the company and 1,232,750
   square feet of leased space.  Fifteen of the company's facilities are
   foreign plants including affiliates and joint ventures with 1,320,931

   The principal equipment at the company's facilities consist of presses,
   welding, machining, slitting and other metal fabricating equipment,
   winding machines, and furnace and painting equipment.  The company regards
   its plant and equipment as well-maintained and adequate for its needs. 
   Multishift operations are used where necessary. 

   In addition to its manufacturing facilities, the company's World
   Headquarters is located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  It also has offices in
   Alsip, Illinois; El Paso, Texas; Irving, Texas; London, England and
   Beijing, China.

   ITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

   The company is involved in various unresolved legal actions,
   administrative proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of its
   business involving product liability, property damage, insurance coverage,
   patents and environmental matters including the disposal of hazardous
   waste.  Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome
   of these unresolved legal actions or the range of possible loss or
   recovery, the company believes these unresolved legal actions will not
   have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. 
   A more detailed discussion of these matters appears in Note 12 of the
   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

   ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

   FINANCIAL REVIEW

   A. O. Smith Corporation recorded earnings from continuing operations of
   $37.6 million or $2.00 per diluted share in 1997 versus $25.2 million or
   $1.19 per diluted share in 1996.  Earnings from discontinued operations
   added $116.3 million to the company's net earnings in 1997 compared to
   $40.2 million in 1996, providing the company with total net earnings of
   $153.8 million and $65.4 million in 1997 and 1996, respectively.  The 1997
   earnings from discontinued operations include a $101.0 million gain, net
   of taxes, associated with the disposition of the automotive business.  As
   a result, diluted earnings per share totaled $8.19 in 1997 versus $3.09 in
   1996. Details of individual segment performance will be discussed later in
   this section.

   Working capital for continuing operations at December 31, 1997 was $244.3
   million compared to $103.4 million and $127.7 million at December 31, 1996
   and 1995, respectively.  The majority of the increase in 1997 was due to
   the net cash proceeds received from the sale of the company's automotive
   products business.  Lower accounts receivable and production related
   increases in trade payables resulted in lower working capital at December
   31, 1996 versus 1995.

   Capital expenditures for continuing operations were $44.9 million in 1997
   compared to $37.8 million in 1996 and $26.9 million in 1995.  The
   increases in capital expenditures are primarily attributed to higher
   capital expenditures for the Electric Motor Technologies business.  The
   company expects that cash flow from operations will adequately cover 1998
   capital expenditures.

   The company established two joint ventures in the People's Republic of
   China in the fourth quarter of 1995.  The company invested $13.7 million
   in these joint ventures during 1997 compared to $15.1 million in 1996.

   Long-term debt was reduced $137.4 million from $238.4 million at the end
   of 1996 to $101.0 million at the end of 1997.  The proceeds from the sale
   of the automotive business, including its Mexican automotive affiliate,
   was $773 million.  A portion of the proceeds was used to pay taxes on the
   transaction, repurchase common stock, retire long term debt, and complete
   the acquisition of UPPCO.  As a result, the company's leverage, as
   measured by total debt to total capital, dropped to 21.0% at the end of
   1997 compared to 37.1% at the end of 1996.

   On January 27, 1997, the company's Board of Directors authorized the
   repurchase of up to three million shares of its outstanding common stock. 
   On June 10, 1997 and December 9, 1997, the Board authorized the repurchase
   of up to $80 million and $50 million, respectively, of additional common
   stock.  During 1997, the company purchased 14,500 shares of Class A Common
   Stock and 4.8 million shares of Common Stock for approximately $176.6
   million.

   Due to significant cash and cash equivalent balances, the company elected
   to reduce its multi-year revolving credit agreement from $210 million to
   $100 million effective September 30, 1997.

   The company uses futures contracts to fix the cost of portions of its
   expected raw materials needs, primarily for copper and aluminum, with the
   objective of reducing risk due to market price fluctuations.  In addition,
   the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the
   effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on transactions and operations of
   foreign affiliates.  Differences between the company's fixed price and
   current market prices on raw materials contracts are included as part of
   inventory cost when the contracts mature.  Differences between the
   company's fixed price and current market prices on currency contracts are
   recognized in the same period in which gains or losses from the
   transactions being hedged are recognized and, accordingly, no net gain or
   loss is realized when contracts mature.  The company does not engage in
   speculation in its derivatives strategies.  The effects of these programs
   were not material on the results of operations for 1997, 1996, or 1995.

   A. O. Smith Company has paid dividends for 58 consecutive years.  A total
   of $.68 per share was paid in 1997 versus $.66 per share in 1996.

   Results of Operations

   Sales from continuing operations in 1997 were $832.9 million surpassing
   1996 sales of $781.2 million by almost $52 million or 6.6 percent.  The
   increase in sales was attributable to  the acquisition in March of UPPCO,
   a manufacturer of subfractional horsepower C-frame electric motors, which
   contributed $56.6 million to total company sales.  The increase in sales
   associated with UPPCO helped overcome weakness in the domestic air
   conditioning and residential water heating industries which are two of the
   company's most significant markets.  Sales from continuing operations in
   1996 increased approximately $85 million compared with 1995 sales of
   $696.6 million.  The sales increase was the result of $50 million of
   additional sales associated with the acquisition of Peabody TecTank Inc.,
   made in December of 1995 and sales increases of approximately 6 percent
   for both Water Systems and Electric Motor Technologies.

   During 1997, the company successfully completed its exit from the
   automotive industry by selling the Automotive Products Company for $710
   million on April 18, 1997.  On October 1, 1997, the company divested the
   remainder  of its automotive business by selling its 40 percent interest
   in a Mexican automotive affiliate for $63 million.  The after-tax gain on
   the sale of $101.1 million combined with 1997 after-tax earnings of $15.2
   million generated net earnings from discontinued operations of $116.3
   million or $6.19 per diluted share.  The results of the automotive
   business have been reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated
   financial statements.

   The company's gross profit margin for continuing operations in 1997 was
   20.5 percent, compared with 21.4 percent in 1996 and 20.3 percent in 1995. 
   Each of the company's business units experienced a decline in 1997 profit
   margin relative to 1996.  Profit margins for Electric Motor Technologies
   dropped due to lower production rates and the lower margins associated
   with subfractional motors produced by UPPCO.  Water Systems Technologies
   experienced a slight decline in profit margin as second half pricing
   pressure for residential products was only partially offset by increased
   sales of higher margin commercial product.  Storage & Fluid Handling
   Technologies' overall margin declined as favorable product mix for
   fiberglass pipe was more than offset by lower volumes for the relatively
   high margin liquid storage tank product.  The favorable trend in margins
   from 1995 to 1996 was due mostly to higher manufacturing volume, increased
   capacity utilization and improved operating efficiencies for electric
   motor production.

   Sales for the Electric Motor Technologies segment in 1997 increased $53.6
   million or almost 16 percent to a record $390.7 million from 1996 sales of
   $337.1 million. Sales in 1995 were $317.3 million.  The increase in sales
   in 1997 was due to the acquisition of UPPCO as discussed above.  Although
   1997 sales, excluding the additional sales from the aforementioned
   acquisition, were comparable to 1996, the company was encouraged by the
   performance of this segment given the weakness in the air conditioning
   market in 1997.  An abnormally cool selling season combined with high
   customer inventory levels resulted in a decline in overall industry
   production volume of more than 10 percent compared to 1996.  Despite the
   weak market conditions, hermetic motor volumes declined only modestly. 
   The cool weather also affected other motor markets, specifically pump
   motors, heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) fan motors and
   aftermarket sales.  1997 fractional horsepower sales were about equal to
   1996 levels as a 10 percent growth in the General Industries market
   resulting from additional air compressor and garage door opener motor
   volume offset the weather related weakness.

   Earnings for the Electric Motor Technologies segment in 1997 were $45.4
   million or 6.2 percent higher than the $42.7 million earned in 1996. 
   Earnings in 1995 were $31.9 million.  The improved earnings in 1997 were
   due to the UPPCO acquisition while the significant improvement over the
   past few years was due to increased volume and the continued payoff from
   capital investments in new equipment and concentration of production in
   lower cost facilities.

   Sales for the Water Systems Technologies segment declined modestly from
   $291.3 million in 1996 to $287.5 million in 1997.  Sales in 1995 were $276
   million.  The minor drop off in sales in 1997 was due to decreased unit
   volume for residential product which reflected conditions prevalent within
   the general industry.  The unfavorable impact of decreased volume was
   amplified by a competitive pricing environment present during the second
   half of the year.  Conversely, sales of commercial product rose on the
   strength of higher unit volume and better pricing.  The international
   environment improved in 1997 as both the Canadian and European markets for
   Water Products showed signs of recovery.

   Earnings for Water Systems Technologies in 1997 have remained fairly
   constant over the past three years, despite the aggressive pricing
   environment that has existed during this time period.  Earnings were $33.4
   million, $32.8 million and $32.2 million in 1997, 1996 and 1995,
   respectively.

   Sales for the Storage & Fluid Handling Technologies segment reflected
   slight improvement in 1997 increasing to $154.7 million from $152.8
   million in 1996. 1996 sales increased $49.4 million over 1995 sales of
   $103.4 million due to the December, 1995 acquisition of Peabody TecTank,
   Inc., which contributed approximately $50 million to this segment's 1996
   sales.  The sales increase from 1996 to 1997 resulted from record sales of
   fiberglass pipe which more than offset  a sales decline for liquid storage
   tanks.  Earnings in 1997 were similar to 1996 as the impact of additional
   volume and favorable product mix for fiberglass pipe was offset by the
   loss of volume for the relatively high margin liquid storage tanks.

   Selling, general, and administrative (SG & A) expense in 1997 was $107.0
   million, about equal to 1996 SG & A of $107.4 million.  SG & A in 1995 was
   $91.4 million.  As a percent of sales, SG & A dropped from 13.7 percent in
   1996 to 12.8 percent in 1997.  The decline in SG & A relative to sales was
   due largely to a reduction in general corporate expenses resulting from
   the divestiture of the Automotive Products Company.  The increase in SG &
   A from $91.4 million in 1995 to $107.4 million in 1996 was due to the
   consolidation of SG & A associated with the acquisition of Peabody
   TecTank, Inc., as well as increased sales commissions and other expenses
   in support of increased sales volumes.

   Interest expense, net of the amount allocated to discontinued operations,
   was $7.8 million in 1997 compared to $8.1 million and $7.6 million in 1996
   and 1995, as debt levels for continuing operations remained fairly
   constant during the period.

   Interest  income in 1997 was $9 million and resulted from investing the
   proceeds received from the sale of the automotive business.  Interest
   income in 1996 and 1995 was minimal.

   The company's effective tax rate decreased to 34.6 percent in 1997 from 37
   percent and 35.9 percent in 1996 and 1995, respectively.  The decline in
   the rate in 1997 resulted primarily from the impact of the utilization of
   state tax loss carryforwards associated with liquidated subsidiaries and
   research tax credits.
    
   The company's share of the pre-tax losses incurred by its joint ventures
   in China increased slightly from 1996 to 1997, however, the after-tax
   losses declined from $3.9 million in 1996 to $2.7 million in 1997 due to
   the company's ability to now tax effect these losses for U.S. tax
   purposes.  Current projections for 1998 China activity reflect a loss
   similar to that of 1997 as start up costs associated with the new water
   heater plant in Nanjing are incurred.

   Consolidated earnings from continuing operations in 1997 increased 49
   percent to $37.6 million compared with 1996 earnings of $25.2 million
   reflecting the UPPCO acquisition, increased interest income and reduced
   general corporate expenses.  Diluted earnings per share of $2.00 in 1997
   were 68 percent higher than the $1.19 per share earned in 1996,
   underscoring the additional benefit of the company's share repurchase
   program.

   Outlook

   Looking ahead to 1998, the company expects to encounter continued
   competitive pricing  in the residential water heater market as well as in
   certain electric motor markets.  This impact should be mitigated by
   favorable interest income, lower customer inventory levels in HVAC
   markets, a full year of UPPCO earnings, and a significantly lower average
   number of shares outstanding relative to 1997.

   OTHER MATTERS

   Year 2000

   Many computer systems experience problems handling dates beyond the year
   1999.  Therefore, some computer hardware and software will need to be
   modified prior to the end of the year 1999 in order to remain functional. 
   Relative to the Year 2000, the company has conducted a comprehensive
   review of its computer systems to identify those systems that could be
   affected by this issue and has initiated a company wide project to resolve
   any potential issues.  The company believes that, with in-house
   modifications and vendor-supplied enhancements to existing software as
   well as deployment of new systems, the Year 2000 issue does not pose
   significant operational problems for the company's computer systems.  It
   is anticipated that all modifications, enhancements, and deployment of
   Year 2000-ready systems will be completed in early 1999, allowing adequate
   time for testing.  Modification and enhancement costs will be expensed as
   incurred, while the costs of new software will be capitalized and
   amortized over the software's useful life. The company does not expect the
   costs to be incurred over the next two years to have a material effect on
   its financial position or results of operations.  The amount expensed in
   1997 was not material.

   Environmental

   The company's operations are governed by a number of federal, state and
   local environmental laws concerning the generation and management of
   hazardous materials, the discharge of pollutants into the environment and
   remediation of sites owned by the company or third parties.  The company
   has expended substantial financial and managerial resources complying with
   such laws.  Expenditures related to environmental matters were not
   material in 1997 and are not expected to be material in any single year. 
   Although the company believes that its operations are in compliance with
   such laws and maintains procedures designed to maintain compliance, there
   are no assurances that substantial additional costs for compliance will
   not be incurred in the future.  However, since the company's competitors
   are governed by the same laws, the company should not be placed at a
   competitive disadvantage.

   Forward Looking Statements

   Certain statements in this report are forward-looking statements. 
   Although the company believes that its expectations are based upon
   reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge of its business,
   there can be no assurance that the company's financial goals will be
   realized.  Although a significant portion of the company's sales are
   derived from the replacement of previously installed product and such
   sales are therefore less volatile, numerous factors may affect the
   company's actual results and may cause results to differ materially from
   those expressed in forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the
   company.  Among such numerous factors the company includes the continued
   strong growth of the worldwide heating, ventilating and air conditioning
   market, the stability of the pricing environment for residential water
   heaters and the successful implementation of the company's joint venture
   strategies in China.

               NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

   1.  Organization and Significant Accounting Policies

   Organization.  A.O. Smith Corporation is a diversified manufacturer
   serving customers world-wide.  The corporation's major product lines
   include: fractional horsepower and hermetic electric motors; residential
   and commercial water heaters; fiberglass piping systems and water, waste
   water, and dry storage tanks.  The corporation's products are marketed
   primarily in North America.  The corporation has two plants in Europe and
   two joint ventures in China.  Original equipment manufacturers are the
   largest customers of the electric motor technologies unit.  Water heaters
   are distributed principally through a diverse network of plumbing
   wholesalers.  Fiberglass piping is sold through a network of distributors
   to the service station market and the petroleum production industry as
   well as the chemical/industrial market.  The corporation's storage tanks
   and handling systems are sold through a network of dealers to
   municipalities, industrial concerns, and farmers.  As discussed in Note 2,
   the operations of the automotive products business are classified as
   discontinued operations.

   Consolidation and basis of presentation.  The consolidated financial
   statements include the accounts of the corporation and its wholly-owned
   subsidiaries.

   Investments in joint ventures.  The Corporation has two joint ventures in
   the Peoples Republic of China, which are accounted for under the equity
   method.  The corporation holds a majority interest in each.  The joint
   ventures are involved in the manufacture and distribution of products
   similar to those of the corporation's water systems and storage and fluid
   handling technologies businesses.

   Use of estimates.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity
   with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
   estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
   financial statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results could differ
   from those estimates.

   Fair values.  The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
   receivable and payable, and long-term borrowings approximated fair value
   as of December 31, 1997 and 1996.

   Foreign currency translation.  For all subsidiaries outside the United
   States with the exception of Mexico, the corporation uses the local
   currency as the functional currency.  For these operations, assets and
   liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates
   and weighted average exchange rates are used for revenues and expenses. 
   The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component
   of stockholders' equity.  Gains and losses from foreign currency
   transactions are included in net earnings.  

   Cash and cash equivalents.  The Company considers all highly liquid
   investments, generally with a maturity of three months or less when
   purchased to be cash equivalents.  Cash equivalents consisting principally
   of money market funds, totaled $140 million at December 31, 1997.  The
   cost of these securities are considered to be "available for sale" for
   financial reporting purposes.

   Inventory valuation.  Inventories are carried at lower of cost or market. 
   Cost is determined on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for a
   significant portion of domestic inventories.  Inventories of foreign
   subsidiaries and supplies are determined using the first-in, first-out
   (FIFO) method.

   Derivative instruments.  The corporation enters into futures contracts to
   fix the cost of certain raw material purchases, principally copper and
   aluminum, with the objective of minimizing cost risk due to market
   fluctuations.  Any differences between the corporation's fixed price and
   current market prices are included as part of the inventory cost when the
   contracts mature.  As of December 31, 1997, the corporation had contracts
   covering the majority of its expected copper and aluminum requirements for
   1998, with varying maturities in 1998, the longest duration of which is
   December 1998.  These futures contracts limit the impact from both
   favorable and unfavorable price changes.  The effect of these programs was
   not material to the results of operations for the three years ended
   December 31, 1997.

   As a result of having various foreign operations, the corporation is
   exposed to the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the U.S.
   dollar value of its foreign subsidiaries.  Further, the corporation and
   its subsidiaries conduct business in various foreign currencies.  To
   minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on its income, the
   corporation enters into foreign currency forward contracts.  The contracts
   are used to hedge known foreign currency transactions on a continuing
   basis for periods consistent with the corporation's exposures.

   The corporation does not engage in speculation. The difference between
   market and contract rates is recognized in the same period in which gains
   or losses from the transactions being hedged are recognized.  The
   contracts, which are executed with major financial institutions, generally
   mature within one year with no credit loss anticipated for failure of the
   counterparties to perform.

   The following table summarizes, by currency, the contractual amounts of
   the corporation's forward exchange contracts.

                                  =========     ========  ========  ========

   The contracts in place at December 31, 1997 and 1996 amounted to
   approximately 80 and 60 percent, respectively, of the corporation's
   anticipated subsequent year exposure for those currencies hedged.

   Goodwill.  Goodwill, representing the excess of cost over net assets of
   businesses acquired, is stated at cost and is amortized on a straight line
   basis over periods of 15 to 40 years.  The corporation reviews the
   recoverability of goodwill when events and circumstances so indicate. 
   Amortization charged to operations amounted to $1.4 million and $.5
   million in 1997 and 1996, respectively.

   Property, plant, and equipment.  Property, plant, and equipment are stated
   at cost.  Depreciation is computed primarily by the straight-line method.

   Revenue recognition.  The corporation recognizes revenue upon shipment of
   product to the customer.

   Research and development.  Research and development costs are charged to
   expense as incurred and amounted to approximately $17.2, $17.3, and $15.0
   million for continuing operations during 1997, 1996, and 1995,
   respectively.

   Environmental remediation costs.  The corporation accrues for losses
   associated with environmental obligations when such losses are probable
   and reasonably estimable.  Costs of future expenditures are not discounted
   to their present value.  Recoveries of environmental remediation costs
   from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed
   probable.  The accruals are adjusted as further information develops or
   circumstances change.

   Earnings per share of common stock.  The corporation has adopted Statement
   of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 128, "Earnings Per Share,"
   which replaced the calculation of primary and fully diluted earnings  per
   share with basic and diluted earnings per share.  All earnings per share
   amounts for all periods have been restated to conform to the SFAS No.128

   New accounting standards.  In June 1997, the Financial Accounting
   Standards Board issued SFAS No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income,"
   which establishes the standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive
   income and its components (revenues, expenses, gains, and losses) as part
   of a full set of financial statements.  This statement requires that all
   elements of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that
   is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements. The
   statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997. 
   Since this statement applies only to the presentation of comprehensive
   income, it will not have any impact on the corporation's results of
   operations, financial position or cash flows.

   In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board also issued SFAS
   No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
   Information," which establishes the standards for the manner in which
   public enterprises are required to report financial and descriptive
   information about their operating segments.  The statement defines
   operating segments as components of an enterprise for which separate
   financial information is available and evaluated regularly as a means for
   assessing segment performance and allocating resources to segments.  A
   measure of profit or loss, total assets, and other related information are
   required to be disclosed for each operating segment.  In addition, this
   statement requires the annual disclosure of information concerning
   revenues derived from the enterprise's products or services, countries in
   which it earns revenue or holds assets, and major customers.  The
   statement is also effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
   1997.  The adoption of SFAS No. 131 will not affect the corporation's
   results of operations or financial position, but may affect the disclosure
   of segment information.

   2.  Discontinued Operations

   On April 18, 1997, the corporation sold its automotive products business,
   excluding its Mexican automotive affiliate, for $710 million.  On October
   1, 1997, the corporation sold the remainder of its automotive business
   with the sale of its 40% interest in its Mexican affiliate for $63
   million.  The results of the automotive businesses have been reported
   separately as discontinued operations and prior year consolidated
   financial statements have been restated.

   Liabilities of the discontinued business at December 31, 1997 consist
   primarily of employee obligations such as workers' compensation and other
   future estimated costs net of deferred income taxes.  Certain expenses
   have been allocated to the discontinued operations through the date of
   sale, including interest expense, which was allocated based on the ratio
   of net assets discontinued to the total consolidated net assets of the
   corporation.

   3.  Acquisitions 

   On March 31, 1997, the corporation acquired the business of UPPCO,
   Incorporated (UPPCO), a manufacturer of subfractional C-frame electric
   motors, for approximately $60.9 million.  On December 6, 1995, the
   corporation acquired the stock of Peabody TecTank Inc. (TecTank), a
   manufacturer of dry bulk storage tanks, for approximately $19.1 million,
   which included a final purchase price adjustment of $1.1 million in 1996. 
   The transactions were accounted for as purchases and the consolidated
   financial statements include the results of UPPCO and TecTank from the
   respective dates of acquisition.  The purchase prices have been allocated
   to the assets purchased and the liabilities assumed based upon their
   respective fair values at the date of acquisition.  The excess of the
   purchase prices over the fair values of net assets acquired, $46.2 million
   and $7.0 million for UPPCO and TecTank, respectively, have been recorded
   as goodwill.  The proforma effect of the acquisitions would not be
   significant to 1997, 1996 or 1995 operating results.

   The corporation has a multi-year revolving credit agreement with a group
   of ten banks which expires June 30, 2001.  Due to its significant cash and
   cash equivalent balances, the corporation elected to reduce this available
   facility from $210 million to $100 million effective September 30, 1997. 
   At its option, the corporation maintains either cash balances or pays fees
   for bank credit and services.

   The corporation's credit agreement and term loans contain certain
   conditions and provisions which restrict the corporation's payment of
   dividends.  Under the most restrictive of these provisions, retained
   earnings of $86.6 million were unrestricted as of December 31, 1997.

   Borrowings under the bank credit lines and in the commercial paper market
   are supported by the revolving credit agreement and accordingly have been
   classified as long-term.  It has been the corporation's practice to renew
   or replace the credit agreement so as to maintain the availability of debt
   on a long-term basis and to provide 100 percent backup for its borrowings
   in the commercial paper market.

   Long-term debt, maturing within each of the five years subsequent to
   December 31, 1997, is as follows:    1998--$5.6; 1999--$4.6; 2000--$9.6;
   2001--$11.1; 2002--$13.3 million.

   Future minimum payments under noncancelable operating leases from
   continuing operations total $30.8 million and are due as follows:  1998--
   $8.1; 1999--$6.8; 2000--$4.4; 2001--$3.8; 2002--$2.7; thereafter--$5.0
   million. Rent expense for continuing operations, including payments under
   operating leases, was $12.9, $12.1, and $10.3 million in 1997, 1996, and
   1995, respectively.

   Interest paid by the corporation for continuing and discontinued
   operations, was $13.0, $15.1, and $13.1 million in 1997, 1996, and 1995,
   respectively.

   8.  Stockholders' Equity

   The corporation's authorized capital consists of 3 million shares of
   Preferred Stock $1 par value, 14 million shares of Class A Common Stock $5
   par value and 60 million shares of Common Stock $1 par value.  The Common
   Stock has equal dividend rights with Class A Common Stock and is entitled,
   as a class, to elect 25 percent of the board of directors and has 1/10th
   vote per share on all other matters.

   During 1997, 1996, and 1995, 7,300, 42,443, and 146,940 shares of Class A
   Common Stock were converted into Common Stock, respectively.  Regular
   dividends paid on the Class A Common and Common Stock amounted to $.68,
   $.66, and $.58 per share in 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively.

   Changes in certain components of stockholders' equity are as follows:
 
   

   On January 27, 1997, the corporation's Board of Directors approved for
   repurchase 3 million shares of Common Stock.  On June 10, 1997 and
   December 9, 1997, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $80 million
   and $50 million, respectively, of additional Common Stock.  During 1997,
   the corporation purchased 14,500 shares of Class A Common Stock and
   4,807,375 shares of Common Stock.  At December 31, 1997, 17,960 and
   5,392,894 shares of Class A Common Stock and Common Stock, respectively,
   were held as treasury stock.

   9. Stock Options

   The corporation has a Long-Term Executive Incentive Compensation Plan
   (1990 Plan) under which 2 million shares of Common Stock for granting of
   nonqualified and incentive stock options have been reserved.  In addition,
   the corporation has a Long-Term Executive Incentive Compensation Plan
   (1980 Plan) which has terminated except as to outstanding options. 
   Options under both plans become exercisable one year from date of grant
   and, for active employees, expire ten years after date of grant.  The
   number of shares available for granting of options at December 31, 1997,
   1996, and 1995 was 147,700, 264,400, and 470,500, respectively.


   Changes in option shares (all Common Stock) were as follows:

   

   

   Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, "Accounting
   for Stock-Based Compensation," encourages, but does not require companies
   to record compensation cost for stock-based employee compensation plans at
   fair value.  The corporation has chosen to continue applying Accounting
   Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to
   Employees," and related interpretations in accounting for its stock option
   plans.  Accordingly, because the exercise price of the stock options
   equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant , no
   compensation expense has been recognized.  Had compensation cost been
   determined based upon the fair value at the grant date for awards under
   the plans based on the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the corporation's pro
   forma net earnings and pro forma net earnings per share would have been as
   follows:

   The weighted-average fair value per option at the date of grant during
   1997, 1996,and 1995 using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, was
   $11.27, $7.45 and $7.48, respectively.  Assumptions were as follows:

   10. Retirement Plans

   The corporation and its domestic subsidiaries provide retirement benefits
   for all employees.  As of December 31, 1995, the corporation merged its
   various qualified noncontributory defined benefit plans in the United
   States into one pension plan.  Benefits for salaried employees are based
   on an employee's years of service and compensation.  Benefits for hourly
   employees are generally based on specified benefit rates for each year of
   service.  The corporation's funding policy is to contribute amounts which
   are actuarially determined to provide sufficient assets to meet future
   benefit payment requirements consistent with the funding requirements of
   federal laws and regulations.  Plan assets consist primarily of marketable
   equities and debt securities.  The corporation also has several foreign
   pension plans, none of which are material to the corporation's financial
   position.
   
   The following tables present the components of pension income, the funded
   status, and the major assumptions used to determine these amounts for
   domestic pension plans of continuing operations.

   

   The pension income data presented above is for continuing operations.
   Pursuant to the agreement to sell the automotive products operations, the
   corporation retained all existing pension assets as well as all pension
   liabilities earned through the closing date.  Accordingly, investment
   return on these assets and interest cost on the obligation is included in
   the calculation of net periodic pension income for 1997, whereas, such
   amounts prior to the sale were excluded as they were allocated to the
   components of discontinued operations pension expense.  Subsequent to the
   closing date, the buyer assumed the responsibility for pension service
   earned by active employees of the automotive business.

   Net periodic pension cost is determined using the assumptions as of the

   assumptions as of the end of the year.

   The corporation has a defined contribution profit sharing and retirement
   plan covering salaried nonunion employees which provides for annual
   corporate contributions of 35 percent to 140 percent of qualifying
   contributions made by participating employees.  The amount of the
   corporation's contribution in excess of 35 percent is dependent upon the
   corporation's profitability.  The corporation's contribution including for
   discontinued operations through date of sale was $3.5, $5.3, and $5.2
   million for 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively.

   Postretirement Benefits other than Pensions

   The corporation has several unfunded defined benefit postretirement plans
   covering certain hourly and salaried employees which provide medical and
   life insurance benefits from retirement to age 65.  Salaried employees
   retiring after January 1, 1995 are covered by an unfunded defined
   contribution plan with benefits based on years of service.  Certain hourly
   employees retiring after January 1, 1996 will be subject to a maximum
   annual benefit limit.  Salaried employees hired after December 31, 1993
   are not eligible for postretirement medical benefits.

   Pursuant to the agreement to sell the automotive products operations,
   effective with the closing date, the buyer assumed all obligations for all
   postretirement benefits other than pensions.

   Net periodic postretirement benefit cost of continuing operations included
   the following components:

   The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated
   postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) is 6 percent.  The weighted
   average discount rate used in determining the APBO was 7.25 and 8.00
   percent at December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively.  If the health care
   cost trend rate was increased by 1 percent, the APBO at December 31, 1997
   would increase by $.6 million and net periodic postretirement benefit cost
   for 1997 would increase by $.1 million.

   11.  Income Taxes

   The components of the provision for income taxes of continuing operations
   consisted of the following:

   The domestic and foreign components of income from continuing operations
   before income taxes were as follows:

   Total taxes paid by the corporation including for discontinued operations
   amounted to $133.6, $29.9, and $25.2 million in 1997, 1996, and 1995,
   respectively.

   No provision for U.S. income taxes has been made on the undistributed
   earnings of foreign subsidiaries as such earnings are considered to be
   permanently invested.  At December 31, 1997, the undistributed earnings
   amounted to $15.7 million.  It is not practical to determine the income
   tax liability that would result had such earnings been repatriated.

   The approximate tax effects of temporary differences between income tax
   and financial reporting of continuing operations are as follows:

   12.   Litigation and Insurance Matters

   The corporation is involved in various unresolved legal actions,
   administrative proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of its
   business involving product liability, property damage, insurance coverage,
   patents and environmental matters including the disposal of hazardous
   waste.  Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome
   of these unresolved legal actions or the range of possible loss or
   recovery, the corporation believes these unresolved legal actions will not
   have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. 
   The following paragraphs summarize noteworthy actions and proceedings.

   A lawsuit for damages and declaratory judgments in the Circuit Court of
   Milwaukee County, State of Wisconsin, in which the corporation and
   Harvestore are plaintiffs is pending against three insurance companies for
   failure to pay in accordance with liability insurance policies issued to
   the corporation.  The insurers have failed to pay, in full or in part,
   certain judgments, settlements and defense costs incurred in connection
   with closed lawsuits alleging damages for economic losses claimed to have
   arisen out of alleged defects in Harvestore animal feed storage equipment. 
   The court granted the corporation partial summary judgment against two of
   the insurers which have appealed that ruling to the Wisconsin Court of
   Appeals.  In the interim, discovery is continuing.  While the corporation
   has, in part, assumed applicability of this coverage, an adverse judgment
   should not be material to its financial condition.

   As part of its routine business operations, the corporation disposes of
   and recycles or reclaims certain industrial waste materials, chemicals and
   solvents at disposal and recycling facilities which are licensed by
   appropriate federal, state and local agencies and are owned and operated
   by third parties unrelated to the corporation.  In some instances, when
   those facilities are operated such that hazardous substances contaminate
   the soil and groundwater, the United States Environmental Protection
   Agency ("EPA") will designate the contaminated sites as Superfund sites,
   and will designate those parties which are believed to have contributed
   hazardous materials to the sites as potentially responsible parties
   ("PRPs").  Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
   and Liability Act (the "Superfund" law) and similar state laws, each PRP
   that contributed hazardous substances to a Superfund site may be jointly
   and severally liable for the costs associated with cleaning up the site. 
   Typically, PRPs negotiate with the EPA and those state environmental
   agencies that are involved in the matter regarding the selection and
   implementation of a plan to clean up the Superfund site and the terms and
   conditions under which the PRPs will be involved in the process.  PRPs
   also negotiate with each other regarding allocation of each PRP's share of
   the clean up costs.
     
   One such site is a former mining site in Colorado.  The corporation held
   the majority of stock of a Colorado mining operation for a period of time
   beginning in 1936 and ending in 1942.  Because of that stock ownership,
   the corporation was notified by the EPA in March, 1993 that it is a PRP at
   the site.  Estimates of clean up costs at this site have been as high as
   $150,000,000.  The corporation believes that a large majority of those
   costs relate to contamination caused by a corporation that worked the mine
   in the 1980s and continues to maintain that it has valid defenses to any
   liability at this site.  While it is impossible at this time to reasonably
   estimate the corporation's liability at this site, if any, it is
   anticipated that the corporation's liability at the site will not be
   material because the EPA continues to treat the corporation as a potential
   de minimis party.

   The corporation is currently involved as a PRP in judicial and
   administrative proceedings initiated on behalf of the EPA seeking to clean
   up the environment and to recover costs it has or will incur as a result
   of the clean up at a total of fourteen Superfund sites.  Certain state
   environmental agencies have also asserted claims to recover their clean up
   costs in some of these actions.  Further, a claim has been asserted by the
   owner of a landfill which has been designated as a Superfund site to
   recover part of the owner's costs to remediate the site from the
   corporation and several other parties that are alleged to have contributed
   materials to the site.

   The corporation has compiled available information concerning costs
   associated with remediation at these sites. It is impossible at this time
   to estimate the total cost of remediation for all of the sites, or the
   corporation's ultimate share of those costs, for a variety of reasons. 
   Many of the reasons are related to the fact that the sites are in various
   stages of the remediation process.  Of the costs the corporation has been
   able to identify, the corporation estimates the share for which it is or
   may be responsible is approximately $7.9 million.  The corporation and its
   insurance companies have paid $7.2 million of that amount and the balance
   is adequately covered through insurance and reserves established by the
   corporation.  To the best of the corporation's knowledge, the insurers
   have the financial ability to pay any such covered claims and there are
   viable PRPs at each of the sites which have the financial ability to pay
   their respective shares of liability at the sites.

   With respect to non-environmental claims, the corporation has self-insured
   a portion of its product liability loss exposure and other business risks
   for many years. The corporation has established reserves which it believes
   are adequate to cover incurred claims.  For the year ended December 31,
   1997, the corporation had $60 million of third-party product liability
   insurance for individual losses in excess of $1.5 million and for
   aggregate losses in excess of $10 million.

   The corporation reevaluates its exposure on claims periodically and makes
   adjustments to its reserves as appropriate.
