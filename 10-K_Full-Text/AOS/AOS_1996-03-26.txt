                                     PART I

   ITEM 1 - BUSINESS

   A. O. Smith Corporation, a Delaware corporation organized in 1916, its
   subsidiaries and its affiliates (hereafter collectively called the
   "Corporation" unless the context otherwise requires) are engaged in four
   business segments.  These segments are Original Equipment Manufacturer
   ("OEM") Products, Water Products, Fiberglass Products, and Other Products.

   The corporation's principal OEM Products business is the Automotive
   Products Company, a supplier of truck and automobile structural components
   and assemblies.  OEM Products also includes the Electrical Products
   Company which produces fractional horsepower and hermetic electric motors. 
   The Water Products Company is a leading manufacturer of residential and
   commercial gas, oil, and electric water heating systems.  Smith Fiberglass
   Products Inc. (Smith Fiberglass) manufactures reinforced thermosetting
   resin piping. Other Products consists of three units.  A. O. Smith
   Harvestore Products, Inc. (Harvestore) is a manufacturer of agricultural
   feed storage and handling systems, for which AgriStor Credit Corporation
   (AgriStor) provides financing, and industrial and municipal water and bulk
   storage systems.  The corporation intends to sell the agricultural
   business and is in the process of liquidating AgriStor.  In December of
   1995 the corporation expanded its presence in the environmental bulk
   storage tank business with the purchase of Peabody TecTank, Inc.
   (TecTank).  TecTank is a manufacturer of epoxy-coated steel and aluminum
   storage tanks primarily used in industrial, food processing, water, and
   waste water applications. Information regarding industry segments is
   provided in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements which appear
   elsewhere herein.

   The following table summarizes revenues by segment for the corporation's
   operations.  This segment summary and all other information presented in
   this section should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial
   Statements and the Notes thereto which appear elsewhere herein.

   OEM PRODUCTS
   Automotive Products

   Automotive sales in 1995 of $845.3 million, or 55 percent of total
   corporation revenues, increased 17 percent from previous year sales.  This
   was due to continued strength in the North American market for both the
   light and heavy truck segments.  Automotive Products had product on six of
   the top seven selling vehicles sold in the U.S. in 1995.

   Automotive Products has contracts, some of which are subject to economic
   price adjustments, to supply frame assemblies and components to Ford,
   Chrysler, and General Motors in the passenger car and light truck class. 
   Because of the importance of light vehicle sales to this unit, it is
   affected by general business conditions in the North American automotive
   industry.  The company is also a supplier of truck frames to most domestic
   producers of medium and heavy-duty trucks, such as Ford, Navistar
   International, Freightliner, and Paccar.

   The largest product group within Automotive Products continues to be truck
   frames and components which accounted for 79 percent of Automotive
   Products' sales and almost 43 percent of the corporation's revenues.  The
   company continues to hold its lead position in truck frame manufacturing
   in the United States and Canada, supplying nearly 40 percent of the 1995
   market.

   In 1995, the Milwaukee, Wisconsin plant began shipping full frame
   assemblies for the new Chevrolet Tahoe/GMC Yukon and the extended cab
   version of the Dodge Ram pickup truck.  The Granite City, Illinois plant
   began producing engine cradles for the redesigned Ford Taurus/Mercury
   Sable and the Milan, Tennessee plant began shipping side rail assemblies
   for the Nissan pickup.

   Automotive Products reached an agreement in 1995 to establish a joint
   venture in Changchun, China, with First Auto Works and Golden Lion Group
   to produce automotive structures.  A. O. Smith is the majority owner in
   the venture and will begin producing components in January of 1997.

   In 1996, the company plans two new product programs and three major
   redesign programs. In the first quarter, production will begin on frame
   rails for the new Nissan pickup truck followed by production to support
   Volvo/GM's new Class 8 heavy truck in the third quarter. The Volvo custom
   frame rails will be fabricated at a new regional assembly plant in
   Roanoke, Virginia. Major redesign programs include suspension links on the
   1997 Camry, full frame for the Econoline/Club Wagon, and the full frame
   for the Dakota Pickup. Assembly for the Dakota pickup will be at a new
   regional plant in Plymouth, Michigan.

   The company's products are sold in competitive markets with its principal
   competitors including Dana Corporation, Magna International, and
   integrated units of Ford, Chrysler, and General Motors.

   The following table summarizes sales to the company's three largest
   automotive customers:

                               Years Ended December 31(Dollars in Millions)

   Electrical Products

   Sales of electric motors increased by $36.1 million or 13% in 1995 to
   $317.3 million.  The increased volume came primarily as a result of strong
   market demand for hermetic motors and sales growth in the export segment. 
   Sales of motors were up for heating, ventilating and air conditioning, for
   both original equipment and replacement customers as a result of growing
   demand in 1995. The manufacturing operations handled the increased volume
   without disproportionate increases in costs.

   The company's product lines include jet pump motors sold to manufacturers
   of home water systems, swimming pools, hot tubs and spas; and fan motors
   used in furnaces, air conditioners, and blowers, as well as fractional
   horsepower motors used in other consumer products.  Hermetic motors are
   sold worldwide to manufacturers of compressors and are used in air
   conditioning and refrigeration systems.  In addition to selling its
   products directly to OEMs, Electrical Products also markets its products
   through a distributor network which sells to both OEMs and the related
   after-market.  The company estimates that approximately one half of the
   market is derived from the less cyclical replacement business with the
   remainder being impacted by general business conditions in the new
   construction market.

   The company's principal products are sold in competitive markets with its
   major competitors being Emerson Electric, General Electric, Magnetek,
   Inc., Fasco, and vertically integrated customers.

   WATER PRODUCTS

   Sales in 1995 were a record $276 million, increasing slightly from $271.5
   million in 1994, which represents 18 percent of total corporation
   revenues. The company capitalized on its strong wholesale channels to
   improve market share in the commercial water heater industry.

   Water Products markets residential gas and electric water heaters through
   a diverse network of plumbing wholesalers in the United States.  The
   majority of Water Products' sales is in the less cyclical replacement
   market although the new housing market is an important segment as well. 
   The residential water heater market remains highly competitive with Water
   Products and three other manufacturers supplying over 90 percent of market
   requirements.

   Water Products markets commercial water heating systems through a diverse
   network of plumbing wholesalers in the United States and Canada. 
   Commercial water heating systems are used in a wide range of applications
   including schools, nursing homes, hospitals, prisons, hotels, motels,
   laundries, restaurants, stadiums, amusement parks, car washes, and other
   large users of hot water.  The commercial market is characterized by
   competition from a broader range of products and competitors than occurs
   in the residential market.

   Water Products Company established a joint venture with Nanjing Water
   Heater Company of China to manufacture instantaneous and storage type
   heaters for the Chinese market.  Water Products Company is a majority
   owner of the venture, which is scheduled to begin operation in early 1996.

   The principal competitors in the Water Products segment are Rheem
   Manufacturing, State Industries, The American Water Heater Group (formerly
   SABH, Inc.) and Bradford-White.  Water Products is the largest
   manufacturer of commercial water heaters and is a major manufacturer of
   residential water heaters in the United States.

   FIBERGLASS PRODUCTS

   Smith Fiberglass sales totaled $58.6 million in 1995; up slightly from
   1994 sales of $57.9 million.  Sales to the international petroleum
   industry were strong during 1995.  This was offset by the continuing
   effects of strong competition in the service station market.

   Smith Fiberglass manufactures reinforced thermosetting resin piping and
   fittings used to carry corrosive materials.  Typical applications include
   chemical and industrial plant piping, oil field piping, and underground
   distribution at gasoline service stations.  Smith Fiberglass also
   manufactures high pressure fiberglass piping systems used in the petroleum
   production industry.  Its products are sold through a network of
   distributors.

   Smith Fiberglass has formed a joint venture with Harbin Composites
   Corporation of Harbin, China to supply fiberglass pipe to the Chinese oil
   industry. Smith Fiberglass is a majority owner of the new venture, which
   is scheduled to begin production in early 1996.

   The company's principal products are sold in competitive markets with its
   major competitors being Ameron Corporation, Fibercast Company, Environ
   Corporation, and Total Containment Corporation.

   OTHER PRODUCTS

   Other Products includes Harvestore, AgriStor, and TecTank.  Harvestore
   sales in 1995 were $40.6 million, which were about 9 percent higher than
   1994 sales of $37.4 million.  The increase was attributable to demand for
   waste water storage systems due to growing environmental concerns.
   AgriStor revenues in 1995 were $2.8 million, down 3 percent from $2.9
   million in 1994.  The lower revenues resulted from a decline in the size
   of AgriStor's lending portfolio and represents management's continued
   progress toward its goal to liquidate the agricultural finance business. 

   Harvestore manufactures and markets agricultural feed storage and handling
   systems, and industrial and potable water and bulk storage systems. 
   Harvestore's products are distributed through a network of independent
   dealers.  AgriStor assists farm customers in the financing of
   Harvestore/R/ equipment out of offices in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and
   Columbus, Ohio.

   In December the Corporation purchased TecTank from the Pullman Company. 
   TecTank, with fiscal 1995 sales of $49.0 million, is a manufacturer of
   epoxy-coated steel and aluminum storage tanks primarily used in
   industrial, food processing, water and waste water applications.  It is
   one of the few manufacturers to supply factory-coated tanks to the market
   segments mentioned above.  TecTank will complement Harvestore and provide
   the corporation with a more comprehensive product line for both dry
   storage and liquid storage applications.

   AgriStor competes with other agricultural banks and farm credit service
   companies. Harvestore's and TecTank's products are sold in competitive
   markets that include concrete, site-welded, and bolted tanks. Principal
   competitors include Columbian, Imperial, and Ladig.

   Raw Material

   Raw materials for the corporation's operations, which consist primarily of
   steel, copper, and aluminum, are generally available from several sources
   in adequate quantities.

   Seasonality

   The corporation's third quarter revenues and earnings have traditionally
   been lower than the other quarters due to Automotive Products' model year
   changeovers and customer plant shutdowns.

   Research and Development, Patents and Trademarks

   The corporation conducts new product and process development at its
   Corporate Technology Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and at its operating
   unit locations.  The objective of this activity is to increase the
   competitiveness of A. O. Smith and generate new products to fit the
   corporation's market knowledge.  Total expenditures for research and
   development in 1995, 1994, and 1993 were approximately $9.7 million,
   $9.2 million and $7.6 million, respectively.

   The corporation owns and uses in its businesses various trademarks, trade
   names, patents, trade secrets, and licenses.  While a number of these are
   important to the corporation, it does not consider a material part of its
   business to be dependent on any one of them.

   Employees

   The corporation and its subsidiaries employed approximately 13,000 persons
   in its operations as of December 31, 1995.

   Backlog

   Normally none of the corporation's operations sustain significant
   backlogs.  However, the Automotive Products Company has long term
   contracts to supply parts to the large auto and truck manufacturers.

   Environmental Laws

   Compliance with federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of
   materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of
   the environment has not had a material effect and is not expected to have
   a material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive
   position of the corporation.  See ITEM 3.

   Foreign Sales

   Total export sales from the U.S. were $135 million, $114 million, and $71
   million in 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.  The increase in sales from
   1994 to 1995 was largely attributable to increased exports by Electrical
   Products Company and Harvestore.  The amount of revenue and operating
   profit derived from, or the assets attributable to, sales outside the
   North American geographic area are not a substantial portion of total
   corporation operations.

   ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES

   The corporation manufactures its products in 38 locations worldwide. 
   These facilities have an aggregate floor space of approximately 9,205,000
   square feet, consisting of approximately 7,148,000 square feet owned by
   the corporation and 2,057,000 square feet of leased space.  Thirteen of
   the corporation's facilities are foreign plants with approximately
   1,144,000 square feet of space, including approximately 441,000 square
   feet which are leased.

   The manufacturing plants presently operated by the corporation are listed
   below by industry segment.  This data excludes four plants operated by a
   Mexican affiliate.

   The principal equipment at the corporation's facilities consist of
   presses, welding, machining, slitting and other metal fabricating
   equipment, winding machines, and furnace and painting equipment.  The
   corporation regards its plant and equipment as well-maintained and
   adequate for its needs.  Multishift operations are used where necessary.

   In the fourth quarter of 1995, the Automotive Products Company, Water
   Products Company, and Smith Fiberglass Products Inc. each established a
   majority-owned joint venture in the People's Republic of China.  The
   companies and partners are in the process of making investments in
   facilities.

   In addition, the corporation is in the process of acquiring facilities for
   two new Automotive Products Company plants in Plymouth, Michigan and
   Roanoke, Virginia, with start up of these facilities in 1996.

   ITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

   As of December 31, 1995, the corporation and Harvestore were defendants in
   eight cases alleging damages for economic losses claimed to have arisen
   out of alleged defects in Harvestore animal feed storage equipment.  Some
   plaintiffs are seeking punitive as well as compensatory damages.  The
   corporation believes that a significant number of these claims were
   related to the deteriorated general farm economy.  In 1995, fifteen cases
   were concluded.  The corporation and Harvestore continue to vigorously
   defend these cases.

   Two of the eight pending cases contain class action allegations.  One of
   the cases is a New York state court action which names the corporation,
   Harvestore, and two of its dealers as defendants.  The court has denied
   the plaintiffs' motion to certify the class and has granted the
   defendants' motions dismissing some of the plaintiffs' allegations.  The
   plaintiffs are appealing the court's rulings.

   The second case is pending in the Federal District Court for the Southern
   District of Ohio.  It was filed in August 1992 and the court, in March
   1994, conditionally certified it as a class action on behalf of purchasers
   and lessees of Harvestore structures manufactured by the corporation and
   Harvestore.  A notice of the certification was mailed to the purported
   class members in the third quarter of 1994, with approximately 5,500 "opt
   out" forms being filed with the court, the impact of which is unknown. 
   The court canceled a previously set trial date as a result of motions the
   corporation filed seeking summary judgment or in the alternative
   decertification of the class.  The corporation is awaiting a ruling.

   Based on the facts currently available to management and its prior
   experience with lawsuits alleging damages for economic loss resulting from
   use of the Harvestore animal feed storage equipment, management is
   confident that the class action suits can be defeated and that the
   lawsuits do not represent a material threat to the corporation.  The
   corporation believes that any damages, including any punitive damages,
   arising out of the pending cases are adequately covered by insurance and
   recorded reserves.  No range of reasonably possible losses can be
   estimated because in most instances the complaint is silent as to the
   amount of the claim or states it as an unspecified amount in excess of the
   jurisdictional minimum.  The corporation reevaluates its exposure
   periodically and makes adjustment of its reserves as appropriate.

   A lawsuit for damages and declaratory judgments in the Circuit Court of
   Milwaukee County, State of Wisconsin, in which the corporation and
   Harvestore are plaintiffs is pending against three insurance companies for
   failure to pay in accordance with liability insurance policies issued to
   the corporation.  The insurers have failed to pay, in full or in part,
   certain judgments, settlements and defense costs incurred in connection
   with pending and closed lawsuits alleging damages for economic losses
   claimed to have arisen out of alleged defects in Harvestore animal feed
   storage equipment.  While the corporation has, in part,  assumed
   applicability of this coverage, an adverse judgment should not be material
   to its financial condition.

   As part of its routine business operations, the corporation disposes of
   and recycles or reclaims certain industrial waste materials, chemicals,
   and solvents at disposal and recycling facilities which are licensed by
   appropriate federal, state and local agencies.  In some instances, when
   those facilities are operated such that hazardous substances contaminate
   the soil and groundwater, the United States Environmental Protection
   Agency ("EPA") will designate the contaminated sites as Superfund sites,
   and will designate those parties which are believed to have contributed
   hazardous materials to the sites as potentially responsible parties
   ("PRPs").  Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
   and Liability Act ("CERCLA" or the "Superfund" law) and similar state
   laws, each PRP that contributes hazardous substances to a Superfund site
   is jointly and severally liable for the costs associated with cleaning up
   the site.  Typically, PRPs negotiate with the EPA and those state
   environmental agencies that are involved in the matter regarding the
   selection and implementation of a plan to clean up the Superfund site and
   the terms and conditions under which the PRPs will be involved in the
   process.  PRPs also negotiate with each other regarding allocation of each
   PRP's share of the clean up costs.

   The corporation is currently involved as a PRP in judicial and
   administrative proceedings initiated on behalf of the EPA seeking to clean
   up the environment at seventeen Superfund sites and to recover costs it
   has or will incur as a result of the clean up.   Certain state
   environmental agencies have also asserted claims to recover their clean up
   costs in some of these actions.  The sites are as follows:

        Two separate but related sites in Kentucky involving the same storage
        and disposal operation.  Proceedings were commenced on behalf of the
        EPA in the United States District Court for the District of Kentucky,
        Louisville Division in March 1988 with respect to these sites.  A
        consent decree allocating liability among the PRPs for costs of
        remediation at the sites and the response costs of the EPA and the
        Commonwealth of Kentucky was executed by the corporation in September
        1993.  The consent decree was lodged by the Court in 1994 and the
        corporation paid the entire amount allocated to it as its share of
        the clean up costs.  The corporation remains liable for a share of
        the cost overruns, but none are anticipated at this time.

        A site in Indiana used for storage, treatment, recycling and disposal
        of waste chemicals.  In January 1984, the company and several other
        PRPs became parties to an action that had been pending in the United
        States District Court for the District of Indiana since January 1980
        regarding this site.  In July 1988, the corporation executed a
        consent decree allocating liability among the PRPs for costs of
        remediation at the site and the EPA's response costs.  Remediation is
        well underway at the site.

        A municipal landfill in Michigan is the subject of a proceeding that
        was filed on behalf of the EPA in the United States District Court
        for the Western District of Michigan in this case in April 1991. In
        1994 EPA required actions were taken and point source contaminants
        were removed by the end of the year.  Work to determine the extent to
        which a long-term groundwater remedy may be required began in 1995.

        A county-owned incinerator, ash disposal lagoon, and landfill in
        Ohio.  A proceeding was commenced on behalf of the EPA in the United
        States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Western
        Division regarding this site in December 1989.  A final remedy was
        selected and the consent decree, which was executed by the PRPs and
        the EPA, was entered by the Court in March 1993.  Work on the remedy
        began shortly after the consent decree was entered and has been
        progressing on schedule.

        An industrial and municipal waste landfill in Wisconsin.  Separate
        proceedings commenced on behalf of the EPA and the State of
        Wisconsin in the United States District Court for the Eastern
        District of Wisconsin in November 1991 relative to this site were
        consolidated into a single matter in 1992.  The consent decree
        entered into by the PRPs, the EPA, and the State of Wisconsin divides
        the site into two operable units, the first of which deals with soil
        remediation and an interim groundwater remedy and the second of which
        is anticipated to deal with the long-term groundwater remedy.  The
        cap on the landfill was completed in 1994 and work on the interim
        groundwater remedy is underway.  At this time, the extent to which
        long-term groundwater treatment will be required with respect to the
        second operable unit has not been determined.

        A drum disposal site in Wisconsin.  In September 1992, the
        corporation joined a group of PRPs that attempted to negotiate with
        other PRPs and the EPA to come to agreement as to the respective
        liabilities of the PRPs involved at the site, the implementation of a
        plan to clean up the site, and the terms and conditions under which
        the PRPs would be involved in the process.  In May 1993, after those
        negotiations stalled, the EPA issued an order to 17 of the PRPs, one
        of which was the corporation, under Section 106 of CERCLA requiring
        them to take certain measures to clean up the site.  In 1994 the cap
        on the landfill was completed and construction of the groundwater
        monitoring and treatment system began.  In 1995 the corporation
        settled all of its remaining liability at the site under an agreement
        with two of the major PRPs at the site which have assumed
        responsibility for completing the remediation required by the EPA.

        A former mining site in Colorado.  The corporation held the majority
        of stock of a Colorado mining operation for a period of time
        beginning in 1936 and ending in 1942.  Because of that stock
        ownership, the corporation was notified by the EPA in March 1993 that
        it is a PRP at the site.  Estimates of clean-up costs at this site
        have been as high as $150,000,000.  The corporation believes that a
        large majority of those costs relate to contamination caused by a
        corporation that worked the mine in the 1980s.  In 1995, the EPA made
        an offer to negotiate de minimis settlements with each PRP that
        contributed less than 3% of the hazardous materials to the site.  The
        corporation accepted that offer, and settlement negotiations are
        expected to begin in 1996.  However, the corporation continues to
        maintain that it has valid defenses to any liability at this site. 
        It is impossible at this time to reasonably estimate the
        corporation's liability at this site, if any.

        A drum recycling facility.  In 1992, the EPA commenced an action
        against a small group of PRPs in the United States District Court for
        the Western District of Michigan to recover its response costs and
        require the PRPs to clean up a Superfund site in Michigan.  Those
        PRPs filed a motion for summary judgment in this matter claiming they
        were not responsible for cleaning up the site.  The Court granted the
        motion and the government has appealed.  Those PRPs had previously
        commenced a third party contribution action against approximately
        eighty other parties which were involved at the subject site but were
        not named as defendants in the EPA's action.  The corporation became
        a third party defendant to that action in January 1994.  If the
        summary judgment is upheld by the Court of Appeals, the action
        against the corporation and the other third party defendants will be
        dismissed.

        A site in Wisconsin that was formerly owned and operated by a drum
        recycling facility.  When the property was being developed for
        residential purposes, it was discovered that the site is
        contaminated.  Subsequently, the EPA notified a large group of PRPs
        that did business with the recycler that they are responsible for
        remediating the site.  A PRP group was formed and it has agreed to
        remediate the site.  The corporation joined that group in 1995.  Some
        remedial activities have been performed at the site, but the full
        extent of the contamination and the types of remediation that will be
        required are still being investigated.  It is impossible at this time
        to accurately estimate the total clean-up costs at the site or the
        corporation's liability for those costs, if any.

        Two separate but related sites in Kansas and Missouri involving the
        same PCB treatment business.  In 1995, the corporation received a
        notice from the EPA that it is a PRP at the sites. Information
        concerning the extent of the contamination and the remediation that
        will be required is not available.  According to information the EPA
        made available to the corporation, it is believed that the
        corporation did very little business with the PCB treatment
        operations and may qualify as a de minimis party.

   CERCLA provides that the EPA has authority to enter into de minimis
   settlement agreements with those PRPs that are believed to have
   contributed relatively small ("de minimis") amounts of materials to a
   Superfund site as compared to major contributors at the site.  The
   corporation has settled its liability at sites in Indiana and Arkansas as
   a de minimis party.  Under those settlement agreements, the corporation
   may have additional liability to participate in cleaning up the affected
   site under certain circumstances, such as: changes in the scope of
   remedial action are required to the extent that costs to clean up the site
   are substantially increased, or new information is discovered that
   indicates that the corporation contributed more or different materials to
   the site than was previously believed.  There is no information at this
   time which would indicate that the corporation will incur any material
   additional liability at either site.  Further, the corporation has joined
   with similarly situated PRPs to negotiate settlements as de minimis
   parties at three sites in Indiana and Illinois.

   The corporation has compiled information regarding the cost to clean up
   all of the sites where the corporation has been designated a PRP by the
   EPA or a comparable state agency.  The following estimates include amounts
   that have already been spent at the sites and estimates of amounts that
   will be spent to complete remediation activities.  The corporation
   estimates that the total cost to clean up all of the sites is
   approximately $293.4 million.  The corporation's estimate of the portion
   of the total for which the corporation is or may be responsible is
   approximately $7.3 million, of which $6.2 million has already been paid by
   the corporation and its insurance companies.  The balance of the estimated
   cleanup costs is believed to be adequately covered by insurance and
   reserves which have been established by the corporation.  To the best of
   the corporation's knowledge, the insurers have the financial ability to
   pay any such covered claims.  The corporation reevaluates its exposure
   periodically and makes adjustment of its reserves as appropriate.

   The above cost estimates are not complete.  It is impossible at this time
   to estimate the total cost of remediation for all of the sites, or the
   corporation's ultimate share of those costs, for a variety of reasons. 
   Many of the reasons are related to the fact that the sites are in various
   stages of the remediation process.  For example, the investigation of the
   extent of remediation has not been completed at all sites; at several
   sites the final remedy has not been selected; negotiations concerning the
   corporation's liability relative to the liability of the other PRPs
   continue at some sites; and for others, even though the remedy has been
   selected, final cost estimates have not been determined.  Other
   uncertainties are based upon the current status of the law.  Key issues
   that have not been resolved include the extent to which costs associated
   with the sites are recoverable from insurers, the extent to which joint
   and several liability can be imposed upon PRPs at the various sites, and
   the viability of defenses asserted by the PRPs.  It is impossible to
   determine at this time how the courts will resolve those issues.

   With the exception of the former mining site in Colorado discussed above,
   the amount allocated to the corporation at any specific site, or in the
   aggregate for all sites, is not expected to be material.  Concerning the
   former mining site, a judgment as to materiality is premature given the
   early stage of the investigation, the uncertainty regarding appropriate
   remediation and its costs, and the potential liability of governmental
   agencies in this case.  However, even though the allocation process has
   not been completed at the site and settlement negotiations with the EPA
   have not yet begun, it is anticipated that the corporation's liability at
   the site will not be material because the EPA is treating the corporation
   as a potential de minimis party.

   Over the past several years, the corporation has self-insured a portion of
   its product liability loss exposure and other business risks.  The
   corporation has established reserves which it believes are adequate to
   cover incurred claims.  For the year ended December 31, 1995, the
   corporation had $60 million of third-party product liability insurance for
   individual losses in excess of $1.5 million and for aggregate losses in
   excess of $10 million.

   Statements.

   ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

   A. O. Smith Corporation achieved record earnings of $61.4 million or $2.94
   per share in 1995 versus $57.3 million or $2.75 per share in 1994.  Three
   units, Automotive Products, Electrical Products, and Water Products
   established new sales records in 1995.  Details of individual unit
   performance will be discussed later in this section.

   Working capital at December 31, 1995 was $138.8 million compared to $113.6
   million and $80.7 million at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively. 
   Higher working capital requirements, predominantly accounts receivable and
   customer tooling, supported higher sales in 1995 versus 1994.  Higher
   sales in 1994 versus 1993 also led to increased working capital
   requirements, particularly for accounts receivable, customer tooling and
   inventory, which were modestly offset by related increases in trade
   payables.

   Capital expenditures were $91.0 million in 1995 compared to $76.1 million
   in 1994 and $54.7 million in 1993.  Capital spending in 1995 was higher
   than 1994 levels due principally to new Automotive Products Company
   programs.

   For 1996, the corporation projects capital expenditures, excluding
   investments in joint ventures, to be between $120 and $140 million. A
   significant portion of these expenditures is associated with two new
   Automotive Products Company manufacturing plants in Roanoke, Virginia and
   Plymouth, Michigan.  The corporation anticipates that the majority of the
   planned cash requirements will be funded with cash flow from operations.

   In the fourth quarter of 1995, the corporation established three joint
   ventures in the People's Republic of China.  The corporation will maintain
   the majority interest in each of these businesses.  In addition to the
   above mentioned capital expenditures, the corporation expects to invest
   approximately $25 million  in these ventures in 1996.

   Long-term debt, excluding debt of the finance subsidiary, increased from
   $136.8 million at the end of 1994 to $167.1 million at the end of 1995. 
   The majority of the increase was due to the acquisition of Peabody TecTank
   for approximately $18 million.  The long-term debt of the finance
   subsidiary has been reduced from $29.4 million in 1994 to $23.8 million at
   December 31, 1995, as the planned liquidation of AgriStor Credit
   Corporation continued.  Despite the higher debt level, an increased equity
   base allowed the total debt to total capital ratio, excluding the finance
   subsidiary, to remain relatively constant at 31.5 percent and 31 percent
   in 1995 and 1994, respectively.  Given the capital spending and investment
   activities mentioned above, the corporation projects that the total debt
   to total capital ratio will be higher in 1996, but should return to a
   percentage more in line with recent years in 1997.

   In June 1995, the corporation's multi-year revolving credit agreement was
   increased to $160 million and extended to June 30, 2000.  The amended
   agreement carries lower fees and borrowing costs.

   During 1995, the corporation drew down $60 million of long-term debt under
   various loan facilities.  The notes range in term from ten to fifteen
   years.  During the year, the corporation entered into two loan facilities
   with insurance companies, which as of December 31, 1995, give it the
   ability to borrow up to $80 million.

   The corporation uses futures contracts to fix the cost of portions of its
   expected raw materials needs, primarily for copper and aluminum, with the
   objective of reducing risk due to market price fluctuations.  In addition,
   the corporation enters into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize
   the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on its income.  Differences
   between the corporation's fixed price and current market prices on raw
   materials contracts are included as part of inventory cost when the
   contracts mature.  Differences between the corporation's fixed price and
   current market prices on currency contracts are recognized in the same
   period in which gains or losses from the transactions being hedged are
   recognized and, accordingly, no net gain or loss is realized when
   contracts mature.  The corporation does not engage in speculation in its
   derivatives strategies.  The effect of these programs was not material on
   the results of operations for 1995, 1994, or 1993.

   At the present time, the corporation is not a party to any contracts to
   manage its exposure to interest rate changes related to its borrowing. 
   The corporation does not expect interest rate movements to significantly
   affect its liquidity or operating results in the foreseeable future.  At
   December 31, 1995, the corporation's floating rate debt amounted to 47
   percent of its total debt.

   On December 14, 1994, the A. O. Smith Common Stock (AOS) moved from the
   American Stock Exchange back to the New York Stock Exchange after an
   absence of ten years.  This move was made to enhance the recognition of
   the corporation's Common Stock.

   At its April 6, 1995 meeting, A. O. Smith Corporation's Board of Directors
   increased the regular quarterly dividend by 15 percent to $.15 per share
   on its common stocks (Class A and Common).  The last three quarterly
   dividend payments in 1995 were paid at this rate, resulting in a total of
   $.58 per share being paid versus $.50 per share in 1994.  A. O. Smith
   Corporation has paid dividends on its common stock for 56 consecutive
   years.

   Results of Operations

   Revenues in 1995 were $1.54 billion, achieving record levels for the third
   consecutive year and surpassing 1994 revenues of $1.37 billion by 12.5
   percent and 1993 revenues of $1.19 billion by 29.4 percent.  Despite
   competitive conditions in all of the markets the corporation serves, each
   operating company's sales increased over the prior year.  The most
   significant revenue improvements occurred in the OEM segment of the
   corporation, comprised of the Automotive Products and Electrical Products
   companies, and provided almost 93 percent of the increased revenues in
   1995.

   The corporation's gross profit margin in 1995 was 14.4 percent or one
   percent and one half percent lower than the profit margins experienced in
   1994 and 1993, respectively.  The reduced margin was due mostly to a
   series of one-time unrelated occurrences at the Automotive Products
   Company which more than offset the favorable influence of increased volume
   throughout the corporation.  During 1995, launch costs associated with
   several new product programs had an adverse impact on margins.  The most
   significant decline in margins occurred in the third quarter.  Extremely
   heavy demand at the Automotive Products Company for light and heavy truck
   products created unusual pressures on production schedules, particularly
   at the company's Milwaukee, Wisconsin facilities.  The impact of strong
   demand was accompanied by unprecedented hot weather as well as labor-
   related inefficiencies in its Milwaukee operations.

   Automotive Products Company achieved record sales of $845.3 million in
   1995 surpassing the previous year's record of $722.7 million by $122.6
   million or 17 percent.  Sales in 1993 were $606.3 million.  The record-
   setting sales performance was especially encouraging considering it was
   achieved in a domestic automotive market for light vehicles that decreased
   by approximately three percent from the prior year.  Automotive continues
   to benefit from providing full frame assemblies and other products
   associated with popular models within the light truck segment.  Most of
   the 1995 sales increase was attributable to recent new product programs
   which supply the expanding sport utility market.  Demand within the heavy
   truck market remained strong in 1995 and resulted in record sales for the
   Automotive heavy truck operations.

   Automotive's trend of increasing earnings which commenced in 1991 was
   curtailed in 1995 as operating profits were less than 1994.  The impact of
   the aforementioned product launch costs, record summer heat, unprecedented
   product demand, and labor contract issues presented an obstacle that could
   not be overcome by the increased volume.

   Automotive anticipates that 1996 earnings will benefit from the recently
   ratified, four-year labor agreement.  The new contract should resolve
   labor productivity issues which negatively affected 1995.  Automotive's
   aggressive efforts to expand its presence in the light truck/sport utility
   market, as evidenced by several new product launches and redesign
   programs, and the forecast of a modest recovery in light vehicle sales in
   1996 should also prove beneficial.  The company will be confronted by
   costs related to the start-up of two new regional assembly plants in 1996
   and will be further challenged by the costs associated with new products
   and redesign programs.

   The corporation's 40 percent owned Mexican affiliate, Metalsa, S.A.,
   experienced a very good year.  Equity in earnings was $3.4 million in 1995
   compared to $1.6 million and $2.3 million in 1994 and 1993, respectively.

   A significant portion of Metalsa's sales are for the export market and are
   denominated in U.S. dollars.  Due to increased export shipments and a
   lower cost structure reflecting the benefits of realigned operations, the
   affiliate's results compare positively to 1994. Total sales as expressed
   in dollars were down from 1994 levels as an increase in dollar-
   denominated export sales was not sufficient to offset the decline in
   domestic sales.

   In 1994, Metalsa's sales were approximately the same as the prior year. 
   Earnings in 1994 were lower than 1993 due to restructuring and product
   launch costs.  In 1995, a translation loss of $.5 million was incurred and
   reflected in earnings.  Due to the decline in the value of the peso, in
   late 1994, the corporation recorded a translation adjustment of $7.5
   million in stockholders' equity.  There were no similar adjustments in
   1993, as the value of the peso was fairly constant.

   Electrical Products Company sales in 1995 increased $36.1 million or
   almost 13 percent to a record $317.3 million from 1994 sales of $281.2
   million.  Sales in 1993 were $242.5 million.  The company's major motor
   markets continued to expand in 1995 although the growth exhibited was not
   as strong as was experienced in 1994.  While much of the increased volume
   in 1994 was due to low finished goods levels at which many motor markets
   entered 1994, the increased volume in 1995 was the result of obtaining
   incremental share in several market segments.  Strong global demand for
   compressors bolstered hermetic motor sales significantly in 1995.  The
   company's position as a low-cost producer of fractional horsepower fan
   motors and a revitalized domestic heating, ventilation, and air
   conditioning industry resulted in a double-digit percentage increase over
   the prior year's sales in this segment.  The company's continued focused
   penetration of the international markets provided a 50 percent increase in
   export sales in 1995.  Sales into the motor aftermarket increased
   significantly in 1995 due to new merchandising strategies and favorable
   alignment with several key wholesale distributors.

   Profits for the Electrical Products Company in 1995 demonstrated
   substantial improvement from a relatively good earnings year experienced
   in 1994.  The increase in 1994 earnings over those in 1993 resulted from
   the transfer of production to the company's lower cost facilities which
   occurred in 1993.  During 1995, the company continued its successful
   strategy of concentrating manufacturing activities in the most efficient
   plant locations.  Additionally, the company upgraded capital equipment in
   all of its plant locations resulting in further productivity gains.  This
   combination of significantly higher volumes, concentration of production
   in low cost facilities, and improved technology was responsible for the
   increased earnings in 1995.

   Electrical Products is positioned to surpass 1995's strong performance in
   1996 assuming its ability to retain newly acquired market share and
   continued strong market conditions entering the new year.

   Sales for the Water Products Company were $276.0 million in 1995,
   increasing slightly from $271.5 million in 1994 and establishing a record
   for the fourth consecutive year.  Sales in 1993 were $248.1 million. 
   While sales of residential water heaters in 1994 benefitted from a shift
   in demand to the fourth quarter of that year due to an announced price
   increase effective as of January 1, 1995, sales in early 1995 were
   adversely impacted.  In contrast to the residential inventory situation,
   the commercial water heater industry entered 1995 with low inventory
   levels.  Demand for commercial products in 1995 rebounded from the
   depressed levels experienced in 1994.  The combination of low inventory
   levels at the start of the year and an expanded market, coupled with Water
   Products strong position in the wholesale channels and broad commercial
   product offering resulted in a significant gain in market share in 1995.

   Although total sales increased only modestly in 1995, earnings for the
   Water Products Company were seven percent higher than 1994 and also
   established a record for the fourth consecutive year.  The increased
   volume of the higher-margin commercial product more than offset the
   adverse impact of lower volume and pricing for residential water heaters.

   Water Products anticipates that 1996 will provide further growth in sales
   as the residential market returns to more normal growth patterns and our
   Chinese joint venture begins operations.

   Smith Fiberglass Products Inc. 1995 sales of $58.6 million were modestly
   higher than 1994 sales of $57.9 million and slightly less than the record
   sales of $58.9 million established in 1993.  While sales were at levels
   comparable to the prior two years, the mix among the company's various
   markets was substantially different.  Sales of fiberglass pipe to service
   stations in 1995 were significantly lower than 1994 and were at the lowest
   levels in three years.  This decline in the petroleum marketing segment
   was caused by a significant slowdown in construction, poor weather early
   in the year, and loss of market share to flexible hose products.  Sales to
   the chemical and industrial market increased over the prior two years as
   fiberglass pipe continues to gain acceptance as an alternative to its iron
   and steel counterparts.  Shipments to the domestic petroleum production
   industry showed improvement during the second half of 1995 as a result of
   stable oil prices.  Strong export sales to South American oil fields also
   helped offset declines in the petroleum marketing segment.

   Earnings for Fiberglass Products in 1995 were lower than the previous two
   years.  The higher concentration of sales in the company's lower-margin
   product lines was a major cause of the earnings decline. Additional costs
   associated with establishing a joint venture in China, as well as other
   new marketing initiatives, also affected 1995 earnings.

   Fiberglass Products' projections for 1996 reflect an improvement in
   earnings, however a return to the record earnings level of 1993 is not
   expected.  Most of the growth will come from new corrosion resistant
   product offerings to the chemical and industrial market, an increased
   presence in the international market, and additional export shipments.

   Revenues for the corporation's other operations were $47.6 million in
   1995, an increase of $7.4 million and $9.5 million over 1994 and 1993,
   respectively.  Sales in 1995 for A. O. Smith Harvestore Products, Inc.
   (Harvestore), were $40.6 million, an 8.7 percent increase over 1994 and
   the highest total since 1984. The major growth in sales occurred in the
   municipal and industrial segment of the business where a record for unit
   volume was established in 1995.  Harvestore's agricultural business
   exhibited mixed results in 1995 as sales of its newest chain unloader
   increased 25 percent over 1994 while sales of Slurrystore  structures
   declined after five years of volume growth.  Earnings in 1995 for
   Harvestore were much improved over both 1994 and 1993 as a result of
   higher volume.

   To further expand opportunities in the municipal and industrial storage
   market the corporation acquired Peabody TecTank Inc. from the Pullman
   Company, Inc. in December 1995.  TecTank is a manufacturer of bolted steel
   tanks and shop welded steel, stainless steel, and aluminum tanks.  TecTank
   had sales of $49 million in fiscal 1995 and will more than double the
   corporation's presence in the storage tank market.  Sales and earnings
   since the acquisition of this wholly owned subsidiary have been included
   in the Other Products segment of the corporation and were not significant
   to 1995 results.

   Revenues for AgriStor Credit Corporation were $2.8 million, $2.9 million,
   and $4.8 million in 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.  The trend of
   decreasing revenues is reflective of management's desire to liquidate this
   finance subsidiary.  Interest costs and administrative expenses have
   declined consistently throughout the liquidation process.  The costs
   associated with non-performing contracts were significantly less in 1995
   than 1994, thereby reducing the loss incurred in 1995.

   Management is encouraged by the fact that the Other Products segment of
   the corporation has gone from a net after tax loss of $.17 per share in
   both 1994 and 1993 to break-even in 1995.  The future for this segment of
   the corporation has improved substantially with the aforementioned TecTank
   acquisition increasing penetration of the storage tank market as well as
   providing an expanded international presence with several foreign sales
   offices.

   Selling, general, and administrative (SGA) expense for the corporation in
   1995 was $113.0 million compared to $108.3 million and $96.3 million in
   1994 and 1993, respectively.  The majority of the increase during this
   period was caused by higher employee incentive and profit sharing
   provisions, increased commissions, and other expenses in support of
   additional sales volume.  The amount of increase in SGA in 1995 was
   substantially less than 1994 due to a significant reduction in the amount
   of bad debt expenditures and re-marketing costs associated with
   repossessed equipment incurred by AgriStor Credit Corporation.  As a
   percent of sales, selling, general, and administrative expenses have
   declined steadily from 8.1 percent in 1993 to 7.3 percent in 1995.

   Interest expense increased $1.0 million in 1995 to $13.1 million from
   $12.1 million in 1994.  Interest expense in 1993 was $13.4 million.  The
   increase in interest expense in 1995 reflected higher average interest
   rates.  The decline in interest expense  from 1993 to 1994 was a function
   of lower debt levels.

   The corporation's effective income tax rate decreased to 37.9 percent in
   1995 from 38.3 percent  and 41 percent in 1994 and 1993, respectively. 
   The slight decline in rate in 1995 was caused primarily by lower state
   income and franchise tax provisions and tax benefits associated with the
   corporation's newly created foreign sales corporation.  The relatively
   high rate in 1993 was due to the one percent federal rate increase
   including the cumulative impact on prior years.

   In the fourth quarter of 1995, the Automotive Products Company, Water
   Products Company, and Smith Fiberglass Products Inc. each established a
   joint venture in the People's Republic of China.  The companies and their
   partners are in the process of making the required initial investments. 
   When all the capital contributions and shareholder loans have been made,
   A.O. Smith Corporation will hold a majority interest in each venture.

   In March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
   No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-
   Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," which requires impairment losses to be
   recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of
   impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be
   generated by those assets are less than the assets' carrying amount.
   Statement No. 121 also addresses the accounting for long-lived assets that
   are expected to be disposed of. The corporation will adopt Statement No.
   121 in the first quarter of 1996 and, based on current circumstances, does
   not believe the effect of adoption will be material.

   The corporation has applied Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
   "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees", in accounting for its stock
   option plans.  No decision has been reached as to how the corporation will
   apply, beginning in 1996, recently issued Statement of Financial
   Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation",
   which permits the corporation to continue accounting for stock options in
   the same manner with fair value disclosures or measure compensation cost
   by the fair value of stock options granted.

   The corporation entered 1995 with the aggressive objective of establishing
   record earnings for the third consecutive year.  The goal was achieved, as
   net earnings in 1995 were $61.4 million or $2.94 per share surpassing the
   previous record of $57.3 million or $2.75 per share earned in  1994.  The
   corporation earned $42.7 million or $2.08 per share in 1993.  The record-
   setting performance in 1995 was accomplished despite the challenges
   presented by weather issues, union contract negotiations, and volatile
   Mexican economic conditions.

   The corporation is committed to extending its string of record-setting
   performances in 1996.  Achieving this goal will require successfully
   contending with a new set of challenges including: start-up of the Chinese
   joint ventures and two regional assembly facilities for Automotive
   Products Company; integration of the recently acquired Peabody TecTank
   business; and the introduction of new product programs throughout the
   corporation.

   INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

   The Board of Directors and Stockholders
   A. O. Smith Corporation

   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of A. O. Smith
   Corporation as of December 31, 1995 and 1994 and the related consolidated
   statements of earnings and retained earnings and cash flows for each of
   the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995. Our audits also
   included the financial statement schedule listed in the index in Item
   14(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of
   the corporation's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion
   on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

   We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
   standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
   obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
   free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test
   basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
   statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
   used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
   the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits
   provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
   in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of A. O.
   Smith Corporation at December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the consolidated

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

   1.   Organization and Significant Accounting Policies

   Organization.  A.O. Smith Corporation is a diversified manufacturer
   serving customers world-wide.  The corporation's major product lines
   include:  automotive structural components; fractional horsepower and
   hermetic electric motors; residential and commercial water heaters;
   fiberglass piping systems and water, waste water, and dry storage tanks. 
   The corporation's products are marketed primarily in North America.  The
   major automotive manufacturers and other original equipment manufacturers
   are the largest customers of the automotive and electrical products units. 
   Water heaters are distributed through a diverse network of plumbing
   wholesalers.  Fiberglass piping is sold through a network of distributors
   to the service station market and the petroleum production industry as
   well as the chemical/industrial market.  The corporation's storage tanks
   and handling systems are sold through a network of dealers to
   municipalities, industrial concerns, and farmers.

   Consolidation and basis of presentation.  The consolidated financial
   statements include the accounts of the corporation and its wholly-owned
   subsidiaries and majority owned joint ventures.

   Use of estimates.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity
   with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
   estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
   financial statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results could differ
   from those estimates.

   Foreign currency translation.  For all subsidiaries outside the United
   States with the exception of entities in Mexico, the corporation uses the
   local currency as the functional currency.  For these operations, assets
   and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange
   rates and weighted average exchange rates are used for revenues and
   expenses.  The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a
   separate component of stockholders' equity.  Gains and losses from foreign
   currency transactions are included in net earnings.  For the corporation's
   Mexican affiliate and subsidiaries, the U.S. dollar is used as the
   functional currency.  Accordingly, cash and certain other monetary assets
   and liabilities, such as receivables and payables, and revenues and
   expenses are translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates. 
   Inventories and nonmonetary assets, such as fixed assets, are translated
   into U.S. dollars using historical exchange rates.  The resulting
   translation adjustments and gains and losses from foreign currency
   transactions are reflected in net earnings.

   Inventory valuation.  Inventories are carried at lower of cost or market. 
   Cost is determined on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for a
   significant portion of domestic inventories.  Inventories of foreign
   subsidiaries and supplies are determined using the first-in, first-out
   (FIFO) method.

   Derivative instruments.  The corporation enters into futures contracts to
   fix the cost of certain raw material purchases, principally copper and
   aluminum, with the objective of minimizing cost risk due to market
   fluctuations.  Any differences between the corporation's fixed price and
   current market prices are included as part of the inventory cost when the
   contracts mature.  As of December 31, 1995, the corporation had contracts
   covering the majority of its expected copper and aluminum requirements for
   1996, with varying maturities in 1996, the longest duration of which is
   December 1996.  These futures contracts limit the impact from both
   favorable and unfavorable price changes.

   As a result of having various foreign operations, the corporation is
   exposed to the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the U.S.
   dollar value of its foreign subsidiaries.  Further, the corporation and
   its subsidiaries conduct business in various foreign currencies.  To
   minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on its income, the
   corporation enters into foreign currency forward contracts.  The contracts
   are used to hedge known foreign currency transactions on a continuing
   basis for periods consistent with the corporation's exposures.

   The corporation does not engage in speculation. The difference between
   market and contract rates is recognized in the same period in which gains
   or losses from the transactions being hedged are recognized.  The
   contracts, which are executed with major financial institutions, generally
   mature within one year and no credit loss is anticipated for failure of
   the counterparties to perform.

   The following table summarizes, by currency, the corporation's forward
   exchange contracts.

   The contracts in place at December 31, 1995 and 1994 amounted to
   approximately 35 and 58 percent, respectively, of the corporation's
   anticipated subsequent year exposure for those currencies hedged.

   Property, plant, and equipment.  Property, plant, and equipment are stated
   at cost.  Depreciation is computed primarily by the straight-line method.

   Deferred model change.  Tool costs not reimbursed by customers and
   expenses associated with significant model changes are amortized over the
   estimated model life which ranges from four to ten years, with the shorter
   periods associated with automobile structural components and the longer
   periods associated with structural components for trucks.  

   Finance subsidiary.  Finance charges for retail contracts receivable are
   recognized as income as installments become due using the interest method. 
   For direct finance leases, income is recognized based upon a constant rate
   of return on the unrecovered lease investment over the term of the related
   lease.

   Revenue recognition.  The corporation recognizes revenue upon shipment of
   product to the customer.

   Research and development.  Research and development costs are charged to
   expense as incurred and amounted to approximately $9.7, $9.2, and $7.6
   million during 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.

   Earnings per share of common stock.  Earnings per common share are
   computed using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during
   the year.  The effect of shares issuable under stock compensation plans is
   not significant.

   Reclassifications.  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to
   conform to the 1995 presentation.

   2.   Acquisition and Joint Ventures

   On December 6, 1995, the corporation acquired the stock of Peabody TecTank
   Inc. (TecTank), a manufacturer of environmental bulk storage tanks, for
   approximately $18 million, subject to final adjustment of the purchase
   price.  The transaction has been accounted for as a purchase and the
   consolidated financial statements include the results of TecTank from the
   date of acquisition.  The purchase price has been allocated to the assets
   purchased and the liabilities assumed based upon the respective fair
   values at the date of acquisition.  The excess of the purchase price over
   the fair values of net assets acquired has been recorded as goodwill and
   will be amortized over 15 years.  The allocation is preliminary pending
   completion of an appraisal.  The proforma effect of this acquisition would
   not be significant to either 1995 or 1994 operating results.

   In the fourth quarter of 1995, the corporation established three joint
   ventures in the People's Republic of China.  The corporation and its
   partners are in the process of making their initial investments.  When the
   ventures are completed, the corporation will hold a majority interest in
   each.  In 1995, the corporation's partners contributed to the ventures
   non-cash assets valued at approximately $5.4 million.  The balance sheet
   accounts of the ventures are included in the consolidated financial
   statements with the corporation's partners' pro rata share of the net
   assets reflected as minority interest.  Once operations begin, the
   operating results will be reflected in the Consolidated Statement of
   Earnings to the extent of the corporation's ownership.

   3.   Statement of Cash Flows

   For purposes of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash
   equivalents include investments with original maturities of three months

   5.   Investments in and Advances to Affiliated Companies

   Investments in affiliates in which ownership is 50 percent or less are
   accounted for under the equity method.  The corporation's equity in the
   undistributed earnings of such affiliates at December 31, 1995, amounted
   to approximately $21.5 million.  In 1995, because the Mexican affiliate's
   sales, financing, and certain costs are now primarily U.S. dollar
   denominated, the corporation changed the functional currency for foreign
   currency translation purposes from the Mexican peso to the U.S. dollar. 
   In 1994, due to the decline in the value of the Mexican peso, the
   corporation recorded as a component of stockholders' equity, translation
   adjustments of approximately $7.5 million.  During 1994 and 1993,  the
   corporation received dividends of $.8 and $2.8 million, respectively, from
   such affiliates.

   In June 1995, the corporation's multi-year revolving credit agreement with
   a group of ten banks was increased from $140 million to $160 million and
   extended to June 30, 2000.  The amended agreement carries lower fees and
   borrowing costs.  During 1995, the corporation borrowed $5 million with a
   five year term from one of the banks.  At its option, the corporation
   maintains either cash balances or pays fees for bank credit and services.

   In 1993, the corporation entered into two loan facilities with insurance
   companies totaling $65 million.  Through the expiration of these
   facilities in 1995, the corporation had drawn down $45 million under terms
   ranging from ten to thirteen years.

   In 1995, the corporation entered into two new loan facilities with
   insurance companies totaling $125 million.  Through December 31, 1995, the
   corporation had drawn down, under terms ranging from ten to fifteen years,
   $45 million under these facilities.

   The corporation's credit agreement and term loans contain certain
   conditions and provisions which restrict the corporation's payment of
   dividends.  Under the most restrictive of these provisions, retained
   earnings of $107.3 million were unrestricted as of December 31, 1995.

   Borrowings under the bank credit lines and in the commercial paper market
   are supported by the revolving credit agreement and have been classified
   as long-term.  It has been the corporation's practice to renew or replace
   the credit agreement so as to maintain the availability of debt on a long-
   term basis and to provide 100 percent backup for its borrowings in the
   commercial paper market.

   Long-term debt, maturing within each of the five years subsequent to
   December 31, 1995, is as follows:  1996--$4.9; 1997--$12.0; 1998--$12.2;
   1999--$8.1; 2000--$9.9 million.

   The corporation has an agreement to sell, without recourse and at market
   rates, up to $50 million of certain automotive-related receivables.  The
   corporation sold receivables totaling $41.0 million at December 31, 1995,
   compared to $27.5 million at December 31, 1994.  The receivables sale
   program is scheduled to expire on November 28, 1996, unless mutually
   extended.

   Future minimum payments under noncancelable operating leases total $113.4
   million and are due as follows:  1996--$24.7; 1997--$22.5; 1998--$20.7;
   1999--$16.2; 2000--$7.5; thereafter--$21.8 million.  Rent expense,
   including payments under operating leases, was $31.4, $30.8, and $28.2
   million in 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.

   Interest paid by the corporation, was $13.1, $13.3, and $14.0 million in
   1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.

   8.   Stockholders' Equity

   On April 5, 1995, the corporation's stockholders approved an increase in
   the authorized shares of Class A Common Stock $5 par value from 7 million
   shares to 14 million shares and in the authorized shares of Common Stock
   $1 par value from 24 million shares to 60 million shares.  The Common
   Stock has equal dividend rights with Class A Common Stock and is entitled,
   as a class, to elect 25 percent of the board of directors and has 1/10th
   vote per share on all other matters. As of December 31, 1995, there are
   also 3 million shares of preferred stock $1 par value authorized.

   On February 1, 1993, the Board of Directors declared a special $.25 per
   share dividend to holders of Common Stock.  No special dividend was
   declared on the Class A Common Stock.  During 1993, 2,009,683 shares of
   Class A Common Stock, including 623,362 shares held in Treasury, were
   converted into Common Stock.  An additional 146,940 and 49,304 shares of
   Class A Common Stock were converted into Common Stock during 1995 and
   1994, respectively.  Regular dividends paid on the Class A Common and
   Common Stock amounted to $.58, $.50, and $.42 per share in 1995, 1994, and
   1993, respectively.

   In 1993, 5,930 shares of treasury stock were acquired under a purchase
   offer made to holders of less than 100 shares of Class A Common Stock and
   Common Stock.

   At December 31, 1995, 3,460 and 777,569 shares of Class A Common Stock and
   Common Stock, respectively, were held as treasury stock.

   9.  Stock Options

   During 1990, the corporation adopted a Long-Term Executive Incentive
   Compensation Plan (1990 Plan) which initially reserved 1 million shares of
   Common Stock for granting of nonqualified and incentive stock options.  In
   April 1994, shareholders approved a proposal to reserve an additional 1
   million shares of Common Stock for the 1990 plan.  In addition, the
   corporation has a Long-Term Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (1980
   Plan) which has terminated except as to outstanding options.  Options
   under both plans become exercisable one year from date of grant and, for
   active employees, expire ten years after date of grant.  The number of
   shares available for granting of options at December 31, 1995 and 1994 was
   470,500 and 659,600, respectively.

   Changes in option shares (all Common Stock) were as follows:

   The corporation has applied Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
   "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees", in accounting for its stock
   option plans.  No decision has been reached as to how the corporation will
   apply, beginning in 1996, recently issued Statement of Financial
   Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation",
   which permits the corporation to continue accounting for stock options in
   the same manner with fair value disclosures or measure compensation cost
   by the fair value of stock options granted.

   10.  Retirement Plans

   The corporation and its domestic subsidiaries provide retirement benefits
   for all employees.  As of December 31, 1995, the corporation merged its
   various qualified noncontributory defined benefit plans in the United
   States into one pension plan.  Benefits for salaried employees are based
   on an employee's years of service and compensation.  Benefits for hourly
   employees are generally based on years of service.  The corporation's
   funding policy is to contribute amounts which are actuarially determined
   to provide sufficient assets to meet future benefit payment requirements
   consistent with the funding requirements of federal laws and regulations. 
   Plan assets consist primarily of marketable equities and debt securities. 
   The corporation also has several foreign pension plans, none of which are
   material to the corporation's financial position.

   The following tables present the components of pension expense, the funded
   status, and the major assumptions used to determine these amounts for
   domestic pension plans:

   1/ The provisions of FAS No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions,"
   require the recognition of an additional minimum liability for each
   defined benefit plan for which the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds
   plan assets.  Prior to December 31, 1995, this amount was recorded as a
   long-term liability with an offsetting intangible asset.  Because the
   asset recognized may not exceed the amount of unrecognized prior service
   cost and transition obligation on an individual plan basis, the balance,
   net of tax benefits, was reported as a separate reduction of stockholders'
   equity at December 31, 1994.  As the result of the merger of the various
   plans on December 31, 1995, the corporation no longer has any underfunded
   plans.

   Major assumptions at year-end:
                                                 1995      1994      1993 

   Discount rate                                 7.50%     8.50%     7.75%
   Rate of increase in compensation level        4.00%     4.50%     4.00%
   Expected long-term rate of return on assets  10.25%    10.25%    10.25%

   Net periodic pension cost is determined using the assumptions as of the
   beginning of the year.  The funded status is determined using the
   assumptions as of the end of the year.

   The corporation has a defined contribution profit sharing and retirement
   plan covering salaried nonunion employees which provides for annual
   corporate contributions of 35 percent to 140 percent of qualifying
   contributions made by participating employees.  The amount of the
   corporation's contribution in excess of 35 percent is dependent upon the
   corporation's profitability.  The amount of the contribution was $5.2,
   $5.2, and $4.0 million for 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.

   Postretirement Benefits other than Pensions

   The corporation has several unfunded defined benefit postretirement plans
   covering certain hourly and salaried employees which provide medical and
   life insurance benefits from retirement to age 65.  Salaried employees
   retiring after January 1, 1995 are covered by an unfunded defined
   contribution plan with benefits based on years of service.  Certain hourly
   employees retiring after January 1, 1996 will be subject to a maximum
   annual benefit limit.  Salaried employees hired after December 31, 1993
   are not eligible for postretirement medical benefits.

   Net periodic postretirement benefit cost included the following
   components:

   The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated
   postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) is 6 percent.  The weighted
   average discount rate used in determining the APBO was 7.50 and 8.50
   percent at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.  If the health care
   cost trend rate was increased by 1 percent, the APBO at December 31, 1995
   would increase by $3.7 million and net periodic postretirement benefit
   cost for 1995 would increase by $0.3 million.

   11.  Income Taxes

   The components of the provision for income taxes consisted of the
   following:

   Years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands)                         
                                       1995           1994           1993

   The tax provision differs from the statutory U.S. federal rate due to the
   following items:

                                    =======        =======        =======

   The domestic and foreign components of income from operations before
   income taxes were as follows:

                                    =======        =======        =======

   Taxes paid amounted to $25.2, $21.7, and $12.2 million in 1995, 1994, and
   1993, respectively.

   No provision for U.S. income taxes has been made on the undistributed
   earnings of foreign subsidiaries as such earnings are considered to be
   permanently invested.  At December 31, 1995, the undistributed earnings
   amounted to $17.4 million.  It is not practical to determine the income
   tax liability that would result had such earnings been repatriated.

   No provision for U.S. income taxes has been made on the cumulative net
   translation gains and other items of equity investees.  At December 31,
   1995, the amount of unrecognized U.S. tax liability for the net
   translation gains and other items totaling $9.8 million amounted to $3.4
   million.

   The approximate tax effects of temporary differences between income tax
   and financial reporting are as follows:

  12.  Agricultural Businesses

   The corporation's strategic plan is to concentrate its resources in
   nonagricultural businesses and withdraw from the agricultural market.  The
   strategy includes plans to sell the agricultural business and to phase out
   AgriStor Credit Corporation (AgriStor), a wholly-owned finance subsidiary. 
   It is not possible to predict when the sale of the agricultural business
   will occur.  The corporation is continuing to phase out AgriStor's
   operations in an orderly manner.

   The corporation's consolidated balance sheet includes AgriStor.  A
   condensed consolidated balance sheet of AgriStor is presented below:

   AgriStor was the lessor of Harvestore equipment accounted for as direct
   financing leases.  AgriStor is currently financing under retail
   installment contracts a nominal amount of new and previously owned
   equipment.  There is no quoted market price available for the retail
   contracts and leases.  Management believes fair value approximates book
   value.  While some maturities extend beyond the year 2000, the portfolio
   is predominantly of three to four year duration carrying an average
   interest rate of 7.7 percent.

   The majority of AgriStor's financing needs are provided by the
   corporation.  AgriStor Credit Corporation-Canada (AgriStor Canada) had
   outstanding a $4.1 million Canadian dollar denominated note ($3.0 million
   U.S. dollar equivalent) with a final maturity in 1998.  AgriStor Canada
   also has a $10.0 million Canadian dollar denominated credit facility ($7.3
   million U.S. dollar equivalent) to meet its borrowing needs, none of which
   was outstanding at December 31, 1995.  Long-term debt, excluding financing
   provided by the corporation, maturing subsequent to December 31, 1995, is
   as follows:  1996--$1.0; 1997--$1.0; 1998--$1.0; million.

   A condensed consolidated statement of operations of AgriStor is presented
   below.  The 1995 and 1994 statements of operations reflect repossession
   and contract settlement costs that previously were not recognized until
   final disposition of repossessed structures.

   The finance subsidiary provided cash before financing activities of $8.0,
   $14.5, and $21.4 million in 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.

   13.  Litigation and Insurance Matters

   As of December 31, 1995, the corporation and A. O. Smith Harvestore
   Products, Inc. (Harvestore), a subsidiary of the corporation, were
   defendants in eight cases alleging damages for economic losses claimed to
   have arisen out of alleged defects in Harvestore animal feed storage
   equipment.  Some plaintiffs are seeking punitive as well as compensatory
   damages.  The corporation believes that a significant number of these
   claims were related to the deteriorated general farm economy.  In 1995,
   fifteen cases were concluded.  The corporation and Harvestore continue to
   vigorously defend these cases.

   Two of the eight pending cases contain class action allegations.  One of
   the cases is a New York state court action which names the corporation,
   Harvestore, and two of its dealers as defendants.  The court has denied
   the plaintiffs motion to certify the class and has granted the defendants'
   motions dismissing some of the plaintiffs' allegations.  The plaintiffs
   are appealing the court's rulings.

   The second case is pending in the Federal District Court for the Southern
   District of Ohio.  It was filed in August 1992 and the court, in March
   1994, conditionally certified it as a class action on behalf of purchasers
   and lessees of Harvestore structures manufactured by the corporation and
   Harvestore.  A notice of the certification was mailed to the purported
   class members in the third quarter of 1994, with approximately 5,500 "opt
   out" forms being filed with the court, the impact of which is unknown. 
   The court canceled a previously set trial date as a result of motions the
   corporation filed seeking summary judgment or in the alternative
   decertification of the class.  The corporation is awaiting a ruling.

   Based on the facts currently available to management and its prior
   experience with lawsuits alleging damages for economic loss resulting 
   from use of the Harvestore animal feed storage equipment, management is
   confident that the class action suits can be defeated and that the
   lawsuits do not represent a material threat to the corporation.  The
   corporation believes that any damages, including any punitive damages,
   arising out of the pending cases are adequately covered by insurance and
   recorded reserves.  No range of reasonably possible losses can be
   estimated because in most instances the complaint is silent as to the
   amount of the claim or states it as an unspecified amount in excess of the
   jurisdictional minimum.  The corporation reevaluates its exposure
   periodically and makes adjustment of its reserves as appropriate.

   A lawsuit for damages and declaratory judgments in the Circuit Court of
   Milwaukee County, State of Wisconsin, in which the corporation and
   Harvestore are plaintiffs is pending against three insurance companies for
   failure to pay in accordance with liability insurance policies issued to
   the corporation.  The insurers have failed to pay, in full or part,
   certain judgments, settlements and defense costs incurred in connection
   with pending and closed lawsuits alleging damages for economic losses
   claimed to have arisen out of alleged defects in Harvestore animal feed
   storage equipment.  While the corporation has, in part,  assumed
   applicability of this coverage, an adverse judgment should not be material
   to its financial condition.

   The corporation is involved in other litigation and claims which arise in
   the ordinary course of its business including governmental proceedings
   regarding the disposal of hazardous waste at sites which are in various
   stages of the remediation process.  For some of the sites, total costs for
   remediation are not available because the final remedy has not been
   selected or for other reasons.  Further, the ultimate liability of the
   corporation, if any, has not been determined at all of the sites.  As a
   result, it is impossible at this time to estimate the total cost of
   remediation for all of the sites.  The total estimated cleanup costs
   identified at this time for all parties at all sites involving claims
   filed by the Environmental Protection Agency or similar state agencies
   where the corporation has been designated a potentially responsible party
   is approximately $293.4 million.  The estimated portion of the total for
   which the corporation is or may be responsible is approximately $7.3
   million, of which $6.2 million has been contributed towards the cleanup
   costs by the corporation and its insurance companies.  The balance of the
   identified potential cleanup costs is covered by insurance and established
   reserves set by the corporation which are believed to be adequate to cover
   the corporation's obligations with respect to the unpaid balance of the
   claims.  To the best of the corporation's knowledge, the insurers have the
   financial ability to pay any such covered claims and the corporation has
   not incorporated any insurance proceeds in the calculation of its reserves 
   for which recovery is not considered probable.  The corporation reevaluates 
   its exposure periodically and makes adjustment of its reserves as 
   appropriate. 

   In March 1992, a subsidiary of the corporation, Smith Fiberglass Products
   Inc. (Smith Fiberglass), won a patent infringement suit filed against a
   competitor.  A judgment was entered in favor of Smith Fiberglass.  The
   judgment was appealed by the defendant.  However, the Court of Appeals
   affirmed the award and Smith Fiberglass recognized the judgment which
   amounted to $1.9 million after recognition of legal fees as income in the
   second quarter of 1993.

   A lawsuit initiated by the corporation in connection with previously
   concluded antitrust action involving a former subsidiary was terminated in
   the second quarter of 1993 with a favorable settlement of $2.8 million.

   Over the past several years, the corporation has self-insured a portion of
   its product liability loss exposure and other business risks.  The
   corporation has established reserves which it believes are adequate to
   cover incurred claims.  For the year ended December 31, 1995, the
   corporation had $60 million of third-party product liability insurance for
   individual losses in excess of $1.5 million and for aggregate losses in
   excess of $10 million.

   Amendment No. 1, filed on May 12, 1983, Post-Effective Amendment No. 2, 
   filed on December 22, 1983, Post-Effective Amendment No. 3, filed on 
   March 30, 1987; 33-19015 filed on December 11, 1987; 33-21356 filed on 
   April 21, 1988; Form S-8 No. 33-37878 filed November 16, 1990; and 
   Form S-8 No. 33-56827 filed December 13, 1994.

     Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities 
     Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers, and controlling 
     persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or 
     otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the 
     Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public 
     policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, 
     unenforceable.  In the event that a claim for indemnification against 
     such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses 
     incurred or paid by a director, officer, or controlling person of the 
     registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit, or proceedings)
     is asserted by such director, officer, or controlling person in connection
     with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the 
     opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling 
     precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question
     whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed
     in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
