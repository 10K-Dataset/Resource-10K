                                     PART I

   ITEM 1 - BUSINESS

   A. O. Smith Corporation, a Delaware corporation organized in 1916, its
   subsidiaries and its affiliates (hereafter collectively called the
   "corporation" unless the context otherwise requires) are engaged in three
   business segments.  These segments are Electric Motor Technologies, Water
   Systems Technologies and Storage & Fluid Handling Technologies.

   The corporation's Electric Motor Technologies segment produces fractional
   horsepower and hermetic electric motors.  The Water Systems Technologies
   Segment is a leading manufacturer of residential and commercial gas, oil,
   and electric water heating systems.  Storage & Fluid Handling Technologies
   manufactures reinforced thermosetting resin piping, agricultural,
   industrial and municipal liquid and dry bulk storage systems. The
   corporation is in the process of selling the agricultural portion of this
   segment. The agricultural business is not considered material. Financial
   information regarding the corporation's business segments is provided in
   Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements which appear elsewhere
   herein.

   On January 27, 1997 the corporation announced a definitive agreement to
   sell its Automotive Products Company to Tower Automotive, Inc. The
   transaction is expected to close early in the second quarter of this year. 
   See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, entitled
   "Discontinued Operations" which appears elsewhere herein.

   On March 4, 1997, the corporation announced a definitive agreement to
   acquire UPPCO, Inc., a privately held manufacturer of sub-fractional
   horsepower electric motors with projected 1997 sales of approximately $80
   million. The transaction is expected to close near the end of the first
   quarter.

   The following table summarizes sales by segment for the corporation's
   operations.  This segment summary and all other information presented in
   this section should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial
   Statements and the Notes thereto which appear elsewhere herein.

                               ======  ======   ======    ======   ======

   ELECTRIC MOTOR TECHNOLOGIES

   The Electric Motor Technologies segment includes the A. O. Smith
   Electrical Products Company and manufactures fan motors used in furnaces,
   air conditioners, and blowers, as well as fractional horsepower motors
   used in other consumer products and jet pump motors sold to manufacturers
   of home water systems, swimming pools, hot tubs and spas.  Hermetic motors
   are sold worldwide to manufacturers of compressors and are used in air
   conditioning and refrigeration systems.  In addition to selling its
   products directly to OEMs, the company also markets its products through a
   distributor network which sells to both OEMs and the related after-market. 
   The company estimates that approximately 60 percent of the market is
   derived from the less cyclical replacement business with the remainder
   being impacted by general business conditions in the new construction
   market.

   Segment sales increased by $19.8 million or approximately 6 percent in
   1996 to $337.1 million and represented 43 percent of total corporation
   sales.  The increased volume resulted from strong market demand for
   hermetic motors.  Sales of the company's hermetic motors totaled $132.9
   million, $103.8 million and $79.5 million in 1996, 1995 and 1994,
   respectively.   1996 sales of hermetic motors were higher as a result of
   growing worldwide and replacement demand for air conditioning and
   refrigeration systems.  The company's manufacturing operations handled the
   increased volume without disproportionate increases in costs.  

   Segment sales to York International totaled  $91.5 million, $72.5 million
   and $ 56.3 million in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

   The segment's principal products are sold in competitive markets with its
   major competitors being Emerson Electric, General Electric, Magnetek,
   Inc., Fasco, and vertically integrated customers.

   WATER SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGIES

   The Water Systems Technology segment includes the A. O. Smith Water
   Products Company which had 1996 sales of $291.3 million, approximately 6
   percent higher than 1995 sales of $276.0 million and represented
   approximately 37 percent of total corporation sales. The company continued
   to capitalize on its strong wholesale channels to improve market share in
   the commercial water heater industry.

   The company markets residential gas and electric water heaters through a
   network of plumbing wholesalers in the United States.  The majority of the
   company's sales are in the less cyclical replacement market although the
   new housing market is an important portion of the business as well. 
   Residential sales in 1996 were $172 million or approximately 59 percent of
   segment revenues.  The residential water heater market remains highly
   competitive. A. O. Smith competes with four other manufacturers in
   supplying over 90 percent of market requirements.

   The company also markets commercial water heating systems through a
   network of plumbing wholesalers in the United States and Canada. 
   Commercial water heating systems are used in a wide range of applications
   including schools, nursing homes, hospitals, prisons, hotels, motels,
   laundries, restaurants, stadiums, amusement parks, car washes, and other
   large users of hot water.  The commercial market is characterized by
   competition from a broader range of products and competitors than occurs
   in the residential market.

   The company estimates that approximately 80 percent of the commercial and
   residential market is derived from the less cyclical replacement business
   with the remainder being impacted by general business conditions in the
   new construction market.

   In 1995 Water Systems established a joint venture with Nanjing Water
   Heater Company of China to manufacture instantaneous and storage type
   heaters for the Chinese market.  A.O. Smith is a majority owner of the
   venture, which began operation in 1996.

   The principal competitors in the Water Systems segment are Rheem
   Manufacturing, State Industries, The American Water Heater Group (formerly
   SABH, Inc.) and Bradford-White.  A.O. Smith's Water Systems Technologies
   segment is the largest manufacturer of commercial water heaters and is a
   major manufacturer of residential water heaters in the United States.

   STORAGE & FLUID HANDLING TECHNOLOGIES

   The Storage & Fluid Handling segment provides world-wide solutions for
   effectively storing liquids and a wide range of dry materials; as well as
   high performance piping systems that safely and effectively contain and
   convey corrosive, abrasive or related materials.  1996 sales of $152.8
   million were approximately 48 percent higher than 1995 as a result of the
   December 1995 acquisition of Peabody TecTank, Inc. (TecTank).

   Engineered Storage Products
   Engineered Storage Products manufactures industrial and municipal liquid
   and dry bulk storage products marketed by A. O. Smith Harvestore Products,
   Inc. (Harvestore), and TecTank. 1996 sales were $94.2 million compared
   with 1995 sales of  $44.8 million.  The increase in sales is attributable
   to the full year consolidation of TecTank. Harvestore's and TecTank's
   products are sold in competitive markets that include concrete, site-
   welded, and bolted tanks. Principal competitors include Columbian Steel
   Tank Company, Permastore LTD., Pittsburg Tank and Tower Company Inc. and
   Natgun Corporation.

   Fiberglass Products
   Sales of $58.6 million in 1996 were unchanged compared with 1995.  Sales
   to petroleum production markets were higher in 1996 but were offset by a
   decline in sales to the service station market.

   Fiberglass Products manufactures reinforced thermosetting resin piping and
   fittings used to carry corrosive materials.  Typical applications include
   chemical and industrial plant piping, oil field piping, and underground
   distribution at gasoline service stations. Fiberglass Products also
   manufactures high pressure fiberglass piping systems used in the petroleum
   production industry.  Products are sold through a network of distributors.

   Fiberglass Products has formed a joint venture with Harbin Composites
   Corporation of Harbin, China to supply fiberglass pipe to the Chinese oil
   industry. The company is a majority owner of the new venture, which began
   production in 1996.

   The company's principal products are sold in competitive markets with its
   major competitors being Ameron Corporation, Fibercast Company, Environ
   Corporation, and Total Containment Corporation.

   RAW MATERIAL

   Raw materials for the corporation's operations, which consist primarily of
   steel, copper, and aluminum, are generally available from several sources
   in adequate quantities.

   SEASONALITY

   There is no significant seasonal pattern to the corporation's consolidated
   quarterly sales and earnings.  

   RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

   In order to improve competitiveness by generating new products and
   processes, the corporation conducts research and development at its
   Corporate Technology Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin as well as at its
   operating unit locations. Total expenditures for research and development
   in 1996, 1995, and 1994 were approximately $17.3 million, $15.0 million,
   and $13.5 million, respectively.

   The corporation owns and uses in its businesses various trademarks, trade
   names, patents, trade secrets, and licenses.  While a number of these are
   important to the corporation, it does not consider a material part of its
   business to be dependent on any one of them.

   EMPLOYEES

   The corporation and its subsidiaries employed approximately 7,700 persons
   in its continuing operations as of December 31, 1996.

   BACKLOG

   Normally, none of the corporation's operations sustain significant
   backlogs.

   ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS

   The corporation's operations are governed by a variety of federal, state
   and local laws intended to protect the environment.  While environmental
   considerations are a part of all significant capital expenditures,
   compliance with the environmental laws has not had a material effect and
   is not expected to have a material effect upon the capital expenditures,
   earnings, or competitive position of the corporation.  See Item 3.

   FOREIGN SALES

   Total export sales of continuing operations from the U.S. were $52
   million, $49 million, and $32 million in 1996, 1995, and 1994,
   respectively.  The increase in sales of continuing operations from 1995 to
   1996 was largely attributable to Storage & Fluid Handling, somewhat offset
   by decreased exports by Electric Motor Technologies.  The amount of sales
   and operating profit derived from, or the assets attributable to, sales
   outside the North American geographic area are not a substantial portion
   of total corporation operations.

   ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES

   The corporation manufactures its products in 29 locations worldwide. 
   These facilities have an aggregate floor space of approximately 4,323,000
   square feet, consisting of approximately 2,999,000 square feet owned by
   the corporation and 1,324,000 square feet of leased space.  Fourteen of
   the corporation's facilities are foreign plants including affiliates and
   joint ventures with approximately 1,279,000 square feet of space, of which
   approximately 551,000 square feet are leased.

   Excluded from the above totals are approximately 5,391,000 square feet of
   domestic and 790,000 square feet of foreign floor space occupied by the
   corporation's Automotive Products business which the corporation has
   reached a definitive agreement to sell.  The manufacturing plants
   presently operated by the corporation's continuing operations are listed
   below by industry segment.

    (1,130,000 sq. ft.)

   The principal equipment at the corporation's facilities consist of
   presses, welding, machining, slitting and other metal fabricating
   equipment, winding machines, and furnace and painting equipment.  The
   corporation regards its plant and equipment as well-maintained and
   adequate for its needs.  Multishift operations are used where necessary.

   ITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

   The corporation is involved in various unresolved legal actions,
   administrative proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of its
   business involving product liability, property damage, insurance coverage,
   patents and environmental matters including the disposal of hazardous
   waste.  Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome
   of these unresolved legal actions or the range of possible loss or
   recovery, the corporation believes these unresolved legal actions will not
   have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. 
   A more detailed discussion of these matters appears in Note 14 of the
   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

   ITEM 4 - SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

   ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

   FINANCIAL REVIEW

   A. O. Smith Corporation recorded earnings from continuing operations of
   $25.2 million or $1.21 per share in 1996 versus $24.0 million or $1.15 per
   share in 1995.  Earnings from discontinued operations added $40.2 million
   to the corporation's net earnings in 1996 compared to $37.4 million in
   1995, providing the corporation with total net earnings of $65.4 million
   and $61.4 million in 1996 and 1995, respectively.  As a result, earnings
   per share totaled $3.13 in 1996 versus $2.94 in 1995.  Two segments,
   Electric Motor Technologies and Water Systems Technologies, established
   new sales and earnings records in 1996.  Details of individual segment
   performance will be discussed later in this section.

   Working capital for continuing operations at December 31, 1996 was $87.0
   million compared to $112.7 million and $118.1 million at December 31, 1995
   and 1994, respectively. Lower accounts receivable and production-related
   increases in trade payables resulted in lower working capital at
   December 31, 1996 versus 1995.  Sales-related increases in accounts
   receivable were more than offset by related increases in trade payables,
   resulting in lower working capital in 1995 versus 1994.

   Capital expenditures for continuing operations were $37.8 million in 1996
   compared to $26.9 million in 1995 and $18.1 million in 1994.  The
   increases in capital expenditures are primarily attributed to new
   equipment for the hermetic HVAC motor operations of the Electric Motor
   Technologies business.  The corporation expects that cash flow from
   operations will adequately cover 1997 capital expenditures.

   The corporation established two joint ventures for continuing operations
   in the People's Republic of China in the fourth quarter of 1995.  The
   corporation invested $15.1 million in these joint ventures during 1996
   compared to $3.4 million in 1995.

   Long-term debt increased $47.5 million from $190.9 million at the end of
   1995 to $238.4 million at the end of 1996.  The majority of the increase
   was due to capital expenditures and investments in a joint venture
   associated with discontinued operations.  The corporation's leverage, as
   measured by total debt to total capital, increased to 37.1% at the end of
   1996 compared to 34.5% at the end of 1995.

   On January 27, 1997, the corporation reached a definitive agreement to
   sell its automotive products business.  The sale price of the transaction,
   which excludes the sale of the corporation's investment in its Mexican
   affiliate, is approximately $625 million, subject to final adjustment. 
   The corporation expects to pay approximately $100 million in taxes on this
   transaction.  Closing is expected to occur early in the second quarter. 
   The proceeds of the sale will be used to pay down existing debt to
   approximately $100 million, repurchase stock and make acquisitions in its
   three core businesses.  On January 27, 1997, the corporation's Board of
   Directors authorized the repurchase of up to three million shares of its
   outstanding class A and common stock.  As of February 28, 1997, 1,150,700
   shares had been purchased for approximately $38.4 million.

   In June 1996, the corporation's multi-year revolving credit agreement was
   increased to $210 million and extended to June 30, 2001.  The amended
   agreement carries lower fees and lower borrowing costs.

   The corporation uses futures contracts to fix the cost of portions of its
   expected raw materials needs, primarily for copper and aluminum, with the
   objective of reducing risk due to market price fluctuations.  In addition,
   the corporation enters into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize
   the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on its income.  Differences
   between the corporation's fixed price and current market prices on raw
   materials contracts are included as part of inventory cost when the
   contracts mature.  Differences between the corporation's fixed price and
   current market prices on currency contracts are recognized in the same
   period in which gains or losses from the transactions being hedged are
   recognized and, accordingly, no net gain or loss is realized when
   contracts mature.  The corporation does not engage in speculation in its
   derivatives strategies.  The effect of these programs was not material to
   the results of operations for 1996, 1995, or 1994.

   At its April 4, 1996 meeting, A. O. Smith Corporation's Board of Directors
   increased the regular quarterly dividend by 13 percent to $.17 per share
   on its common stocks (Class A and Common). The last three quarterly
   dividend payments in 1996 were paid at this rate, resulting in a total of
   $.66 per share being paid versus $.58 per share in 1995.  A. O. Smith
   Corporation has paid dividends on its common stock for 57 consecutive
   years.

   Results of Operations

   Sales from continuing operations in 1996 were $781.2 million surpassing
   1995 sales of $696.7 by 12.1 percent. Sales in 1994 were $648 million.
   Despite a slow start, 1996 proved to be another solid year as each of the
   corporation's operating companies increased its sales over the prior year.
   The most significant sales improvement occurred in the corporation's
   Storage & Fluid Handling Technologies segment as a result of the TecTank
   acquisition made in December of 1995. This subsidiary which manufactures
   bolted steel tanks and shop-welded steel, stainless steel and aluminum
   tanks provided approximately $50 million of the year-to-year increase in
   sales. The corporation's larger two segments, Electric Motor Technologies
   and Water Systems Technologies each reflected sales increases over the
   prior year of approximately six percent.

   On January 27,1997, the corporation announced it had reached a definitive
   agreement with Tower Automotive Inc. to sell all the assets of Automotive
   Products Company (APC) excluding the investment in its Mexican affiliate,
   Metalsa, S. A. , which is expected to be sold within one year. Due to the
   pending sale, APC and Metalsa have been accorded discontinued  operations
   treatment in the accompanying financial statements. Sales in 1996
   including APC's sales of $863 million amounted to $1.64 billion, an
   increase over 1995 of 6.5 percent.

   The corporation's gross profit margin for continuing operations in 1996
   was 21.4 percent, compared with 20.3 percent in 1995 and 19.7 percent in
   1994. The favorable trend in margins was due largely to the higher
   manufacturing volumes, increased capacity utilization and improved
   operating efficiencies in the Electric Motor Technologies segment. The
   gross margin for the Water Systems Technologies segment also reflected 
   improvement over the prior two years as a result of higher volume in 1996
   which more than offset the unfavorable impact of industry-wide pricing
   pressures which were prevalent throughout the first half of the year.
   Partially offsetting the favorable trend in the corporation's overall
   margin was a deterioration in the Storage & Fluid Handling Technologies
   margin. This deterioration resulted from declining volumes for the
   relatively higher margin fiberglass pipe produced  for the service station
   market by the Smith Fiberglass subsidiary.

   Sales for the Electric Motor Technologies segment in 1996 increased almost
   $20 million or 6.2 percent to a record $337.1 million from 1995 sales of
   $317.3 million. Sales in 1994 were $281.2 million. Demand for hermetic
   motor products associated with the heating, ventilating and air
   conditioning (HVAC) industry provided most of the increase in sales over
   the past two years. The replacement market for air conditioning equipment
   was responsible for much of the growth in the hermetic motor business as a
   growing percentage of the existing unitary air conditioning equipment in
   the marketplace is at or near the end of its life cycle. In addition, the
   use of new refrigerants and higher efficiency compressors has combined to
   encourage the replacement of older commercial air conditioning and
   refrigeration installations. Continued growth in exports of compressors by
   the company's customers also bolstered hermetic volume.

   Earnings for the Electric Motor Technologies segment in 1996 were $42.7
   million or 34 percent higher than the $31.9 million earned in 1995.
   Earnings in 1994 were $23.4 million. While increased volume was one of the
   major factors responsible for the significant improvement in earnings over
   the past three years, other factors were also important. Commencing in
   1993 the company began concentrating production in its lower cost
   facilities while making significant capital investments in new equipment.
   These factors enabled this segment to efficiently handle higher
   manufacturing volumes while continuing to improve productivity.

   Sales for the Water Systems Technologies segment were $291.3 million in
   1996 increasing 5.5 percent from $276 million in 1995 and establishing a
   record for the fifth consecutive year. Sales in 1994 were $271.5 million.
   The record sales in 1996 were achieved through domestic growth in both the
   residential and commercial water heater market. The company's residential
   volume increase corresponded to the growth in the overall domestic market
   which experienced growth of approximately 5.6 percent in 1996. The strong
   domestic economy and an active construction market resulted in commercial
   water heater unit volume increasing in excess of six percent in 1996.
   While the domestic market expanded in 1996, economic weakness in Europe
   and Canada resulted in lower sales in both of these markets compared to
   the prior year. Segment sales in 1995 demonstrated only a slight increase
   from 1994 due to an announced price increase effective as of January
   1, 1995. The price increase caused a shift in demand to the fourth quarter
   of 1994 thereby reducing demand in 1995.

   Although Water Systems Technologies sales increased 5.5 percent in 1996,
   the earnings increase was minimal, increasing from $32.2 million in 1995
   to $32.8 million in 1996. 1994 earnings were $30.1 million. In 1996, the
   earnings contribution from higher sales was offset by higher selling
   expense as well as transition costs associated with moving to an outside
   sales organization. Earnings increased seven percent from 1994 to 1995
   despite only a 1.7 percent increase in sales. 1995 earnings benefited from
   increased volume of higher margin commercial product which more than
   offset the adverse impact of lower volume and pricing for residential
   water heaters.

   The corporation's Storage & Fluid Handling Technologies segment is a
   combination of two business units, Engineered Storage Products and
   Fiberglass Products. Total sales for this segment reflected a $49.4
   million increase over 1995 sales of $103.4 million. This increase was
   directly attributable to the aforementioned acquisition of TecTank which
   was completed in December of 1995. Sales in 1994 were $95.3 million. Total
   earnings for this segment declined from $12.6 million in 1994 to $11.0
   million in 1995 and rose slightly in 1996 to $11.1 million. The decline in
   earnings from 1994 to 1995 was due to lower earnings at Fiberglass
   Products. In 1996, the addition of TecTank's earnings compensated for a
   further decline in earnings at Fiberglass Products.

   The corporation continued to liquidate the portfolio of AgriStor Credit
   Corporation in 1996. The net operating results of this finance subsidiary
   are no longer integrated as part of the business segments of the
   corporation and are included in general corporate expense with interest
   expense consolidated with the corporation's total interest expense.
   Interest costs and administrative expenses have declined throughout the
   liquidation process and are not significant to the total corporation's
   performance.

   Selling, general, and administrative (SG & A) expense for the corporation
   in 1996 was $107.4 million compared to $91.4 million and $88.5 million in
   1995 and 1994, respectively. Approximately one third of the increase from
   1995 to 1996 was attributable to the consolidation of SG & A associated
   with the acquisition of TecTank. Other major reasons for the increase in
   1996 include increased commissions and other expenses in support of
   additional sales volume as well as costs incurred relative to establishing
   joint venture operations in China. As a percent of sales, SG & A was 13.7
   percent in 1996, 13.1 percent in 1995 and 13.7 percent in 1994.

   Interest expense, net of the amount allocated to discontinued operations
   was $8.1 million in 1996 compared to $7.6 million and $8.0 million in 1995
   and 1994, respectively. Interest expense was allocated to discontinued
   operations based on the ratio of net assets discontinued to total
   consolidated net assets of the corporation. Interest expense before
   allocation to APC rose throughout the three year reporting period. This
   upward trend in interest expense before allocation was a function of
   increasing interest rates and rising debt levels to support aggressive
   capital spending programs at APC. Since APC's assets represented a greater
   proportion of the corporation's total net assets each year due to its
   capital spending program, their allocated interest expense increased each
   year.

   Earnings from continuing operations were $25.2 million or $1.21 per share
   in 1996 compared to $24.0 million or $1.15 per share in 1995. 1996
   earnings demonstrated improvement over 1995 despite nearly $4.0 million of
   losses and other administrative costs to establish the corporation's joint
   ventures in China. The corporation earned $17.1 million or $.82 per share
   in 1994.

   Outlook

   The corporation projects sales growth from continuing operations before
   acquisitions to range between five and ten percent compared with 1996. 
   The corporation's Electric Motor Technologies segment expects to benefit
   from continued strong growth in the heating, ventilating, air conditioning
   and refrigeration (HVAC&R) market as well as improved demand in its
   General Industries business unit.  Water Systems is projecting continued
   penetration of the commercial water heater market as well as stronger
   market growth for residential water heaters.  The Storage & Fluid Handling
   segment expects to benefit from increased capital spending for industrial
   storage products as well as increased demand for chemical and industrial
   pipe. 

   OTHER MATTERS

   Environmental

   The corporation's operations are governed by a number of federal, state
   and local environmental laws concerning the generation and management of
   hazardous materials, the discharge of pollutants into the environment and
   remediation of sites owned by the corporation or third parties.  The
   corporation has expended substantial financial and managerial resources
   complying with such laws.  However, expenditures related to environmental
   matters were not material in 1996 and are not expected to be material in
   any single year.  Although the corporation believes that its operations
   are in substantial compliance with such laws and maintains procedures
   designed to maintain compliance, there are no assurances that substantial
   additional costs for compliance will not be incurred in the future. 
   However, since the corporation's competitors are governed by the same
   laws, the corporation should not be placed in a competitive disadvantage.

   Forward Looking Statements

   Certain statements in this report are forward-looking statements. 
   Although the corporation believes that its expectations are based upon
   reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge of its business,
   there can be no assurance that the corporation's financial goals will be
   realized.  Although a significant portion of the corporation's sales are
   derived from the replacement of previously installed product and such
   sales are therefore less volatile, numerous factors may affect the
   corporation's actual results and may cause results to differ materially
   from those expressed in forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of
   the corporation.  Among such numerous factors the corporation includes the
   continued strong growth of the worldwide heating, ventilating and air
   conditioning market, the stability of the pricing environment for
   residential water heaters and the successful implementation of the
   corporation's joint venture strategies in China.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

   1.  Organization and Significant Accounting Policies

   Organization.  A.O. Smith Corporation is a diversified manufacturer
   serving customers world-wide.  The corporation's major product lines
   include: fractional horsepower and hermetic electric motors; residential
   and commercial water heaters; fiberglass piping systems and water, waste
   water, and dry storage tanks.  The corporation's products are marketed
   primarily in North America. Original equipment manufacturers are the
   largest customers of the electrical products unit.  Water heaters are
   distributed principally through a diverse network of plumbing wholesalers. 
   Fiberglass piping is sold through a network of distributors to the service
   station market and the petroleum production industry as well as the
   chemical/industrial market.  The corporation's storage tanks and handling
   systems are sold through a network of dealers to municipalities,
   industrial concerns, and farmers.  As discussed in Note 2, the operations
   of the automotive products business are classified as discontinued
   operations.

   Consolidation and basis of presentation.  The consolidated financial
   statements include the accounts of the corporation and its wholly-owned
   subsidiaries.

   Use of estimates.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity
   with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
   estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
   financial statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results could differ
   from those estimates.

   Fair values.  The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
   receivable and payable, and long-term borrowings approximated fair value
   as of December 31, 1996 and 1995.

   Foreign currency translation.  For all subsidiaries outside the United
   States with the exception of entities in Mexico, the corporation uses the
   local currency as the functional currency.  For these operations, assets
   and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange
   rates and weighted average exchange rates are used for revenues and
   expenses.  The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a
   separate component of stockholders' equity.  Gains and losses from foreign
   currency transactions are included in net earnings.

   Inventory valuation.  Inventories are carried at lower of cost or market. 
   Cost is determined on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for a
   significant portion of domestic inventories.  Inventories of foreign
   subsidiaries and supplies are determined using the first-in, first-out
   (FIFO) method.

   Derivative instruments.  The corporation enters into futures contracts to
   fix the cost of certain raw material purchases, principally copper and
   aluminum, with the objective of minimizing cost risk due to market
   fluctuations.  Any differences between the corporation's fixed price and
   current market prices are included as part of the inventory cost when the
   contracts mature.  As of December 31, 1996, the corporation had contracts
   covering the majority of its expected copper and aluminum requirements for
   1997, with varying maturities in 1997, the longest duration of which is
   December 1997.  These futures contracts limit the impact from both
   favorable and unfavorable price changes.  The effect of these programs was
   not material to the results of operations for the three years ended
   December 31, 1996.

   As a result of having various foreign operations, the corporation is
   exposed to the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the U.S.
   dollar value of its foreign subsidiaries.  Further, the corporation and
   its subsidiaries conduct business in various foreign currencies.  To
   minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on its income, the
   corporation enters into foreign currency forward contracts.  The contracts
   are used to hedge known foreign currency transactions on a continuing
   basis for periods consistent with the corporation's exposures.

   The corporation does not engage in speculation. The difference between
   market and contract rates is recognized in the same period in which gains
   or losses from the transactions being hedged are recognized.  The
   contracts, which are executed with major financial institutions, generally
   mature within one year with no credit loss anticipated for failure of the
   counterparties to perform.

   The following table summarizes, by currency, the corporation's forward
   exchange contracts.

   December 31 (dollars in thousands)   1996               1995

   French franc                     --       756        --     1,483

                               =======    ======   =======    ======

   The contracts in place at December 31, 1996 and 1995 amounted to
   approximately 62 and 40 percent, respectively, of the corporation's
   anticipated subsequent year exposure for those currencies hedged.

   Property, plant, and equipment.  Property, plant, and equipment are stated
   at cost.  Depreciation is computed primarily by the straight-line method.

   Revenue recognition.  The corporation recognizes revenue upon shipment of
   product to the customer.

   Research and development.  Research and development costs are charged to
   expense as incurred for continuing operations and amounted to
   approximately $17.3, $15.0, and $13.5 million during 1996, 1995, and 1994,
   respectively.

   Environmental remediation costs.  The corporation accrues for losses
   associated with environmental obligations when such losses are probable
   and reasonably estimable.  Costs of future expenditures are not discounted
   to their present value.  Recoveries of environmental remediation costs
   from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed
   probable.  The accruals are adjusted as further information develops or
   circumstances change.

   Earnings per share of common stock.  Earnings per common share are
   computed using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during
   the year.  The effect of shares issuable under stock compensation plans is
   not significant.

   Reclassifications.  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to
   conform to the 1996 presentation.

   2.  Discontinued Operations

   On January 27, 1997, the corporation reached a definitive agreement to
   sell its automotive products business. The sale price of the transaction,
   which excludes the sale of the corporation's Mexican affiliate, is
   approximately $625 million, subject to final adjustment.  Closing is
   expected to occur early in the second quarter of 1997.  The corporation
   also intends to sell its interest in its Mexican affiliate, which had been
   accounted for under the equity method.

   The results of the automotive businesses have been reported separately as
   discontinued operations.  Prior year consolidated financial statements
   have been restated to present the automotive businesses as discontinued.

   The components of the net assets of discontinued operations included in
   the consolidated balance sheets are as follows:

   In 1995, because the Mexican affiliate's sales, financing, and certain
   costs were primarily U.S. dollar denominated, the corporation changed the
   functional currency for foreign currency translation purposes from the
   Mexican peso to the U.S. dollar.  In 1994, due to the decline in the value
   of the Mexican peso, the corporation recorded as a component of
   stockholders' equity, translation adjustments of approximately $7.5
   million.  During 1996 and 1994,  the corporation received dividends of
   $2.9 and $.8 million, respectively, from the affiliate.

   3.  Acquisition

   On December 6, 1995, the corporation acquired the stock of Peabody TecTank
   Inc. (TecTank), a manufacturer of environmental bulk storage tanks, for
   approximately $19.1 million, which included a final purchase price
   adjustment of $1.1 million in 1996.  The transaction was  accounted for as
   a purchase and the consolidated financial statements include the results
   of TecTank from the date of acquisition.  The purchase price has been
   allocated to the assets purchased and the liabilities assumed based upon
   the respective fair values at the date of acquisition.  The excess of the
   purchase price over the fair values of net assets acquired has been
   recorded as goodwill and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over
   15 years. The proforma effect of this acquisition would not be significant
   to either 1995 or 1994 operating results.

   4.  Statement of Cash Flows

   In June 1996, the corporation's multi-year revolving credit agreement with
   a group of ten banks was increased from $160 million to $210 million and
   extended to June 30, 2001.  The amended agreement carries lower fees and
   borrowing costs.  During 1995, the corporation borrowed $5 million with a
   five year term from one of the banks.  At its option, the corporation
   maintains either cash balances or pays fees for bank credit and services.

   In 1995, the corporation entered into two loan facilities with insurance
   companies totaling $125 million.  Through December 31, 1996, the
   corporation had drawn down, under terms ranging from ten to fifteen years,
   $45 million under these facilities.

   The corporation's credit agreement and term loans contain certain
   conditions and provisions which restrict the corporation's payment of
   dividends.  Under the most restrictive of these provisions, retained
   earnings of $125.6 million were unrestricted as of December 31, 1996.

   Borrowings under the bank credit lines and in the commercial paper market
   are supported by the revolving credit agreement and accordingly have been
   classified as long-term.  It has been the corporation's practice to renew
   or replace the credit agreement so as to maintain the availability of debt
   on a long-term basis and to provide 100 percent backup for its borrowings
   in the commercial paper market.

   Long-term debt, maturing within each of the five years subsequent to
   December 31, 1996, is as follows:  1997--$11.9; 1998--$12.2; 1999--$8.1;
   2000--$9.9; 2001--$12.1 million.

   Under an agreement, the corporation sold at face value certain automotive
   related receivables without recourse totaling $50 million at December 31,
   1996, compared to $41.0 million at December 31, 1995.

   Future minimum payments under noncancelable operating leases from
   continuing operations total $37.9 million and are due as follows:  1997--
   $7.6; 1998--$6.9; 1999--$5.3; 2000--$5.1; 2001--$7.7; thereafter--$5.3
   million.  Rent expense for continuing operations, including payments under
   operating leases, was $12.1, $10.3, and $9.5 million in 1996, 1995, and
   1994, respectively.

   Interest paid by the corporation, was $15.1, $13.1, and $13.3 million in
   1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively.


   9. Stockholders' Equity

   On April 5, 1995, the corporation's stockholders approved an increase in
   the authorized shares of Class A Common Stock $5 par value from 7 million
   shares to 14 million shares and in the authorized shares of Common Stock
   $1 par value from 24 million shares to 60 million shares.  The Common
   Stock has equal dividend rights with Class A Common Stock and is entitled,
   as a class, to elect 25 percent of the board of directors and has 1/10th
   vote per share on all other matters.  As of December 31, 1996, there are
   also 3 million shares of preferred stock $1 par value authorized.

   During 1996, 1995, and 1994, 42,443, 146,940, and 49,304 shares of Class A
   Common Stock were converted into Common Stock, respectively.  Regular
   dividends paid on the Class A Common and Common Stock amounted to $.66,
   $.58, and $.50 per share in 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively.

   Changes in certain components of stockholders' equity are as follows:

   Common Stock, respectively, were held as treasury stock.


   10. Stock Options

   During 1990, the corporation adopted a Long-Term Executive Incentive
   Compensation Plan (1990 Plan) which initially reserved 1 million shares of
   Common Stock for granting of nonqualified and incentive stock options.  In
   April 1994, stockholders approved a proposal to reserve an additional 1
   million shares of Common Stock for the 1990 plan.  In addition, the
   corporation has a Long-Term Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (1980
   Plan) which has terminated except as to outstanding options.  Options
   under both plans become exercisable one year from date of grant and, for
   active employees, expire ten years after date of grant.  The number of
   shares available for granting of options at December 31, 1996, 1995, and
   1994 was 264,400, 470,500, and 659,600 respectively.

   Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, "Accounting
   for Stock-Based Compensation," encourages, but does not require companies
   to record compensation cost for stock-based employee compensation plans at
   fair value.  The corporation has chosen to continue applying Accounting
   Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to
   Employees," and related interpretations in accounting for its stock option
   plans.  Accordingly, because the exercise price of the stock options
   equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no
   compensation expense has been recognized.  Had compensation cost been
   determined based upon the fair value at the grant date for awards under
   the plans based on the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the corporation's pro
   forma net earnings and pro forma net earnings per share would have been as
   follows:

   Years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands, 
    except per share amounts)                  1996       1995 
   Net earnings:
       As reported                          $65,417    $61,413
       Pro forma                             64,538     61,220
   Net earnings per share:
       As reported                          $  3.13    $  2.94
       Pro forma                               3.08       2.93

   The pro forma effect on net earnings for 1995 is not representative of the
   pro forma effect on net earnings in future years because it does not take
   into consideration pro forma compensation expense related to 1994 grants.

   The weighted-average fair value per option at the date of grant during
   1996 and 1995, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, was $7.45 and
   $7.48, respectively.  Assumptions were as follows: 

                                          1996       1995

   11.  Retirement Plans

   The corporation and its domestic subsidiaries provide retirement benefits
   for all employees.  As of December 31, 1995, the corporation merged its
   various qualified noncontributory defined benefit plans in the United
   States into one pension plan.  Benefits for salaried employees are based
   on an employee's years of service and compensation.  Benefits for hourly
   employees are generally based on years of service.  The corporation's 
   funding policy is to contribute amounts which are actuarially determined
   to provide sufficient assets to meet future benefit payment requirements
   consistent with the funding requirements of federal laws and regulations.
   Plan assets consist primarily of marketable equities and debt securities.
   The corporation also has several foreign pension plans, none of which are
   material to the corporation's financial position.

   The following tables present the components of pension (income) expense,
   the funded status, and the major assumptions used to determine these
   amounts for domestic pension plans of continuing operations.

   Pursuant to the agreement to sell the automotive products operations, the
   corporation will retain all existing pension assets as well as all
   liabilities earned through the closing date.

   The corporation has a defined contribution profit sharing and retirement
   plan covering salaried nonunion employees which provides for annual
   corporate contributions of 35 percent to 140 percent of qualifying
   contributions made by participating employees.  The amount of the
   corporation's contribution in excess of 35 percent is dependent upon the
   corporation's profitability.  The corporation's contribution was $5.3,
   $5.2, and $5.2 million for 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively.

   Postretirement Benefits other than Pensions

   The corporation has several unfunded defined benefit postretirement plans
   covering certain hourly and salaried employees which provide medical and
   life insurance benefits from retirement to age 65.  Salaried employees
   retiring after January 1, 1995 are covered by an unfunded defined
   contribution plan with benefits based on years of service.  Certain hourly
   employees retiring after January 1, 1996 will be subject to a maximum
   annual benefit limit.  Salaried employees hired after December 31, 1993
   are not eligible for postretirement medical benefits.

   Pursuant to the agreement to sell the automotive products operations, all
   liabilities for active employees and retirees of these operations will be
   transferred to the buyer.

   Net periodic postretirement benefit cost of continuing operations included
   the following components:

   The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated
   postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) is 6 percent.  The weighted
   average discount rate used in determining the APBO was 8.00 and 7.50
   percent at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.  If the health care
   cost trend rate was increased by 1 percent, the APBO at December 31, 1996
   would increase by $.7 million and net periodic postretirement benefit cost
   for 1996 would increase by $.1 million.

   12.  Income Taxes

   The components of the provision for income taxes of continuing operations
   consisted of the following:

   The domestic and foreign components of income from continuing operations
   before income taxes were as follows:


    Years Ended December 31                 1996         1995         1994

                                          =======      =======      =======

   Total taxes paid by the corporation including for discontinued operations
   amounted to $29.9, $25.2, and $21.7 million in 1996, 1995, and 1994,
   respectively.

   No provision for U.S. income taxes has been made on the undistributed
   earnings of foreign subsidiaries as such earnings are considered to be
   permanently invested.  At December 31, 1996, the undistributed earnings
   amounted to $15.2 million.  It is not practical to determine the income
   tax liability that would result had such earnings been repatriated.

   No provision for U.S. income taxes has been made on the cumulative net
   translation gains and other items of equity investees.  At December 31,
   1996, the amount of unrecognized U.S. tax liability for the net
   translation gains and other items totaling $9.9 million amounted to $3.5
   million.

   The approximate tax effects of temporary differences between income tax
   and financial reporting of continuing operations are as follows:

   13.  Agricultural Businesses

   The corporation's strategic plan is to concentrate its resources in
   nonagricultural businesses and withdraw from the agricultural market.  The
   strategy includes plans to sell the agricultural business and to phase out
   the related finance operations.  It is not possible to predict when the
   sale of the agricultural business will occur.   The corporation is
   continuing to phase out the finance operations in an orderly manner. 
   AgriStor Credit Corporation (AgriStor), a wholly owned finance subsidiary,
   was merged into the corporation as of December 31, 1996.

   The finance operations are no longer deemed to be material, and,
   accordingly, the accounts related thereto are not presented separately in
   the consolidated financial statements.  Condensed consolidated financial
   statements of AgriStor are also no longer presented.

   14.  Litigation and Insurance Matters

   The corporation is involved in various unresolved legal actions,
   administrative proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of its
   business involving product liability, property damage, insurance coverage,
   patents and environmental matters including the disposal of hazardous
   waste.  Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome
   of these unresolved legal actions or the range of possible loss or
   recovery, the corporation believes these unresolved legal actions will not
   have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. 
   The following paragraphs summarize noteworthy actions and proceedings.

   A lawsuit for damages and declaratory judgments in the Circuit Court of
   Milwaukee County, State of Wisconsin, in which the corporation and
   Harvestore are plaintiffs is pending against three insurance companies for
   failure to pay in accordance with liability insurance policies issued to
   the corporation.  The insurers have failed to pay, in full or in part,
   certain judgments, settlements and defense costs incurred in connection
   with closed lawsuits alleging damages for economic losses claimed to have
   arisen out of alleged defects in Harvestore animal feed storage equipment. 
   The court granted the corporation partial summary judgment against two of
   the insurers and the appellate court accepted an appeal of that ruling. 
   In the interim, discovery is stayed.  While the corporation has, in part,
   assumed applicability of this coverage, an adverse judgment should not be
   material to its financial condition.

   As part of its routine business operations, the corporation disposes of
   and recycles or reclaims certain industrial waste materials, chemicals and
   solvents at disposal and recycling facilities which are licensed by
   appropriate federal, state and local agencies and are owned and operated
   by third parties unrelated to the corporation.  In some instances, when
   those facilities are operated such that hazardous substances contaminate
   the soil and groundwater, the United States Environmental Protection
   Agency ("EPA") will designate the contaminated sites as Superfund sites,
   and will designate those parties which are believed to have contributed
   hazardous materials to the sites as potentially responsible parties
   ("PRPs").  Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
   and Liability Act (the "Superfund" law) and similar state laws, each PRP
   that contributed hazardous substances to a Superfund site may be jointly
   and severally liable for the costs associated with cleaning up the site. 
   Typically, PRPs negotiate with the EPA and those state environmental
   agencies that are involved in the matter regarding the selection and
   implementation of a plan to clean up the Superfund site and the terms and
   conditions under which the PRPs will be involved in the process.  PRPs
   also negotiate with each other regarding allocation of each PRP's share of
   the clean up costs.
     
   One such Superfund site is a former mining site in Colorado.  The
   corporation was a majority owner of a Colorado mining operation for a
   period of time beginning in 1936 and ending in 1942.  Because of that
   stock ownership, the corporation was notified by the EPA in March, 1993
   that it is a PRP at the site.  Estimates of clean up costs at this site
   have been as high as $150,000,000.  The corporation believes that a large
   majority of those costs relate to contamination caused by a corporation
   that worked the mine in the 1980s.  In 1995, the EPA made an offer to
   negotiate de minimis settlements with each PRP that contributed less than
   3% of the hazardous materials to the site.  The corporation accepted that
   offer which has not been finalized, however the corporation continues to
   maintain that it has valid defenses to any liability at this site.  It is
   impossible at this time to reasonably estimate the corporation's liability
   at this site, if any.  However, it is anticipated that the corporation's
   liability at the site will not be material because the EPA is treating the
   corporation as a potential de minimis party.

   The corporation is currently involved as a PRP in judicial and
   administrative proceedings initiated on behalf of the EPA seeking to clean
   up the environment at a total of fifteen Superfund sites and to recover
   costs it has or will incur as a result of the clean up.  Certain state
   environmental agencies have also asserted claims to recover their clean up
   costs in some of these actions.  Further, a claim has been asserted by the
   owner of a landfill which has been designated as a Superfund site to
   recover part of the owner's costs to remediate the site from the
   corporation and several other parties that are alleged to have contributed
   materials to the site.

   The corporation has compiled available information concerning costs
   associated with remediation at these sites. It is impossible at this time
   to estimate the total cost of remediation for all of the sites, or the
   corporation's ultimate share of those costs, for a variety of reasons. 
   Many of the reasons are related to the fact that the sites are in various
   stages of the remediation process.  Of the costs the corporation has been
   able to identify, the corporation estimates the share for which it is or
   may be responsible is approximately $7.1 million.  The corporation and its
   insurance companies have paid $6.4 million of that amount and the balance
   is adequately covered through insurance and reserves established by the
   corporation.  To the best of the corporation's knowledge, the insurers
   have the financial ability to pay any such covered claims and there are
   viable PRPs at each of the sites which have the financial ability to pay
   their respective shares of liability at the sites.

   The corporation has self-insured a portion of its product liability loss
   exposure and other business risks for many years. The corporation has
   established reserves which it believes are adequate to cover incurred
   claims.  For the year ended December 31, 1996, the corporation had $60
   million of third-party product liability insurance for individual losses
   in excess of $1.5 million and for aggregate losses in excess of $10
   million.

   The corporation reevaluates its exposure on claims periodically and makes
   adjustments to its reserves as appropriate.

   Pursuant to the requirements of Rule 14a-3(b)(10) of the Securities
   Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the corporation will, upon request and
   upon payment of a reasonable fee not to exceed the rate at which such
   copies are available from the Securities and Exchange Commission, furnish
   copies to its security holders of any exhibits listed in the Index to
   Exhibits.

   For the purposes of complying with the amendments to the rules governing
   Form S-8 (effective July 13, 1990) under the Securities Act of 1933, the
   undersigned registrant hereby undertakes as follows, which undertaking
   shall be incorporated by reference into registrant's Registration
   Statements on Form S-8 Nos. 2-72542 filed on May 26, 1981, Post-Effective
   Amendment No. 1, filed on May 12, 1983, Post-Effective Amendment No. 2,
   filed on December 22, 1983, Post-Effective Amendment No. 3, filed on March
   30, 1987; 33-19015 filed on December 11, 1987; 33-21356 filed on April 21,

   filed December 13, 1994; and Form S-8 No. 333-05799 filed June 12, 1996.

        Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the
        Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers,
        and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the
        foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been
        advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange
        Commission such indemnification is against public policy as
        expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore,
        unenforceable.  In the event that a claim for indemnification
        against such liabilities (other than the payment by the
        registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer,
        or controlling person of the registrant in the successful
        defense of any action, suit, or proceedings) is asserted by such
        director, officer, or controlling person in connection with the
        securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the
        opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by
        controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate
        jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is
        against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be
        governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
