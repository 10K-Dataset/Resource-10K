PART 1

ITEM 1 - BUSINESS

We are a leading manufacturer of water heating equipment and electric motors,
serving a diverse mix of residential, commercial and industrial end markets principally in the United States with a growing international presence. Our company is comprised of two reporting segments: Water Products and Electrical Products. Our Water
Products business manufactures and markets a comprehensive line of residential gas and electric water heaters, standard and specialty commercial water heating equipment, high-efficiency copper-tube boilers, and water systems tanks. Our Electrical
Products business manufactures and markets a comprehensive line of hermetic motors, fractional horsepower alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) motors. In 2007, we had net sales of approximately $2.3 billion, with 61 percent attributable
to our Water Products business and 39 percent attributable to our Electrical Products business.

The following table summarizes our sales
by reporting segment. This segment summary and all other information presented in this section should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appear in Item 8 in
this document.

WATER PRODUCTS

In our Water Products business, sales increased 13 percent or $162 million in 2007 over the prior year due to a full year of the GSW business acquired in April 2006, which added $128 million in
sales in the first quarter of 2007; sales growth of 26 percent in China, which added $30 million in sales; and increased sales of commercial water heaters. Excluding the incremental sales added by the GSW acquisition, sales in the residential market
segment were lower in 2007 than in 2006.

We serve residential, commercial and industrial end markets with a broad range of products,
including:

Residential gas and electric water heaters

. Our residential water heaters come in sizes ranging from two-gallon
(point-of-use) models to 120-gallon appliances with varying efficiency ranges. We offer traditional atmospheric and tankless water heaters as well as direct-vented, power-vented and condensing models for today’s energy efficient homes. North
American residential water heater sales in 2007 were approximately $990 million or 70 percent of segment revenues.

Standard commercial
water heaters.

Our gas, oil and electric water heaters come in capacities ranging from 6 gallons to 130 gallons and are used by customers who require a consistent, economical source of hot water. Typical applications include restaurants, hotels
and motels, laundries, car washes and small businesses.

A significant portion of our Water Products business is derived from the
replacement of existing product, and it is believed that the sale of product to the North American residential new housing construction market represents approximately 15 percent of the segment’s total sales. Our Water Products business also
manufactures and markets specialty commercial water heaters, copper-tube boilers, expansion tanks and related products and parts.

We are
the largest manufacturer and marketer of water heaters in North America, and we have a leading share in both the residential and commercial segments of the market. In the commercial market segment, we believe our comprehensive product line gives us
a competitive advantage in this higher-margin segment of the water heating industry. As the leader in the residential water heating market segment, we offer an extensive line of high-efficiency gas and electric models.

Our Water Products wholesale distribution channel includes more than 1,250 independent wholesale plumbing distributors with more than 5,800 selling
locations serving residential, commercial and industrial markets. We also sell our residential water heaters through the retail channel. In this channel, our customers include five of the seven largest national hardware and home center chains,
including long-standing private label relationships with both Lowes and Sears, Roebuck and Co.



We entered the Chinese water heater market through a joint venture in 1995, buying out our partner three
years later. Since that time, we have been aggressively expanding our presence while building brand recognition in the Chinese residential and commercial markets. In 2007, the company generated sales of $147 million in China, an increase of 26
percent, compared with 2006. We believe we are the second largest supplier of water heaters to the residential market in China.

We sell
our water heating products in highly competitive markets. We compete in each of our targeted market segments based on product design, quality of products and services, performance and price. Our principal domestic water heating competitors include
Rheem Manufacturing Company, Inc., Bradford-White Corporation and Lochinvar Corporation. Our primary competitor in China is Haier Appliances, a Chinese company, but we also compete with Makro, Rinnai and Ariston, as well as numerous other Chinese
private and state-owned water heater and boiler manufacturing companies.

ELECTRICAL PRODUCTS

In our Electrical Products business, improved selling price and growth in the global market were more than offset by lower unit volumes. Sales in the
segment declined one percent in 2007, or approximately $12 million, to $894.0 million compared with 2006. Unit volume sales were negatively impacted by the weak housing market, most notably in the residential hermetic and pump motor segments which
more than offset improved sales in the commercial hermetic and distribution market segments.

We are one of the four largest manufacturers
of electric motors in North America. We offer a comprehensive line of hermetic motors, fractional horsepower AC and DC motors, and integral horsepower motors, ranging in size from sub-fractional C – frame ventilation motors up to
1,320 horsepower hermetic and 400 horsepower integral motors. We believe our extensive product offerings give us an advantage in our targeted markets, often allowing us to serve all of our customer’s electric motor needs.

Our motors are used in a wide range of targeted residential and commercial applications, including: hermetic motors that are sold worldwide to
manufacturers of air conditioning and commercial refrigeration compressors; fractional horsepower fan motors used in furnaces, air conditioners and blowers; fractional horsepower motors for pumps for home water systems, swimming pools, hot tubs and
spas; fractional horsepower motors used in other consumer products (such as garage door openers); and integral horsepower AC and DC motors for industrial and commercial applications. Sales to the North American OEM heating, ventilating, air
conditioning and refrigeration market account for approximately 33 percent of segment sales. Approximately 82 percent of our 2007 segment sales were to OEMs in a diverse mix of industries, with the remainder of sales sold through aftermarket or
distribution channels. We believe that at least 25 percent of our total segment sales were attributable to products used outside of the United States. A significant portion of our Electrical Products business is derived from the replacement of
existing product, and it is believed that the sale of product to the residential new housing construction market in North America represents approximately 25 percent of the segment’s total sales.

To remain a leader in this highly competitive industry, we are committed to being a low-cost supplier of electric motors. Since 2001, we have undertaken
initiatives to accelerate cost-reduction in our motor operations to enhance our competitive position. These initiatives included the closure of seven U.S. facilities as well as our operations in Bray, Ireland and Taizhou, China, transferring related
production to our lower cost operations in Mexico and China.

At the end of the third quarter of 2007, we announced that we will close our
operations in Scottsville, KY, and Mebane, NC, and consolidate our hermetic motor assembly operations in Acuna, Mexico and Suzhou, China. We expect the transfer of work at both hermetic motor facilities to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2008.
We will also close our motor manufacturing facility in Budapest, Hungary, and transfer the remaining production to China. The 2007 expense associated with the closure of Budapest was $9.2 million while we received a tax benefit of $9.9 million
associated with the write down of that investment. We expect to complete the closing of Budapest by the end of February 2008. For all of 2007, the restructuring expense at Electrical Products totaled $22.8 million before taxes or $8.9 million after
taxes, equivalent to $.29 per share.



In 2008, we expect to record an additional pretax restructuring charge of approximately $13.2 million
associated with the above-mentioned facilities, equivalent to $7.9 million after taxes, or approximately $.25 per share. The expense is expected to be incurred relatively evenly throughout 2008.

In November 2003, we acquired Taicang Special Motor Co., Ltd. (Taicang), of Suzhou, China, a manufacturer of hermetic motors for commercial air
conditioning equipment. Taicang currently serves the Chinese operations of a number of North American air conditioning companies and enhances our position in the global hermetic motor market. In November of 2005, we completed our fourth motor
acquisition in China with the purchase of Yueyang Zhongmin Special Electrical Machinery Co., Ltd. Located in Hunan Province, Yueyang, manufactures large hermetic motors used in commercial air conditioning applications.

We sell our electric motor products in highly competitive markets. We compete in each of our targeted market segments based on product design, quality of
products and services, performance and price. Our principal competitors in the electric motor industry are Emerson Electric Co., Regal Beloit Corporation and Baldor Electric Company.

RAW MATERIAL

Raw materials for our manufacturing operations, which consist
primarily of steel, copper and aluminum, are generally available from several sources in adequate quantities. We typically hedge a portion of our annual copper and aluminum purchases to protect against price volatility. In addition a portion of
Electrical Products customers are contractually obligated to accept price changes based on fluctuations in certain of our raw material prices. Recent consolidation in the steel industry and world-wide demand for steel have resulted in significant
cost increases for steel.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

In order to improve competitiveness by generating new products and processes, we conduct research and development at our Corporate Technology Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as well as at our operating units. Total
expenditures for research and development in 2007, 2006, and 2005 were $47.8, $42.3, and $36.0 million, respectively.

PATENTS AND
TRADEMARKS

We own and use in our businesses various trademarks, trade names, patents, trade secrets and licenses. While a number of
these are important to us, we do not believe that our business as a whole is materially dependent upon any such trademark, trade name, patent, trade secret or license.

EMPLOYEES

Our company and its subsidiaries employed approximately 16,800 employees as of
December 31, 2007.

BACKLOG

Due to the short-cycle nature of our businesses, none of our operations sustain significant backlogs.

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS

Our operations are governed by a variety of federal, state and local laws intended to protect the
environment. While environmental considerations are a part of all significant capital expenditures, compliance with the environmental laws has not had and is not expected to have a material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings, or
competitive position of our company. See Item 3.

ITEM 1A – RISK FACTORS

You should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below and all
other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the documents incorporated by reference, before making an investment decision regarding our common stock. If any of the events contemplated by the following risks actually
occurs, then our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. The risks and
uncertainties below are not the only risks facing our company.

n

Because we participate in markets that are highly competitive, our revenues could decline as we respond to competition

We sell all of our products in highly competitive markets. We compete in each of our targeted markets based on product design, quality of products and
services, product performance, maintenance costs, and price. We compete against manufacturers located in the United States and throughout the world. We also face potential competition from some OEMs to whom we sell our electrical products and from
our customers and the end users of our products, who continually assess any costs that could be reduced by vertically integrating or using alternate sources for the products we manufacture. Some of our competitors may have greater financial,
marketing, manufacturing, and distribution resources than we have. We cannot assure that our products and services will continue to compete successfully with those of our competitors or that we will be able to retain our customer base or improve or
maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers, all of which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

n

A portion of our business could be adversely affected by a decline in new residential or commercial construction

We sell a portion of our products for new residential and commercial construction. The strength of these markets depends on new housing starts and
business investment, which are a function of many factors beyond our control, including interest rates, employment levels, availability of credit and consumer confidence. Downturns in the markets we serve could result in lower revenues and lower
profitability. New housing starts declined in 2006 and 2007 and the pace may continue at the lower levels or decline further and commercial construction activity, which has been high in recent years, could decline as well. We believe that
approximately 15 percent of our Water Products and 25 percent of our Electrical Products businesses, respectively, are affected by changes in the residential housing construction markets. Furthermore, though we believe that the majority of the
commercial business we serve is for replacement, we could also be affected by changes in the commercial construction market.

n

We depend on revenues from a few significant customers, and any loss, cancellation, reduction, or delay in purchases by these customers could harm our
business

Net sales to our four largest customers represented approximately 26 percent of 2007 net sales. Our success
will depend on our continued ability to develop and manage relationships with significant customers. We expect that significant customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future. Our dependence on sales from a relatively small number
of customers makes our relationship with each of these customers important to our business. We cannot assure that we will be able to retain our largest customers. Some of our customers may in the future shift their purchases of products from us to
our competitors or to other sources. The loss of one or more of our largest customers, any reduction or delay in sales to these customers, our inability to successfully develop relationships with additional customers, or future price concessions
that we may make could significantly harm our business.



n

We increasingly manufacture our products outside the United States, which may present additional risks to our business

A significant portion of our 2007 net sales were attributable to products manufactured outside of the United States, principally in Mexico and China, and
expanding international manufacturing capacity in Mexico and China is part of our strategy to reduce costs. Approximately 6,600 of our 16,800 total employees and 17 of our 40 manufacturing facilities are located in Mexico. Approximately 4,400
employees and five manufacturing facilities are located in China. International operations generally are subject to various risks, including political, religious, and economic instability, local labor market conditions, the imposition of foreign
tariffs and other trade restrictions, the impact of foreign government regulations, and the effects of income and withholding tax, governmental expropriation, and differences in business practices. We may incur increased costs and experience delays
or disruptions in product deliveries and payments in connection with international manufacturing and sales that could cause loss of revenue. Unfavorable changes in the political, regulatory, and business climate could have a material adverse effect
on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

n

In serving U.S. customers of our electric motors business, we manufacture a significant portion of our products in Mexico and China, which exposes us to the
risk of increased labor costs due to both wage inflation in Mexico and stability or increases in the value of the Mexican peso and Chinese RMB relative to the U.S. dollar

Over 90% of our electric motor manufacturing productive labor hours are incurred in Mexico and China. The peso based costs we incur manufacturing these products are directly related to
changes in labor costs in Mexico and fluctuations in exchange rates of the Mexican peso relative to the U.S. dollar. The labor costs we incur are measured in U.S. dollars and based on the cost of labor in Mexican pesos. Historically, Mexico has had
higher wage inflation than the United States. That inflation does not adversely affect our costs when there is a corresponding decrease in the value of the Mexican peso relative to the U.S. dollar. However, during periods in which the value of the
Mexican peso increases or remains stable relative to the U.S. dollar, higher wage inflation in Mexico results in an increase in our labor costs. Manufacturing and material costs we incur in China are principally incurred in Chinese RMB. If the RMB
continues to strengthen against the U.S. dollar our costs would increase.

n

Our operations could be adversely impacted by material price volatility and supplier concentration

The market price for certain key materials we purchase (e.g., steel, copper, aluminum, diesel fuel and natural gas) have been very volatile in the recent
past. While our company periodically does enter into futures contracts to fix the cost of certain raw material purchases, principally copper and aluminum, significant increases in the cost of any of the key materials we purchase could increase our
cost of doing business and ultimately could lead to lower operating earnings if we are not able to recover these cost increases through price increases to our customers. Historically, there has been a lag in any customer recovery of increased
material costs. In addition, in some cases we are dependent on a single or limited number of suppliers for some of the raw materials and components required in the manufacture of our product.

n

Our pension plans are under-funded and the plans could be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates and decreasing investment returns on invested plan
assets

The projected benefit obligations of our defined benefit pension plans exceeded the fair value of the plan
assets by $39.7 million at December 31, 2007. The pension plans continue to meet all funding requirements under ERISA regulations, and under current assumptions, no funding will be required until the Pension Protection Act (PPA) provisions
become effective in 2008. Beginning in 2008, the minimum required contribution will equal the target normal cost plus a seven year amortization of any funding shortfall, offset by any ERISA credit balance. Among the key assumptions inherent in the
actuarially calculated pension plan obligation and pension plan expense are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets. If interest rates and actual rates of return on invested plan assets were to decrease significantly, our
pension plan obligations could increase materially.

n

We have significant goodwill and an impairment of our goodwill could cause a decline in our net worth

Our total assets include substantial goodwill. The goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess of the purchase price we paid over the
fair value of the tangible and intangible assets we acquired. We assess whether there has been impairment in the value of our goodwill during the fourth quarter of each calendar year or sooner if triggering events warrant. If future operating
performance at one or more of our businesses does not meet expectations, we may be required to reflect,



under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating results for goodwill impairment. The recognition of an impairment of a significant
portion of goodwill would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material. A significant reduction in our stockholders’ equity due to an impairment of goodwill may affect our ability
to maintain the required debt-to-capital ratio existing under our debt arrangements. We have identified the valuation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as a critical accounting policy. See “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies—Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets” included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

n

A substantial contribution to our financial results has come through acquisitions, and we may not be able to identify or complete future acquisitions, which
could adversely affect our future growth

Acquisitions we have made since 1997 have had a significant impact on our
results of operations during that period. While we will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions, we may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions, obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms,
obtain regulatory approval for certain acquisitions, or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future. If we complete any future acquisitions, then we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses or operate them profitably or
accomplish our strategic objectives for those acquisitions. Our level of indebtedness may increase in the future if we finance acquisitions with debt, which would cause us to incur additional interest expense and could increase our vulnerability to
general adverse economic and industry conditions and limit our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing. We cannot assure you that future acquisitions will not have a material adverse affect on our financial condition, results of
operations, and cash flows.

n

Our results of operations may be negatively impacted by product liability lawsuits and claims

Our water heater and electric motor products expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture, and sale of our
products. While we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance, we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms or that this insurance will provide adequate protection
against potential liabilities. In addition, we self-insure a portion of product liability claims. A series of successful claims against us could materially and adversely affect our reputation and our financial condition, results of operations, and
cash flows.

n

Significant repositioning activities are planned for the electric motor business and if implementations are delayed or transitions are not successful with our
customers, we could lose business to our competitors

Our electric motors business has successfully closed plants and
transitioned many products to lower cost regions, however, every plant closure carries the risk of a failed execution. If we fail to transition the product on time or if we fail to meet the customer’s testing requirements at the new facility,
we could lose some business to our competitors. We cannot assure that we will be able to retain all of the business that we are moving and the loss of a customer or a particular product line to a competitor could negatively impact our operating
earnings.

n

One stockholder has voting control of the company

We have two classes of common equity: our Common Stock and our Class A Common Stock. The holders of Common Stock are entitled, as a class, to elect only 25 percent of our board of directors. The holders of
Class A Common Stock are entitled, as a class, to elect the remaining directors. As of December 31, 2007, Smith Investment Company effectively controlled 70 percent of our board of directors and our operations because it beneficially owned
approximately 98 percent of our Class A Common Stock. Due to the differences in the voting rights between shares of our Common Stock and shares of our Class A Common Stock, Smith Investment Company is in a position to control to a large
extent the outcome of matters requiring a stockholder vote, including the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or approval of transactions involving a change of control. The differences in the voting rights between
shares of our Common Stock and our Class A Common Stock could have the effect of delaying, deterring, or preventing a change of control. As of December 31, 2007, Smith Investment Company beneficially owned approximately 32 percent of the
total number of outstanding shares of our Common Stock and Class A Common Stock.



ITEM 1B - UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

None.

ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES

Properties utilized by the company at December 31, 2007, were as follows:

Water Products

This segment has 14 manufacturing plants located in 5 states and 4 non-USA countries, of which 11 are owned directly by the company or its subsidiaries and 3 are leased from outside parties. Lease terms generally provide for minimum terms
of ten years and have one or more renewal options. The term of leases in effect at December 31, 2007, expire between 2009 and 2015.

Electrical Products

This segment has 26 manufacturing plants located in 2 states and 4 non-USA countries, of which
14 are owned directly by the company or its subsidiaries and 12 are leased from outside parties. Lease terms generally provide for minimum terms of five to twenty years and have one or more renewal options. The term of leases in effect at
December 31, 2007, expire between 2008 and 2015.

Corporate and General

The company considers its plants and other physical properties to be suitable, adequate, and of sufficient productive capacity to meet the requirements
of its business. The manufacturing plants operate at varying levels of utilization depending on the type of operation and market conditions. The executive offices of the company, which are leased, are located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

ITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are involved in various unresolved legal actions, administrative
proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business involving product liability, property damage, insurance coverage, exposure to asbestos and other substances, patents and environmental matters including the disposal of hazardous waste.
Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions or the range of possible loss or recovery, we believe, based on past experience, adequate reserves and insurance availability, that these unresolved
legal actions will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. A more detailed discussion of these matters appears in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

In a Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 19, 2007, the company disclosed an adverse verdict in a product liability
lawsuit in Baldwin County, Alabama.

On February 19, 2008, all plaintiffs executed a Release, Settlement and Confidentiality Agreement
(the Settlement) resolving the lawsuit in its entirety. The Settlement is subject to Baldwin County Court approval, which the company believes will be granted. As part of the Settlement, the adverse verdict will be vacated by the Baldwin County
Court. The terms of the Settlement are confidential. The company’s expense related to the Settlement is included in the reserve recorded as of December 31, 2007.

ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We achieved record net earnings of $88.2 million or $2.85 per share in 2007, compared with
$76.5 million or $2.47 per share in 2006 and $46.5 million or $1.54 per share in 2005. Net earnings recorded in 2007 were higher than 2006 due to a full year of the GSW business acquired in April 2006, higher sales of commercial product, another
strong year for our China water heater business and a lower effective tax rate. These improvements were partially offset by higher SG&A expenses and restructuring charges in 2007 compared with 2006. Net earnings recorded in 2006 were higher than
in 2005 as a result of the GSW acquisition in the second quarter of 2006, higher margins in both businesses and strong China water heater company performance. Our individual segment performance will be discussed later in this section.

Our working capital was $295.0 million at December 31, 2007 compared with $322.7 million and $268.4 million at December 31, 2006 and
December 31, 2005, respectively. The $27.7 million reduction in our working capital in 2007 compared with 2006 was a result of lower inventories in our Electrical Products segment. Higher accounts payable balances in both businesses were offset
by an increase in our Water Products segment’s accounts receivable balances. The $54.3 million increase in working capital in 2006 from 2005 was primarily due to the acquisition of GSW. In addition, increases in receivables, primarily in our
Water Products segment, and increases in inventory levels, primarily in our Electrical Products segment, were partially offset by an expansion in the accounts payable balances at Water Products.

Cash provided by operating activities during 2007 was $190.5 million compared with $128.8 million during 2006 and $186.7 million during 2005. Higher net
earnings in 2007 compared with 2006 combined with higher depreciation and amortization and the working capital decrease described above explain the $61.7 million year over year improvement in our cash flow. Despite higher earnings in 2006, cash
provided by operating activities was lower than in 2005 due to a $21.1 million expansion in working capital in 2006 compared with the significant contraction in working capital that was achieved in 2005.

Our capital expenditures were $71.4 million in 2007, slightly higher than the $68.2 million spent in 2006. Our capital spending in 2006 was almost $18
million higher than in 2005 due primarily to the capital spending at GSW, acquired in April of 2006, and higher spending at Electrical Products. We are projecting 2008 capital expenditures of between $85 and $90 million, at least $15 million greater
than projected depreciation and amortization expense. The projected increase in capital spending in 2008 over 2007 levels is associated with the expansion of our Nanjing, China water heater and Yueyang, China motor operations.

In February 2006, we completed a $425 million multi-currency five year revolving credit facility with a group of ten banks. The facility backs up
commercial paper and credit line borrowings, and it expires on February 17, 2011. As a result of the long-term nature of this facility, the commercial paper and credit line borrowings, as well as drawings under the facility are classified as
long-term debt. At December 31, 2007, we had available borrowing capacity of $207.6 million under this facility. We believe that the combination of available borrowing capacity and operating cash flow will provide sufficient funds to finance
our existing operations for the foreseeable future.

Our total debt was $395.2 million at the end of December 2007 compared with $439.0
million at the end of 2006. In turn, our leverage, as measured by the ratio of total debt to total capitalization, was 34 percent at the end of 2007 compared with 39 percent at the end of 2006 and 22 percent at the end of 2005.

Our purchase of GSW was completed on April 3, 2006 for $339.3 million US Dollar equivalent. The purchase was made with a combination of borrowings
under our credit facility, commercial paper and $30 million (Canadian) term notes. As a result of the acquisition, our total debt increased $269.7 million from $169.3 million at December 31, 2005 to $439.0 million at December 31, 2006.



Aggregate Contractual Obligations

A summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007, is as follows:

As of December 31, 2007 the liability for uncertain income tax positions was $4.8 million.
Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid.

We utilize blanket purchase orders to communicate expected annual requirements to many of our suppliers. Requirements under blanket
purchase orders generally do not become committed until several weeks prior to the company’s scheduled unit production. The purchase obligation amount presented above represents the value of commitments considered firm.

GSW operated a captive insurance company to provide product liability and general liability insurance to its subsidiary, American Water Heater Company
(American). We decided to cover American’s liability exposures with our existing insurance programs and operate the captive in runoff effective July 1, 2006. The reinsurance company restricts the amount of capital which must be maintained
by the captive. At December 31, 2007, the restricted amount was $38.9 million compared with $37.7 million at the end of 2006 and is included in other non-current assets. The restricted assets are invested in money market securities.

In February 2007, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program in the amount of one million shares of our common stock. During 2007, we
completed the repurchase of all one million shares at an average cost of $36.62 per share. Our board approved an additional one million shares to be repurchased under this program at its December 14, 2007 meeting.

Our pension plan continues to meet all funding requirements under ERISA regulations. While we were not required to make a contribution to the plan in
2007, we elected to make a contribution of $16.0 million. Similarly, no contributions are required to be made in 2008, but we may elect to make a voluntary contribution at some point in 2008. For further information on our pension plan, see Note 11
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

We have paid dividends for 68 consecutive years with payments increasing each of the
last 16 years. We paid total dividends of $.70 per share in 2007 compared with $.66 per share in 2006.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Our sales in 2007 were a record $2.31 billion, an increase of $150.8 million, or 7.0 percent from sales of $2.16 billion in 2006. The
sales increase occurred in our Water Products segment and was due to a full year of the GSW business acquired in April 2006, which added $128 million of sales in the first quarter of 2007 as well as increased sales of commercial water heaters and
higher sales in China. Sales for Electrical Products declined $11.9 million from $905.9 million in 2006 to $894.0 million in 2007 as improved pricing was more than offset by lower volume. Sales in 2006 increased by $472.1 million or 27.9 percent
from sales of $1.69 billion in 2005 due to our GSW acquisition, which contributed $361.3 million in sales as well as an increase of $35 million in sales at our China operation and general improvement in our commercial and residential businesses.



Sales in 2006 for Electrical Products increased $44.9 million over 2005 due to improved pricing and our Yueyang acquisition made in November 2005, which more
than offset a unit volume decline in the underlying motor business.

Our gross profit margin for 2007 was 22.2 percent compared to 21.5
percent in 2006. The improved margins in 2007 were due mostly to sales of higher margin products in our Water Products segment. Our gross profit margin increased from 20.8 percent in 2005 to 21.5 percent in 2006 due to the addition of GSW and
improved margins in the legacy water heater business.

Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) increased $39.0 million from
$324.0 million in 2006 to $363.0 million in 2007. The majority of the increase in SG&A in 2007 was due to higher selling and advertising costs to support increased sales at our water heater segment and included $15.2 million of first quarter
SG&A attributable to the GSW acquisition. SG&A increased $72.2 million from 2005 to 2006 due to the addition of GSW, continued expansion in China and higher pension costs.

Pension expense in 2007 was $12.2 million compared to $11.9 million in 2006 and $5.1 million in 2005. The increase in pension expense from 2006 to 2007 was due to curtailment charges and other
one-time expenses as partially offset by lower amortization of deferred asset losses. The increase in pension expense from 2005 to 2006 was due to recognition of deferred asset losses.

In 2007, a pretax charge of $24.7 million was recorded for restructuring and other charges. Of this charge, $22.8 million was recognized in our Electrical Products segment with $12.0 million of
the charge attributable to the closing of our operations in Scottsville, KY and Mebane, NC and the write down of other assets. The closing of these plants results in our hermetic motor assembly operations being consolidated in Acuna, Mexico and
Suzhou, China. The pretax charge of $9.2 million associated with the closing of our motor facility in Budapest, Hungary is also included in the restructuring charge. We expect to recognize an additional $13.2 million pretax restructuring charge in
2008 associated with the aforementioned closings. Transfer of work from Scottsville and Mebane to Mexico is scheduled to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2008, while the remaining production from Budapest is expected to be transferred to China
by the end of the first quarter of 2008. A pretax charge of $1.6 million is included in the Electrical Products charge for certain other domestic repositioning and asset write-down expenses. In addition to the restructuring charges at Electrical
Products we also recognized a $1.9 million pretax corporate charge related to previously owned businesses. In 2006, a pretax restructuring and other charge of $9.6 million was recorded. Of this charge, $8.9 million was recognized in our Electrical
Products segment most of which was related to the closure of our McMinnville, TN motor fabrication plant which was completed in the first quarter of 2007 and the closure of our motor operation in Taizhou, China in the fourth quarter of 2006. In
2005, our Electrical Products segment recorded restructuring charges of $12.4 million of which $7.0 million was related to the closure of our Bray, Ireland facility and was non-deductible for tax purposes and an additional $5.4 million charge was
related to product repositioning programs at domestic motor plants. An additional $4.2 million of restructuring and other charges was recorded in 2005 as corporate expense and was associated with previously owned businesses.

Interest expense in 2007 increased to $26.7 million from $24.9 million in 2006 due to GSW acquisition related financing costs incurred for a full year in
2007 versus only nine months in 2006. Interest expense increased from $13.0 million in 2005 to $24.9 million in 2006 due to incremental debt incurred to finance the acquisition of GSW.

In 2007 net other income was $0.9 million compared to net other expense of $0.6 million in 2006. The differential was due to $0.5 million of interest income on restricted marketable securities
for GSW in the first quarter of 2007 with the remainder due primarily to exchange gains associated with U.S. dollar denominated purchases made by our Canadian operations. Net other expense decreased by $1.3 million from 2005 to 2006 as a result of
interest income on the restricted marketable securities acquired in the GSW transaction.

Our effective tax rate was 11.7 percent in 2007,
27.3 percent in 2006 and 32.3 percent in 2005. The 2007 effective rate includes a $3.7 million tax benefit upon completion of tax audits and lapse of statutes of limitations and a $1.1 million China investment incentive tax benefit. Also included in
the 2007 rate is a $9.9 million tax benefit associated with the write off of the investment in our Hungarian subsidiary. The geographic composition of our 2007 and 2006 pretax earnings resulted in a significant reduction in our effective tax rate in
those years as a greater proportion of earnings was recognized in the lower taxed countries of China and Mexico compared to the United States and Europe. The higher rate in 2005 was impacted by losses incurred in Ireland that could not be tax
effected.



Our 2007 net earnings were a record $88.2 million, an increase of $11.7 million or 15.3 percent over net
earnings of $76.5 million in 2006. On a per share basis, 2007 earnings were $2.85 compared with $2.47.

Water Products

Sales for our Water Products segment were a record $1.42 billion in 2007, or $162.3 million higher than sales of $1.26 billion in
2006. The increase was due to a full year of the GSW business acquired in April 2006, which added $128.0 million of sales in the first quarter of 2007, a $30.1 million increase in sales at our China operation and increased sales of commercial water
heaters. Sales in 2006 were $427.5 million higher than sales of $833.3 million in 2005. The increase was due to our GSW acquisition, which contributed $361.3 million in sales, an increase of almost $35 million in sales at our China operation and
general improvement in our commercial and residential businesses.

Operating earnings for Water Products increased 22.5 percent to $150.0
million in 2007 from $122.4 million in 2006. The increase in earnings was due to an additional three months of GSW earnings, higher earnings in China and sales of higher margin products all of which offset lower residential water heater volume.
Operating earnings of $122.4 million in 2006 were 54 percent higher than earnings of $79.5 million in 2005. The increase was primarily due to the GSW acquisition but was also the result of the $35 million revenue increase in China and improved
performance and product mix in the legacy business.

Electrical Products

Sales in our Electrical Products segment in 2007 were $894.0 million or 1.3 percent lower than 2006. Increased selling prices to offset higher costs for
raw materials were more than offset by the impact of lower unit volume primarily caused by the weak housing market. Lower volume in the residential hermetic and pump motor markets more than offset improved sales in the commercial hermetic and
distribution market segments. Sales in 2006 of $905.9 million were 5.2 percent higher than 2005. Sales from our Yueyang acquisition made in November 2005 accounted for half of the sales increase while improved pricing, as partially offset by a unit
volume decline, provided the remainder of the increase.

Operating earnings at our Electrical Products segment were $23.1 million in 2007
compared with $48.1 million in 2006. The majority of the decline in earnings was due to an increase in restructuring charges from $8.9 million in 2006 to $22.8 million in 2007. The remaining decline in earnings was caused by lower unit volumes.
Operating earnings in 2006 were $5.8 million higher than earnings of $42.3 million in 2005 due mostly to a reduction in restructuring charges from $12.4 million in 2005 to $8.9 million in 2006. Please refer to the previous discussion on
restructuring charges for additional details.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our accounting policies are described in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Also as disclosed in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires the use of estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects
cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements.

The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates associated with the
evaluation of the impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, as well as significant estimates used in the determination of liabilities related to warranty activity, product liability, and pensions. Various assumptions and other
factors underlie the determination of these significant estimates. The process of determining significant estimates is fact-specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience and trends, and in some cases, actuarial techniques. We
constantly reevaluate these significant factors and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate. Historically, actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using the estimates described above.

Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets

In conformity with U.S. GAAP, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. We
perform impairment reviews for our reporting units using a fair-value method based on management’s judgments and assumptions. The fair value represents the estimated amount at which a reporting unit could be bought or sold in a current
transaction between willing parties on an arms-length basis. The estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including recorded goodwill. We are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets become impaired. Any impairment review is, by its nature, highly judgmental as estimates of future sales,



earnings and cash flows are utilized to determine fair values. However, we believe that we conduct annual thorough and competent valuations of goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets and that there has been no impairment.

Product warranty

Our products carry warranties that generally range from one to ten years and are based on terms that are generally accepted in the market. We provide for
the estimated cost of product warranty at the time of sale. The product warranty provision is estimated based upon warranty loss experience using actual historical failure rates and estimated costs of product replacement. The variables used in the
calculation of the provision are reviewed on a periodic basis. At times, warranty issues may arise which are beyond the scope of our historical experience. While our warranty costs have historically been within its calculated estimates, it is
possible that future warranty costs could differ significantly from those estimates. We provide for any such warranty issues as they become known and estimable. The allocation of the warranty liability between current and long-term is based on the
expected warranty liability to be paid in the next year as determined by historical product failure rates.

Product liability

Due to the nature of our products, we are subject to product liability claims in the normal course of business. A substantial portion
of these claims involve our Water Products business, while such claims in our Electrical Products business have historically been limited. We maintain insurance to reduce our risk. Most insurance coverage includes self-insured retentions that vary
by year. As of December 31, 2007, we maintained a self-insured retention of $5.0 million per occurrence with an aggregate insurance limit of $125.0 million per occurrence.

GSW insurance coverage included self-insurance retentions that varied by business segment and by year. Effective April 3, 2006 GSW maintained a $25.0 million aggregate loss retention through
self-insurance and captive insurance company coverage. GSW claims occurring on or after July 1, 2006 are covered under the company’s insurance program.

We establish product liability reserves for our self-insured retention portion of any known outstanding matters based on the likelihood of loss and our ability to reasonably estimate such loss. There is inherent
uncertainty as to the eventual resolution of unsettled matters due to the unpredictable nature of litigation. We make estimates based on available information and our best judgment after consultation with appropriate advisors and experts. We
periodically revise estimates based upon changes to facts or circumstances. We also use an actuary to calculate reserves required for estimated incurred but not reported claims as well as to estimate the effect of adverse development of claims over
time.

Pensions

We
have significant pension benefit costs that are developed from actuarial valuations. The valuations reflect key assumptions regarding, among other things, discount rates, expected return on assets, retirement ages, and years of service.
Consideration is given to current market conditions, including changes in interest rates in making these assumptions. Our assumptions for the expected rate of return on plan assets is 8.75 percent in 2007, unchanged from 2006. The discount rate used
to determine net periodic pension costs increased from 5.75 percent in 2006 to 5.90 percent in 2007. In 2008, the rate of return on plan assets is 8.75 percent and the discount rate is 6.5 percent.

In developing our expected long-term rate of return assumption, we evaluate our pension plan’s target asset allocation, the historical long-term
rates of return of equity and bond indices and the actual historical returns of our pension plan. Our plan’s target allocation to equity managers is between 60 to 70 percent, with the remainder allocated primarily to bond managers and a small
allocation to private equity managers. Due to market fluctuations, our actual asset allocation as of December 31, 2007, was 71 percent to equity managers, 24 percent to bond managers, four percent to private equity managers and the remainder in
money market instruments. We regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Our pension plan’s historical 10-year and 25-year compounded annualized
returns are 8.6 percent and 12.1 percent, respectively. We believe that with our target and actual allocation and the historical long-term returns of equity and bond indices as well as our actual historical returns, our 8.75 percent expected return
on assets for 2008 is reasonable.

The discount rate assumptions used to determine future pension obligations at December 31, 2007 and
2006 were based on the Hewitt Yield Curve (HYC), which was designed by Hewitt Associates to provide a means for plan sponsors to value the liabilities of their postretirement benefit plans. The HYC is a hypothetical double A yield curve represented
by a series of



annualized individual discount rates. Each bond issue underlying the HYC is required to have a rating of Aa or better by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc.
or a rating of AA or better by Standard & Poor’s. Prior to using the HYC rates, the discount rate assumptions for pension expense in 2005 was based on investment yields available on AA rated long-term corporate bonds. The discount
rates determined on the basis described above were 6.5 percent, 5.9 percent and 5.75 percent at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions at least annually, and we will adjust the
assumptions as necessary.

We estimate that we will recognize approximately $5.0 million of pension expense in 2008 compared to $12.2
million in 2007. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on assets by 25 basis points would increase our net pension expense for 2008 by approximately $1.8 million. Lowering the discount rate by 25 basis points would increase our 2008 net
pension expense by approximately $1.4 million.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB
Statement No. 109

.

”

This interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity’s financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income
Taxes.” It prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. The provisions of FIN 48 were adopted by the company on January 1,
2007. Please see Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further disclosure.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements." SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that
prioritizes information used in developing assumptions when pricing an asset or liability. SFAS No. 157 will be effective for the company beginning in 2008. The company is assessing the potential impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 157
will have on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 158, "Employer's Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans - an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132 (R)." SFAS No. 158 requires that the company recognize the overfunded or underfunded
status of its defined benefit and retiree medical plans as an asset or liability in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2006, with changes in the funded status recognized through comprehensive income in the year in which they occur. As further
discussed in Note 11, the company adopted SFAS No. 158 effective December 31, 2006. SFAS No. 158's provisions regarding the change in the measurement date of postretirement benefit plans are not applicable as the company already
uses a measurement date of December 31 for its benefit plans.

Outlook

We are forecasting lower unit sales in our residential businesses in 2008. Furthermore, we believe the weakness in construction could broaden and negatively affect our commercial businesses later
in the year. Accordingly, we are projecting commercial sales to be flat to down in the North American market for the full year. On a more positive note, we expect our businesses in China to continue to generate favorable results in the coming year.
In the face of these market challenges, as evidenced by the actions we are taking in our motor business, our operating units are working diligently to reduce costs and better position operations for market adversity. As a result of our cautious
outlook for the year, we expect A. O. Smith to earn between $2.70 and $2.90 per share in 2008, which includes restructuring expense of approximately $.25 per share.

OTHER MATTERS

Environmental

Our operations are governed by a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws concerning the generation and management of hazardous materials, the discharge of pollutants into
the environment and remediation of sites owned by the company or third parties. We have expended financial and managerial resources complying with such laws. Expenditures related to environmental matters were not material in 2007 and are not
expected to be material in any single year. We have accrued amounts associated with environmental obligations at various facilities and we believe these reserves are sufficient to cover reasonably anticipated remediation costs. Although we believe
that our operations are substantially in compliance with such laws and maintain procedures designed to maintain compliance, there are no assurances that substantial additional costs for compliance will not be incurred in the future. However, since
the same laws govern our competitors, we should not be placed at a competitive disadvantage.



Market Risk

We are exposed to various types of market risks, primarily currency and certain commodities. We monitor our risks in such areas on a continuous basis and generally enter into forward and futures contracts to minimize
such exposures for periods of less than one year. We do not engage in speculation in our derivatives strategies. Further discussion regarding derivative instruments is contained in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Commodity risks include raw material price fluctuations. We use futures contracts to fix the cost of our expected needs for certain raw materials (i.e.
copper and aluminum) with the objective of reducing price risk. Futures contracts are purchased over time periods and at volume levels which approximate expected usage. At December 31, 2007, we had commodity futures contracts amounting to $66.5
million of commodity purchases. A hypothetical ten percent change in the underlying commodity price of such contracts would have a potential impact of $6.7 million. It is important to note that gains and losses from our futures contract activities
will be offset by gains and losses in the underlying commodity purchase transactions being hedged.

In addition, we enter into foreign
currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies. At December 31, 2007, we had net foreign currency contracts outstanding of $146.9 million. Assuming a hypothetical ten percent movement in the respective
currencies, the potential foreign exchange gain or loss associated with the change in rates would amount to $14.7 million. It is important to note that gains and losses from our forward contract activities will be offset by gains and losses in the
underlying transactions being hedged.

Our earnings exposure related to movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding
floating-rate debt instruments that are determined by short-term money market rates. At December 31, 2007, we had $198.9 million in outstanding floating-rate debt with a weighted-average interest rate of 5.1 percent at year end. A hypothetical
ten percent annual increase or decrease in the year-end average cost of our outstanding floating-rate debt would result in a change in annual pretax interest expense of approximately $1.0 million.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Organization and Significant Accounting Policies

Organization.

A. O. Smith Corporation (the company) is a manufacturer serving customers worldwide. The company’s major product lines include residential and commercial gas and electric water heating
equipment, as well as fractional horsepower alternating current, direct current, and hermetic electric motors. The company’s products are manufactured and marketed primarily in North America and China. Water heaters are sold through both
wholesale and retail channels to plumbing wholesalers and retail outlets. Electric motors are sold principally to original equipment manufacturers and distributors.

Consolidation.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany transactions.

Use of estimates

. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair value of financial instruments

. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and trade payables approximated fair value as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, due to
the short maturities of these instruments. The carrying amount of long-term debt approximated fair value as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, based on current rates offered to the company for debt with the same or similar maturities. The fair
values of derivative financial instruments are discussed later in this footnote.

Foreign currency translation.

For all subsidiaries
outside the United States, with the exception of all Mexican operations and two of the China operations of the company’s Electrical Products segment, the company uses the local currency as the functional currency. For those operations using a
functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at weighted-average exchange rates. The resulting translation adjustments
are recorded as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. The Mexican operations and two of the Chinese operations of the company’s Electrical Products segment use the U.S. dollar as the functional currency as such operations are a
direct and integral component of the company’s U.S. operations. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in net earnings.

Cash and cash equivalents

. The company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.

Inventory valuation.

Inventories are carried at lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for
substantially all domestic inventories, which comprise 82 percent and 85 percent of the company’s total inventory at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Inventories of foreign subsidiaries and supplies are determined using the
first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.

Property, plant and equipment.

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is
computed primarily by the straight-line method. The estimated service lives used to compute depreciation are generally 25 to 50 years for buildings, 3 to 20 years for equipment and 3 to 7 years for software. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed
as incurred.

Goodwill and other intangibles.

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed for
impairment on an annual basis. Intangible assets of $78.8 million including $32.1 million with an indefinite life were recorded as part of the GSW Inc (GSW) acquisition (see Note 2). Indefinite-lived assets totaled $38.0 million and $39.0 million at
December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Separable intangible assets primarily comprised of customer relationships that are not deemed to have an indefinite life are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives
which range from 10 to 25 years. Amortization of $4.5 million and $2.9 million was recorded in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The 2005 amount was not significant. In the future, amortization should approximate $4.1 million annually and the intangible
assets will be amortized over a weighted average period of 16 years. Total accumulated amortization at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $9.3 million and $4.8 million, respectively.

Impairment of long-lived and amortizable intangible assets.

Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the related asset or



1.

Organization and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

group of assets, a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the asset or group of assets. Such analyses necessarily
involve significant judgment.

Derivative instruments.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, as amended,
requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and establishes criteria for designation and effectiveness of the hedging relationships. Any fair value changes are recorded in net earnings or other
comprehensive earnings.

The company utilizes certain derivative instruments to enhance its ability to manage currency and interest rate
exposures as well as raw materials price risks. Derivative instruments are entered into for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. The company does not enter into
contracts for speculative purposes. The contracts are executed with major financial institutions with no credit loss anticipated for failure of the counterparties to perform.

Commodity Futures Contracts

In addition to entering into supply arrangements
in the normal course of business, the company also enters into futures contracts to fix the cost of certain raw material purchases, principally copper and aluminum, with the objective of minimizing changes in cost due to market price fluctuations.

The commodity futures contracts are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges of a forecasted transaction. Derivative commodity
liabilities of $3.5 million are recorded in accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2007. Derivative commodity assets of $14.8 million were recorded in other current assets as of December 31, 2006. The value of the effective portion of the
contracts of $(2.0) million and $9.3 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, and reclassified into cost of products sold in the period in which the underlying
transaction was recorded in earnings. Ineffective portions of the commodity hedges are recorded in earnings in the period in which the ineffectiveness occurs. The impact of hedge ineffectiveness on earnings was not material in 2007, 2006 and 2005.

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts

The company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of certain subsidiaries. The company utilizes foreign currency forward purchase and
sale contracts to manage the volatility associated with foreign currency purchases, sales and certain intercompany transactions in the normal course of business. Contracts typically have maturities of one year or less. Principal currencies include
the Mexican peso, Chinese Renminbi, Canadian dollar and Euro.

Forward contracts are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges of a
forecasted transaction. Derivative currency assets of $2.9 million and $2.6 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, were recorded in other current assets. Gains and losses on these instruments are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive loss, net of tax, until the underlying transaction is recorded in earnings. When the hedged item is realized, gains or losses are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to the statement of earnings. The assessment of
effectiveness for forward contracts is based on changes in the forward rates. These hedges have been determined to be perfectly effective.

The majority of the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss for cash flow hedges is expected to be reclassified into earnings within one year.



1.

Organization and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

The following table summarizes, by currency, the contractual amounts of the company’s foreign
currency forward contracts.

The forward contracts in place at December 31, 2007 and 2006, amounted to approximately 60
percent and 80 percent, respectively, of the company’s anticipated subsequent year exposure for those currencies hedged.

Interest
Rate Swap Agreement

The company is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of its floating rate borrowings under its revolving
credit facility. The company uses interest rate swaps to manage this risk. As of December 31, 2007, the company had one interest rate swap outstanding in the amount of $25 million that expires in November 2010.

The interest rate swap is designated and accounted for as a cash flow hedge of floating rate debt. A derivative interest rate liability of $0.7 million
as of December 31, 2007 and a $0.1 derivative interest rate asset as of December 31, 2006 are recorded in accrued liabilities and other current assets, respectively. Gains and losses on this instrument are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive loss, net of tax, until the underlying transaction is recorded in earnings. When the hedged item is realized, gains or losses are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to the statement of earnings. The assessment of
effectiveness for the interest rate swap is based on changes in floating rate interest rates. This swap has been determined to be perfectly effective.

Revenue recognition.

The company recognizes revenue upon transfer of title, which occurs upon shipment of the product to the customer except for certain export sales where transfer of title occurs when the
product reaches the customer destination.

Contracts and customer purchase orders are used to determine the existence of a sales
arrangement. Shipping documents are used to verify shipment. The company assesses whether the selling price is fixed or determinable based upon the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or
adjustment. The company assesses collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer’s payment history.

Accruals for customer returns for defective product are based on historical experience with similar types of sales. Accruals for rebates and incentives are based on pricing agreements and are
tied to sales volume. Changes in such accruals may be required if future returns differ from historical experience or if actual sales volume differs from estimated sales volume. Rebates and incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales.

Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in net sales and the related costs are included in cost of products sold.

Advertising.

Advertising costs are charged to operations as incurred and amounted to $38.0, $30.5, and $24.4 million during 2007,
2006 and 2005, respectively.

Research and development.

Research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred
and amounted to $47.8, $42.3 and $36.0 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Product warranties.

The company’s
products carry warranties that generally range from one to ten years and are based on terms that are generally accepted in the market. The company records a liability for the expected cost of warranty-related



1.

Organization and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

claims at the time of sale. The allocation of our warranty liability between current and long-term is based on expected warranty claims to be paid in the
next year as determined by historical product failure rates.

The following table presents the
company’s product warranty liability activity in 2007 and 2006:

Environmental costs.

The company accrues for losses associated with environmental
obligations when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable. Costs of estimated future expenditures are not discounted to their present value. Recoveries of environmental costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is
considered probable. The accruals are adjusted as facts and circumstances change.

Stock-based compensation.

Effective
January 1, 2006, the company adopted SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS 123(R)), using the modified-prospective transition method. Under that method compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date
(a) based on the requirements of SFAS 123(R) for all share-based payments granted after the effective date and (b) based on the requirements of SFAS 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS 123(R) that
remain unvested on the effective date. SFAS 123(R) had no impact on the company’s financial position, statement of operations or cash flows at the date of adoption. SFAS 123(R) requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in
exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant. Compensation cost is recognized using the straight-line method over the vesting period of the award. SFAS 123(R) also requires the benefits of tax
deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under prior literature. Excess tax deductions of $4.8 million and $4.2 million were recognized as a
financing cash flow in 2007 and 2006, respectively. This requirement reduced net operating cash flows and increased net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. The amount of operating cash flows recognized for such excess tax deductions was
$4.5 million in 2005. The company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on, among other things, when employees exercise stock options.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), the company followed the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” which encouraged, but did not
require companies to record compensation cost for stock-based employee compensation plans at fair value. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), the company accounted for share-based compensation in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related interpretations. Accordingly, because the number of shares were fixed and the exercise price of the stock options equaled the market price of the underlying stock on the
date of grant, no compensation expense was recognized. Had compensation cost been determined based upon the fair value at the grant date for stock option awards under the plan based on the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the company’s pro
forma earnings and earnings per share would have been as follows:



1.

Organization and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Except as mentioned above, there is no other impact of adopting SFAS
123 (R) versus SFAS No. 123.

Earnings per share of common stock.

The numerator for the calculation of basic and diluted
earnings per share is net earnings. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted weighted-average shares used in the earnings per share calculations:

Restricted marketable securities.

As described in Note 2, the company acquired GSW in 2006.
GSW operated a captive insurance company to provide product liability and general liability insurance to its subsidiary American Water Heater Co. (American). The company decided to cover American’s prospective liability exposures with its
existing insurance programs and all product liability claims for events which occurred prior to July 1, 2006 will be financed by the captive. The reinsurance company restricts the amount of capital which must be maintained by the captive and
this restricted amount is $38.9 million and $37.7 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The $38.9 million and $37.7 million of restricted money market instruments are included in other assets on the company’s balance sheet
at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The cost of the money market instruments approximates fair value.

Recent accounting
pronouncements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.” (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. SFAS 157 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes information used in developing assumptions when pricing an asset or liability. SFAS 157 will be effective for the company beginning in 2008. The company is assessing the
potential impact that the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

2.

Acquisitions

On
April 3, 2006, the company acquired GSW, a publicly traded Canadian-based manufacturer which operated in two business segments: water heaters and building products. The water heating segment manufactures and markets water heaters sold in the
U.S. and Canada through its American and GSW Water Heater subsidiaries. The addition of GSW to the company’s existing water heater operations expands the company’s share of the growing retail channel of the U.S. residential water heater
market segment as well as increases its presence in the Canadian residential water heater market segment. On December 19, 2006, the company sold the building products business for $11.4 million and in 2007, recorded a reduction in sales
proceeds of $0.4 million associated with a working capital adjustment. For accounting purposes, the operations of the building products business are reported as a discontinued operation.

The aggregate purchase price, net of $39.3 million of cash acquired, was $307.7 million. This was comprised of $339.3 million for the outstanding stock and $7.7 million of acquisition costs
principally incurred in 2005. In addition, $36.9 million of payments were made for change in control provisions and tax liabilities assumed.

The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition as finalized in 2007. The non-deductible goodwill has been recorded within the Water Products segment. Of the
$78.8 million of acquired intangible assets, $32.1 million was assigned to indefinite-lived trademarks that are not subject to amortization and $46.7 million was assigned primarily to customer relationships which have amortization periods ranging
from 10 to 25 years.



2.

Acquisitions (continued)

The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and accordingly, the
results of operations have been included in the company’s financial statements from the April 3, 2006 date of acquisition.

The
pro forma unaudited results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, assuming consummation of the purchase as of January 1, 2005, are as follows (dollars in millions except per share data):

The pro forma results have been prepared for informational purposes only and include adjustments
for depreciation expense of acquired plant and equipment, amortization of intangible assets other than goodwill and trademarks, increased interest expense on acquisition debt, and certain other adjustments, together with related income tax effects
of such adjustments. Anticipated efficiencies from the consolidation of manufacturing and commercial activities and anticipated lower material costs related to the consolidation of purchasing have been excluded from the pro forma operating results.
These pro forma results do not purport to be indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had the purchase been made as of the beginning of the period presented or of the results of operations that may occur in the future.

In November 2005, the company acquired Yueyang Zhongmin Special Electrical Machinery Co., Ltd. (Yueyang), a manufacturer of hermetic
motors located in Yueyang City, Hunan Province, China. The total cost of the acquisition was $17.9 million including fixed future payments of $1.4 million which were made in 2006 as well as potential future payments not to exceed $1.7 million
subject to reductions for claims the company may make if there are any breaches of the representations and warranties made by the selling shareholders under the acquisition agreement. $1.2 million was paid to the sellers in 2007. The remaining $0.5
million is currently in dispute. This cost exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired by $10.6 million which was recorded as goodwill in the Electrical Products segment.

The purchase price for the Yueyang acquisition was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon estimates of its respective fair value at the date of acquisition. The
operating results have been included in the company’s consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition.

Restructuring and Other Charges

Electrical Products Restructuring and Related Charges

In June 2005, Electrical Products closed the motor operation in Bray, Ireland which supplied large commercial hermetic motors to European air
conditioning and refrigeration customers. Pre-tax restructuring and related charges of $7.0 million were recognized in 2005 related to the Bray plant closure. No tax deduction was available in Ireland for restructuring costs. The Bray closure was
substantially complete as of December 31, 2005.

In 2005, the company recognized $5.4 million in charges for additional restructuring
initiatives associated with product repositioning programs at our domestic motor plants. Those activities were substantially complete as of December 31, 2005.

In 2006, $7.3 million of expense was recognized for the continuation of domestic repositioning activities. The majority of the charge is related to the closure of our McMinnville, TN, motor fabrication plant which was
completed in the first quarter of 2007. Additionally, a pretax charge of $1.6 million was recognized for the closure of the Taizhou, China plant which was closed in the fourth quarter of 2006.

In 2007, $13.6 million of expense was recognized for the continuation of domestic repositioning activities. Included in this amount is an asset impairment charge of $10.6 million. The majority of
the domestic repositioning charges relate to the announced closure of the Scottsville, KY and Mebane, NC production facilities. Electrical Products will consolidate its hermetic motor assembly operations in Acuna, Mexico and Suzhou, China. The
closures are expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2008.

Additionally, in 2007, Electrical Products recognized $9.2 million of
expense (of which $7.5 million is an asset impairment charge), and a $9.9 million tax benefit related to the announced closure of its Budapest, Hungary facility. The closure of its Budapest Hungary facility will result in the remaining operations
being transferred to China. This closure is expected to be completed in February 2008.

The following table presents an analysis of the
company’s Electrical Products restructuring reserve as of and for the years ended December 31, 2007 , 2006 and 2005 (dollars in millions):

Other Charges – Tower Automotive, Inc.

The company was the primary lessee on a facility lease in Corydon, Indiana related to a business sold to Tower Automotive, Inc. (Tower) in 1997. The
company entered into a sublease arrangement with Tower in 1997 with the same terms and conditions as the company lease. Tower filed for bankruptcy on February 2, 2005 and subsequently notified the company that it would reject the sublease
arrangement effective October 1, 2005. In order to minimize costs, the company purchased the Corydon facility for $4.5 million on October 11, 2005. The company recognized $0.5 million, $0.4 million and $1.2 million expense in 2007, 2006
and 2005, respectively, related to facility maintenance and the company’s estimate of its ultimate net loss upon disposition of this facility.



3.

Restructuring and Other Charges (continued)

Other Charges – Previously Owned Businesses

In 2007, the company recognized $1.4 million of expense associated with retained liabilities of previously owned businesses which were sold by the
company between 1997 – 2001. The majority of the $1.4 million expense is related to certain costs associated with previously owned real estate. The company recognized expense of $0.3 million in 2006 related to the settlement of an environmental
liability. In 2005, the company recognized expense of $3.0 million associated with retained liabilities of previously owned businesses related to revised estimates for certain environmental liability exposure and employee benefit litigation matters.

Statement of Cash Flows

Supplemental cash flow information is as follows:

5.

Inventories

The company recognized after-tax LIFO income of $4.3 million, $0.6 million and $2.1 million in
2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

6.

Property, Plant and Equipment

7.

Goodwill

The company
concluded that no impairment existed at the time of the annual impairment tests which were performed in the fourth quarters of 2007, 2006 and 2005. The two reporting units used to test goodwill for impairment are Water Products and Electrical
Products.



7.

Goodwill (continued)

Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006,
consisted of the following:

8.

Debt and Lease Commitments

The company has a $425 million multi-year multi-currency revolving credit agreement with a group
of ten banks, which expires on February 17, 2011. Borrowings under the company’s bank credit lines and commercial paper borrowings are supported by the revolving credit agreement. As a result of the long-term nature of this facility, the
commercial paper and credit line borrowings are classified as long-term debt at December 31, 2007 and 2006. At its option, the company maintains either cash balances or pays fees for bank credit and services.

Scheduled maturities of long-term debt within each of the five years subsequent to December 31, 2007, are as follows: 2008-$15.6; 2009-$17.5; 2010 -
$21.1; 2011-$236.0; 2012-$25.1 million.

Future minimum payments under non-cancelable operating leases relating mostly to office,
manufacturing and warehouse facilities total $49.0 million and are due as follows: 2008-$14.1; 2009-$9.9; 2010-$6.9; 2011-$3.9; 2012-$3.0, and thereafter – $11.2 million. Rent expense, including payments under operating leases, was $26.6, $25.6
and $24.9 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.



8.

Debt and Lease Commitments (continued)

Interest paid by the company was $26.7, $24.9 and $13.0 million in
2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

9.

Stockholders’ Equity

The company’s authorized capital consists of 3 million shares of Preferred Stock $1 par value, 14 million shares of Class A Common Stock $5 par value, and 60 million shares of Common Stock $1 par value. The Common
Stock has equal dividend rights with Class A Common Stock and is entitled, as a class, to elect 25 percent of the Board of Directors and has 1/10th vote per share on all other matters. Class A Common Stock is convertible to Common Stock on
a one for one basis.

During 2007, 2006 and 2005, 23,540, 193,975 and 22,757 shares, respectively, of Class A Common Stock were
converted into Common Stock. Regular dividends paid on the Class A Common Stock and Common Stock amounted to $.70, $.66 and $.64 per share in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

In February 2007, the company's Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 1,000,000 shares of its outstanding Common Stock. As of December 31, 2007, the company has completed this
program at a total cost of $36.6 million. In December 2007, the company’s Board of Directors authorized the purchase of an additional 1,000,000 shares of its outstanding Common Stock.

At December 31, 2007, 32,595 and 2,463,745 shares of Class A Common Stock and Common Stock, respectively, were held as treasury stock. At December 31, 2006, 32,595 and 1,832,696
shares of Class A Common Stock and Common Stock, respectively, were held as treasury stock.

Accumulated other comprehensive loss is as follows:

10.

Stock Based Compensation

The company adopted the A. O. Smith Combined Incentive Compensation Plan (the “plan”) effective January 1, 2007. The plan is a continuation of the A. O. Smith Combined Executive Incentive Compensation Plan which was
originally approved by shareholders in 2002. The plan provides for the issuance of 1,250,000 stock options, restricted stock or share units. Stock options are issued at exercise prices equal to the fair value of Common Stock on the date of grant.
Additionally, any shares that would have been available for stock options, restricted stock or share units under the predecessor plan, if that plan was in effect, will be available for granting of share based awards under the plan. The stock options
granted in 2007 and 2006 become exercisable three years from the date of grant. Of the 175,600 options granted in 2005, 26,900 become exercisable one year from date of grant and 148,700 become exercisable with three year pro rata vesting from date
of grant. For active employees, all options granted in 2007, 2006 and 2005 expire ten years after date of grant. The number of shares available for granting of options or share units at December 31, 2007, was 1,271,388. Upon stock option
exercise, restricted stock grant, or share unit vesting, shares are issued from Treasury stock.

Total
stock based compensation cost recognized in 2007, 2006, and 2005 was $4.6, $3.0 and $4.3 million, respectively.

Stock options

Stock option compensation recognized in 2007 and 2006 was $1.7 million and $0.7 million, respectively. Stock option expense recognized
in the year ended December 31, 2007, included $0.5 million of expense associated with the accelerated vesting of stock option awards for certain executives who either retired or were retirement eligible in 2007.



10.

Stock Based Compensation (continued)

Stock options

Changes in option shares, all of which are Common Stock, were as follows:

The aggregate intrinsic value for the outstanding and exercisable options as of December 31,
2007 is $9.0 million and $7.6 million, respectively. The average remaining contractual life for outstanding and exercisable options is 6 years.

The following table summarizes weighted-average information by range of exercise prices for stock options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2007:

The weighted-average fair value per option at the date of grant during 2007, 2006 and 2005, using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, was $14.43, $12.94 and $10.82, respectively. Assumptions were as follows:



10.

Stock Based Compensation (continued)

The expected life is based on historical exercise behavior and the projected exercise of unexercised
stock options. The risk free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect on the date of grant for the respective expected life of the option. The expected dividend yield is based on the expected annual dividends divided by the
grant date market value of our common stock. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock.

Restricted stock and share units

Participants may also be awarded shares of restricted stock or share units under the
plan. The company granted 68,600, 21,000, and 120,000 share units under the plan in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The company granted 15,000 shares of restricted stock in 2005. The restricted stock and share units were valued at $2.7, $0.8 and
$3.9 million at the date of issuance in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and will be recognized as compensation expense ratably over the three-year vesting period. Compensation expense of $2.9, $2.3 and $4.3 million was recognized in 2007, 2006
and 2005, respectively. Share based compensation expense in 2007 and 2005 included $0.5 million and $1.8 million of expense, respectively, associated with the accelerated vesting of restricted stock and share unit awards for certain executives who
retired or were retirement eligible in those years.

A summary of restricted stock and share unit activity
under the plan is as follows:

Total compensation expense for restricted stock and share units not yet recognized is $2.3 million
at December 31, 2007. The weighted average period over which the expense is expected to be recognized is one year.

11.

Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefits

The company provides retirement benefits for all United States employees including benefits for employees of previously owned businesses which were earned up to the date of sale. The company also has several foreign
pension plans, none of which are material to the company's financial position.

The company has a defined-contribution profit sharing and
retirement plan covering the majority of its salaried nonunion employees which provides for annual company contributions of 35 percent to 140 percent of qualifying contributions made by participating employees. The amount of the company's
contribution in excess of 35 percent is dependent upon the company's profitability. The company also has defined-contribution plans for certain hourly employees which provide for annual matching company contributions.

The company has several unfunded defined-benefit post-retirement plans covering certain hourly and salaried employees that provide medical and life
insurance benefits from retirement to age 65. Certain hourly employees retiring after January 1, 1996, are subject to a maximum annual benefit and salaried employees hired after December 31, 1993, are not eligible for post-retirement
medical benefits.

On December 31, 2006, the company adopted SFAS No. 158, "Employer's Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
Other Postretirement Plans - an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)." SFAS 158 requires that the company recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of its defined benefit and retiree medical plans as an asset or
liability in the balance sheet with changes in the funded status recognized through comprehensive income in the year in which they occur. The impact of adoption was a one time before tax charge to accumulated other comprehensive loss of $28.3
million.

Obligations and Funded Status

Pension and Post-Retirement Disclosure Information Under FASB Statements 132 and 158

The following tables present the changes in benefit obligations, plan assets and funded status for domestic pension and post-retirement plans and the components of net periodic benefit costs.

*

In addition the company has recorded a liability for a foreign pension plan of $0.5 million and $0.6 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively and an accumulated other comprehensive loss of $0.5 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006.



11.

Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefits (continued)

The estimated net actuarial loss and prior service cost for the pension plans that will be
amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost during 2008 are $7.7 million and $0.5 million, respectively. The estimated net actuarial loss and prior year service cost for the post-retirement benefit plans that
will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost during 2008 are each less than $0.1 million. As permitted under paragraph 26 of FASB Statement No. 87 and paragraph 53 of Statement No. 106, the
amortization of any prior service cost is determined using a straight-line amortization of the cost over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the Plan.

The 2007 and 2006 after tax adjustments for additional minimum pension liability resulted in other comprehensive earnings of $33.8 million and $15.0
million, respectively.

Assumptions

Actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December 31 are as follows:

Actuarial assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost
for the year ended December 31 are as follows:



11.

Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefits (continued)

In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption, the company evaluated its pension
plan’s target and actual asset allocation and historical long-term rates of return of equity and bond indices. The company also considered its pension plan’s historical 10-year and 25-year compounded annualized returns of 8.6 percent and
12.1 percent, respectively.

Assumed health care cost trend rates

Assumed health care cost trend rates as of December 31 are as follows:

A one-percentage-point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates would not result in a
material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements.

Plan Assets

The company’s pension plan weighted asset allocations as of December 31 by asset category are as follows:

The company’s target allocation to equity managers is between 60 to 70 percent with the
remainder allocated primarily to bond managers and a small allocation to private equity managers. The company regularly reviews its actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances its investments to the targeted allocation when considered
appropriate.

There is no company stock included in plan assets at December 31, 2007 and 2006.

Cash Flows

The
company is not required to contribute to its pension plans. In 2007, the company made contributions of $16 million and may elect to make a contribution during 2008.

Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefits (continued)

Estimated Future Payments

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid:

12.

Income Taxes

The components of the provision for income taxes from continuing operations consisted of the following:

The provision for income taxes differs from the U.S. federal
statutory rate due to the following items:

Components of earnings from continuing operations before income
taxes were as follows:



12.

Income Taxes (continued)

Total taxes paid by the company amounted to $14.1, $37.3, and $6.9 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. Included in the 2007 and 2006 taxes paid are $4.2 million and $9.2 million of net tax payments for the companies acquired in 2006 relating to periods before the acquisition.

No provision for U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes has been made on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as such earnings are considered to be permanently invested. At
December 31, 2007, the undistributed earnings amounted to $184.5 million. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on the undistributed earnings is not practicable. In addition, no provision or benefits for U.S. income
taxes have been made on foreign currency translation gains or losses.

The tax effects of temporary differences of assets and liabilities
between income tax and financial reporting are as follows:

These deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or
long-term based on the balance sheet classification of the related assets and liabilities as follows:

The company has foreign net operating loss carryovers with tax benefits of $3.9 million. Of the
$3.9 million of tax benefits, $3.6 million have an unlimited carryover period and $0.3 million expire in 2008. Based on future realizability, a valuation allowance of $3.9 million has been established against the foreign net operating loss carryover
tax benefits.

The company also has state and local net operating loss carryovers having a tax value of $4.7 million and state and local
tax credit carryovers of $1.3 million. These carryovers expire between 2010 and 2027. Based on future realizability, no valuation allowance has been established against the state and local carryover tax benefits.

During 2007 and 2006, the valuation allowance was decreased and goodwill decreased by $1.3 million and $1.0 million, respectively, to reflect expected
utilization of tax benefits previously acquired with the State Industries, Inc. acquisition in 2001. Also, in 2007 the valuation allowance was increased by $0.7 million for the current year tax benefits of foreign loss carryovers that are not
expected to be utilized and decreased by $0.2 million to reflect expiration of foreign net operating losses. The valuation allowance was also decreased by $2.0 million in 2006 to reflect expiration of federal capital loss carryovers previously
acquired with the State Industries, Inc. acquisition and by $0.3 million to reflect expiration of foreign net operating loss carryovers.



12.

Income Taxes (continued)

In China, foreign investment enterprises engaged in manufacturing activities are granted favorable
tax treatment during start-up periods. The enterprises are granted a two-year tax exemption and a three-year 50% tax rate reduction beginning with the enterprise's first profit making year. In 2007 three of the company's China subsidiaries benefited
from the favorable tax treatment. The consolidated earnings would have been $0.11 per share lower without the tax holiday.

The Company
adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. There was no cumulative effect of adoption recorded to retained earnings. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized benefits is as follows:

The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate
is $3.7 million. The company recognizes potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense. At January 1, 2007, there was $0.8 million of interest and penalties accrued. The amount was
reduced to $0.4 million during 2007. It is not anticipated there will be a significant change in the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months. The company’s U.S. federal tax returns for 2005-2007 are subject to audit. The
company is subject to state and local audits for tax years 2003-2007. The company is subject to non-U.S. income tax examinations for years 2001-2007.

13.

Commitments and Contingencies

The company is a potentially responsible party in eight judicial and administrative proceedings initiated on behalf of various state and federal regulatory agencies seeking to clean up sites which have been environmentally impacted and to
recover costs they have incurred or will incur as to the sites.

The company has established reserves for the sites and insurance proceeds
and potential recovery from third parties are available to cover a portion of the company's potential liability. The company believes that any environmental claims for these sites in excess of reserves, insurance proceeds and indemnified amounts
will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations.

The company or its subsidiaries have been named as a
co-defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos integrated into certain of the company’s or its subsidiaries’ products or premises. The company and its subsidiaries have never manufactured asbestos. As
of December 31, 2007 the company and its subsidiaries are defendants in lawsuits involving claims by approximately 66,072 plaintiffs. The company and its subsidiaries have made no payment in a substantial majority of the cases closed to date.
The remainder of the resolved cases have settled for amounts that are not material to the company, and the costs of defense and settlements have been supported in part by insurance.

The company has been named as a co-defendant in lawsuits alleging manganese-induced illness involving claims by approximately 2,560 plaintiffs. The claimants in these lawsuits allege that
exposure to manganese in welding consumables caused them to develop adverse neurological conditions, including a condition known as manganism, and are seeking compensatory and, in many instances, punitive damages, usually for unspecified sums. The
company manufactured welding consumables from 1918 until it sold that business to another company in 1965. The company has not been found liable in any of the lawsuits and has not paid any settlements. The costs of defense have been paid by
insurance, and the company believes it has adequate insurance coverage to cover its exposure.



13.

Commitments and Contingencies (continued)

The company is subject to various claims and pending lawsuits for product liability and other matters
arising out of the conduct of the company's business. With respect to product liability claims, the company has self-insured a portion of its product liability loss exposure for many years. The company has established reserves which it believes are
adequate to cover incurred claims. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the company had $125 million of product liability insurance for individual losses in excess of $5 million. The company periodically reevaluates its exposure on
claims and lawsuits and makes adjustments to its reserves as appropriate. The company believes, based on current knowledge, consultation with counsel, adequate reserves and insurance coverage that the outcome of such claims and lawsuits will not
have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In a Form 8-K filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on October 19, 2007, the company disclosed an adverse verdict in a product liability lawsuit in Baldwin County, Alabama.

On February 19, 2008, all plaintiffs executed a Release, Settlement and Confidentiality Agreement (the Settlement) resolving the lawsuit in its entirety. The Settlement is subject to Baldwin County Court
approval, which the company believes will be granted. As part of the Settlement, the adverse verdict will be vacated by the Baldwin County Court. The terms of the Settlement are confidential. The company's expense related to the Settlement is
included in the reserve recorded as of December 31, 2007.

Operations by Segment

The
company has two reportable segments: Water Products and Electrical Products. The Water Products segment manufactures residential and commercial gas and electric water heaters used in a wide range of applications including hotels, laundries, car
washes, factories and large institutions. In addition, the Water Products segment manufactures copper tube boilers used in large-volume hot water and hydronic heating applications. The Electrical Products segment manufactures fractional horsepower
alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) motors used in fans and blowers in furnaces, air conditioners and ventilating systems; as well as in other consumer products such as home appliances and pumps for swimming pools, hot tubs and spas. In
addition, the Electrical Products segment manufactures hermetic motors which are sold worldwide to manufacturers of compressors used in air conditioning and refrigeration systems.

The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” outlined in Note 1. Operating earnings, defined by
the company as earnings before interest, taxes, general corporate and corporate research and development expenses, is used to measure the performance of the segments and allocate resources.



14.

Operations by Segment (continued)

Sales to a major customer within the Water Products segment totaled $251.1 million in 2007 which
is 11% of the company's net sales. There were no sales to customers exceeding 10% of consolidated net sales in 2006 or 2005.

Assets,
depreciation and capital expenditures by segment

The majority of corporate assets consists of cash and cash
equivalents and deferred income taxes.

Net sales and long-lived assets by geographic location

The following data by geographic area includes net sales based on product shipment destination and long-lived assets based on physical location.
Long-lived assets include net property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets, other intangibles and long-lived assets of previously owned businesses.



15.

Quarterly Results of Operations (Unaudited)

Net earnings per share are computed separately for each period and, therefore, the sum of such
quarterly per share amounts may differ from the total for the year. Electrical Products 2007 fourth quarter net earnings included a $2.4 million LIFO benefit, net of tax, associated with lower inventory levels and bad debt expense of $1.5 million,
net of tax.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

A.O. Smith Corporation

We have audited A.O. Smith Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). A.O. Smith Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our
opinion, A.O. Smith Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of A.O. Smith Corporation as of
December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 and our report dated
February 1, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
