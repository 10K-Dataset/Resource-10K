   ITEM 1 - BUSINESS

   A. O. Smith Corporation, a Delaware corporation organized in 1916, its
   subsidiaries and its affiliates (hereafter collectively called the
   "Corporation" unless the context otherwise requires) are engaged in four
   business segments.  These segments are Original Equipment Manufacturer
   ("OEM") Products, Water Products, Agricultural Products, and Other
   Products.

   The Corporation's principal OEM Products business is the Automotive
   Products Company, a supplier of truck and automobile structural components
   and assemblies.  OEM Products also includes the Electrical Products
   Company which produces fractional horsepower and hermetic electric motors. 
   Included in Water Products is the Water Products Company, a leading
   manufacturer of residential and commercial gas, oil, and electric water
   heating systems.  Agricultural Products consists of two units. 
   A. O. Smith Harvestore Products, Inc. (Harvestore) is a manufacturer of
   agricultural feed storage and handling systems, for which AgriStor Credit
   Corporation (AgriStor) provides financing, and industrial and municipal
   water and bulk storage systems.  The Corporation intends to sell
   Harvestore and is in the process of liquidating Agristor.  Other Products
   consist of Smith Fiberglass Products Inc. which manufactures reinforced
   thermosetting resin piping.  Information regarding industry segments is
   provided in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements which appear
   elsewhere herein.

   The following table summarizes revenues by segment for the Corporation's
   operations.  This segment summary and all other information presented in
   this section should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial
   Statements and the Notes thereto which appear elsewhere herein.

   

   OEM PRODUCTS
   Automotive Products

   Automotive sales in 1993 of $606.3 million, or 51 percent of total
   Corporation revenues, increased almost 15 percent from previous year sales
   due to continued strength in both the light and heavy truck segments plus
   added volume in the passenger car segment.  As a result of increased
   volume, Automotive Products showed improved operating profits over 1992.

   The largest product group within Automotive Products continues to be truck
   frames and components which accounted for slightly more than 80 percent of
   Automotive Products' sales and 41 percent of the Corporation's revenues. 
   The company continues to hold its lead position in truck frame
   manufacturing in the United States and Canada, supplying more than 30
   percent of the 1993 market.

   Automotive Products had two product launches during 1993.  The company
   began to ship full frame assemblies for a Mazda pick-up truck in the
   spring.  During the third quarter, the company began production of a new
   full frame assembly in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, for Chrysler's Dodge Ram
   pick-up truck. 

   In 1994, the Granite City, Illinois, plant will begin shipping engine
   cradles for a new Ford Windstar mini-van and Lincoln Continental, and for
   the new Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique.  The Milan, Tennessee, plant
   will build trailing axles for the Ford mini-van and will manufacture a new
   structural assembly for Toyota U.S.A.  The company expects capital
   expenditures to increase in 1994 to support these and additional new
   product launches.

   Automotive Products has contracts, some of which are subject to economic
   price adjustments, to supply frame assemblies and components to Ford,
   General Motors and Chrysler in the light truck class.  The company is also
   a supplier of truck frames to most domestic producers of medium and
   heavy-duty trucks, such as Ford, Navistar International, General Motors,
   Freightliner and Paccar.

   The company believes the North American market will grow in 1994.  Longer
   term, the products now under development, combined with continuing
   strength in the economy could result in Automotive's sales surpassing $800
   million by 1996.

   The company's products are sold in highly competitive markets with its
   principal competitors including Dana Corporation and vertically integrated
   units of Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler.

   The following table summarizes sales to the company's three largest
   automotive customers:

                                Years Ended December 31 (Dollars in Millions)
                                 1993     1992     1991     1990     1989
      Ford
       Sales                   $266.9    $219.3   $177.5   $179.8    $171.3

   Electrical Products

   The Corporation's sales of electric motors which are included in the OEM
   Product segment totalled $242.5 million, or 20 percent of total
   Corporation revenues in 1993.  This represents a 7 percent increase over
   the previous year's sales of $225.6 million.  Although Electrical
   Products' sales increased in 1993, profits declined from 1992 levels due
   in part to the costs and lower initial productivity associated with
   transferring the hermetic motor production from Mt. Sterling, Kentucky to
   Mebane, North Carolina location. 

   Product lines include jet pump motors sold to manufacturers of home water
   systems, swimming pools, hot tubs and spas plus fan motors used in
   furnaces, air conditioners and ceiling fans as well as fractional
   horsepower motors used in other consumer products.  Hermetic motors are
   sold to almost every U.S. manufacturer of compressors and are used in air
   conditioning and refrigeration systems.  In addition to selling its
   products directly to OEMs, Electrical Products also markets its products
   through a distributor network which sells to both OEMs and the related
   after-market.

   The company has maintained a reduced break-even point, which remains more
   than 20 percent lower than in 1989.  This improved cost structure has
   roughly coincided with a competitive period in the motor industry and has
   accounted for the company's ability to remain profitable during this time. 
   Electrical Products has reduced costs through increased productivity and
   higher output from its Mexican facilities and reduced manufacturing
   conversion costs throughout the organization.  An improved economy should
   have a positive effect on Electrical Products' 1994 sales and earnings.

   Motor efficiency and environmental concerns are two areas influencing
   product development.  Electrical Products is working with new materials
   and variable speed designs that can improve the efficiency of both
   hermetic and fractional horsepower motors.  Work continues on new motors
   and motor insulation materials that are compatible with refrigerants that
   do not deplete the ozone layer.

   The company's principal products are sold in highly competitive markets
   with its major competitors being Emerson Electric, General Electric,
   Magnetek, Inc., Fasco and vertically integrated customers.

   WATER  PRODUCTS

   Sales in 1993 were a record $248.1 million which represented 21 percent of
   total Corporation revenues.  Sales were up over 15 percent compared to
   1992 sales of $215.2 million, as the company gained market share in
   residential water heaters and increased unit volume in higher margin
   commercial heaters.  Operating profits also set new highs increasing 33%
   percent over the prior year, which is the result of increased volume and
   improved pricing.  Water Products believes it is the most consistently
   profitable water heater supplier in the extremely competitive U. S.
   market.  

   Water Products markets residential gas and electric water heaters through
   a diverse network of plumbing wholesalers.  About 80 percent of Water
   Products' sales is in the less cyclical replacement market although the
   new housing market is an important segment as well.  The company's
   residential plants were able to adjust easily to 1993's increase in volume
   without significantly increasing costs.  The residential water heater
   market remains highly competitive with Water Products and three other
   manufacturers supplying over 90 percent of market requirements.

   Water Products markets commercial water heating systems through a diverse
   network of plumbing wholesalers and manufacturers' representatives. 
   Commercial water heating systems are used in a wide range of applications
   including schools, nursing homes, hospitals, prisons, hotels, motels,
   laundries, restaurants, stadiums, amusement parks, car washes, and other
   large users of hot water.  The commercial market is characterized by a
   much broader range of competitors than the residential market.

   The company expects both sales and profits will increase in 1994 due
   primarily to new product introductions and an improving economy.  In
   addition, Water Products intends to grow through the selective addition of
   quality distribution, possible acquisitions and further expansion of its
   international presence.

   The principal competitors in the Water Products segment are Rheem-Rudd,
   State Industries, Bradford-White and SABH, Inc.  Water Products believes
   it continues to be the largest manufacturer of commercial water heaters
   and the fourth largest manufacturer of residential water heaters in the
   United States.


   AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS

   Agricultural Products includes Harvestore and AgriStor.  Harvestore sales
   in 1993 were $33.3 million, which were about 20 percent higher than 1992
   sales of $27.7 million.  The increase was attributable to demand for water
   and agricultural waste storage systems.  Harvestore's operating profits
   were much improved over 1992.  AgriStor revenues in 1993 were $4.8
   million, down 25 percent from $6.4 million in 1992.  The lower revenues
   resulted from a decline in the size of Agristor's lending portfolio and
   represents management's continued progress toward its goal of phasing out
   of the agricultural finance business.  Agricultural Products sustained a
   net loss of $4.8 million between Harvestore and Agristor operations which
   include additional reserve provisions taken during the year.

   Harvestore manufactures and markets agricultural feed storage and handling
   systems, and industrial and municipal water and bulk storage systems. 
   Harvestore products are distributed through a network of independent
   dealers.  AgriStor assists farm customers in the financing of
   Harvestore[R] equipment out of offices in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Columbus,
   Ohio; and Memphis, Tennessee.

   A good backlog of Slurrystore[R] systems orders combined with the recovery
   in industrial capital spending will benefit Harvestore in 1994. 
   Harvestore expects sales and earnings to increase in 1994. 

   Stable interest rates and adequate milk prices also will have a positive
   impact on Agristor's operations.  The Corporation expects its agricultural
   operations loss in 1994 to be less than it was in 1993.

   Harvestore's principal competitor in the municipal and industrial segment
   is U.S. Filter.


   OTHER PRODUCTS

   Other Products consists essentially of Smith Fiberglass Products Inc. 
   Sales of Smith Fiberglass Products Inc. totaled $58.9 million in 1993; up
   34 percent from 1992 sales of $43.9 million.  Strong recoveries in the
   service station and petroleum production markets were largely responsible
   for the increase in sales.  The company doubled its profits compared to
   1992 due primarily to this resurgence in sales.

   Smith Fiberglass manufactures reinforced thermosetting resin piping used
   to carry corrosive materials.  Typical applications include chemical and
   industrial plant piping, oil field piping, and underground distribution at
   gasoline service stations.  Smith Fiberglass also manufactures high
   pressure fiberglass piping systems used in the petroleum production
   industry.  Its products are sold through a network of distributors.

   Smith Fiberglass should have another good year in 1994.  The company
   expects to increase its presence in international markets, expand
   participation in the petroleum marketing segment and aggressively pursue
   the chemical and industrial markets.

   Smith Fiberglass has two principal competitors which are Ameron
   Corporation and Fibercast Company.


   Raw Material

   Raw materials for the Corporation's operations, which consist primarily of
   steel, copper and aluminum, are generally available from several sources
   in adequate quantities.


   Seasonality

   The Corporation's third quarter revenues and earnings have traditionally
   been lower than the other quarters due to Automotive Products' model year
   changeovers and customer plant shutdowns.


   Research and Development, Patents and Trademarks

   The Corporation conducts new product and process development at its
   Corporate Technology Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and at its operating
   unit locations.  The objective of this activity is to increase the
   competitiveness of A. O. Smith and generate new products to fit the
   Corporation's market knowledge.  Total expenditures for research and
   development in 1993, 1992 and 1991 were approximately $7.6 million, $6.5
   million, and $6.1 million, respectively.

   The Corporation owns and uses in its businesses various trademarks, trade
   names, patents, trade secrets and licenses.  While a number of these are
   important to the Corporation, it does not consider a material part of its
   business to be dependent on any one of them.


   Employees

   The Corporation and its subsidiaries employed approximately 10,800 persons
   in its operations as of December 31, 1993.


   Backlog

   Normally none of the Corporation's operations sustain significant
   backlogs.


   Environmental Laws

   Compliance with federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of
   materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of
   the environment has not had a material effect and is not expected to have
   a material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive
   position of the Corporation.  See ITEM 3.


   Foreign Sales

   Total export sales from the U.S. were $71 million, $48 million, and $49
   million in 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively.  The increase in export
   sales from 1992 to 1993 was largely attributable to increased Automotive
   Products Company exports to Canada.  The amount of revenue and operating
   profit derived from, or the assets attributable to, sales outside the
   North American geographic area are not a substantial portion of total
   Corporation operations.

   ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES

   The Corporation manufactures its products in 35 locations worldwide. 
   These facilities have an aggregate floor space of approximately 8,927,000
   square feet and are owned by the Corporation with the exception of the
   following leased facilities:  four Automotive Products plants, two of
   which are approximately 124,000 square feet each, located in Corydon,
   Indiana and Rockford, Illinois, a plant of approximately 39,000 square
   feet in Bowling Green, Kentucky and a fourth plant of approximately 41,000
   square feet located in Barrie, Ontario, Canada; a Water Products Company
   plant with floor space of approximately 84,000 square feet located in
   Seattle, Washington and a second plant of approximately 100,000 square
   feet in El Paso, Texas; and a Smith Fiberglass plant in Little Rock,
   Arkansas, with floor space of approximately 45,000 square feet.  A 258,000
   square foot facility for the Electrical Products Company in Mt. Sterling,
   Kentucky, a 533,000 square foot facility for the Automotive Products
   Company in Milan, Tennessee, and a 237,000 square foot facility for the
   Smith Fiberglass plant in Little Rock, Arkansas are being acquired on a
   lease-purchase basis and have been capitalized for accounting purposes. 
   Included in the above totals are approximately 478,000 square feet of
   domestic floor space in DeKalb, Illinois, occupied by the Corporation's
   agricultural operations and which is being held for sale.

   Of the Corporation's facilities, thirteen are foreign plants with
   approximately 1,142,000 square feet of space, including approximately
   442,000 square feet which are leased.

   The manufacturing plants presently operated by the Corporation are listed
   below by industry segment.  This data excludes six plants operated by a
   Mexican affiliate.

   


   The principal equipment at the Corporation's facilities consist of
   presses, welding, machining, slitting and other metal fabricating
   equipment, winding machines, and furnace and painting equipment.  The
   Corporation regards its plant and equipment as well-maintained and
   adequate for its needs.  Multishift operations are used where necessary.


   ITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS


   As of December 31, 1993, the Corporation and Harvestore were defendants in
   26 cases alleging damages for economic losses claimed to have arisen out
   of alleged defects in Harvestore animal feed storage equipment.  Some
   plaintiffs are seeking punitive as well as compensatory damages.  The
   Corporation believes that a significant number of these claims were
   related to the deteriorated general farm economy at the time suit was
   commenced, including those filed in 1993.  The Corporation and Harvestore
   continue to vigorously defend these cases.

   In 1993, nine new cases were filed and 38 cases were concluded.  One of
   the cases filed during 1993 is a New York state court action and contains
   class action allegations, and names the Corporation, Harvestore and two of
   its dealers as defendants.  Among the many motions the defendants have
   filed in this action is one to stay the action pending the ruling on class
   action certification requested by the plaintiffs in a lawsuit pending in
   the Federal District Court for the Southern District of Ohio.  Based on
   the facts currently available to management and its prior experience with
   lawsuits alleging damages for economic loss resulting from use of the
   Harvestore animal feed storage equipment, management is confident that the
   motion for class certification in the Ohio lawsuit can be defeated and
   that the lawsuit does not represent a material threat to the Corporation. 
   The Corporation believes that any damages, including any punitive damages,
   arising out of the pending cases are adequately covered by insurance and
   recorded reserves.  The Corporation reevaluates its exposure periodically
   and makes adjustment of its reserves as appropriate.  A lawsuit for
   damages and declaratory judgments in the Circuit Court of Milwaukee
   County, State of Wisconsin, in which the Corporation and Harvestore are
   plaintiffs, is pending against three insurance companies for failure to
   pay in accordance with liability insurance policies issued to the
   Corporation.  The insurers have failed to pay, in full or in part, certain
   judgments, settlements and defense costs incurred in connection with
   pending and closed lawsuits alleging damages for economic losses claimed
   to have arisen out of alleged defects in Harvestore animal feed storage
   equipment.  While the Corporation has, in part, assumed applicability of
   this coverage, an adverse judgment should not be material to its financial
   condition.

   As part of its routine business operations, the Corporation disposes of
   and recycles or reclaims certain industrial waste materials, chemicals and
   solvents at disposal and recycling facilities which are licensed by
   appropriate federal, state and local agencies.  In some instances, when
   those facilities are operated such that hazardous substances contaminate
   the soil and groundwater, the United States Environmental Protection
   Agency ("EPA") will designate the contaminated sites as Superfund sites,
   and will designate those parties which are believed to have contributed
   hazardous materials to the sites as potentially responsible parties
   ("PRPs").  Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
   and Liability Act ("CERCLA" or the "Superfund" law) and similar state
   laws, each PRP that contributes hazardous substances to a Superfund site
   is jointly and severally liable for the costs associated with cleaning up
   the site.  Typically, PRPs negotiate with the EPA and those state
   environmental agencies that are involved in the matter regarding the
   selection and implementation of a plan to clean up the Superfund site and
   the terms and conditions under which the PRPs will be involved in process. 
   PRPs also negotiate with each other regarding allocation of each PRP's
   share of the clean up costs.

   The Corporation is currently involved as a PRP in judicial and
   administrative proceedings initiated on behalf of the EPA seeking to clean
   up the environment at fifteen Superfund sites and to recover costs it has
   or will incur as a result of the clean up.  Certain state environmental
   agencies have also asserted claims to recover their clean up costs in some
   of these actions.  The sites are as follows:

      Two separate sites in Kentucky involving related storage and disposal
      facilities.  Proceedings were commenced on behalf of the EPA in the
      United States District Court for the District of Kentucky, Louisville
      Division in March, 1988 with respect to these sites.  A consent decree
      allocating liability among the PRPs for costs of remediation at the
      sites and the response costs of the EPA and the Commonwealth of
      Kentucky was executed by the Corporation in September, 1993.  It is
      anticipated that the consent decree will be entered by the Court in
      1994.

      A site in Indiana used for storage, treatment, recycling and disposal
      of waste chemicals.  In January, 1984, the Company and several other
      PRPs became parties to an action that had been pending in the United
      States District Court for the District of Indiana since January, 1980
      regarding this site.  In July, 1988, the Corporation executed a consent
      decree allocating liability among the PRPs for costs of remediation at
      the site and the EPA's response costs.  Remediation is well underway at
      the site.

      A municipal landfill in Michigan is the subject of a proceeding that
      was filed on behalf of the EPA in the United States District Court for
      the Western District of Michigan in this case in April, 1991.  The
      final remedy has been selected and a consent decree has been executed
      by the PRPs and the EPA.  The consent decree was entered by the Court
      in 1991.  The bulk of the work on the remedy is expected to begin in
      1995.

      A county owned incinerator, ash disposal lagoon and landfill in Ohio. 
      A proceeding was commenced on behalf of the EPA in the United States
      District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Western Division
      regarding this site in December, 1989.  The final remedy has been
      selected and the consent decree, which was executed by the PRPs and the
      EPA, was entered by the Court in March, 1993.  Work on the remedy began
      shortly after the consent decree was entered and has been progressing.

      An industrial and municipal waste landfill in Wisconsin.  Separate
      proceedings were commenced on behalf of the EPA and the State of
      Wisconsin in the United States District Court for the Eastern District
      of Wisconsin in November, 1991 relative to this site.  The two actions
      which were consolidated into a single matter in 1992.  The consent
      decree entered into by the PRPs, the EPA and the State of Wisconsin
      divides the site into two operable units, the first of which deals with
      soil remediation and an interim groundwater remedy and the second of
      which is anticipated to deal with the long term groundwater remedy. 
      Work on the design of the remedy for the first operable unit is
      underway.  At this time, the extent to which remedial action will be
      required with respect to the second operable unit has not been
      determined.

      A drum disposal site in Wisconsin.  In September, 1992, the Corporation
      joined a group of PRPs that attempted to negotiate with other PRPs and
      the EPA to come to agreement as to the respective liabilities of the
      PRPs involved at the site, the implementation of a plan to clean up the
      site, and the terms and conditions under which the PRPs would be
      involved in the process.  In May, 1993, after those negotiations
      stalled, the EPA issued an order to 17 of the PRPs, one of which was
      the Corporation, under Section 106 of CERCLA requiring them to take
      certain measures to clean up the site.  Since then negotiations resumed
      and settlement was reached among the PRPs with respect to some, but not
      all of the issues related to liability under the Section 106 order. 
      The clean up has proceeded as directed by the EPA.

      A former mining site in Colorado.  The Corporation held the majority of
      stock of a Colorado mining operation for a period of time beginning in
      1936 and ending in 1942.  Because of that stock ownership, the
      Corporation was notified by the EPA in March, 1993 that it is a PRP at
      the site.  Estimates of clean up costs at this site have been as high
      as $100,000,000.  The Corporation believes that a large majority of
      those costs relate to contamination caused by a corporation that worked
      the mine in the 1980s, and the EPA has indicated that it does not
      believe the Corporation is responsible to remediate the damage caused
      by those operations.  The EPA is not bound by that initial
      determination and may seek to impose joint and several liability upon
      the PRPs at the site.  However, the Corporation believes that it has
      valid defenses to any liability at this site.  It is impossible at this
      time to reasonably estimate the Corporation's liability at this site,
      if any.

      A manufacturing facility in Indiana.  In January, 1994 the Corporation
      received a general notice of potential liability from the EPA
      concerning a plant site the Corporation operated in Indiana for a brief
      period of time in the mid-1980s.  Based upon a preliminary
      investigation into this matter, the Corporation believes that a viable
      business has a valid obligation to the Corporation to investigate and
      remediate contamination at this site at the cost and expense of the
      other business.

      A drum recycling facility.  In 1992, the EPA commenced an action
      against a small group of PRPs in the United States District Court for
      the Western District of Michigan to recover its response costs and
      require the PRPs to clean up a Superfund site in Michigan.  Those PRPs
      believe they have valid defenses to any liability at this site and have
      filed a motion for summary judgment in this matter.  Those PRPs had
      previously commenced a third party contribution action against
      approximately eighty other parties which were involved at the subject
      site but were not named as defendants in the EPA's action.  The
      Corporation became a third party defendant to that action in January,
      1994.

   CERCLA provides that the EPA has authority to enter into de minimis
   settlement agreements with those PRPs that are believed to have
   contributed relatively small ("de minimis") amounts of materials to a
   Superfund site as compared to major contributors at the site.  The
   Corporation has settled its liability at sites in Indiana and Arkansas as
   a de minimis party.  Under those settlement agreements, the Corporation
   may have additional liability to participate in cleaning up the affected
   site under certain circumstances, such as: changes in the scope of
   remedial action are required to the extent that costs to clean up the site
   are substantially increased, or new information is discovered that
   indicates that the Corporation contributed more or different materials to
   the site than was previously believed.  There is no information at this
   time which would indicate that the Corporation will incur any material
   additional liability at either site.  Further, the Corporation has joined
   with similarly situated PRPs to negotiate settlements as de minimis
   parties at three sites in Indiana and Illinois.

   Based upon information compiled by the Corporation, the estimate of known
   and estimated cleanup costs for all parties at all sites involving claims
   filed by the EPA where the Corporation has been designated a PRP is
   approximately $232 million.  The Corporation's estimate of the portion of
   the total for which the Corporation is or may be responsible is
   approximately $5.0 million, of which $3.6 million has been contributed
   towards the cleanup costs by the Corporation and its insurance companies. 
   The balance of the identified potential cleanup costs is covered by
   insurance and established reserves set by the Corporation which are
   believed to be adequate to cover the Corporation's obligations with
   respect to the unpaid balance of the claims.  To the best of the
   Corporation's knowledge, the insurers have the financial ability to pay
   any such covered claims.  The Corporation reevaluates its exposure
   periodically and makes adjustment of its reserves as appropriate.

   The above cost estimates are not complete.  It is impossible at this time
   to estimate the total cost of remediation for all of the sites, or the
   Corporation's ultimate share of those costs, for a variety of reasons. 
   Many of the reasons are related to the fact that the sites are in various
   stages of the remediation process.  For example, the investigation of the
   extent of remediation has not been completed at all sites; at several
   sites the final remedy has not been selected; negotiations concerning the
   Corporation's liability relative to the liability of the other PRPs
   continue at some sites; and for others, even though the remedy has been
   selected, final cost estimates have not been determined.  Other
   uncertainties are based upon the current status of the law.  Key issues
   that have not been resolved include the extent to which costs associated
   with the sites are recoverable from insurers, the extent to which joint
   and several liability can be imposed upon PRPs at the various sites, and
   the viability of defenses asserted by the PRPs.  It is impossible to
   determine at this time how the courts will resolve those issues.

   With the exception of the former mining site in Colorado discussed above,
   the amount allocated to the Corporation at any specific site, or in the
   aggregate for all sites, is not expected to be material.  Concerning the
   former mining site, a judgment as to materiality is premature given the
   early stage of the investigation, the uncertainty regarding appropriate
   remediation and its costs, and the potential liability of governmental
   agencies in this case.

   Over the past several years, the Corporation has self-insured a portion of
   its product liability loss exposure and other business risks.  The
   Corporation has established reserves which it believes are adequate to
   cover incurred claims.  For the year ended December 31, 1993, the
   Corporation had $60 million of third-party product liability insurance for
   individual losses in excess of $1.5 million and for aggregate losses in
   excess of $10 million.

   In March 1992, a subsidiary of the Corporation, Smith Fiberglass Products
   Inc. (Smith Fiberglass), won a patent infringement suit filed against a
   competitor.  A judgment was entered in favor of Smith Fiberglass.  The
   judgment was appealed by the defendant.  However, the Court of Appeals
   affirmed the award in 1993 and Smith Fiberglass recognized the judgment
   which amounted to $1.9 million after recognition of legal fees as other
   income in the second quarter of 1993.

   A lawsuit initiated by the Corporation in connection with previously
   concluded antitrust action involving a former subsidiary was terminated in
   the second quarter of 1993 with a favorable settlement of $2.8 million
   which was included as other income.

   Reference also Note 12 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
   Statements.

   ITEM 4 - SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

   No matters were submitted to a vote of the security holders during the
   fourth quarter of 1993.  The voting results from the Annual Meeting of
   Stockholders held on April 7, 1993 were previously reported in the
   Corporation's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30,
   1993.

      were unrestricted as of December 31, 1993.


   ITEM 6 - SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA
   (Dollars in Thousands, except per share amounts)
   

   As discussed in Notes 10 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
   the Corporation changed its method of accounting for postretirement
   benefits other than pensions and income taxes effective January 1, 1992.


   ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

   Financial Review

   A. O. Smith Corporation achieved record earnings of $42.7 million or $2.08
   per share in 1993 versus $28 million or $1.41 per share before a one-time
   charge for postretirement benefits in 1992.  Three units, Automotive
   Products, Water Products and the Smith Fiberglass Products subsidiary,
   established new sales records in 1993 while increasing their profits over
   the prior year.  Sales for the Electrical Products Company also increased
   over 1992, but profits of this company were adversely affected by costs
   associated with production transfer.  Additional details of individual
   unit performance will be discussed later in this section.

   The Corporation's record operating results and improving prospects have
   favorably impacted the performance of its common stock over the last three
   years.  Since the end of 1991 the market value of outstanding stock has
   quadrupled, increasing from $180 million to $740 million at December 31,
   1993.

   Working capital at December 31, 1993 was $80.7 million compared to $62.6
   million and $36.7 million at December 31, 1992 and 1991, respectively. 
   Higher sales in 1993 resulted in increased working capital requirements,
   particularly for accounts receivable and inventories, which were partially
   offset by related increases in trade payables and accrued wages and
   benefits.  In 1992, the Corporation's adoption of Statement of Financial
   Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" resulted in an
   increase in working capital versus 1991 due to the classification of $20.5
   million of deferred taxes as a current asset. 

   Capital expenditures were $54.7 million in 1993 compared to $46.9 million
   in 1992 and $59.3 million in 1991.  In addition, production equipment
   acquired under a master operating lease agreement totalled $10.9 million
   in 1993, $8.1 million in 1992 and $19.2 million in 1991.  Capital spending
   in 1993 was up from 1992 levels due to new Automotive Products Company
   programs including a full frame assembly for the new Chrysler light truck;
   structural components for the Ford Contour and Windstar and the Mercury
   Mystique; and a suspension assembly for Toyota, U.S.A.  Capital
   acquisitions in 1992 were down from 1991 levels primarily because the
   Automotive Products Company's regional assembly plants had been
   substantially completed.

   The Corporation projects that it will use approximately $73 million of

   internally generated funds and $13 million of operating lease financing to
   support 1994 planned capital acquisitions of $86 million.  The majority of
   this money will be spent by Automotive Products Company to support new
   product programs including full frames for a new General Motors truck and
   the Ford Explorer; structural components for a Nissan light truck; and
   engine cradles for the Ford Taurus, Mercury Sable and Lincoln Continental.

   Long-term debt, excluding debt of the finance subsidiary, decreased from
   $174.3 million in 1992 to $148.9 million at the end of 1993.  The long-
   term debt of the finance subsidiary has been reduced, as the planned
   liquidation of AgriStor Credit Corporation continued, from $62.3 million
   in 1992 to $41.7 million at December 31, 1993.  As a result of these
   reduced debt levels and 1993 earnings, the debt-to-equity ratio, excluding
   the finance subsidiary, decreased from 71.2% at December 31, 1992 to 55.2%
   at the end of 1993.  The Corporation anticipates that, given a continued
   economic rebound, debt and debt-to-equity levels will decline further
   during 1994.

   The Corporation drew a total of $30 million against facilities totalling
   $65 million with two insurance companies.  These notes have 10-year terms
   and carry an average interest rate of approximately 6.8 percent.

   During the third quarter the Corporation redeemed, at a modest premium,
   $10 million in Granite City Industrial Revenue Bonds.  The bonds, which
   had a coupon rate of 11.5%, were to mature on August 1, 2003.

   At a special meeting on January 26, 1993, shareholders approved charter
   amendments to change the name of the Corporation's Class B Common Stock to
   "Common Stock"; permit the holders of Class A Common Stock at any time, at
   their option, to convert to Common Stock on a share-for-share basis; and
   increase the number of authorized shares.  These changes have increased
   the Corporation's financial flexibility and enhanced the liquidity of the
   Common Stock.

   On February 1, 1993, the Board of Directors declared a special, one-time
   dividend of $.25 per share, (split-adjusted), which was paid only to
   Common Stockholders (formerly Class B) of record as of March 8, 1993. 
   Subsequent to the declaration of the special dividend on the Common Stock,
   split-adjusted shares totaling 4,019,366 of Class A Common Stock including
   1,133,584 shares held in Treasury were converted by the holders into
   Common Stock. 

   At its June 8, 1993 meeting, A. O. Smith Corporation's Board of Directors
   approved a 2-for-1 split of the Corporation's Class A and Common Stock
   effected in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend to shareholders on
   August 16, 1993.  In addition, the Board of Directors increased the
   regular quarterly dividend by 10 percent to a split-adjusted $.11 per
   share on its common stocks (Class A and Common) for the last two quarterly
   dividend payments of 1993, resulting in a total of $.42 per share being
   paid versus $.40 per share in 1992.  A. O. Smith Corporation has paid
   dividends on its common stock for 54 consecutive years.


   Results of Operations

   Revenues in 1993 were $1.19 billion establishing a record and surpassing
   1992 revenues of $1.05 billion by 14 percent and 1991 revenues of $915.8
   million by 30 percent.  All of the Corporation's product operations
   reported double digit percentage increases in sales in 1993 with the
   exception of the Electrical Products Company where sales increased 7.5
   percent over 1992.  For the second consecutive year the Automotive
   Products Company provided the majority of the Corporation's year-to-year
   sales increase as the recovery in the domestic automotive industry which
   commenced in 1992 gained momentum in 1993.

   The Corporation's gross profit margin was 14.9 percent in 1993,
   representing a significant improvement from 13.6 percent and 11.1 percent
   gross margins in 1992 and 1991, respectively.  The impact of increased
   volume was evident in the favorable trend in the gross margin.

   The Automotive Products Company achieved record sales of $606.3 million in
   1993, reflecting a 14.9 percent increase from 1992 sales of $527.6 million
   and a 42.3 percent increase from 1991 sales of $426.1 million.  The record
   sales were a result of several factors.  Light trucks continued to be the
   vehicle of choice within the marketplace, as evidenced by the second
   straight year in which this market has demonstrated 11 percent growth. 
   Automotive benefitted from the preference for this vehicle type over the
   past two years, since it is a supplier for such popular vehicles as the
   Ford Ranger, Econoline, and Explorer, General Motors GMT-400 and Suburban,
   and the recently introduced redesigned Dodge Ram pick-up.  The successful
   launch of Chrysler's three new mid-sized LH model passenger cars also had
   a major impact on Automotive's sales growth in 1993.  The excellent
   acceptance of these Chrysler vehicles resulted in additional production of
   engine cradles and rear suspension modules and resulted in a new line
   being placed in Automotive's plant in Belcamp, Maryland.  Sales of heavy-
   truck related products also bolstered Automotive's sales as the number of
   heavy trucks sold during the year was the highest in the last five years.

   Operating profits at Automotive increased over 1992 which in turn
   reflected a significant improvement over the loss incurred in 1991.  The
   favorable trend in earnings was a direct result of Automotive's position
   as a supplier of vehicles experiencing strong demand.

   The prognosis for 1994 is encouraging.  In addition to the core of
   successful products for which Automotive is the supplier, several new
   launches will occur during the year.  Shipment of engine cradles and rear
   trailing axles for the new Ford Windstar mini van will begin in the first
   quarter as will production of rear suspension assemblies for Toyota U.S.A. 
   During the second quarter Automotive will commence manufacturing of engine
   cradles for the new Ford Contour/Mercury Mystique.  Later in the year
   Automotive will begin producing cradles for the redesigned Lincoln
   Continental.  Additional programs are being developed for subsequent years
   and with a new automotive products office in Yokohama, Japan, a very good
   opportunity exists for early involvement in future new products to be
   manufactured by the Japanese.

   Equity in the earnings of the Corporation's 40-percent owned Mexican
   affiliate, Metalsa S.A., was $2.3 million in 1993 compared to $3.5 million
   and $1.5 million in 1992 and 1991, respectively.  In 1993, Metalsa's sales
   decreased approximately 10% due to a decline in automotive industry sales
   in Mexico.  Earnings were lower than the prior year due to the lower
   sales, product mix, and certain restructuring costs.  In 1992, Metalsa's
   sales increased about 8 percent over 1991 due to the improved Mexican
   economy and, in particular, strength in the automotive sector.  This
   increase, combined with higher gross margins, lower administrative and
   interest costs, and a low effective tax rate due to the benefit of tax
   loss carryforwards, resulted in a significant increase in profits compared
   to 1991.

   Sales at the Electrical Products Company increased 7.5 percent in 1993 to
   $242.5 million from $225.6 million in 1992.  Sales in 1991 were $205
   million.  The company has shown a steady growth in sales over the past two
   years despite weak market conditions and competitive pressures.  In 1993
   the market for pools, spas and room air conditioners was adversely
   impacted by poor spring weather while in 1992 the same market was affected
   by a cautious attitude on the part of consumers toward discretionary
   spending.

   Although sales increased in 1993, earnings declined from the 1992 level
   and were sightly better than in 1991.  The favorable impact of increased
   1993 volume and productivity improvements resulting from the initiation of
   a continuous improvement program throughout the organization were more
   than offset by the costs associated with transferring the hermetic motor
   production from the Mt. Sterling, Kentucky plant to the lower-cost Mebane,
   North Carolina location.  Costs associated with the transfer of
   production, which was substantially completed in 1993, amounted to several
   million dollars.  

   Sales for the Water Products Company established a record for the second
   straight year in 1993, increasing more than 15 percent to $248.1 million
   from the previous record of $215.2 million in 1992.  1991 sales were
   $194.6 million.  The domestic residential water heater market as a whole
   increased by nearly seven percent in 1993 with Water Products benefitting
   from this expanded market by capturing more than a pro rata share of the
   increase.  The company's most notable market penetration occurred in the
   western United States where additional product distribution was
   established.  The introduction of the power vent line of water heaters
   also had a favorable impact on residential volume.  The commercial segment
   of the business experienced mixed results.  While the sales of replacement
   commercial heaters was strong in 1993, a weakness in commercial
   construction caused a decline in sales of specialty commercial units. 
   Plans to increase the activity in the international export market,
   introduction of redesigned commercial products and an expected increase in
   housing starts in 1994 should continue the trend of improved sales.

   Earnings for the Water Products Company increased significantly in 1993
   when compared to 1992 and 1991 as a result of higher revenues and the
   ability to minimize incremental manufacturing costs associated with the
   additional volume.

   Sales for Smith Fiberglass Products, Inc. increased 34 percent in 1993 to
   $58.9 million from $43.9 million in 1992 and exceeded the previous record
   of $53.9 million in 1991.  Strong recoveries in the service station and
   petroleum production markets contributed significantly to the increase in
   sales over both 1992 and 1991.  1993 volumes were particularly strong in
   the service station market as customers increased their fiberglass pipe
   installation to meet environmental regulations including the requirements
   of the Federal Clean Air Act Amendments.  The shipment of a large overseas
   oil field order provided a major share of the increase in petroleum
   production volume in 1993.  The chemical and industrial segment of the
   business experienced a relatively flat year in 1993.  Continued
   penetration of the overseas markets coupled with domestic service station
   demand resulting from state programs to comply with federal vapor recovery
   regulations bode well for 1994 sales activity.

   Earnings for Fiberglass Products in 1993 more than doubled 1992 earnings
   and were improved over 1991.  The increased earnings were a direct result
   of the resurgence of demand in the service station and petroleum
   production market.

   Revenues for agricultural products were $38.1 million in 1993, an increase
   of $4.1 million and $2.0 million over 1992 and 1991, respectively.  Much
   of the increase in sales was attributable to the water storage segment of
   A. O. Smith Harvestore Products, Inc. (Harvestore) where new markets for
   this product line have developed as a result of recent Environmental
   Protection Agency regulations regarding the handling and disposal of waste
   water.  Harvestore's 1993 earnings were much improved over both 1992 and
   1991 as a result of higher volume.  Revenues for AgriStor Credit
   Corporation were $7.7 million, $6.4 million and $4.8 million in 1991,
   1992, and 1993, respectively.  This trend of decreasing revenues is
   consistent with management's objective of expeditiously liquidating this
   finance subsidiary.  As the liquidation proceeds, the losses of AgriStor
   continue to decline as a result of reduced operating expenses.  Despite
   operating earnings improvement for Harvestore and AgriStor the overall
   loss within the agricultural segment has been relatively consistent over
   the period of 1991 to 1993 reflecting the impact of maintaining adequate
   bad debt and liability reserves.

   Selling, general and administrative expense in 1993 was $96.3 million
   compared to $85.6 million in 1992 and $77.9 million in 1991.  The
   increases over this time period were caused in part by higher employee
   incentive and profit sharing accruals associated with the improved
   earnings.  Higher commissions and other expenses in support of the
   increased sales volumes also contributed to the upward trend.

   Interest expense in 1993 was $13.4 million and compares favorably to
   interest of $17.9 million in 1992 and $20.9 million in 1991.  The trend of
   declining interest expense is a function of the continuation of lower
   interest rates in conjunction with a steady reduction in debt levels
   throughout the three year period.

   During 1993, other income and expense for the Corporation reflected
   several non-recurring items which had a minimal aggregate impact on net
   earnings.  A total of $4.7 million of income was recognized as a result of
   favorable resolution of litigation which was offset by the impairment or
   write off of certain fixed assets and receivables.

   The Corporation's overall effective income tax rate increased from 1992 to
   1993 due to the one percent federal rate increase and increased state
   franchise taxes.

   For purposes of determining net periodic pension expenses, the discount
   rate was reduced to 8.5 percent.  A further reduction in the discount rate
   to 7.75 percent was made as of year-end to determine the benefit
   obligations.  At discount rates below 7.75 percent, management estimates
   each 25 basis points of incremental lower discount rate would reduce
   earnings by about two cents per share and would increase the pension
   liability adjustment charged to stockholders' equity by about $3.5
   million.

   The assumed rate of return on plan assets was reduced to 10.25 percent in
   1993.  While this return assumption has been exceeded meaningfully and
   consistently, including 1993 when the return was 14.8 percent, management
   deemed it prudent to reduce the rate to reflect current market conditions. 
   The changes made resulted in an increase of approximately $2.0 million in
   pension expense for 1993 compared to 1992.

   As to other postretirement benefits, a reduction in discount rate
   assumption to 7.75 percent was also made.  Due to recent coverage policy
   changes and current demographics, the discount rate change is anticipated
   to have only a minimal impact on future expense.

   A. O. Smith Corporation achieved record net earnings in 1993 of $42.7
   million or $2.08 per share.  In 1992 the Corporation earned $28 million or
   $1.41 per fully diluted share before recognition of a one-time charge for
   postretirement benefits as required by Financial Accounting Standard No.
   106 "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
   Pensions".  The Corporation recorded an after tax charge of $46.1 million,
   or $2.25 per share to record the cumulative effect of the accounting
   change.  1992's earnings were also impacted by a $1.6 million favorable
   cumulative effect as a result of the Corporation being able to recognize
   tax credits.  This tax adjustment was required due to the adoption of
   Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for
   Income Taxes" in the first quarter of 1992.  As a result of adopting FAS
   Nos. 106 and 109 in 1992, the Corporation reported a net loss applicable
   to common shareholders of $18.2 million or $.84 per fully diluted share. 
   1991 was essentially a break-even year.

   The Corporation achieved its expectation of establishing new sales and
   earnings records in 1993.  Considering domestic light vehicle sales are
   projected to increase in 1994, the process of transferring electric motor
   production is complete, and interest rates appear stable at historically
   attractive rates, it appears that similar expectations may be achieved in
   1994.

   REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS


   The Board of Directors and Stockholders
   A. O. Smith Corporation

   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of A. O. Smith
   Corporation as of December 31, 1993 and 1992 and the related consolidated
   statements of operations and retained earnings and cash flows for each of
   the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993.  Our audits also
   included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index in Item
   14(a).  These financial statements and schedules are the responsibility of
   the Corporation's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion
   on these financial statements and schedules based on our audits.

   We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
   standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
   obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
   free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test
   basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
   statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
   used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
   the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits
   provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
   in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of A. O.
   Smith Corporation at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the consolidated
   results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years
   in the period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally
   accepted accounting principles.  Also, in our opinion, the related
   financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic
   financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material
   respects the information set forth therein.

   As discussed in Notes 10 and 11 to the financial statements, the
   Corporation changed its method of accounting for postretirement benefits
   other than pensions and income taxes effective January 1, 1992.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

   1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

   Consolidation and Basis of Presentation.  The consolidated financial
   statements include the accounts of the Corporation and its wholly-owned
   subsidiaries including the Corporation's agricultural businesses which are
   being held for sale or liquidation.

   Foreign Currency Translation.  Financial statements for the Corporation's
   subsidiaries outside of the United States are translated into U.S. dollars
   at year-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and weighted average
   exchange rates for revenues and expenses.  The resulting translation
   adjustments are recorded as a component of stockholders' equity.

   Inventory Valuation.  Domestic inventories are carried at lower of cost or
   market determined on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.  Inventories of
   foreign subsidiaries and supplies are determined using the first-in,
   first-out (FIFO) method.

   Futures Contracts.  The Corporation enters into futures contracts to hedge
   certain raw material purchases, principally copper and aluminum, with the
   objective of minimizing cost risk due to market fluctuations.  Any gains
   or losses from hedging transactions are included as part of the inventory
   cost. 

   The Corporation also enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to
   hedge foreign currency transactions on a continuing basis for periods
   consistent with its committed exposures.  The Corporation does not engage
   in speculation.  The Corporation's foreign exchange contracts do not
   subject the Corporation to risk due to exchange rate movements because
   gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets,
   liabilities, and transactions being hedged.

   Gains and losses are recognized in the same period in which gains or
   losses from the transactions being hedged are recognized.  As of December
   31, 1993, the Corporation and its foreign subsidiaries had contracts to
   purchase or sell the U.S. dollar equivalent of $36.2 million in foreign
   currencies (Canadian dollars, Irish punts, British pounds, Dutch guilders
   and French francs) at varying maturities, most of which occur during 1994.

   Deferred Model Change.  Tool costs not reimbursed by customers and
   expenses associated with significant model changes are amortized over the
   estimated model life which ranges from four to ten years, with the shorter
   periods associated with automobile structural components and the longer
   periods associated with structural components for trucks.  

   Property, Plant and Equipment.  Property, plant and equipment are stated
   at cost.  Depreciation is computed primarily by the straight-line method.

   Finance Subsidiary.  Finance charges for retail contracts receivable are
   recognized as income as installments become due using the interest method. 
   For direct finance leases, income is recognized based upon a constant rate
   of return on the unrecovered lease investment over the term of the related
   lease.

   Income Taxes.  The Corporation accounts for income taxes using the
   liability method prescribed by FAS No. 109 in 1993 and 1992 and FAS No. 96
   in 1991.

   Research and Development.  Research and development costs are charged to
   expense as incurred and amounted to approximately $7.6, $6.5 and $6.1
   million during 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

   Common Stock Dividend.  On January 26, 1993, the stockholders authorized
   certain increases in the authorized capital stock as follows:  increase of
   1,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock for a total of 7,000,000 shares
   and 12,000,000 shares of Common Stock (formerly Class B Common Stock) for
   a total of 24,000,000 shares.  In addition, the stockholders authorized
   the conversion of the Class A Common Stock into Common Stock on a share-
   for-share basis, at any time, at the option of the holder.  

   On June 8, 1993, the Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock split
   in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend to stockholders of record on
   July 30, 1993 and payable on August 16, 1993.  All references in the
   financial statements to average number of shares outstanding, price per
   share, per share amounts and stock option plan data have been restated to
   reflect the split.

   Earnings (Loss) Per Share of Common Stock.  Primary per share amounts are
   determined by dividing earnings (loss) applicable to common shareholders
   by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and materially
   dilutive common stock equivalents (stock options) outstanding.

   Fully diluted per share amounts include the dilutive effect, if any, of
   the assumed conversion in 1991 and 1992 of the outstanding preferred stock
   into common stock with appropriate adjustments being made to earnings
   (loss) applicable to common stock for dividends on the preferred stock. 
   For 1992, fully diluted net loss per share amounts are anti-dilutive
   because of the preferred stock conversion.

   If the redemption of the Series I Preferred Stock discussed in Note 8 had
   taken place at the beginning of 1992, primary loss per share for 1992
   would not have been significantly impacted.  

   Reclassifications.  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to
   conform to the 1993 presentation.

   2.  Statement of Cash Flows  

   For purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash
   equivalents include investments with original maturities of three months
   or less.  Supplemental cash flow information is as follows:

   Years ended December 31 (Dollars in Thousands)

   


   The finance subsidiary provided cash before financing activities of $21.4,

   $13.7 and $11.7 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

   3.  Agricultural Businesses

   The Corporation's strategic plan is to concentrate the Corporation's
   resources in nonagricultural businesses and withdraw from the agricultural
   market.  The strategy includes plans to sell A. O. Smith Harvestore
   Products, Inc. (Harvestore), a wholly-owned manufacturing subsidiary, and
   to phase out AgriStor Credit Corporation (AgriStor), a wholly-owned
   finance subsidiary.

   Due to the uncertainties which continue to impact the farm sector, it is
   not possible to predict when the sale of Harvestore will occur.  The
   Corporation is continuing to phase out AgriStor's operations in an orderly
   manner.  The agricultural businesses are classified as continuing
   operations in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 93.

   The Corporation's consolidated balance sheet includes AgriStor.  A
   condensed consolidated balance sheet of AgriStor is presented below:

   The receivables and net investment in leases are net of bad debt reserves
   totalling $14.6 and $20.6 million at December 31, 1993 and 1992,
   respectively.  AgriStor is the lessor in the direct finance leasing of
   Harvestore equipment.  The equipment has an estimated economic life of 15
   years and is leased under agreements with original terms of 5 to 12 years.

   There is no quoted market price available for the retail contracts and
   leases.  Management believes fair value approximates book value.  While
   some maturities extend beyond the year 2000, the portfolio is
   predominantly of two to three year duration carrying an average interest
   rate of 8.2%.  As a liquidating business, it is possible certain
   instruments could be sold before maturity and gains or losses recognized
   at time of sale.  Given the maturities involved, it is not expected that
   such gains or losses would be material to the financial condition of the
   Corporation.

   Finance subsidiary long-term debt was comprised of the following:

   AgriStor has $36.5 million in committed bank credit facilities at December
   31, 1993.  The total consists of a $35 million multi-year revolving credit
   facility from a group of eleven banks which expires January 2, 1997 and
   $1.5 million from a revolver bank under a separate revolving credit
   facility to provide additional liquidity for up to one year.  In addition,
   AgriStor Credit Corporation-Canada (AgriStor Canada) has a $7.6 million
   credit facility to meet its borrowing needs.  Included in AgriStor's other
   notes are a $5.0 million term loan with a final maturity in 1995 and a
   $5.2 million note with a final maturity in 1998 for AgriStor-Canada which
   require a combined annual principal payment of $3.5 million in 1994.  It
   has been AgriStor's practice to renew or replace its credit agreements to
   maintain 100% coverage of its borrowing needs in the commercial paper
   market as well as its direct borrowing under the credit facilities.

   AgriStor has entered into interest rate swap agreements to minimize the
   impact of changes in interest rates on its line of credit and commercial
   paper borrowings.  At December 31, 1993, AgriStor had outstanding three
   interest rate swap agreements and four interest rate cap agreements with
   commercial banks, having a total notional principal of $40 million.  The
   fixed rates under the swap agreements range from 7.46% to 7.84% and expire
   August 6, 1994.  The interest rate cap agreements expire February 21,
   1995.

   Long-term, debt maturing within each of the five years subsequent to
   December 31, 1993, is as follows:  1994--$5.6, 1995--$3.5, 1996--$1.0,
   1997--$1.0, 1998--$1.0 million.

   A condensed consolidated statement of operations of AgriStor is presented
   below.  The following does not include certain bad debt reserves provided
   by the Corporation totalling $1.8, $1.4 and $1.0 million in 1993, 1992 and
   1991, respectively:

   During 1992 and 1991, inventory reductions in certain operations resulted
   in liquidations of certain LIFO inventory quantities acquired at lower
   costs in prior years as compared with 1992 and 1991 costs, the effect of
   which reduced the 1992 net loss by $2.8 million and increased the 1991 net
   earnings by $.6 million.

   The inventory amounts exclude $19.9 and $24.5 million, respectively, of
   equipment held for resale by AgriStor.


   5.  Investments in and Advances to Affiliated Companies

   Investments in affiliates in which ownership is 50 percent or less are
   accounted for under the equity method.  During 1993, 1992 and 1991, the
   Corporation received dividends of $2.8, $1.3 and $.8 million,
   respectively, from such affiliates.  The Corporation's equity in the
   undistributed earnings of such affiliates at December 31, 1993, amounted
   to approximately $22.5 million.  In 1993, the Corporation advanced $1.2
   million to its Mexican affiliate with repayment due in 1996 and interest
   at 5% due quarterly.

   The Corporation has a $115 million multi-year revolving credit facility
   from a group of eleven banks which expires April 3, 1996.  At its option,
   the Corporation maintains either cash balances or pays fees for bank
   credit and services.

   In 1993, the Corporation entered into two loan facilities with insurance
   companies totalling $65 million.  Through December 31, 1993, the
   Corporation had drawn down, under ten year terms, $30 million under these
   facilities.  The Corporation used a portion of these proceeds to redeem a
   $1.2 million bank note with an interest rate of 9.5% due December 1, 2001
   and, at a modest premium, a $10 million Industrial Revenue Bond with an
   interest rate of 11.5% due August 1, 2003 saving several million dollars
   in interest costs over the remaining term of the retired instruments.

   The Corporation's credit agreement and term loans contain certain
   conditions and provisions which restrict the Corporation's payment of
   dividends.  Under the most restrictive of these provisions, retained
   earnings of $72.1 million were unrestricted as of December 31, 1993.

   Borrowings under the bank credit lines and in the commercial paper market
   are supported by the revolving credit agreements and have been classified
   as long-term.  It has been the Corporation's practice to renew or replace
   the credit agreements so as to maintain the availability of debt on a
   long-term basis and to provide 100% backup for its borrowings in the
   commercial paper market.

   Long-term debt, exclusive of AgriStor, maturing within each of the five
   years subsequent to December 31, 1993, is as follows:  1994--$8.8;
   1995--$8.9; 1996--$6.6; 1997--$7.9; 1998--$5.0 million.

   The Corporation sold, without recourse and at market rates, certain
   automotive related receivables totalling $16.0 million at December 31,
   1993, compared to $14.0 million at December 31, 1992.  The receivables
   sale program is scheduled to expire on April 30, 1994, unless mutually
   extended.

   Future minimum payments under noncancelable operating leases total $105.4
   million and are due as follows:  1994--$20.7; 1995--$18.1; 1996--$14.6;
   1997--$13.1; 1998--$12.7; thereafter--$26.2 million.  Rent expense,
   including payments under operating leases, was $28.2, $27.5 and $23.9
   million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

   Interest paid by the Corporation, excluding AgriStor, was $10.2, $12.4 and
   $12.5 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.


   8.  Stockholders' Equity

   As of December 31, 1993, there were 7,000,000 shares of Class A Common
   Stock $5 par value, 24,000,000 shares of Common Stock $1 par value and
   3,000,000 shares of preferred stock $1 par value authorized.  The Common
   Stock has equal dividend rights with Class A Common Stock and is entitled
   as a class to elect 25 percent of the board of directors and has 1/10th
   vote per share on all other matters.

   On February 1, 1993 the Board of Directors declared a special $.25 per
   share dividend payable on March 22 to Common Stockholders of record March
   8. No special dividend was declared on the Class A Common Stock.  During
   1993, 2,009,683 shares of Class A Common Stock including 623,362 shares
   held in Treasury were converted by the holders into Common Stock.  Regular
   dividends paid on the Class A Common and Common Stock amounted to $.42,
   $.40 and $.40 per share in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

   The Corporation issued 1,725,000 shares of Series I Preferred Stock in
   1985.  The preferred stock was convertible at the option of the holder at
   any time into approximately 1.1905 shares of Common Stock.  The
   Corporation called for redemption of all of its $2.125 Convertible
   Exchangeable Preferred Stock on April 23, 1992.  The Corporation issued
   1,901,458 shares of Common Stock as a result of the conversion of
   1,597,313 shares of its preferred stock prior to the redemption date with
   cash of $377,659 paid in lieu of 14,387 shares of preferred stock which
   otherwise would have been converted into fractional shares of Common
   Stock.  On January 26, 1993, the stockholders authorized a restatement of
   the Certificate of Incorporation deleting the designation relating to
   Series I Preferred Stock.

   Changes in certain components of stockholders' equity are as follows:

   

   In 1993, 5,930 shares of treasury stock were acquired under a purchase
   offer made to holders of less than 100 shares of Class A Common Stock and
   Common Stock.

   At December 31, 1993, 3,460 and 1,009,324 shares of Class A Common Stock
   and Common Stock, respectively, were held as treasury stock.

   9.  Stock Options

   During 1990, the Corporation adopted a Long-Term Executive Incentive
   Compensation Plan (1990 Plan).  The 1990 Plan initially reserved 1,000,000
   shares of common stock for granting of nonqualified and incentive stock
   options.  The Corporation will submit a proposal to stockholders in 1994
   for approval to reserve an additional 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock. 
   Each option entitles the holder upon exercise to obtain one share of
   Common Stock.  In addition, the Corporation has a Long-Term Executive
   Incentive Compensation Plan (1980 Plan) which has terminated except as to
   outstanding options.  Options under both plans become exercisable one year
   from date of grant and, for active employees, expire ten years after date
   of grant.  The number of shares available for granting of options at
   December 31, 1993 and 1992 was 25,400.  Options as to 188,400 shares
   granted in 1993 are subject to approval by the stockholders.

   Changes in option shares (all Common Stock) were as follows:

   10.  Retirement Plans

   The Corporation and its domestic subsidiaries have noncontributory defined
   benefit pension plans covering all employees.  Plans covering salaried
   employees provide benefits that are based on an employee's years of
   service and compensation.  Plans covering hourly employees provide
   benefits of stated amounts for each year of service.  The Corporation's
   funding policy is to contribute amounts which are actuarially determined
   to provide the plans with sufficient assets to meet future benefit payment
   requirements consistent with the funding requirements of federal laws and
   regulations.  Plan assets consist primarily of marketable equities and
   debt securities.  The Corporation also has several foreign pension plans,
   none of which are material.


   The following tables present the components of pension expense, the funded
   status and the major assumptions used to determine these amounts for
   domestic pension plans:

   Major assumptions at year-end:

   Expected long-term rate 
    of return on assets                10.25%   10.50% 10.50%

   Net periodic pension cost is determined using the assumptions as of the
   beginning of the year.  The funded status is determined using the
   assumptions as of the end of the year.

   The Corporation has a defined contribution profit sharing and retirement
   plan covering salaried nonunion employees which provides for annual
   corporate contributions of 35 percent to 140 percent of qualifying
   contributions made by participating employees.  The amount of the
   Corporation's contribution in excess of 35 percent is dependent upon the
   Corporation's profitability.  The amount of the contribution was $4.0,
   $2.3 and $1.2 million for 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

   The Corporation has several unfunded defined benefit postretirement plans
   covering certain hourly and salaried employees which provide medical and
   life insurance benefits from retirement to age 65.  Salaried employees
   retiring after January 1, 1995 will be covered by an unfunded defined
   contribution plan with benefits based on years of service.  Certain hourly
   employees retiring after January 1, 1996 will be subject to a maximum
   annual benefit limit.  Salaried employees hired in the future are not
   eligible for postretirement medical benefits.

   Effective January 1, 1992, the Corporation adopted FAS No. 106,
   "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions." 
   The Corporation recorded a charge of $46.1 million ($75.0 million before
   tax) or $2.25 per share to record the cumulative effect of the accounting
   change which represents the transition obligation as of January 1, 1992.

   Net periodic postretirement benefit cost included the following
   components:

   The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated
   postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) was 10% in 1992, declining by 1%
   per year to 6% in 1996.  The weighted average discount rate used in
   determining the APBO was 7.75% and 8.75% at December 31, 1993 and 1992,
   respectively.  If the health care cost trend rate was increased by 1%, the
   APBO at December 31, 1993 would increase by $4.1 million and net periodic
   postretirement benefit cost for 1993 would increase by $.5 million.

   Prior to 1992, the cost of continuing life and health insurance for
   eligible retirees was accounted for on a pay-as-you-go basis and totalled
   $8.5 million in 1991.


   11.   Income Taxes

   Effective January 1, 1992, the Corporation adopted FAS No. 109,
   "Accounting for Income Taxes."  The adoption of FAS No. 109 had a $1.6
   million favorable effect as of January 1, 1992 as a result of the
   realization of tax credits. 

   The components of the provision for income taxes consisted of the
   following:

   On August 10, 1993, the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993 was signed into
   law.  The Act increased the corporate federal income tax rate from 34
   percent to 35 percent.  In the third quarter, the Corporation adjusted its
   deferred income tax accounts by $.8 million and increased its provision
   for current income taxes for the first half of 1993 by $.4 million.

   The domestic and foreign components of income (loss) from operations
   before income taxes were as follows:

   Years ended December 31 (Dollars in Thousands)
                                    1993       1992        1991

   Domestic                      $60,407    $34,776     $  (926)
   Foreign                         8,111      4,031       3,390
                                  ------     ------     -------
                                 $68,518    $38,807     $ 2,464
                                  ======     ======      ======

   Taxes paid amounted to $12.2, $5.4 and $4.6 million in 1993, 1992 and
   1991, respectively.

   The Corporation has the following carryforwards for federal income tax
   purposes:

    - Tax credits of $14.4 million which expire from 1996 through 2007.
    - Alternative Minimum Tax credits of $6.1 million which do not expire.

   No provision for U.S. income taxes has been made on the undistributed
   earnings of foreign subsidiaries as such earnings are considered to be
   permanently invested.  At December 31, 1993, the undistributed earnings
   amounted to $16.7 million.  It is not practical to determine the income
   tax liability that would result had such earnings been repatriated.  The
   amount of withholding taxes that would be payable upon such repatriation
   is estimated to be $.7 million.

   No provision for U.S. income taxes has been made on undistributed earnings
   of equity investees attributable to cumulative net translation gains and
   other items.  Since the investees do not have the capability to remit such
   gains in the foreseeable future, such gains are considered permanently
   invested.  At December 31, 1993, the amount of unrecognized U.S. tax
   liability for the net translation gains and other items of $17.7 million
   amounted to $6.2 million.


   The approximate tax effects of temporary differences between income tax
   and financial reporting at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively, are
   as follows:

   


   These deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified in the balance
   sheet as current or long-term based on the balance sheet classification of
   the related assets and liabilities.  The balances are as follows:

   Long-term deferred income tax liabilities    (41,281)  (28,148)

   12.    Litigation and Insurance Matters

   As of December 31, 1993, the Corporation and Harvestore were defendants in
   26 cases alleging damages for economic losses claimed to have arisen out
   of alleged defects in Harvestore animal feed storage equipment.  Some
   plaintiffs are seeking punitive as well as compensatory damages.  The
   Corporation believes that a significant number of these claims were
   related to the deteriorated general farm economy at the time suit was
   commenced, including those filed in 1993.  The Corporation and Harvestore
   continue to vigorously defend these cases.

   In 1993, nine new cases were filed and 38 cases were concluded.  One of
   the cases filed during 1993 is a New York state court action and contains
   class action allegations, and names the Corporation, Harvestore and two of
   its dealers as defendants.  Among the many motions the defendants have
   filed in this action is one to stay the action pending the ruling on class
   action certification requested by the plaintiffs in a lawsuit pending in
   the Federal District Court for the Southern District of Ohio.  Based on
   the facts currently available to management and its prior experience with
   lawsuits alleging damages for economic loss resulting from use of the
   Harvestore animal feed storage equipment, management is confident that the
   motion for class certification in the Ohio lawsuit can be defeated and
   that the lawsuit does not represent a material threat to the Corporation. 
   The Corporation believes that any damages, including any punitive damages,
   arising out of the pending cases are adequately covered by insurance and
   recorded reserves.  The Corporation reevaluates its exposure periodically
   and makes adjustment of its reserves as appropriate.  A lawsuit for
   damages and declaratory judgments in the Circuit Court of Milwaukee
   County, State of Wisconsin, in which the Corporation and Harvestore are
   plaintiffs, is pending against three insurance companies for failure to
   pay in accordance with liability insurance policies issued to the
   Corporation.  The insurers have failed to pay, in full or in part, certain
   judgments, settlements and defense costs incurred in connection with
   pending and closed lawsuits alleging damages for economic losses claimed
   to have arisen out of alleged defects in Harvestore animal feed storage
   equipment.  While the Corporation has, in part, assumed applicability of
   this coverage, an adverse judgment should not be material to its financial
   condition.

   The Corporation is involved in other litigation and claims which arise in
   the ordinary course of its business including governmental proceedings
   regarding the disposal of hazardous waste at sites which are in various
   stages of the remediation process.  For some of the sites, total costs for
   remediation are not available because the final remedy has not been
   selected or for other reasons.  Further, the ultimate liability of the
   Corporation, if any, has not been determined at all of the sites.  As a
   result, it is impossible at this time to estimate the total cost of
   remediation for all of the sites.  The total estimated cleanup costs
   identified at this time for all parties at all sites involving claims
   filed by the Environmental Protection Agency or similar state agencies
   where the Corporation has been designated a potentially responsible party
   is approximately $232 million.  The estimated portion of the total for
   which the Corporation is or may be responsible is approximately $5.0
   million, of which $3.6 million has been contributed towards the cleanup
   costs by the Corporation and its insurance companies.  The balance of the
   identified potential cleanup costs is covered by insurance and established
   reserves set by the Corporation which are believed to be adequate to cover
   the Corporation's obligations with respect to the unpaid balance of the
   claims.  To the best of the Corporation's knowledge, the insurers have the
   financial ability to pay any such covered claims.  The Corporation
   reevaluates its exposure periodically and makes adjustment of its reserves
   as appropriate. 

   In March 1992, a subsidiary of the Corporation, Smith Fiberglass Products
   Inc. (Smith Fiberglass), won a patent infringement suit filed against a
   competitor.  A judgment was entered in favor of Smith Fiberglass.  The
   judgment was appealed by the defendant.  However, the Court of Appeals
   affirmed the award and Smith Fiberglass recognized the judgment which
   amounted to $1.9 million after recognition of legal fees as other income
   in the second quarter of 1993.

   A legal action against a supplier of certain automotive equipment alleging
   breach of warranty was settled in December 1992.  The Corporation recorded
   the settlement, net of expenses, of $1.1 million as other income in 1992.

   A lawsuit initiated by the Corporation in connection with previously
   concluded antitrust action involving a former subsidiary was terminated in
   the second quarter of 1993 with a favorable settlement of $2.8 million
   which is included as other income.

   Over the past several years, the Corporation has self-insured a portion of
   its product liability loss exposure and other business risks.  The
   Corporation has established reserves which it believes are adequate to
   cover incurred claims.  For the year ended December 31, 1993, the
   Corporation had $60 million of third-party product liability insurance for
   individual losses in excess of $1.5 million and for aggregate losses in
   excess of $10 million.


   13.  Operations by Segment

   


   Further discussion of the segment results, including Automotive Products
   and Electrical Products which comprise the OEM segment, can be found under
   "Management's Discussion and Analysis--Results of Operations."


   


   14.  Quarterly Results of Operations (Unaudited)

   

   Net earnings (loss) per share is computed separately for each period and,
   therefore, the sum of such quarterly per share amounts may differ from the
   total for the year.

   See note 7 for restrictions on the payment of dividends.

   The cumulative effect of the accounting changes in the first quarter of
   1992 includes a credit of $1.6 million ($.10 and $.08 per primary and
   fully diluted shares, respectively) for a change in accounting for income
   taxes and a charge of $46.1 million [($2.89) and ($2.26) per primary and
   fully diluted shares, respectively] for a change in accounting for
   postretirement benefits. 

   The fourth quarter of 1993 includes, on an after-tax basis, approximately
   $2.3 million of charges for additions to product liability and bad debt
   reserves and writedown of certain assets partially offset by inventory
   adjustments.

   The fourth quarter of 1992 includes, on an after-tax basis, approximately
   $3.0 million of charges for additions to product liability and bad debt
   reserves partially offset by net proceeds of a lawsuit settlement.

        For the purposes of complying with the amendments to the rules
   governing Form S-8 (effective July 13, 1990) under the Securities Act of
   1933, the undersigned registrant hereby undertakes as follows, which
   undertaking shall be incorporated by reference into registrant's
   Registration Statements on Form S-8 Nos. 2-72542 filed on May 26, 1981,
   Post-Effective Amendment No. 1, filed on May 12, 1983, Post-Effective
   Amendment No. 2, filed on December 22, 1983, Post-Effective Amendment No.
   3, filed on March 30, 1987; 33-19015 filed on December 11, 1987; 33-21356
   filed on April 21, 1988; and Form S-8 No. 33-37878 filed November 16,
   1990:

             Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under
        the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors,
        officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to
        the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been
        advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange
        Commission such indemnification is against public policy as
        expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore,
        unenforceable.  In the event that a claim for indemnification
        against such liabilities (other than the payment by the
        registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer
        or controlling person of the registrant in the successful
        defense of any action, suit or proceedings) is asserted by such
        director, officer or controlling person in connection with the
        securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the
        opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by
        controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate
        jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is
        against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be
        governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
