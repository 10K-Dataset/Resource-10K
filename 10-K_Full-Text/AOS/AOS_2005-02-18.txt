PART 1

ITEM 1 - BUSINESS

We are a leading manufacturer of electric motors and water heating equipment, serving a diverse mix of residential, commercial and industrial end markets principally in
the United States with a growing international presence. Our company is organized in two operating segments: electrical products and water systems. Our electrical products business manufactures and markets a comprehensive line of hermetic motors,
fractional horsepower alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) motors, and integral horsepower motors. Our water systems business manufactures and markets a comprehensive line of residential gas and electric water heaters, standard and
specialty commercial water heating equipment, high-efficiency copper-tube boilers, and water systems tanks. In 2004, we had net sales of approximately $1.7 billion, with 52 percent attributable to our electrical products business and 48 percent
attributable to our water systems business.

The following table summarizes our
sales by operating segment. This segment summary and all other information presented in this section should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appear elsewhere in
this document.

ELECTRICAL PRODUCTS

Our Electrical Products segment sales increased $36 million or four
percent in 2004 to $861 million. Sales to the heating and air conditioning market declined four percent as a result of the loss of an important contract by one of our major OEM customers. Sales to all of our other market segments were more than ten
percent higher than in 2003 reflecting higher unit volumes and price increases related to higher costs for steel and freight.

We are one of the three largest manufacturers of electric motors in North America, having manufactured approximately 40 million electric motors in 2004. We offer a
comprehensive line of hermetic motors, fractional horsepower AC and DC motors, and integral horsepower motors, ranging in size from sub-fractional C-frame ventilation motors up to 500 horsepower hermetic and 400 horsepower integral motors. We
believe our extensive product offering gives us an advantage in our targeted markets, often allowing us to serve all of our customer’s electric motor needs.

Our motors are used in a wide range of targeted residential, commercial and industrial applications, including: hermetic motors that are
sold worldwide to manufacturers of air conditioning and commercial refrigeration compressors; fractional horsepower fan motors used in furnaces, air conditioners and blowers; fractional horsepower motors for pumps for home water systems, swimming
pools, hot tubs and spas; fractional horsepower motors used in other consumer products (such as garage door openers); and integral horsepower A/C and D/C motors for industrial and commercial applications. Sales to the heating, ventilating, air
conditioning and refrigeration market account for approximately 56 percent of segment sales. Approximately 85 percent of our 2004 segment sales were to OEMs in a diverse mix of industries, with the remainder of sales directed to the aftermarket or
distribution channels. We believe that more than 25 percent of our total segment sales were attributable to products used outside of the United States. We estimate that approximately 60 percent of sales are derived from the less cyclical replacement
business with the remainder being impacted by general business conditions in the retail and new construction markets.

To remain a leader in this highly competitive industry, we are committed to being a low-cost supplier of electric motors. We were one of the first motor manufacturers to
identify the cost-reduction potential of Mexican operations, and today we manufacture a majority of our electric motors in our 16 Mexican motor facilities. In 2001, we undertook an initiative to accelerate the cost-reduction programs that were
already underway in our motor operations to enhance our competitive position. These initiatives included the closure of four domestic plants, three of which were closed in 2003, the transfer of production to our lower cost operations in Mexico and
China, and the consolidation of warehouse facilities into three hub operations to improve customer service while reducing cost and a ten percent reduction in the salaried workforce. Though the primary repositioning program has now been largely
completed, we intend to continue to optimize our operations in Mexico and China by transferring production from higher to lower cost operations.



In December 2001, we acquired Shenzhen Speeda Industries Co., Ltd. (Shenzhen), a manufacturer of sub-fractional
horsepower electric motors in China. In December 2002, we acquired the Jiangsu Changheng Group Co. Ltd (Changheng), of Changzhou, China. While Changheng has an existing customer base in China, the primary purpose of both the Shenzhen and Changheng
acquisitions is to further expand our ability to manufacture products for the U. S. market. In November 2003, we acquired Taicang Special Motor Co., Ltd. (Taicang), of Suzhou, China, a manufacturer of hermetic motors for commercial air conditioning
equipment. Taicang currently serves the Chinese operations of a number of North American air conditioning companies and enhances our position in the global hermetic motor market.

Our principal competitors in the electric motor industry are Emerson Electric Co. and Regal Beloit Corporation. A number of other companies,
such as Fasco Motors (a subsidiary of Tecumseh Products), Baldor Electric and Jakel Incorporated, compete with us in specific segments of the electric motor market.

WATER SYSTEMS

Our Water Systems business had sales in 2004 of $792 million, which were 12 percent or $86 million higher than in 2003. The higher sales were the result of the
introduction of higher efficiency residential water heaters, higher prices related to increased steel and freight costs, strong commercial volume, a 37 percent increase in China sales, and additional flammable vapor ignition resistant product.

In December 2001, we acquired the privately held water heater manufacturer
State Industries, Inc. (State) for aggregate cash consideration of $117.6 million. This was comprised of a $61.3 million purchase price and the assumption of $56.3 million of debt. The acquisition of State nearly doubled the sales of our water
heating business.

We serve residential, commercial and industrial end markets
with a broad range of products, including:

Residential gas and electric
water heaters

. Our residential water heaters come in sizes ranging from two-gallon (point-of-use) models to 120-gallon appliances with varying efficiency ranges. We offer traditional atmospheric water heaters as well as direct-vented and
power-vented models for today’s energy efficient homes. Domestic residential water heater sales in 2004 were approximately $530 million or two-thirds of segment revenues.

Standard commercial water heaters

. Our gas, oil and electric water heaters come in capacities ranging from 50 to 100 gallons and are
used by customers who require a consistent, economical source of hot water. Typical applications include restaurants, hotels and motels, laundries, car washes and small businesses.

Approximately 80 percent of the residential and commercial markets consist of the replacement of existing product, although new construction
is also an important factor for the business. Our Water Systems business also manufactures and markets specialty commercial water heaters, copper-tube boilers, expansion tanks and related products and parts.

We are one of the two largest manufacturers and marketers of water heaters in North America,
manufacturing approximately 2.8 million units in 2004. We have a leading share in the commercial water heating segment, and we believe we are the only domestic manufacturer that offers standard and specialty commercial water heater products. We
believe that our comprehensive commercial product line gives us a competitive advantage in this higher-margin segment of the water heating industry. We also are one of the leaders in the residential water heating segment with an extensive line of
high-efficiency gas and electric models.

Government regulations are having a
significant impact on the United States water heating industry. Beginning in July 2003, United States water heater manufacturers were required to comply with new flammable vapor ignition resistant standards for residential gas water heaters. These
new regulations, developed by the manufacturers in cooperation with the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission, dictate that gas water heaters must be designed to protect against accidental ignition of flammable vapors caused by spilled
gasoline or other liquids. In addition, a United States government requirement to increase the efficiency of residential gas and electric water heaters went into effect on January 20, 2004.

Our water systems wholesale distribution channel includes more than 750 wholesale plumbing
distributors with more than 4,500 selling locations serving residential, commercial and industrial markets. We also sell our residential water heaters through the retail channel. In this channel, our customers include four of the six largest
national hardware and home center chains, including a long-standing private label relationship with Sears, Roebuck and Co.



Our principal domestic water heating competitors include Rheem Manufacturing Company, Inc. and, to a lesser extent,
American Water Heater Company, Bradford-White Corporation and Lochinvar Corporation. We also compete against numerous competitors in international markets.

RAW MATERIAL

Raw materials for our manufacturing operations, which consist primarily of steel, copper and aluminum, are generally available from several sources in adequate quantities. We hedge the majority of our annual copper
and aluminum purchases to protect against price volatility. While steel prices have increased significantly over the past year, we had adequate supply and believe we have agreements in place to assure adequate supply in the future.

SEASONALITY

There is no significant seasonal pattern to our consolidated quarterly sales and earnings.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, PATENTS and TRADEMARKS

In order to improve competitiveness by generating new products and processes, we conduct
research and development at our Corporate Technology Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as well as at our operating units. Total expenditures for research and development in 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $35.9, $34.6, and $30.4 million, respectively.

We own and use in our businesses various trademarks, trade names, patents,
trade secrets and licenses. While a number of these are important to us, we do not consider a material part of our business to be dependent on any one of them.

EMPLOYEES

Our company and its subsidiaries employed approximately 16,600 employees as of December 31, 2004.

BACKLOG

Normally, none of our operations sustain significant backlogs.

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS

Our operations are
governed by a variety of federal, state and local laws intended to protect the environment. While environmental considerations are a part of all significant capital expenditures, compliance with the environmental laws has not had a material effect
and is not expected to have a material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position of our company. See Item 3.

FOREIGN SALES

Total U.S. export sales from our operations were $106, $98, and $90 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES

We manufacture our products in 43 plants worldwide. These facilities have an aggregate floor space of 7,017,000 square feet, consisting of
5,335,000 square feet owned by us and 1,682,000 square feet of leased space. Twenty-eight of our facilities are foreign plants with 2,884,000 square feet of space, of which 1,292,000 square feet are leased.

The principal equipment at our
facilities consists of presses, welding, machining, slitting and other metal fabricating equipment, winding machines, and furnace and painting equipment. We regard our plants and equipment as well-maintained and adequate for our needs. Multishift
operations are used where necessary.

In addition to our manufacturing
facilities, our World Headquarters and Corporate Technology Center are located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. We also have offices in Alsip, Illinois; El Paso, Texas; Lavergne, Tennessee; London, England; and Singapore.

ITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are involved in various unresolved legal actions, administrative proceedings and claims
in the ordinary course of our business involving product liability, property damage, insurance coverage, patents and environmental matters including the disposal of hazardous waste. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome
of these unresolved legal actions or the range of possible loss or recovery, we believe these unresolved legal actions will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. A more detailed discussion of these matters
appears in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

ITEM 7 – MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We recorded net earnings of $35.4 million or $1.18 per share in 2004, compared with $52.2
million or $1.76 per share recorded in 2003 and $51.3 million or $1.86 per share in 2002. Net earnings recorded in 2004 were negatively impacted by cost increases to steel and freight, as well as manufacturing inefficiencies during the first nine
months of the year in our Ashland City plant and higher selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A). While net earnings were flat in 2003 compared with 2002, the lower earnings per share amount in 2003 as compared with 2002 reflected the
full-year impact of our stock offering in May 2002. Our individual segment performance will be discussed later in this section.

Our working capital, excluding short-term debt, was $339.8 million at December 31, 2004, compared with $305.9 million and $225.1 million at December 31, 2003, and
December 31, 2002, respectively. The $33.9 million increase in 2004 reflects $44.9 million higher receivable balances due to longer payment terms experienced by both of our businesses as well as higher sales levels in the fourth quarter. Offsetting
the increase in receivable balances were $13.5 million lower inventory levels split about equally between Water Systems and Electrical Products and $14.3 million higher accounts payable balances. The $80.8 million increase in 2003 reflects $46.6
million higher inventory balances due primarily to extensive manufacturing repositioning in our electric motor business and several new product introductions and manufacturing consolidation in our water systems business. Additionally, receivable
balances were $21.2 million higher due to price increases associated with new product introductions in our water systems business and an increase in international sales, which tend to have longer payment terms. Finally, a $13.1 million increase in
accounts payable balances was largely offset by $9.4 million in restructuring expenses paid out in 2003. Reducing working capital is one of our major initiatives in 2005.

Cash provided by operating activities during 2004 was $67.2 million compared with $29.0 million during 2003 and $116.0 million during 2002.
Despite lower earnings in 2004, a smaller investment in working capital explains the majority of the improvement in cash flow compared with 2003. The higher investment in working capital in 2003 (as discussed above), explains the majority of the
difference between 2003 and 2002.

Our capital expenditures were $48.5 million
in 2004, essentially the same as in 2003 and approximately $2.2 million higher than in 2002. The increase in 2003 was associated with new product launches in our water systems business. We are projecting 2005 capital expenditures to be approximately
$55 million, essentially the same as our projected 2005 depreciation expense. We believe that our present facilities and planned capital expenditures are sufficient to provide adequate capacity for our operations in 2005.

In June 2004, we completed a $265 million, five-year revolving credit facility with a group
of eight banks. The new facility expires on June 10, 2009, and it replaced a $250 million credit facility which expired on August 2, 2004, and was terminated on June 10, 2004. The new facility backs up commercial paper and credit line borrowings. As
a result of the long-term nature of this facility, the commercial paper and credit line borrowings are now classified as long-term debt. At December 31, 2004, we had available borrowing capacity of $153.9 million under this facility. We believe that
the combination of available borrowing capacity and operating cash flow will provide sufficient funds to finance our existing operations for the foreseeable future.

To take advantage of historically low long-term borrowing rates, we issued $50.0 million in senior notes with two insurance companies in
June 2003. The notes range in maturity between 2013 and 2016 and carry a weighted average interest rate of slightly less than 4.5 percent. The proceeds of the notes were used to repay commercial paper and borrowing under the credit facility. Our
leverage, as measured by the ratio of total debt to total capitalization, was 32 percent at the end of 2004 and the end of 2003.

Aggregate Contractual Obligations

A summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004, is as follows:



We utilize blanket purchase orders to communicate expected annual requirements to many of our suppliers. Requirements
under blanket purchase orders generally do not become “firm” until six weeks prior to the company’s scheduled unit production. The purchase obligation amount presented above represents the value of commitments considered firm.

Our pension plan continues to meet all funding requirements under ERISA
regulations, and under current actuarial assumptions, we do not expect any significant minimum funding requirements for several years. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Included in other assets is a $34.0 million receivable due to the payments of claims
associated with the dip tube class action lawsuit. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The receivable is classified as a long-term asset because, while a trial was completed in 2004, the verdict was inconclusive, and a retrial
date is expected to be scheduled sometime in 2005. We expect to collect the receivable after 2005 through the satisfaction of a judgment favorable to us. Alternatively, collection could occur in 2005 if a settlement of the lawsuit is reached with
the defendants, Perfection Corporation, American Meter Company and insurance companies.

We have paid dividends for 65 consecutive years with payments increasing each of the last 13 years. We paid total dividends of $.62 per share in 2004 compared with $.58 per share in 2003.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Our sales in 2004 were $1.65 billion, an increase of $122.4 million or eight percent from sales of $1.53 billion in 2003. The sales increase
resulted from new higher-priced water heater products, price increases associated with higher steel and freight costs and a 37 percent increase in China water heater sales. 2003 sales increased by $61.6 million or 4.2 percent from sales of $1.47
billion in 2002. The sales increase was due to a full-year impact of our 2002 acquisitions in the motor business, a 44 percent increase in sales at our Chinese water heater operation, and higher water heater pricing related to steel costs and the
introduction of flammable vapor ignition resistant water heaters.

Our gross
profit margin for 2004 was 18.0 percent compared with 19.5 percent and 20.4 percent in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decline in margin from 2003 to 2004 was attributable to higher costs at Water Systems for raw materials, freight and
manufacturing inefficiencies. The decline in margin from 2002 to 2003 resulted from approximately $40 million of sales from acquired businesses with margins lower than those of our established business.

Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) increased $29.6 million from $206.2
million in 2003. SG&A was 14.3 percent of sales in 2004 and 13.5 percent in 2003. The increase in SG&A in 2004 was caused by higher selling and advertising expenses for Water Systems, expansion in China and higher administrative expense
related to pension and personnel costs. SG&A in 2003 of $206.2 million was consistent with 2002.

We have significant pension benefit costs and credits that are developed from actuarial valuations. The valuations reflect key assumptions regarding, among other things, discount rates, expected return on plan assets,
retirement ages and years of service. Consideration is given to current market conditions, including changes in interest rates, in making these assumptions. Our assumption for the expected rate of return on pension plan assets was 9.0 percent in
2004, unchanged from 2003. Our 2005 assumption for return on assets is 8.75 percent. We recognized pension income of $6.0 million, $11.6 million and $17.1 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002 respectively, reflected as reductions to cost of products sold
and SG&A. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We estimate that we will recognize approximately $3.5 million of pension expense in 2005.

In developing our expected long-term rate of return assumption, we evaluate our pension plan’s target asset allocation, the historical
long-term rates of return of equity and bond indices and the actual historical returns of our pension plan. Our plan’s target allocation to equity managers is between 60 to 70 percent, with the remainder allocated primarily to bond managers and
a small allocation to private equity managers. Due to market fluctuations, our actual asset allocation as of December 31, 2004, was 71 percent to equity managers, 24 percent to bond managers, 3 percent to private equity managers and the remainder in
money market instruments. We regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Our pension plan’s historical 10-year and 25-year compounded annualized
returns are 12.6 percent and 13.1 percent, respectively. We believe that with our target allocation and the historical long-term returns of equity and bond indices as well as our actual historical returns, our 8.75 percent expected return on assets
for 2005 is reasonable.

The discount rate that we utilize for determining
future pension obligations is based on the average yield of Moody’s Aa Corporate Bonds. The discount rate determined on this basis has decreased from 6.25 percent at December 31, 2003, to 6.00



percent at December 31, 2004. We will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions at least annually, and we will adjust the assumptions as necessary.

Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on assets by 25 basis points
would increase our net pension expense for 2005 by approximately $1.7 million. Lowering the discount rate by 25 basis points would increase our 2005 net pension expense by approximately $1.3 million.

Interest expense was $13.5 million in 2004, compared with $12.2 million in 2003. The $1.3
million increase in 2004 was the result of modestly higher debt levels and interest rates compared with 2003. Interest expense in 2002 was $13.9 million, exceeding both 2004 and 2003 as the reduction of debt resulting from our stock offering in May
2002 only impacted the last seven months of the year.

Other net expense
consists of bank fees, interest income and other non-operating items and has remained constant over the last three years at approximately $1.3 million.

Our effective tax rate was 25.5 percent in 2004, 33.9 percent in 2003 and 34.5 percent in 2002. The geographic composition of our 2004 pretax earnings resulted in a
significant reduction in our effective tax rate as a greater proportion of earnings was recognized in the lower-taxed countries of China and Mexico compared to the United States and Europe. The decline in the rate from 2002 to 2003 was due to the
resolution of a federal tax audit in May 2003.

Our 2004 net earnings declined
to $35.4 million from $52.2 million in 2003, primarily as a result of significant increases in costs for steel and freight, manufacturing inefficiencies at one of our water heater plants and higher SG&A expense. Earnings per share were $1.18 in
2004 compared with $1.76 in 2003.

Electrical Products

Sales in our Electrical Products segment in 2004 increased by $36.1
million to $860.7 million from $824.6 million in 2003. The increase was due to higher unit volumes and price increases related to higher costs for steel and freight. Sales to all of our served motor markets with the exception of heating, ventilating
and air conditioning (HVAC), were more than ten percent higher than in 2003. HVAC sales declined four percent in 2004 as a result of the loss of an important contract by one of our major OEM customers. Sales in 2003 were $34.2 million higher than
sales of $790.4 million in 2002 due primarily to our 2002 acquisitions of Athens Products and the Jiangsu Changheng Motor Group Co. Ltd.

Operating earnings for our Electrical Products segment were $51.5 million in 2004 or $2.7 million less than 2003. The decrease was due primarily to higher costs for steel
and freight and certain administrative expenses which more than offset the steel related price increases and benefits achieved by our product repositioning program. Operating earnings in 2003 were $54.2 million or $3.4 million less than 2002 due to
pricing and manufacturing costs related to production repositioning to lower cost facilities.

Water Systems

Sales for our
Water Systems segment were a record $792.4 million in 2004, or $86.3 million higher than sales of $706.1 million in 2003. The sales growth was driven by the introduction of higher efficiency residential water heaters, higher prices related to higher
steel and freight costs, strong commercial volume, a 37 percent increase in our China operations and additional flammable vapor ignition resistant product. Sales of $706.1 million in 2003 increased by $27.4 million over sales of $678.7 million in
2002. The increase was due to a January 2003 price increase to cover higher steel costs, a 44 percent increase in China sales and the introduction of flammable vapor ignition resistant product. Partially offsetting these increases were lower unit
sales of commercial and residential retail product.

Operating earnings of
$36.8 million in 2004 were $20.4 million lower than the $57.2 million earned in 2003. The significant benefits related to new product introductions and stronger commercial business were more than offset by raw material cost increases, higher freight
expenses, manufacturing inefficiencies during the first nine months and higher selling expense. Operating earnings of $57.2 million in 2003 were slightly lower than the $58.4 million earned in 2002. Most of the decline was associated with the
flammable vapor ignition resistant product introduction costs in combination with lower sales of higher margin commercial product throughout the year.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our accounting policies are described in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Also as disclosed in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires the use of estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and
their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the



determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be
material to the financial statements.

The most significant accounting
estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates associated with the evaluation of the recoverability of certain assets including goodwill and receivables resulting from the payment of claims associated with the
dip tube class action lawsuit (see Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) as well as those estimates used in the determination of liabilities related to warranty activity, litigation, product liability, environmental matters, and
pensions and other post-retirement benefits. Various assumptions and other factors underlie the determination of these significant estimates. The process of determining significant estimates is fact-specific and takes into account factors such as
historical experience and trends, and in some cases, actuarial techniques. We constantly reevaluate these significant factors, and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate. Historically, actual results have not significantly
deviated from those determined using the estimates described above.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
has issued SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” and SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.” We adopted SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003. Adoption of this statement
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. Adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements.

On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123
(revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash
Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123. However, SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the
income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative.

SFAS No. 123(R) must be adopted no later than July 1, 2005. Early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued. We expect to adopt SFAS No. 123(R) on July 1, 2005.

As permitted by SFAS No. 123, the company currently accounts for share-based
payments to employees using APB Opinion No. 25’s intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R)’s fair value method could have a
significant impact on our results of operations, although it will have no impact on our overall financial position. The impact of adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share-based payments
granted in the future. However, had we adopted SFAS No. 123(R) in prior periods, the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share earlier
in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. SFAS No. 123(R) also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as
required under current literature. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. While the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future (because they depend
on, among other things, when employees exercise stock options), the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were $2.5, $0.8 and $2.4 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Outlook

We have implemented significant price increases in both of our businesses, the most recent increases being effective with the beginning of
this year. These price increases have been put in place to offset the negative impact of material and freight cost increases. While we are generally pleased with the impact and acceptance of the new price levels, it is far too early to project their
ultimate impact and acceptance. Accordingly, we have determined that we will not provide a forecast of earnings per share at this time.

OTHER MATTERS

Environmental

Our operations are
governed by a number of federal, state and local environmental laws concerning the generation and management of hazardous materials, the discharge of pollutants into the environment and remediation of sites owned by the company or third parties. We
have expended financial and managerial resources complying with such laws. Expenditures related to environmental matters were not material in 2004 and are not expected to be material in any single year. Although we believe that our operations are
substantially in compliance with such laws and maintain procedures designed to maintain



compliance, there are no assurances that substantial additional costs for compliance will not be incurred in the future. However, since the same laws govern
our competitors, we should not be placed at a competitive disadvantage.

Market Risk

We are exposed to various types of market risks,
primarily currency and certain commodities. We monitor our risks in such areas on a continuous basis and generally enter into forward and futures contracts to minimize such exposures for periods of less than one year. We do not engage in speculation
in our derivatives strategies. Further discussion regarding derivative instruments is contained in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Commodity risks include raw material price fluctuations. We use futures contracts to fix the cost of our expected needs for certain raw materials (i.e. copper and
aluminum) with the objective of reducing price risk. Futures contracts are purchased over time periods and at volume levels which approximate expected usage. At December 31, 2004, we had commodity futures contracts amounting to $81.0 million of
commodity purchases. A hypothetical ten percent change in the underlying commodity price of such contracts would have a potential impact of $8.1 million. It is important to note that gains and losses from the company’s futures contract
activities will be offset by gains and losses in the underlying commodity purchase transactions being hedged.

In addition, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies. At December 31, 2004, we had net foreign currency contracts outstanding of $119.2 million.
Assuming a hypothetical ten percent movement in the respective currencies, the potential foreign exchange gain or loss associated with the change in rates would amount to $11.9 million. It is important to note that gains and losses from our forward
contract activities will be offset by gains and losses in the underlying transactions being hedged.

Our earnings exposure related to movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating-rate debt instruments that are determined by short-term money market rates. At December 31, 2004, we had
$117.5 million in outstanding floating-rate debt with a weighted-average interest rate of 2.4 percent at year end. A hypothetical ten percent annual increase or decrease in the year-end average cost of our outstanding floating-rate debt would result
in a change in annual pretax interest expense of $0.3 million.

Forward-Looking Statements

This report contains statements
that we believe are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of words such as “may,”
“will,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue” or words of similar meaning. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties
that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated as of the date of this release. Factors that could cause such a variance include the following: significant increases in raw material prices; competitive pressures on the
company’s businesses; instability in the company’s electric motor and water products markets; adverse changes in general economic conditions; and the potential that assumptions on which the company based its expectations are inaccurate or
will prove to be incorrect.

Forward-looking statements included in this report
are made only as of the date of this report, and the company is under no obligation to update these statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributed to the company, or
persons acting on its behalf, are qualified entirely by these cautionary statements.

ITEM 8 - FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

A. O. Smith Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of A. O. Smith Corporation as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the index at
Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of A. O. Smith Corporation at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of A. O. Smith
Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated January 31, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Organization and Significant Accounting Policies

Organization.

A. O. Smith Corporation (the company) is a manufacturer serving customers worldwide. The company’s major product lines include fractional
horsepower alternating current (A/C), direct current (D/C), hermetic and integral horsepower electric motors, as well as residential and commercial water heaters. The company’s products are manufactured and marketed primarily in North America.
Electric motors are sold principally to original equipment manufacturers and distributors. Water heaters are sold principally to plumbing wholesalers and retail outlets.

Consolidation.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries after
elimination of intercompany transactions.

Use of estimates

. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and
notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair value of
financial instruments

. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and trade payables approximated fair value as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, due to the short maturities of these instruments. The carrying amount of long-term
debt approximated fair value as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, based on current rates offered to the company for debt with the same or similar maturities. The fair values of derivative financial instruments are discussed later in this footnote.

Foreign currency translation.

For all subsidiaries outside the United
States, with the exception of all Mexican operations and substantially all of the China operations of the company’s Electrical Products segment, the company uses the local currency as the functional currency. For those operations using a
functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at weighted-average exchange rates. The resulting translation adjustments
are recorded as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. The Mexican operations and the majority of the China operations of the company’s Electrical Products segment use the U.S. dollar as the functional currency as such operations
are a direct and integral component of the company’s U.S. operations. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in net earnings.

Cash and cash equivalents

. The company considers all highly liquid investments, generally with a maturity of three months or less when purchased, to be cash
equivalents.

Inventory valuation.

Inventories are carried at lower of
cost or market. Cost is determined on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for substantially all domestic inventories, which comprise 88 percent and 91 percent of the company’s total inventory at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Inventories of foreign subsidiaries and supplies are determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.

Property, plant and equipment.

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed primarily by the straight-line method. The estimated service lives used to compute depreciation are
generally 25 to 50 years for buildings and 5 to 20 years for equipment. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred.

Goodwill and other intangibles.

The company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,”
effective January 1, 2002. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (totaling $3.0 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003) are no longer amortized but are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis. Separable intangible
assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives which range from 5 to 30 years.



1.

Organization and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Impairment of long-lived and amortizable intangible assets.

Property, plant and equipment and intangible
assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of
the related asset or group of assets, a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the asset or group of assets. Such analyses necessarily involve significant judgment.

Derivative instruments.

SFAS No. 133, as amended, requires that all derivative
instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and establishes criteria for designation and effectiveness of the hedging relationships. Any fair value changes are recorded in net earnings or other comprehensive earnings (loss).

The company utilizes certain derivative instruments to enhance its ability to
manage currency exposures and raw materials price risks. Derivative instruments are entered into for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. The company does not enter
into contracts for speculative purposes. The contracts are executed with major financial institutions with no credit loss anticipated for failure of the counterparties to perform.

Commodity Futures Contracts

In addition to entering into supply arrangements in the normal course of business, the company also enters into futures contracts to fix the cost of certain raw material
purchases, principally copper and aluminum, with the objective of minimizing changes in cost due to market price fluctuations.

The commodity futures contracts are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges of a forecasted transaction. Derivative commodity assets of $13.9 million and $15.7
million are recorded in other current assets as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The value of the effective portion of the contracts of $13.6 million and $15.6 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, was recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive earnings (loss), net of tax, and reclassified into cost of products sold in the period in which the underlying transaction was recorded in earnings. Ineffective portions of the commodity hedges are recorded in
earnings in the period in which the ineffectiveness occurs. The impact of hedge ineffectiveness on earnings was not material in 2004, 2003 and 2002.

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts

The company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of certain subsidiaries. The company
utilizes foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts to manage the volatility associated with foreign currency purchases, sales and certain intercompany transactions in the normal course of business. Contracts typically have maturities of
one year or less. Principal currencies include the Mexican peso, Hungarian forint, British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro and U.S. dollar.

Forward contracts are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges of a forecasted transaction. Derivative currency assets of $5.3 million as of December 31, 2004,
are recorded in other current assets, and derivative currency liabilities of $1.0 million as of December 31, 2003, are recorded in accrued liabilities. Gains and losses on these instruments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings
(loss), net of tax, until the underlying transaction is recorded in earnings. When the hedged item is realized, gains or losses are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive earnings (loss) to the statement of earnings. The assessment of
effectiveness for forward contracts is based on changes in the forward rates. These hedges have been determined to be perfectly effective.



1.

Organization and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

The majority of the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (loss) for cash flow hedges is expected to be
reclassified into earnings within one year.

The following table summarizes, by
currency, the contractual amounts of the company’s foreign currency forward contracts.

The forward contracts in place at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, amounted to approximately 89 percent and 92 percent, respectively, of the company’s anticipated subsequent year exposure for those currencies hedged.

Revenue recognition.

The company recognizes revenue upon transfer of title, which
generally occurs upon shipment of the product to the customer.

Contracts and
customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement. Shipping documents are used to verify delivery. The company assesses whether the selling price is fixed or determinable based upon the payment terms associated
with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. The company assesses collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the
customer’s payment history.

Accruals for customer returns for defective
product are based on historical experience with similar types of sales. Accruals for rebates and incentives are based on pricing agreements and are generally tied to sales volume. Changes in such accruals may be required if future returns differ
from historical experience or if actual sales volume differs from estimated sales volume. Rebates and incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales.

Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in net sales and the related costs are included in cost of products sold.

Advertising.

Advertising costs are charged to operations as incurred and amounted to
$23.7, $18.4 and $16.2 million during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Research and development.

Research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred and amounted to $35.9, $34.6 and $30.4 million during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Product warranty.

The company’s products carry warranties that generally range
from one to six years and are based on terms that are generally accepted in the market. The company records a liability for the expected cost of warranty-related claims at the time of sale. The allocation of our warranty liability between current
and long-term is based on expected warranty claims to be paid in the next year as determined by historical product failure rates.

The following table presents the company’s product warranty liability activity in 2004 and 2003:

Environmental costs.

The
company accrues for losses associated with environmental obligations when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable. Costs of estimated future expenditures are not discounted to their present value. Recoveries of environmental costs from
other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is considered probable. The accruals are adjusted as facts and circumstances change.



1.

Organization and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Stock-based compensation.

The company has one stock-based employee compensation plan (see Note 9). SFAS No.
123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” encourages, but does not require, companies to record compensation cost for stock-based employee compensation plans at fair value. The company has chosen to continue applying Accounting
Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related interpretations in accounting for its stock-based compensation plan. Accordingly, because the number of shares is fixed and the exercise price
of the stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense has been recognized.

Had compensation cost been determined based upon the fair value at the grant date for awards under the plans based on the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the company’s
pro forma earnings and earnings per share would have been as follows:

Earnings per share of common
stock.

The numerator for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is net earnings. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted weighted-average shares used in the earnings per share calculations:

Reclassifications.

Certain
prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2004 presentation.

New accounting standards.

During 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” and SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or
Disposal Activities.” SFAS No. 143 was adopted by the company on January 1, 2003. Adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 146 is effective for exit or disposal
activities initiated after December 31, 2002. Adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements.

On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment”, which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation”. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”, and amends SFAS No. 95, “Statement of Cash Flows”. Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123(R) is similar
to the approach described in SFAS No. 123. However, SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure
is no longer an alternative.

SFAS No. 123(R) must be adopted no later than
July 1, 2005. Early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued. We expect to adopt SFAS No. 123(R) on July 1, 2005. SFAS No. 123(R) permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two
methods: (1) a “modified prospective” method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date (a) based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123(R) for all share-based payments granted after the effective date and (b)
based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 123(R) that remain unvested on the effective date; or (2) a “modified retrospective” method which includes the
requirements of the modified prospective method described above, but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under SFAS No. 123 for purposes of pro forma disclosures.



1.

Organization and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

either (a) all prior periods presented or (b) prior interim periods of the year of adoption. The company plans to adopt SFAS No. 123(R) using the
modified-prospective method.

As permitted by SFAS No. 123, the company
currently accounts for share-based payments to employees using APB Opinion No. 25’s intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R)’s
fair value method could have a significant impact on our results of operations, although it will have no impact on our overall financial position. The impact of adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on
levels of share-based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted SFAS No. 123(R) in prior periods, the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings
and earnings per share earlier in this note. SFAS No. 123(R) also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under
current literature. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. While the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future (because they depend on, among
other things, when employees exercise stock options), the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were $2.5, $0.8, and $2.4 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

2.

Acquisitions

In November 2003, the company acquired certain net assets of Taicang Special Motor Co., Ltd. (Taicang), a manufacturer of commercial hermetic electric motors located in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China. The total cost
of the acquisition was $4.0 million including future payments of $2.3 million which were made in 2004. This cost exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired by $0.4 million which was recorded as goodwill in the Electrical Products segment.

In July 2002, the company acquired certain net assets of the Athens Products
(Athens) division of the Electrolux Group. In December 2002, the company acquired the motor manufacturing assets of Jiangsu Changheng Group Co. Ltd. (Changheng). The total cost of these acquisitions was $25.0 million including future payments of
$3.1 million which were made in 2003 and acquisition costs of $0.1 million and exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired by $3.7 million which was recorded as goodwill in the Electrical Products segment. Athens, based in Athens, Tennessee,
is a manufacturer of hermetic motors for both scroll and reciprocating compressors. Changheng is located in the Jiangsu province of China and manufactures air-moving motors.

The respective purchase prices for the Taicang, Athens and Changheng acquisitions were allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed based upon current estimates of their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The operating results of these companies have been included in the company’s consolidated financial statements since the dates of acquisition. The
pro forma effect of the Taicang acquisition would not be significant to 2003 operating results.

Goodwill

In connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 142, the company completed the transitional goodwill impairment test that required the company to compare the fair value of its reporting units to the carrying value of the
net assets of the respective reporting units as of January 1, 2002. Based on this analysis, the company concluded that no impairment existed at the time of adoption, and, accordingly, the company has not recognized any transitional impairment loss.
Additionally, the company concluded that no impairment existed at the time of the annual impairment tests which were performed in the fourth quarter of 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The two reporting units used to test goodwill for impairment
are Electrical Products and Water Systems.

There were no changes in the
carrying amount of goodwill in 2004. Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill during the year ended December 31, 2003, consisted of the following:

Debt and Lease Commitments



7.

Debt and Lease Commitments (continued)

The company has a $265 million multi year revolving credit agreement with a group of eight financial institutions,
which expires on June 10, 2009. Borrowings under the company’s bank credit lines and commercial paper borrowings are supported by the revolving credit agreement. As a result of the long-term nature of this facility, the commercial paper and
credit line borrowings are classified as long-term debt at December 31, 2004. At its option, the company maintains either cash balances or pays fees for bank credit and services.

During June 2003, the company issued an additional $50 million in senior notes with two insurance companies. The notes range in maturity
between 2013 and 2016 and carry a weighted-average interest rate of slightly less than 4.5 percent. The proceeds of the notes were used to repay commercial paper and revolver borrowing.

Scheduled maturities of long-term debt within each of the five years subsequent to December 31, 2004, are as follows: 2005-$8.6; 2006-$6.9;
2007-$6.9; 2008-$15.6; 2009-$128.6 million.

Future minimum payments under
non-cancelable operating leases relating mostly to office, manufacturing and warehouse facilities total $62.9 million and are due as follows: 2005-$14.4; 2006-$11.0; 2007-$9.7; 2008-$7.0; 2009-$4.6; and thereafter-$16.2 million. Rent expense,
including payments under operating leases, was $25.2, $22.4 and $22.0 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Interest paid by the company was $13.5, $12.2 and $13.9 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

8.

Stockholders’ Equity

The company’s authorized capital consists of 3 million shares of Preferred Stock $1 par value, 14 million shares of Class A Common Stock $5 par value, and 60 million
shares of Common Stock $1 par value. The Common Stock has equal dividend rights with Class A Common Stock and is entitled, as a class, to elect 25 percent of the Board of Directors and has 1/10th vote per share on all other matters.

On May 10, 2002, the company completed the sale of 4,776,065 shares of Common Stock held in
treasury. The $127.5 million net proceeds from the offering were used to reduce long-term debt.

During 2004, 2003 and 2002, 8,018, 64,505 and 91,049 shares, respectively, of Class A Common Stock were converted into Common Stock. Regular dividends paid on the Class A Common Stock and Common Stock amounted to
$.62, $.58 and $.54 per share in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

At
December 31, 2004, 32,595 and 2,851,637, shares of Class A Common Stock and Common Stock, respectively, were held as treasury stock. At December 31, 2003, 32,595 and 3,270,754 shares of Class A Common Stock and Common Stock, respectively, were held
as treasury stock.

Accumulated other comprehensive loss is as follows:

Stock Options and Restricted Stock

The company adopted the A. O. Smith Combined Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (the “plan”) effective January 1, 2002. The plan superceded and replaced two
predecessor incentive compensation plans. The plan provides for the issuance of 1.5 million stock options at exercise prices equal to the fair value of Common Stock on the date of grant. Additionally, any shares that would have been available for
stock option grants under either of the predecessor plans, if such plans were in effect, will be available for granting of stock option awards under the plan. Of the 228,300 options granted in 2004, 71,700 become exercisable one year from date of
grant and 156,600 become exercisable three years from date of grant. The options granted in 2003 and 2002 become exercisable one year from date of grant. For active employees, all options granted in 2004, 2003 and



9.

Stock Options and Restricted Stock (continued)

2002 expire ten years after date of grant. The number of shares available for granting of options at December 31, 2004, was 613,050.

Participants may also be awarded shares of restricted stock under the plan. The company
granted 149,000, 49,100 and 49,000 shares of restricted Common Stock under the plan in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The restricted shares were valued at $3.9, $1.4 and $1.3 million at the date of issuance in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively,
and will be recognized as compensation expense ratably over the three-year vesting period. Compensation expense of $1.5, $0.6 and $0.1 million was recognized in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Changes in option shares, all of which are Common Stock, were as follows:

The following table summarizes
weighted-average information by range of exercise prices for stock options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2004:

The weighted-average fair value per
option at the date of grant during 2004, 2003 and 2002, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, was $10.31, $11.14 and $9.71, respectively. Assumptions were as follows:



10.

Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefits

The company provides retirement benefits for all United States employees including benefits for employees of discontinued operations which were earned up to the date of
sale. The company also has several foreign pension plans, none of which are material to the company’s financial position.

The company has a defined-contribution profit sharing and retirement plan covering the majority of its salaried nonunion employees which provides for annual company
contributions of 35 percent to 140 percent of qualifying contributions made by participating employees. The amount of the company’s contribution in excess of 35 percent is dependent upon the company’s profitability. The company also has
defined-contribution plans for certain hourly employees which provide for annual matching company contributions.

The company has several unfunded defined-benefit post-retirement plans covering certain hourly and salaried employees that provide medical and life insurance benefits
from retirement to age 65. Certain hourly employees retiring after January 1, 1996, are subject to a maximum annual benefit and salaried employees hired after December 31, 1993, are not eligible for post-retirement medical benefits.

Obligations and Funded Status

The following tables present the changes in benefit obligations, plan assets and funded
status for domestic pension and post-retirement plans and the components of net periodic benefit costs.



10.

Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefits (continued)

The projected benefit obligation,
accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the company’s pension plans, both of which are underfunded, with accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets were $779.5, $755.5 and $667.9 million, respectively, as
of December 31, 2004, and $751.3, $730.2 and $667.1 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2003.

Additional information

The change in
the minimum liability included in other comprehensive income is as follows:

Assumptions

Actuarial assumption used to determine benefit obligations at December 31 are as follows:

Actuarial assumptions used to
determine net periodic benefit cost for the year ended December 31 are as follows:

In developing the expected long-term
rate of return assumption, the company evaluated its pension plan’s target asset allocation and historical long-term rates of return of equity and bond indices. The company also considered its pension plan’s historical 10-year and 25-year
compounded annualized returns of 12.6 percent and 13.1 percent, respectively.

Assumed health care cost trend rates

Assumed health care cost
trend rates as of December 31 are as follows:



10.

Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefits (continued)

A one-percentage-point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates would not result in a material impact on
the company’s consolidated financial statements.

Plan Assets

The company’s pension plan weighted asset allocations as of December
31 by asset category are as follows:

The company’s target allocation
to equity managers is between 60 to 70 percent with the remainder allocated primarily to bond managers and a small allocation to private equity managers. The company regularly reviews its actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances its
investments to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate.

There is
no company stock included in plan assets at December 31, 2004 and 2003.

Cash Flows

The company does not expect to contribute to its
pension plans in 2005.

Estimated Future Payments

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are
expected to be paid:

11.

Income Taxes

The components of the provision for income taxes consisted of the following:



11.

Income Taxes (continued)

The provision for income taxes differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate due to the following items:

Components of earnings before income
taxes were as follows:

Total taxes paid (tax refunds
received) by the company for continuing and discontinued operations amounted to $(2.1), 6.7 and $(10.6) million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

No provision for U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes has been made on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as such earnings are considered to be
permanently invested. At December 31, 2004, the undistributed earnings amounted to $91.2 million. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on the undistributed earnings is not practicable. In addition, no provision or
benefits for U.S. income taxes have been made on foreign currency translation gains or losses.

The tax effects of temporary differences of assets and liabilities between income tax and financial reporting are as follows:

These deferred tax assets and
liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or long-term based on the balance sheet classification of the related assets and liabilities as follows:

As a result of the acquisition of
State, the company has $2.6 million of federal net operating loss carryovers that expire in 2021, $6.5 million of federal capital loss carryovers that expire in 2006 and $3.4 million of tax credits, the majority of which have an unlimited carryover
period.



11.

Income Taxes (continued)

The company has foreign net operating loss carryovers with tax benefits of $2.4 million. Of the $2.4 million of tax
benefits, $0.8 million have an unlimited carryover period and $1.6 million expire between 2006 and 2009. Based on future realizability, a valuation allowance of $2.4 million has been established against the foreign net operating loss carryover tax
benefits.

The company also has approximately $148 million of state and local
net operating loss carryovers. The majority of these carryovers expire between 2010 and 2024.

The company recorded a $7.3 million prior period adjustment to increase retained earnings and decrease the amount of deferred tax liabilities recorded as of the beginning of the reporting period. This adjustment was
recorded to recognize differences that existed between the originally recorded amount of deferred tax liabilities related to property, plant and equipment and the amount that should have been recorded based on timing differences between financial
reporting and tax reporting. The company determined that the cumulative difference dated back to 1999 and prior periods. Accordingly, retained earnings as of the beginning of the reporting period was adjusted. Previously issued net earnings for 2003
and 2002 were not adjusted as the differences described above were not material to those periods.

12.

Litigation and Insurance Matters

The company is involved in various unresolved legal actions, administrative proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of its business involving product liability,
property damage, insurance coverage, patents and environmental matters, including the disposal of hazardous waste. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions or the range of possible loss or
recovery, the company believes these unresolved legal actions will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. The following paragraphs summarize noteworthy actions and proceedings.

In 1999, a class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court, Western
District of Missouri, by individuals on behalf of themselves and all persons throughout the United States who have owned or currently own a water heater manufactured by Rheem Manufacturing Company, A. O. Smith Corporation, Bradford White Company,
American Water Heater Company, Lochinvar Corporation, and State Industries, Inc. (the “water heater manufacturers”) that contains a dip tube manufactured, designed, supplied or sold by Perfection Corporation between August 1993 and October
1996. A dip tube is a plastic tube in a residential water heater that brings the cold water supply to the bottom area of the tank to be heated. The plaintiffs and the water heater manufacturers reached a settlement of this lawsuit which the Court
approved in 2000. The water heater manufacturers paid the settlement, and all other legal actions brought against the water heater manufacturers related to dip tube claims have been dismissed as a result of the settlement of the class action.

Separately, the water heater manufacturers in late 1999 filed a direct action
lawsuit in the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans, State of Louisiana, against Perfection Corporation and American Meter Company, the parent company of Perfection Corporation, and their insurers to recover various damages caused by
deteriorating dip tubes that were manufactured by Perfection Corporation. The trial was completed, the jury finished its deliberations and returned a verdict on some, but not all, of the claims presented at trial. On July 8, 2004, the Judge entered
an order of partial judgment finding Perfection Corporation liable to the water heater manufacturers for breach of express warranty and for contribution and awarded $19.3 million with judicial interest from the filing of the lawsuit. The judgment
also rejected all of Perfection Corporation’s claims against the water heater manufacturers and the water heater manufacturers’ claim for breach of contract against Perfection Corporation. The Judge ordered a new trial on the water heater
manufacturers’ other claims against Perfection Corporation and the claim against American Meter Company asserting that it is liable for the acts of Perfection Corporation. The water heater manufacturers are seeking to recover an additional $77
million in damages at the new trial, being the amount the jurors in the first trial assigned to the claims for which they were not able to reach a verdict. The date of that trial has not been established. The judgment entered on July 8, 2004, cannot
be appealed until the new trial has been completed and a judgment entered. It is likely that all or part of the judgments will be appealed by one or more parties adversely affected by the judgments. The appeals process could take from one to three
years to complete.

Perfection Corporation sued the water heater manufacturers
in a separate action in Cook County, Illinois. The filing by Perfection Corporation was an attempt to preempt the Louisiana lawsuit. This action was dismissed.



12.

Litigation and Insurance Matters (continued)

As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, the company recorded a long-term receivable of $34.0 million (as
detailed below) related to dip tube repair claims, administrative costs, legal fees and related expenses.

It is the company’s expectation
that all or a substantial portion of its costs will be recovered from Perfection Corporation, American Meter Company and their insurers, as well as the company’s insurers. The water heater manufacturers have negotiated settlements with 13
insurers of Perfection Corporation and American Meter Company with the proceeds of the settlements being placed in escrow. Management also believes the two defendant companies have the financial ability to pay a judgment. The company has initiated
the claim process with the company’s insurers and reasonably believes that, if necessary, coverage provisions would apply.

The company is currently involved as a potentially responsible party (PRP) in judicial and administrative proceedings initiated on behalf of various state and federal
regulatory agencies seeking to clean up 10 sites which have been environmentally impacted (the “sites”) and to recover costs they have incurred or will incur as to the sites.

It is impossible at this time to estimate the total cost of remediation for the sites or the company’s ultimate share of those costs,
primarily because the sites are in various stages of the remediation process and issues remain open at many sites concerning the selection and implementation of the final remedy, the cost of that remedy and the company’s liability at a site
relative to the liability and viability of the other PRPs. The company has established reserves for the sites in a manner that is consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for costs associated with such cleanups
when those costs are capable of being reasonably estimated. To the best of the company’s knowledge, the reserves it has established, $0.9 and $1.1 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and insurance proceeds that are available to
the company are sufficient to cover the company’s liability. The company further believes its insurers have the financial ability to pay any such covered claims, and there are viable PRPs at each of the sites which have the financial ability to
pay their respective shares of liability at the sites. The company believes that any environmental claims in excess of reserves, insurance proceeds and indemnified amounts will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of
operations.

In addition to those sites, the company is involved in two other
environmental matters. The first is a matter the company previously reported which involves a former mine in Colorado that is being remediated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The State of Colorado appealed the trial
court’s decision to dismiss the State’s claims against the company to recover its costs associated with remediation of the mine site. The Court of Appeals reversed the order dismissing those claims and remanded the matter back to the trial
court. The company believes that the claims against it will ultimately be dismissed because the company was neither an

“owner”

nor

“operator”

of the site, but was merely a stockholder in a mining corporation that
worked the mine from 1936 to 1942. As such, it would have no liability under applicable environmental laws to the State or any other party. The second matter involves a notification by a private party in October 2003 that it intends to bring a
lawsuit against the company and other companies involved in mining operations in Colorado that caused damage to the private party’s land. The claimant has taken no further action with respect to this claim. In the event such further action is
taken, the company expects that any claims brought against it by the private party property owner will also be ultimately dismissed because, as with the case discussed immediately above, the company was merely a stockholder in mining corporations
that worked the mines involved in this claim from 1936 to 1941 and was neither an

“owner”

nor

“operator”

of the site.

The company is the primary lessee on a facility lease in Corydon, Indiana related to a business sold to Tower Automotive, Inc. (Tower). The lease has annual payments of
$1.2 million and expires in February 2010. The company entered into a sublease arrangement with Tower in 1997 with the same terms and conditions as the company lease. Tower filed for bankruptcy on February 2, 2005. The amount of liability, if any,
to the company related to the sublease arrangement is undeterminable at this time.

With respect to non-environmental claims, the company has self-insured a portion of its product liability loss exposure and other business risks for many years. The company has established reserves which it believes are adequate to cover
incurred claims. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the company had $125 million of product liability insurance for individual losses in excess of $5 million. The company periodically reevaluates its exposure on claims and makes adjustments to
its reserves as appropriate.



13.

Operations by Segment

The company has two reportable segments: Electrical Products and Water Systems. The Electrical Products segment manufactures fractional horsepower alternating current
(A/C) and direct current (D/C) and integral horsepower motors used in fans and blowers in furnaces, air conditioners and ventilating systems; industrial applications such as material handling; as well as in other consumer products such as home
appliances and pumps, swimming pools, hot tubs and spas. In addition, the Electrical Products segment manufactures hermetic motors which are sold worldwide to manufacturers of compressors used in air conditioning and refrigeration systems. The Water
Systems segment manufactures residential gas and electric water heaters as well as commercial water heating equipment used in a wide range of applications including hotels, laundries, car washes, factories and large institutions. In addition, the
Water Systems segment manufactures copper tube boilers used in large-volume hot water and hydronic heating applications.

The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” outlined in Note 1.
Intersegment sales have been excluded from segment revenues and are immaterial. Operating earnings, defined by the company as earnings before interest, taxes, general corporate and corporate research and development expenses, is used to measure the
performance of the segments and allocate resources.

There were no sales to customers
exceeding 10% of consolidated net sales in 2004. Net sales of the Electrical Products segment include sales to York International Corporation of $157.3 and $173.3 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Assets, depreciation and capital expenditures by segment

Corporate assets consist primarily of
cash and cash equivalents, deferred income taxes and derivative assets.



13.

Operations by Segment (continued)

Net sales and long-lived assets by geographic location

The following data by geographic area includes net sales based on product shipment
destination and long-lived assets based on physical location. Long-lived assets include net property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets and exclude prepaid pension, other intangibles and long-lived assets of discontinued operations.

14.

Quarterly Results of Operations (Unaudited)

Net earnings per share are computed
separately for each period and, therefore, the sum of such quarterly per share amounts may differ from the total for the year.



ITEM 9 – CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

None.

ITEM 9A – CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures

Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of
December 31, 2004, and have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were adequate and effective to ensure that material information relating to the company and its consolidated subsidiaries would be made known to them by others
within those entities.

Changes in internal controls

There were no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in
other factors that could significantly affect our disclosure controls and procedures nor were there any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls. As a result, no corrective actions were required or undertaken.

Management Report on Internal Control

The management of A. O. Smith Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. A. O. Smith Corporation’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair
presentation of published financial statements.

All internal control systems,
no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

A. O. Smith Corporation management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

. Based on our assessment we believe that, as of December 31, 2004, the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

A. O. Smith Corporation’s independent auditors have issued an audit report on our assessment of the company’s internal control
over financial reporting. This report appears on page 38.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

A.O. Smith Corporation

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control, that A. O. Smith Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). A. O. Smith Corporation’s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and
an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that A. O. Smith Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is
fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, A. O. Smith Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the COSO
criteria

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of A. O. Smith Corporation as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings, stockholders’
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004 and our report dated January 31, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
