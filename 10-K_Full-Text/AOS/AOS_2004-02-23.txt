PART 1

ITEM 1 — BUSINESS

We are a leading manufacturer of
electric motors and water heating equipment, serving a diverse mix of residential,
commercial and industrial end markets principally in the United States with a growing
international presence. Our company is organized in two segments: electrical products and
water systems. Our electrical products business manufactures and markets a comprehensive
line of hermetic motors, fractional horsepower alternating current (AC) and direct current
(DC) motors, and integral horsepower motors. Our water systems business manufactures and
markets a comprehensive line of residential gas and electric water heaters, standard and
specialty commercial water heating equipment, high-efficiency copper-tube boilers, and
water systems tanks. In 2003, we had net sales of approximately $1.5 billion, with 54
percent attributable to our electrical products business and 46 percent attributable to
our water systems business.

The following table summarizes our
sales by operating segment. This segment summary and all other information presented in
this section should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appear elsewhere in this document.

ELECTRICAL PRODUCTS

Our Electrical Products segment sales
increased $34 million or 4 percent in 2003 to $825 million. Excluding the third quarter
2002 acquisition of Athens Products, and the fourth quarter 2002 acquisition of Jiangsu
Changheng Group Co. Ltd. (Changheng) of China, segment sales were flat in 2003.

We are one of the three largest
manufacturers of electric motors in North America, having manufactured approximately 39
million electric motors in 2003. We offer a comprehensive line of hermetic motors,
fractional horsepower AC and DC motors, and integral horsepower motors, ranging in size
from sub-fractional C-frame ventilation motors up to 500 horsepower hermetic and 400
horsepower integral motors. We believe our extensive product offering gives us an
advantage in our targeted markets, often allowing us to serve all of our customer’s
electric motor needs. Over the last seven years we have significantly broadened our
electric motor product line and customer base through a series of acquisitions, including
UPPCO, General Electric Company’s domestic hermetic motor business, MagneTek’s
electric motor business and the Athens Products division of Electrolux.

Our motors are used in a wide range
of targeted residential, commercial and industrial applications, including: hermetic
motors that are sold worldwide to manufacturers of air conditioning and commercial
refrigeration compressors; fractional horsepower fan motors used in furnaces, air
conditioners and blowers; fractional horsepower motors for pumps for home water systems,
swimming pools, hot tubs and spas; fractional horsepower motors used in other consumer
products (such as garage door openers); and integral horsepower A/C and D/C motors for
industrial and commercial applications. Sales to the heating, ventilating, air
conditioning and refrigeration market account for approximately 60 percent of segment
sales. Approximately 87 percent of our 2003 segment sales were to OEMs in a diverse mix of
industries, with the remainder of sales directed to the aftermarket or distribution
channels. Sales to our largest customer, York International and its wholly owned Bristol
Compressors subsidiary, were $157 million in 2003 and represented approximately 19 percent
of segment sales. We believe that more than 25 percent of our total segment sales were
attributable to products used outside of the United States. We estimate that approximately
60 percent of sales are derived from the less cyclical replacement business with the
remainder being impacted by general business conditions in the retail and new construction
markets.


To remain a leader in this highly
competitive industry, we are committed to being a low-cost supplier of electric motors. We
were one of the first motor manufacturers to identify the cost-reduction potential of
Mexican operations, and today we manufacture a majority of our electric motors in our 16
Mexican motor facilities. In 2002, we undertook an initiative to accelerate the
cost-reduction programs that were already underway in our motor operations to enhance our
competitive position. These initiatives included the closure of four domestic plants,
three of which were closed in 2003, the transfer of production to our lower cost
operations in Mexico and China, and the consolidation of warehouse facilities into three
hub operations to improve customer service while reducing cost and a ten percent reduction
in the salaried workforce. Though the primary repositioning program has now been largely
completed, we intend to continue to optimize our operations in Mexico and China by
transferring production from higher to lower cost operations.

In December 2001, we acquired
Shenzhen Speeda, a manufacturer of sub-fractional horsepower electric motors in China. In
December 2002, we acquired the Changheng Motor Group, of Changzhou, China. While Changheng
has an existing customer base in China, the primary purpose of both the Shenzhen and
Changheng acquisitions is to further expand our ability to manufacture products for the U.
S. market. In November 2003 we acquired Taicang Special Motor Co., Ltd. (Taicang), a
manufacturer of hermetic motors for commercial air conditioning equipment. Taicang
currently serves the Chinese operations of a number of North American air conditioning
companies, and the purchase will enhance our position in the global hermetic motor market.

Our principal competitors in the
electric motor industry are Emerson Electric Co. and General Electric Company. A number of
other companies, such as Fasco Motors (a subsidiary of Tecumseh Products), Baldor
Electric, Regal-Beloit Corporation and Jakel Incorporated, compete with us in specific
segments of the electric motor market.

WATER SYSTEMS

Our Water Systems business had sales
in 2003 of $706 million, which were four percent or $27 million higher than in 2002. The
higher sales were the result of a $13 million increase in sales at our Chinese water
heater operation as well as improved pricing for new products and higher steel costs.

In December of 2001, we acquired the
privately held water heater manufacturer State Industries, Inc. (State) for aggregate cash
consideration of $117.6 million. This was comprised of a $61.3 million purchase price and
the assumption of $56.3 million of debt. The acquisition of State nearly doubled the sales
of our water heating business.

We serve residential, commercial and
industrial end markets with a broad range of products, including:

Residential gas and electric water
heaters

. Our residential water heaters come in sizes ranging from two-gallon
(point-of-use) models to 120-gallon appliances with varying efficiency ranges. We offer
traditional atmospheric water heaters as well as direct-vented and power-vented models for
today’s energy efficient homes. Domestic residential water heater sales in 2003 were
approximately $445 million or 63 percent of segment revenues.

Standard commercial water
heaters

. Our gas, oil and electric water heaters come in capacities ranging from 50 to
100 gallons and are used by customers who require a consistent, economical source of hot
water. Typical applications include restaurants, hotels and motels, laundries, car washes
and small businesses.

Approximately 80% of the residential
and commercial markets consist of the replacement of existing product, although new
construction is also an important factor for the business. Our Water Systems business also
manufactures and markets specialty commercial water heaters, copper-tube boilers,
expansion tanks and related products and parts.


We are one of the two largest
manufacturers and marketers of water heaters in North America, manufacturing approximately
2.9 million units in 2003. We have a leading share in the commercial water heating
segment, and we believe we are the only domestic manufacturer that offers standard and
specialty commercial water heater products. We believe that our comprehensive commercial
product line gives us a competitive advantage in this higher-margin segment of the water
heating industry. We also are one of the leaders in the residential water heating segment
with an extensive line of high-efficiency gas and electric models.

Government regulations are having a
significant impact on the United States water heating industry. Beginning in July of 2003,
United States water heater manufacturers were required to comply with new flammable vapor
ignition resistant standards for residential gas water heaters. These new regulations,
developed by the manufacturers in cooperation with the United States Consumer Product
Safety Commission, dictate that gas water heaters must be designed to protect against
accidental ignition of flammable vapors caused by spilled gasoline or other liquids. In
addition, a United States government requirement to increase the efficiency of residential
gas and electric water heaters went into effect on January 20

th

of this year.

Our water systems wholesale
distribution channel includes more than 2,600 wholesale plumbing distributors that serve
residential, commercial and industrial markets. We also sell our residential water heaters
through the retail channel. In this channel, our customers include four of the six largest
national hardware and home center chains, including a long-standing private label
relationship with Sears, Roebuck and Co.

Our principal domestic water heating
competitors include Rheem Manufacturing Company, Inc. and, to a lesser extent, American
Water Heater Company and Bradford-White Corporation. We also compete against a number of
companies, such as Lochinvar Corporation, Raypak, Inc., Teledyne Laars Jandy Products (a
subsidiary of Water Pik Technologies, Inc.), and many smaller, regional competitors, in
certain segments of the United States water heater market, as well as numerous competitors
in international markets.


RAW MATERIAL

Raw materials for our manufacturing
operations, which consist primarily of steel, copper and aluminum, are generally available
from several sources in adequate quantities. We hedge the majority of our annual copper
and aluminum purchases to protect against price volatility.

SEASONALITY

There is no significant seasonal
pattern to our consolidated quarterly sales and earnings.

RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT, PATENTS and TRADEMARKS

In order to improve competitiveness
by generating new products and processes, we conduct research and development at our
Corporate Technology Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin as well as at our operating units.
Total expenditures for research and development in 2003, 2002 and 2001, were $34.6, $30.4
and $27.6 million, respectively.

We own and use in our businesses
various trademarks, trade names, patents, trade secrets and licenses. While a number of
these are important to us, we do not consider a material part of our business to be
dependent on any one of them.

EMPLOYEES

Our company and its subsidiaries
employed approximately 17,000 employees as of December 31, 2003.

BACKLOG

Normally, none of our operations sustain
significant backlogs.

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS

Our operations are governed by a
variety of federal, state and local laws intended to protect the environment. While
environmental considerations are a part of all significant capital expenditures,
compliance with the environmental laws has not had a material effect and is not expected
to have a material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position
of our company. See Item 3.

FOREIGN SALES

Total U.S. export sales from our
operations were $98, $90 and $91 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

ITEM 7 —
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We
recorded net earnings of $52.2 million or $1.76 per share in 2003, compared with $51.3
million or $1.86 per share recorded in 2002 and $14.5 million, or $.61 per share in 2001.
While net earnings were flat, the lower earnings per share amount in 2003 as compared to
2002 reflects the full year impact of our stock offering in May 2002. The significant
improvement in earnings in 2002 was primarily a result of cost-reduction actions in our
Electrical Products business and synergies related to the acquisition of State
Industries, Inc. (State). Our individual segment performance will be discussed later in
this section.

Our working capital, excluding
short-term debt (see discussion below), was $305.9 million at December 31, 2003 compared
with $225.1 million and $221.6 million at December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001,
respectively. The $80.8 million increase in 2003 reflects $46.6 million higher inventory
balances due primarily to extensive manufacturing repositioning in our electric motor
business and several new product introductions and manufacturing consolidation in our
water systems business. Additionally, receivable balances were $21.2 million higher due to
price increases associated with new product introductions in our water systems business
and an increase in international sales, which tend to have longer payment terms. Finally,
a $13.1 million increase in accounts payable balances was almost completely offset by $9.4
million in restructuring expenses paid out in 2003. The small increase in working capital
in 2002 was due to higher cash balances. Reducing working capital will be one of our major
initiatives in 2004.

Cash provided by operating activities
during 2003 was $25.3 million compared with $112.2 million during 2002 and $49.8 million
in 2001. The higher investment in working capital during 2003 explains the majority of the
difference between 2003 and 2002. Significantly higher earnings levels and a $12.4 million
tax refund in 2002 explain the majority of the improvement in 2002 cash provided by
operating activities compared with 2001. With 2004 forecasted earnings of $2.20 to $2.40
per share and successful working capital reduction efforts, we expect cash provided by
operating activities to be approximately $120 to $140 million.

Our capital expenditures were $44.9
million in 2003 compared with $42.5 million is 2002 and $35.3 million in 2001. The
increase in 2003 was associated with new product launches in our water systems business.
The increase in 2002 was associated with our acquisition of State. We are projecting 2004
capital expenditures to be between $45 and $50 million and to be slightly less than
projected 2004 depreciation expense. We believe that our present facilities and planned
capital expenditures are sufficient to provide adequate capacity for our operations in
2004.

We have a $250 million credit
facility with a group of nine financial institutions that expires on August 2, 2004.
Borrowings under bank credit lines and in the commercial paper market are supported by the
credit facility, and have in the past been classified as long-term debt. Since the term of
the facility at December 31, 2003 is less than one year, $96.8 million of debt has been
classified as short-term. We expect to replace the credit facility during the second
quarter of 2004. At December 31, 2003, we had available borrowing capacity of $153.2
million under this facility. We believe that the combination of available borrowing
capacity and operating cash flow will provide sufficient funds to finance our existing
operations for the foreseeable future.

To take advantage of historically low
long-term borrowing rates, we issued $50.0 million in senior notes with two insurance
companies in June 2003. The notes range in maturity between 2013 and 2016 and carry a
weighted average interest rate of slightly less than 4.5 percent. The proceeds of the
notes were used to repay commercial paper and borrowing under the credit facility. Our
leverage, as measured by the ratio of total debt to total capitalization was 32 percent,
down slightly from 33 percent at the end of 2002.

We utilize blanket purchase orders to
communicate expected annual requirements to many of our suppliers. Requirements under
blanket purchase orders generally do not become “firm” until six weeks prior to
the company’s scheduled unit production. The purchase obligation amount included
above represents the value of commitments considered firm.

Our pension plans continue to meet
all funding requirements under ERISA regulations, and under current actuarial assumptions,
we do not expect any significant minimum funding requirements for several years. See Note
12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

In 2002, we completed the sale of 4.8
million shares of our common stock at $28.25 per share and paid down debt with the $127.5
million net proceeds. Additionally during 2002, we recorded a $114.7 million non-cash
charge to equity as a result of the accumulated benefit obligations of our pension plan
exceeding the fair value of the plan assets.

In connection with acquisitions,
purchase liabilities were recorded at the respective acquisition dates for employee
severance and relocation as well as certain facility exit costs. See Note 2 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. All restructuring activities related to our purchase
liabilities were completed by December 31, 2003. Remaining balances as of that date for
purchase liabilities relate to contractual obligations for future payments, continuing
severance payments to separated employees and facility sale costs.

Included in other assets is a $34.0
million receivable due to the payments of claims associated with the dip tube class action
lawsuit. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The receivable is
classified as a long-term asset because the trial to recover the receivable will not begin
until early 2004 and while the trial will be concluded in 2004, the lawsuit may not be
concluded until 2005 or later, should there be an appeal of the trial court decision. We
expect to collect the receivable in 2005 through the satisfaction of a judgment favorable
to the company. Alternatively, collection could occur in 2004 if a settlement of the
lawsuit is reached with the defendants, Perfection Corporation, American Meter Company and
the insurance companies.

We have paid dividends for 64
consecutive years with payments increasing each of the last twelve years. We paid total
dividends of $.58 per share in 2003 compared with $.54 per share in 2002.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Our sales in 2003 were $1.53 billion,
an increase of $61.6 million or 4.2 percent from sales of $1.47 billion in 2002. The sales
increase was due to a full year impact of our 2002 acquisitions in the motor business, a
44 percent increase in sales at our Chinese water heater operation, and higher water
heater pricing related to steel costs and the introduction of the new flammable vapor
ignition resistant water heaters. Sales in 2002 increased by $317.9 million or 27.6
percent from sales of $1.15 billion in 2001. The sales increase was due to our
acquisitions of State in December 2001 and Athens Products (Athens) in July 2002. See
segment discussion below for further analysis.

Our gross profit margin for 2003 was
19.5 percent compared with 20.4 percent and 17.6 percent in 2002 and 2001, respectively.
The decline in margin from 2002 to 2003 was attributable to approximately $40 million of
sales from acquired businesses with margins lower than those of our established business.
The significant improvement in margin from 2001 to 2002 resulted from lower manufacturing
costs associated with the product repositioning program at Electrical Products and the
synergies from the State acquisition.

Selling, general and administrative
expense (SG&A) was $206.2 million in both 2003 and 2002, but as a percent of sales
declined from 14.0 percent in 2002 to 13.5 percent in 2003. SG&A in 2002 increased by
$60.5 million from the $145.7 million recorded in 2001 primarily as a result of
incremental SG&A associated with the State acquisition.

We have significant pension benefit
costs and credits that are developed from actuarial valuations. The valuations reflect key
assumptions regarding, among other things, discount rates, expected return on plan assets,
retirement ages and years of service. Consideration is given to current market conditions,
including changes in interest rates, in making these assumptions. Our assumption for the
expected rate of return on pension plan assets was 9.0 percent in 2003 compared with 9.75
percent in 2002. Our 2004 assumption for return on assets remains at 9.0 percent which
should result in pension income recognition of approximately $7.3 million in 2004. We
recognized pension income of $11.6 million, $17.1 million and $20.1 million in 2003, 2002
and 2001 respectively, reflected as reductions to cost of products sold and SG&A. See
Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

In developing our expected long-term
rate of return assumption, we evaluate our pension plan’s target asset allocation,
the historical long-term rates of return of equity and bond indices and the actual
historical returns of our pension plan. Our plan’s target allocation to equity
managers is between 60 to 70 percent, with the remainder allocated primarily to bond
managers and a small allocation to private equity managers. Due to market fluctuations,
our actual asset allocation as of December 31, 2003 was 72 percent to equity managers, 24
percent to bond managers, 3 percent to private equity managers and the remainder in money
market instruments. We regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically
rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Our
pension plan’s historical 10-year and 25-year compounded annualized returns are 11.6
percent and 13.4 percent, respectively. We believe that with our target allocation and the
historical long-term returns of equity and bond indices as well as our actual historical
returns, our 9.0 percent expected return on assets for 2004 is reasonable.

The discount rate that we utilize for
determining future pension obligations is based on the average yield of Moody’s Aa
Corporate Bonds. The discount rate determined on this basis has decreased from 6.75
percent at December 31, 2002, to 6.25 percent at December 31, 2003. We will continue to
evaluate our actuarial assumptions at least annually, and we will adjust the assumptions
as necessary.

Lowering the expected long-term rate
of return on assets by 25 basis points would decrease our net pension income for 2004 by
approximately $1.8 million. Lowering the discount rate by 25 basis points would decrease
our 2004 net pension income by approximately $1.3 million.

Interest expense was $12.2 million
in 2003, compared with $13.9 million and $16.4 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively.
Decreasing interest rates throughout the past three years coupled with a significant
reduction in debt resulting from our stock offering in May 2002 were responsible for the
downward trend in interest expense. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.


Amortization of intangibles in 2003
and 2002 was $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively, which was significantly lower
than the $7.0 million recorded in 2001. We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” as of January
1, 2002. Under the new standard, goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are no longer
amortized but instead are reviewed annually for impairment, and accordingly, goodwill
amortization of $6.7 million in 2001 was not recorded in 2002 and 2003. See Note 8 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other expense-net consists of bank
fees, interest income and other non-operating items and has remained relatively constant
over the last three years in the range of $1.0 million to $1.4 million.

Our effective tax rate was 33.9
percent in 2003, 34.5 percent in 2002 and 35.5 percent in 2001. The effective rate in 2003
was favorably impacted by the resolution of a federal tax audit in May 2003. The effective
rate in 2002 benefited from the implementation of a more efficient tax structure for
international operations.

Our 2003 net earnings improved
slightly to $52.2 million from $51.3 million in 2002. Despite slightly higher net earnings
in 2003, earnings per share of $1.76 were ten cents lower than 2002 earnings per share of
$1.86 as a result of the increased shares outstanding during 2003 due to the May 2002
stock offering.

Electrical Products

Sales in our Electrical Products
segment in 2003 increased by $34.2 million to $824.6 million from $790.4 million in 2002.
The increase was due primarily to our 2002 acquisitions of Athens and the Jiangsu
Changheng Motor Group Co. Ltd. (Changheng). Sales in 2002 were $12.3 million lower than
sales of $802.7 million in 2001. Excluding approximately $20 million in sales attributable
to the Athens acquisition, sales declined $32.0 million from 2001 to 2002. Sales to the
heating, ventilating and air conditioning market, excluding Athens, declined by 6.0
percent in 2002 and accounted for the majority of the total decrease in sales.

Operating earnings for our Electrical
Products segment were $54.2 million in 2003 or $3.4 million less than 2002. The decrease
was attributable primarily to pricing and manufacturing costs related to the repositioning
program. While there was a delay in recognition of cost savings related to the 2003
repositioning activities, we achieved significant results considering the number of
simultaneous relocation activities. During 2003 we closed three facilities including
Monticello, Indiana; Athens, Tennessee and Ripley, Tennessee. Additionally, we moved
significant amounts of production from four other U.S. facilities.

Operating earnings in 2001 were $20.8
million inclusive of a non-recurring pretax charge of $8.1 million and goodwill
amortization expense of $6.7 million and compare with 2002 operating earnings of $57.6
million. The $36.8 million increase in operating earnings from 2001 to 2002 was partially
attributable to the $8.1 million non-recurring charge and $6.7 million goodwill
amortization incurred in 2001, with the remainder resulting from the cost reduction
program announced in the fourth quarter of 2001. The program consisted of consolidation of
warehouse facilities, salaried workforce reduction, and relocation of domestic production
to Mexico and China.

We are continuing to expand our motor
production capacity in China and in November of 2003 completed the acquisition of Taicang
Special Motor Co., Ltd. near Shanghai. This acquisition will expand our motor
manufacturing capability to include hermetic motors in China.

Water Systems

Sales for our Water Systems segment
were $706.1 million in 2003, or $27.4 million higher than sales of $678.7 million in 2002.
The sales growth was driven by a January 2003 price increase to cover higher steel costs,
a 44 percent increase in our Chinese operations and the introduction of the new flammable
vapor ignition resistant products. These increases were partially offset by lower unit
sales of commercial and residential retail product. Sales of $678.7 million in 2002
increased by $330.2 million over sales of $348.5 million in 2001. Our State acquisition
contributed $312.6 million with the remaining increase attributable to higher volume for
the base residential and commercial business and the China operation.


Operating earnings of $57.2 million
in 2003 were slightly lower than the $58.4 million earned in 2002. Most of the decline was
associated with the flammable vapor ignition resistant product introduction costs, in
combination with lower sales of higher margin commercial product throughout the year. The
improvement in operating earnings from $39.2 million in 2001 to $58.4 million in 2002 was
the result of the State acquisition and its related synergies, as well as increased sales
volume in the base business.

Critical Accounting
Policies

Our accounting policies are described
in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Also as disclosed in Note 1, the
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires the use of estimates and assumptions about future
events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying
notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty.
Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual
results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material
to the financial statements.

The most significant accounting
estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates
associated with the evaluation of the recoverability of certain assets including goodwill
and receivables resulting from the payment of claims associated with the dip tube class
action lawsuit (see Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) as well as
those estimates used in the determination of liabilities related to warranty activity,
litigation, product liability, environmental matters, and pensions and other
post-retirement benefits. Various assumptions and other factors underlie the determination
of these significant estimates. The process of determining significant estimates is
fact-specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience and trends, and
in some cases, actuarial techniques. We constantly reevaluate these significant factors
and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate. Historically, actual
results have not significantly deviated from those determined using the estimates
described above.

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements

The Financial Accounting Standards
Board has issued SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,”
and SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities.” We adopted SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003. Adoption of this statement
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 146 is
effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. Adoption of
this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Outlook

As we look ahead to 2004, we have a
strong base for performance. The year 2003 was one of challenge and accomplishment. During
the year we transferred a substantial portion of our domestic motor manufacturing
operations to lower-cost facilities in Mexico and China. In the water heater business we
undertook the most significant product line transformation in our history. Unfortunately,
accomplishing these transitions hurt profitability and resulted in lower operating cash
flow due to increased working capital and restructuring expenditures. Restoring working
capital to its proper level will be a major initiative in 2004.

In October, we forecasted 2004
earnings of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. The profit improvement in 2004 will be driven
largely by the initiatives completed in 2003. In the motors business, we expect a full
year’s impact of the transition to Mexico, as well as the ramp-up in China, will
generate pretax earnings of $15 million. In the water heater business, a full year’s
sales of flammable vapor ignition resistant product, as well as the introduction of NAECA
compliant product is expected to generate $15 million pre-tax. The focusing of commercial
water heater production in our McBee, South Carolina plant, with residential product
relocated to Ashland City, Tennessee is expected to provide $5 million in pre-tax impact.

However, in response to recent
developments, on January 21st of this year, we adjusted our 2004 earnings guidance to a
range between $2.20 and $2.40 per share from the previous range of $2.40 to $2.60 a share.
This change was due to raw material cost pressures, particularly for steel and the loss of
a sales contract by a major motor customer.

We expect first quarter earnings to
approximate the $.46 per share earned in the first quarter of 2003.


OTHER MATTERS

Environmental

Our operations are governed by a
number of federal, state and local environmental laws concerning the generation and
management of hazardous materials, the discharge of pollutants into the environment and
remediation of sites owned by the company or third parties. We have expended financial and
managerial resources complying with such laws. Expenditures related to environmental
matters were not material in 2003 and are not expected to be material in any single year.
Although we believe that our operations are substantially in compliance with such laws and
maintain procedures designed to maintain compliance, there are no assurances that
substantial additional costs for compliance will not be incurred in the future. However,
since the same laws govern our competitors, we should not be placed at a competitive
disadvantage.

Market Risk

We are exposed to various types of
market risks, primarily currency and certain commodities. We monitor our risks in such
areas on a continuous basis and generally enter into forward and futures contracts to
minimize such exposures for periods of less than one year. We do not engage in speculation
in our derivatives strategies. Further discussion regarding derivative instruments is
contained in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Commodity risks include raw material
price fluctuations. We use futures contracts to fix the cost of our expected needs for
certain raw materials (i.e. copper and aluminum) with the objective of reducing price
risk. Futures contracts are purchased over time periods and at volume levels which
approximate expected usage. At December 31, 2003, we had commodity futures contracts
amounting to $55.5 million of commodity purchases. A hypothetical 10 percent change in the
underlying commodity price of such contracts would have a potential impact of $5.6
million. It is important to note that gains and losses from the company’s futures
contract activities will be offset by gains and losses in the underlying commodity
purchase transactions being hedged.

In addition, we enter into foreign
currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies. At
December 31, 2003, we had net foreign currency contracts outstanding of $132.4 million.
Assuming a hypothetical 10 percent movement in the respective currencies, the potential
foreign exchange gain or loss associated with the change in rates would amount to $13.2
million. It is important to note that gains and losses from our forward contract
activities will be offset by gains and losses in the underlying transactions being hedged.

Our earnings exposure related to
movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating-rate debt
instruments that are determined by short-term money market rates. At December 31, 2003, we
had $103.3 million in outstanding floating-rate debt with a weighted-average interest rate
of 1.4 percent at year end. A hypothetical 10 percent annual increase or decrease in the
year-end average cost of our outstanding floating-rate debt would result in a change in
annual pretax interest expense of $0.1 million.

Forward-Looking
Statements

This report contains statements that
we believe are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements generally can be
identified by the use of words such as “may,” “will,”
“expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,”
“believe,” “continue,” or words of similar meaning. These
forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those anticipated as of the date of this filing. Factors
that could cause such a variance include the following: instability in the company’s
electric motor and water products markets; inability to generate the synergistic cost
savings from the acquisition of State Industries; the inability to implement
cost-reduction programs; adverse changes in general economic conditions; significant
increases in raw material prices; competitive pressures on the company’s businesses;
and the potential that assumptions on which the company based its expectations are
inaccurate or will prove to be incorrect.

A.
O. Smith Corporation (the company) is a manufacturer serving customers
          worldwide. The company’s major product lines include fractional and
          integral horsepower alternating current (A/C), direct current (D/C) and
hermetic           electric motors, as well as residential and commercial water heaters.
The           company’s products are manufactured and marketed primarily in North
          America. Electric motors are sold principally to original equipment
          manufacturers and distributors. Water heaters are sold principally to plumbing
          wholesalers and retail outlets.

Consolidation.

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and           its
wholly owned subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany transactions.

Use of estimates

. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and notes. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Fair value of financial
instruments

. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, and trade
payables approximated fair value as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, due to the short
maturities of these instruments. The carrying amount of long-term debt approximated fair
value as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, based on current rates offered to the company for
debt with the same or similar maturities. The fair values of derivative financial
instruments are discussed later in this footnote.

Foreign currency translation.

For all subsidiaries outside the United States, with the exception of all Mexican
operations and the China operations of the company’s Electrical Products segment, the
company uses the local currency as the functional currency. For those operations using a
functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, assets and liabilities are translated into
U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at
weighted-average exchange rates. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a
separate component of stockholders’ equity. The Mexican operations and the China
operations of the company’s Electrical Products segment use the U.S. dollar as the
functional currency as such operations are a direct and integral component of the
company’s U.S. operations. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are
included in net earnings.

Cash and cash equivalents

. The
company considers all highly liquid investments, generally with a maturity of three months
or less when purchased, to be cash equivalents.

Inventory valuation.

Inventories are carried at lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on the last-in,
first-out (LIFO) method for substantially all domestic inventories which comprise 91
percent and 92 percent of the company’s total inventory at December 31, 2003 and
2002, respectively. Inventories of foreign subsidiaries and supplies are determined using
the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.

Property, plant and equipment.

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed primarily by
the straight-line method. The estimated service lives used to compute depreciation are
generally 25 to 50 years for buildings and 5 to 20 years for equipment. Maintenance and
repair costs are expensed as incurred.

Goodwill and other
intangibles.

The company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” effective January 1, 2002.
Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (totaling $3.0 million
at December 31, 2003 and 2002) are no longer amortized but are reviewed for impairment on
an annual basis. Separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite
life are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives which range
from 5 to 30 years.


1.    Organization and
Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Impairment of long-lived and
amortizable intangible assets.

Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the sum of the
expected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the related asset or
group of assets, a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and
carrying value of the asset or group of assets. Such analyses necessarily involve
significant judgment.

Derivative instruments.

Effective January 1, 2001, the company adopted SFAS No. 133, as amended, which requires
that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and
establishes criteria for designation and effectiveness of the hedging relationships. Any
fair value changes are recorded in net earnings or other comprehensive earnings (loss).
The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 133 was not material to the company’s
consolidated financial statements as of January 1, 2001.

The company utilizes certain
derivative instruments to enhance its ability to manage currency exposures and raw
materials price risks. Derivative instruments are entered into for periods consistent with
the related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those
exposures. The company does not enter into contracts for speculative purposes. The
contracts are executed with major financial institutions with no credit loss anticipated
for failure of the counterparties to perform.

Commodity Futures
Contracts

In addition to entering into supply
arrangements in the normal course of business, the company also enters into futures
contracts to fix the cost of certain raw material purchases, principally copper and
aluminum, with the objective of minimizing changes in cost due to market price
fluctuations.

The commodity futures contracts are
designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges of a forecasted transaction. Derivative
commodity assets of $15.7 million are recorded in other current assets as of December 31,
2003 and derivative commodity liabilities of $1.8 million are recorded in accrued
liabilities as of December 31, 2002. The value of the effective portion of the contracts
of $15.6 and $1.7 million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, was recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive earnings (loss), net of tax, and reclassified into cost of
products sold in the period in which the underlying transaction was recorded in earnings.
Ineffective portions of the commodity hedges are recorded in earnings in the period in
which the ineffectiveness occurs. The impact of hedge ineffectiveness on earnings was not
material in 2003, 2002 and 2001.

Foreign Currency Forward
Contracts

The company is exposed to foreign
currency exchange risk as a result of transactions in currencies other than the functional
currency of certain subsidiaries. The company utilizes foreign currency forward purchase
and sale contracts to manage the volatility associated with foreign currency purchases,
sales, and certain intercompany transactions in the normal course of business. Contracts
typically have maturities of one year or less. Principal currencies include the Mexican
peso, Hungarian forint, British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro and U.S. dollar.

Forward contracts are designated and
accounted for as cash flow hedges of a forecasted transaction. Derivative currency
liabilities of $1.0 million and $3.9 million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, are recorded in accrued liabilities. Gains and losses on these instruments
are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (loss), net of tax, until the
underlying transaction is recorded in earnings. When the hedged item is realized, gains or
losses are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive earnings (loss) to the
statement of earnings. The assessment of effectiveness for forward contracts is based on
changes in the forward rates. These hedges have been determined to be perfectly effective.


1.    Organization and
Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

The majority of the amounts in
accumulated other comprehensive earnings (loss) for cash flow hedges is expected to be
reclassified into earnings within one year.

The following table summarizes, by
currency, the contractual amounts of the company’s foreign currency forward
contracts.

The forward contracts in place at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, amounted to approximately 92 percent and 95 percent,
respectively, of the company’s anticipated subsequent year exposure for those
currencies hedged.

Revenue recognition.

The
company recognizes revenue upon transfer of title, which generally occurs upon shipment of
the product to the customer.

Contracts and customer purchase
orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement. Shipping documents
are used to verify delivery. The company assesses whether the selling price is fixed or
determinable based upon the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the
sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. The company assesses collectibility based
primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and
analysis, as well as the customer’s payment history.

Accruals for customer returns for
defective product are based on historical experience with similar types of sales. Accruals
for rebates and incentives are based on pricing agreements and are generally tied to sales
volume. Changes in such accruals may be required if future returns differ from historical
experience or if actual sales volume differ from estimated sales volume. Rebates and
incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales.

Compensated absences.

In the
fourth quarter of 2001, the company changed its vacation policy for certain employees so
that vacation pay is earned ratably throughout the year and must be used by year-end. The
accrual for compensated absences was reduced by $1.6 million in 2001 to eliminate vacation
pay no longer required to be accrued under the current policy.

Advertising.

Advertising
costs are charged to operations as incurred and amounted to $18.4,           $16.2 and
$8.8 million during 2003, 2002 and 2001 respectively.

Research and development.

Research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred and amounted to
$34.6, $30.4 and $27.6 million during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Product warranty.

The
company’s products carry warranties that generally range from one to six years and
are based on terms that are generally accepted in the market place. The company records a
liability for the expected cost of warranty-related claims at the time of sale. The
allocation of our warranty liability between current and long-term is based on expected
warranty claims to be paid in the next year as determined by historical product failure
rates.

exchange for other concessions, the customer has agreed to accept

          defective. The amount of the warranty reserve applicable to the estimated
number           of units previously sold to this customer that may become defective has
been           reclassified from the product warranty liability to a deferred revenue
account.

Environmental costs.

The
company accrues for losses associated with environmental obligations when such losses are
probable and reasonably estimable. Costs of estimated future expenditures are not
discounted to their present value. Recoveries of environmental costs from other parties
are recorded as assets when their receipt is considered probable. The accruals are
adjusted as facts and circumstances change.

Stock based compensation.

The
company has one stock-based employee compensation plan (see Note 11). SFAS No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” encourages, but does not require
companies to record compensation cost for stock-based employee compensation plans at fair
value. The company has chosen to continue applying Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related interpretations, in
accounting for its stock option plans. Accordingly, because the number of shares is fixed
and the exercise price of the stock options equals the market price of the underlying
stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense has been recognized.

Had compensation cost been determined
based upon the fair value at the grant date for awards under the plans based on the
provisions of SFAS No. 123, the company’s pro forma earnings and earnings per share
would have been as follows:

Reclassifications.

Certain
prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2003           presentation.

New accounting standards.

During 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 143,
“Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” and SFAS No. 146,
“Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.” SFAS No. 143
was adopted by the company on January 1, 2003. Adoption of this statement did not have a
material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 146 is
effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. Adoption of
this statement did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial
statements.

2.    Acquisitions

In November 2003, the company
acquired certain net assets of Taicang Special Motor Co., Ltd. (Taicang), a manufacturer
of commercial hermetic electric motors located in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China. The
total cost of the acquisition was $4.0 million including future payments of $2.3 million.
This cost exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired by $0.4 million which was
recorded as goodwill in the Electrical Products segment.

In July 2002, the company acquired
certain net assets of the Athens Products (Athens) division of the Electrolux Group. In
December 2002, the company acquired the motor manufacturing assets of Jiangsu Changheng
Group Co. Ltd. (Changheng). The total cost of these acquisitions was $25.0 million
including future payments of $3.1 million and acquisition costs of $0.1 million and
exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired by $3.7 million which was recorded as
goodwill in the Electrical Products segment. Athens, based in Athens, Tennessee, is a
manufacturer of hermetic motors for both scroll and reciprocating compressors. Changheng
is located in the Jiangsu province of China and manufactures air-moving motors.

In December 2001, the company
acquired all of the outstanding stock of State Industries, Inc. (State). State, located in
Ashland City, Tennessee, is a manufacturer of residential and standard commercial water
heaters which complements the wholesale channel of distribution with a strong presence in
the retail market. The aggregate cash consideration paid to acquire State was $117.6
million. This was comprised of a $61.3 million purchase price (including $3.5 million of
acquisition costs) and the assumption of $56.3 million of debt. Goodwill of $63.7 million
was recorded within the Water Systems segment.

In December 2001, the company
acquired a 100 percent equity interest in Shenzhen Speeda Industries Co., Ltd. and is
utilizing the facility located in China to manufacture sub-fractional electric motors. The
total purchase price of $3.3 million, including future payments of $0.7 million, exceeded
the fair value of the assets acquired (principally plant and equipment) by $0.8 million
and was recorded as goodwill within the Electrical Products segment.

The respective purchase prices for
the Taicang, Athens, Changheng, State and Shenzhen acquisitions were allocated to the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon current estimates of their respective
fair values at the date of acquisition. The operating results of these companies have been
included in the company’s consolidated financial statements since the dates of
acquisition. The pro forma effect of these acquisitions, individually and in the
aggregate, would not be significant to 2003 or 2002 operating results.

In connection with the company’s
acquisitions, aggregate purchase liabilities were recorded at the respective acquisition
dates for employee severance and relocation, as well as certain facility exit costs. All
restructuring activities related to the company’s purchase liabilities were completed
by December 31, 2003. Remaining balances as of that date for purchase liabilities relate
to contractual obligations for future payments, continuing severance payments to separated
employees and facility sale costs.

In January 2001, the company sold its
liquid and dry storage business, operated as Engineered Storage Products Company. The net
after-tax proceeds of $33.0 million from the sale are included in cash flow provided by
discontinued operations in 2001.

4.    Business Improvement
Programs

In the fourth quarter of 2001, the
company recorded restructuring and other charges of $9.4 million. The charges include
employee separation costs of $7.7 million associated with product or component
manufacturing repositioning and the realignment of certain administrative functions. The
reduction of workforce was approximately 100 salaried and 540 hourly employees. In
addition, the company recorded facility impairment and lease charges of $1.7 million
representing estimated costs of vacated facilities. All restructuring activities related
to our business improvement program were completed by December 31, 2003. Remaining
balances as of that date in the restructuring reserve relates to contractual obligations
for future payments or continuing severance payments to separated employees.

8.    Goodwill

In connection with the adoption of
SFAS No. 142, the company completed the transitional goodwill impairment test, which
required the company to compare the fair value of its reporting units to the carrying
value of the net assets of the respective reporting units as of January 1, 2002. Based on
this analysis, the company concluded that no impairment existed at the time of adoption,
and, accordingly, the company has not recognized any transitional impairment loss.
Additionally, the company concluded that no impairment existed at the time of the annual
impairment tests which were performed in the fourth quarter of 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The two reporting units used to test goodwill for impairment are Electrical
Products and Water Systems.

Changes in the carrying amount of
goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, consist of the

The company has a $250 million
multi-year revolving credit agreement with a group of nine financial institutions, which
expires on August 2, 2004. The company expects to extend this revolving credit agreement
prior to its expiration. Borrowings under the company’s bank credit lines and
commercial paper borrowings are supported by the revolving credit agreement. As the
revolving credit agreement expires in less than one year, outstanding borrowings of bank
credit lines and commercial paper are classified as short-term debt at December 31, 2003.
At its option, the company maintains either cash balances or pays fees for bank credit and
services.

During June 2003, the company issued
an additional $50 million in senior notes with two insurance companies. The notes range in
maturity between 2013 and 2016 and carry a weighted-average interest rate of slightly less
than 4.5 percent. The proceeds of the notes were used to repay commercial paper and
revolver borrowing.

The company’s credit agreements
and term notes contain certain conditions and provisions which restrict the company’s
payment of dividends. Under the most restrictive of these provisions, retained earnings of
$131.0 million are unrestricted as of December 31, 2003.

Scheduled maturities of long-term
debt within each of the five years subsequent to December 31, 2003, are as follows:
2004-$8.6; 2005-$8.6; 2006-$6.9; 2007-$6.9; 2008-$9.6 million.

Future minimum payments under
non-cancelable operating leases relating mostly to office, manufacturing and warehouse
facilities total $58.8 million and are due as follows: 2004-$14.6; 2005-$9.8; 2006-$7.7;
2007-$6.8; 2008-$5.5 and thereafter — $14.4 million. Rent expense including payments
under operating leases, was $22.4 $22.0 and $19.0 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

Interest paid by the company was
$12.2, $13.9 and $16.9 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.


10.    Stockholders’
Equity

The company’s authorized capital
consists of 3 million shares of Preferred Stock $1 par value, 14 million shares of Class A
Common Stock $5 par value, and 60 million shares of Common Stock $1 par value. The Common
Stock has equal dividend rights with Class A Common Stock and is entitled, as a class, to
elect 25 percent of the Board of Directors and has 1/10th vote per share on all other
matters.

On May 10, 2002, the company
completed the sale of 4,776,065 shares of Common Stock held in treasury. The $127.5
million net proceeds from the offering were used to reduce long-term debt.

During 2003, 2002 and 2001, 64,505,
91,049 and 36,236 shares, respectively, of Class A Common Stock were converted into Common
Stock. Regular dividends paid on the Class A Common Stock and Common Stock amounted to
$.58, $.54 and $.52 per share in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

At December 31, 2003, 32,595 and
3,270,754, shares of Class A Common Stock and Common Stock, respectively, were held as
treasury stock. At December 31, 2002, 32,595 and 3,476,844 shares of Class A Common Stock
and Common Stock, respectively, were held as treasury stock.

11.    Stock Options

The company adopted the A. O. Smith
Combined Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (the “plan”) effective January 1,
2002. The plan supercedes and replaces two predecessor incentive compensation plans. The
plan provides for the issuance of 1.5 million stock options at exercise prices equal to
the fair value of Common Stock on the date of grant. Additionally, any shares that would
have been available for stock option grants under either of the predecessor plans, if such
plans were in effect, will be available for granting of stock option awards under the
plan. The options granted become exercisable one year from date of grant and, for active
employees, expire ten years after date of grant. The number of shares available for
granting of options at December 31, 2003, was 990,350.

Participants may also be awarded
shares of restricted stock under the plan. The company granted 49,100 and 49,000 shares of
restricted Common Stock under the plan in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The restricted
shares were valued at $1.4 million and $1.3 million at the date of issuance in 2003 and
2002, respectively, and will be recognized as compensation expense ratably over the
three-year vesting period. Compensation expense of $0.6 and $0.1 million was recognized in
2003 and 2002, respectively.

12.    Pension and Other
Post-retirement Benefits

The company provides retirement
benefits for all United States employees including benefits for employees of discontinued
operations which were earned up to the date of sale. Plan assets consist primarily of
marketable equities and debt securities. The company also has several foreign pension
plans, none of which are material to the company’s financial position.

The company has a
defined-contribution profit sharing and retirement plan covering the majority of its
salaried nonunion employees which provides for annual company contributions of 35 percent
to 140 percent of qualifying contributions made by participating employees. The amount of
the company’s contribution in excess of 35 percent is dependent upon the
company’s profitability. The company also has defined-contribution plans for certain
hourly employees which provide for annual matching company contributions.

The company has several unfunded
defined-benefit post-retirement plans covering certain hourly and salaried employees that
provide medical and life insurance benefits from retirement to age 65. Certain hourly
employees retiring after January 1, 1996, are subject to a maximum annual benefit and
salaried employees hired after December 31, 1993, are not eligible for post-retirement
medical benefits.

allocation and historical long-term rates of return of equity and bond indices. The
company also considered its pension plan’s historical 10-year and 25-year compounded
annualized returns of 11.6 percent and 13.4 percent, respectively.

No provision for U.S. income taxes or
foreign withholding taxes has been made on the undistributed earnings of foreign
subsidiaries as such earnings are considered to be permanently invested. At
December 31, 2003, the undistributed earnings amounted to $69.3 million.
Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on the undistributed
earnings is not practicable. In addition, no provision or benefit for U.S. income taxes
have been made on foreign currency translation gains or losses.

As a result of the acquisition of
State, the company has $6.8 million of federal capital loss carryovers that expire in 2006
and $3.7 million of tax credits, the majority of which have an unlimited carryover period.
Due to the change in State ownership, the annual limitation for utilization of the federal
net operating loss carryovers is the equivalent of $2.2 million of deductions.

The company also has approximately
$140 million of state and local net operating loss carryovers. The majority of these
carryovers expire between 2010 and 2023.

14.    Litigation and
Insurance Matters

The company is involved in various
unresolved legal actions, administrative proceedings, and claims in the ordinary course of
its business involving product liability, property damage, insurance coverage, patents,
and environmental matters, including the disposal of hazardous waste. Although it is not
possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions or the
range of possible loss or recovery, the company believes these unresolved legal actions
will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. The
following paragraphs summarize noteworthy actions and proceedings.


14.    Litigation and
Insurance Matters (continued)

In 1999, a class action lawsuit was
filed in the United States District Court, Western District of Missouri, by individuals on
behalf of themselves and all persons throughout the United States who have owned or
currently own a water heater manufactured by Rheem Manufacturing Company, A. O. Smith
Corporation, Bradford White Company, American Water Heater Company, Lochinvar Corporation
and State Industries, Inc. (the “water heater manufacturers”) that contains a
dip tube manufactured, designed, supplied, or sold by Perfection Corporation between
August 1993 and October 1996. A dip tube is a plastic tube in a residential water heater
that brings the cold water supply to the bottom area of the tank to be heated. The
plaintiffs and the water heater manufacturers reached a settlement of this lawsuit which
the Court approved in 2000. The water heater manufacturers paid the settlement, and all
other legal actions brought against the water heater manufacturers related to dip tube
claims have been dismissed as a result of the settlement of the class action.

Separately, the water heater
manufacturers in late 1999 filed a direct action lawsuit in the Civil District Court for
the Parish of Orleans, State of Louisiana, against Perfection Corporation and American
Meter Company, the parent company of Perfection, and their insurers. This lawsuit seeks
(1) recovery of damages sustained by the water heater manufacturers related to the costs
of the class action settlement and the handling of dip tube claims outside of and prior to
the national class action settlement, (2) damages for the liability of the water heater
manufacturers assumed by Perfection Corporation by contract and (3) personal injuries
suffered by the water heater manufacturers as a result of the disparagement of their
businesses. Also relating to the water heater manufacturers’ recovery efforts, the
insurers of Perfection Corporation have brought third-party claims against the water
heater manufacturers in a state court action in Cook County, Illinois. This action has
been stayed by order of the Court.

Perfection Corporation has also sued
the water heater manufacturers in a separate action in Cook County, Illinois. The filing
by Perfection Corporation is an attempt to preempt the Louisiana lawsuit. This action has
been stayed by order of the Court.

As of December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, the company recorded a long-term receivable of $34.0 million (as detailed
below) related to dip tube repair claims, administrative costs, legal fees and related
expenses.

It is the company’s expectation
that all or a substantial portion of its costs will be recovered from Perfection
Corporation, American Meter Company and their insurers, as well as the company’s
insurers. The water heater manufacturers have negotiated settlements with 11 insurers of
Perfection Corporation and American Meter Company with the proceeds of the settlements
being placed in escrow. Negotiating opportunities with Perfection Corporation, American
Meter Company and the two remaining insurance company defendants in the lawsuit continues
to be available. Management also believes the two defendant companies have the financial
ability to pay a judgment. The Company has initiated the claim process with the
company’s insurers and reasonably believes that, if necessary, coverage provisions
would apply. Management also believes the two insurance companies have the financial
ability to pay a judgment.

The company is currently involved as
a potentially responsible party (PRP) in judicial and administrative proceedings initiated
on behalf of various state and federal regulatory agencies seeking to clean up 11 sites
which have been environmentally impacted (the “sites”) and to recover costs they
have incurred or will incur as to the sites. In 2003, remediation at one such site was
completed and the company entered into a

de minimis

settlement agreement with the
United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The company has fulfilled its
obligations under the agreement and will have no further liability at the site. In the
fourth quarter of 2003, the company was notified that it has been identified as a

de
minimis

party at a new site in Indiana. Based on


14.    Litigation and
Insurance Matters, continued

information available concerning its
involvement at the site, the company expects to have minimal liability for remediation of
the site.

It is impossible at this time to
estimate the total cost of remediation for the sites or the company’s ultimate share
of those costs, primarily because the sites are in various stages of the remediation
process and issues remain open at many sites concerning the selection and implementation
of the final remedy, the cost of that remedy and the company’s liability at a site
relative to the liability and viability of the other PRPs. The company has established
reserves for the sites in a manner that is consistent with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States for costs associated with such cleanups when those costs are
capable of being reasonably estimated. To the best of the company’s knowledge, the
reserves it has established, $1.1 and $1.8 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, and insurance proceeds that are available to the company are sufficient to
cover the company’s liability. The company further believes its insurers have the
financial ability to pay any such covered claims, and there are viable PRPs at each of the
sites which have the financial ability to pay their respective shares of liability at the
sites. The company believes that any environmental claims in excess of reserves, insurance
proceeds and indemnified amounts would not result in a material change in its results of
operations, financial condition or liquidity.

In addition to those sites, the
company is involved in two other environmental matters. The first is a matter the company
previously reported which involves a former mine in Colorado that is being remediated by
the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The State of Colorado appealed
the trial court’s decision to dismiss the State’s claims against the company to
recover its costs associated with remediation of the mine site. The Court of Appeals
reversed the order dismissing those claims and remanded the matter back to the trial
court. The company believes that the claims against it will ultimately be dismissed
because the company was neither an

“owner”

nor

“operator”

of the site, but was merely a stockholder in a mining
corporation that worked the mine from 1936 to 1942. As such, it has no liability under
applicable environmental laws to the State or any other party. The second matter involves
a notification by a private party that it intends to bring a lawsuit against the company
and other companies involved in mining operations in Colorado that caused damage to the
private party’s land. Since the company was merely a stockholder in mining
corporations that worked the mines involved in this claim from 1936 to 1942, it expects
that any claims brought against it by the private party property owner will also be
ultimately dismissed.

With respect to non-environmental
claims, the company has self-insured a portion of its product liability loss exposure and
other business risks for many years. The company has established reserves which it
believes are adequate to cover incurred claims. For the year ended December 31, 2003,
the company had $125 million of third-party product liability insurance for individual
losses in excess of $3 million and for aggregate annual losses in excess of $65 million.
The company periodically reevaluates its exposure on claims and makes adjustments to its
reserves as appropriate.

15.    Operations by Segment

The company has two reportable
segments: Electrical Products and Water Systems. The Electrical Products segment
manufactures fractional horsepower alternating current (A/C) and direct current (D/C) and
integral horsepower motors used in fans and blowers in furnaces, air conditioners and
ventilating systems; industrial applications such as material handling; as well as in
other consumer products such as home appliances and pumps, swimming pools, hot tubs and
spas. In addition, the Electrical Products segment manufactures hermetic motors which are
sold worldwide to manufacturers of compressors used in air conditioning and refrigeration
systems. The Water Systems segment manufactures residential gas and electric water heaters
as well as commercial water heating equipment used in a wide range of applications
including hotels, laundries, car washes, factories and large institutions. In addition,
the Water Systems segment manufactures copper tube boilers used in large-volume hot water
and hydronic heating applications.


15.    Operations by Segment (continued)

The accounting policies of the
reportable segments are the same as those described in the “Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies” outlined in Note 1. Intersegment sales have been excluded from
segment revenues and are immaterial. Operating earnings, defined by the company as
earnings before interest, taxes, general corporate and corporate research and development
expenses, is used to measure the performance of the segments and allocate resources.

Net sales of the Electrical Products
segment includes sales to York International Corporation of $157.3, $173.3 and $171.9
million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
