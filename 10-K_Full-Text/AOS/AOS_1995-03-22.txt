   OEM PRODUCTS

   Automotive Products

   Automotive sales in 1994 of $722.7 million, or 53 percent of total
   corporation revenues, increased over 19 percent from previous year sales
   due to continued strength in the North American market for both the light
   and heavy truck segments.  As a result of increased volume, Automotive
   Products showed improved operating profits over 1993.

   Automotive Products has contracts, some of which are subject to economic
   price adjustments, to supply frame assemblies and components to Ford,
   Chrysler and General Motors in the passenger car and light truck class. 
   Because of the importance of light vehicle sales to this unit, it is
   affected by general business conditions in the North American automotive
   industry.  The company is also a supplier of truck frames to most domestic
   producers of medium and heavy-duty trucks, such as Ford, Navistar
   International, General Motors, Freightliner and Paccar.

   The largest product group within Automotive Products continues to be truck
   frames and components which accounted for slightly more than 77 percent of
   Automotive Products' sales and almost 41 percent of the corporation's
   revenues.  The company continues to hold its lead position in truck frame
   manufacturing in the United States and Canada, supplying over 30 percent
   of the 1994 market.

   In 1994, the Granite City, Illinois, plant began shipping engine cradles
   for a new Ford Windstar mini-van and Lincoln Continental, and for the new
   Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique.  The Milan, Tennessee, plant began
   building trailing axles for the Ford mini-van and a new structural
   assembly for Toyota U.S.A.

   In 1995, the company plans three new product programs and two major
   vehicle redesign programs including; full-frame assemblies for the
   Chevrolet Tahoe/GMC Yukon and the extended cab version of the Dodge Ram
   pickup truck; side rail assemblies for a new Nissan pickup truck; side
   rails for a new Ford class 8 truck; and new engine cradles for the 1996
   model year Ford Taurus/Mercury Sable.

   In February 1995, the company announced it had signed a letter of intent
   with China First Auto Works Corporation to form a joint venture company to
   manufacture automotive structural products for China's automobile market. 
   The two organizations are currently preparing a feasibility study and
   depending upon the outcome of the study, the new joint venture company
   could begin production in January of 1997.  Although details of the joint
   venture remain to be worked out, A. O. Smith would be the majority
   ownership partner.

   The company's products are sold in highly competitive markets with its
   principal competitors including Dana Corporation, Magna International, and
   vertically integrated units of Ford, Chrysler and General Motors.

   The following table summarizes sales to the company's three largest
   automotive customers:

                             Years Ended December 31 (Dollars in Millions)

   Electrical Products

   The corporation's sales of electric motors which are included in the OEM
   Product segment totalled $281.2 million, or 20 percent of total
   corporation revenues in 1994.  This represents an increase of over 15
   percent above the previous year's sales of $242.5 million.  The heating,
   ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) industry entered 1994 with
   relatively low finished goods inventories, so that sales growth translated
   into increased demand for motors.  Electrical Products was able to take
   further advantage of the strong HVAC market by securing additional
   business in the room air conditioning industry.  Sales of hermetic
   compressor motors and fractional horsepower fan and blower motors grew
   significantly over the prior year.

   With its transfer of production to lower cost plants largely complete,
   Electrical Products' operations contributed substantially to the company's
   improved profits.  Its plants were able to handle the higher volumes
   without a disproportionate increase in costs, holding fixed costs at 1993
   levels.  Notable improvements came from the Mebane, North Carolina, plant,
   which completed the transfer of hermetic motor production early in 1994
   and was able to increase output and on-time performance throughout the
   year.  The company's Mexican operations set unit production records in
   1994. 

   Product lines include jet pump motors sold to manufacturers of home water
   systems, swimming pools, hot tubs and spas plus fan motors used in
   furnaces, air conditioners, and ceiling fans as well as fractional
   horsepower motors used in other consumer products.  Hermetic motors are
   sold to U.S. manufacturers of compressors and are used in air conditioning
   and refrigeration systems.  In addition to selling its products directly
   to OEMs, Electrical Products also markets its products through a
   distributor network which sells to both OEMs and the related after-market. 
   Over 50% of the market is derived from the less cyclical replacement
   business with the remainder being impacted by general business conditions
   in the new construction market.

   The company's principal products are sold in highly competitive markets
   with its major competitors being Emerson Electric, General Electric,
   Magnetek, Inc., Fasco, and vertically integrated customers.


   WATER PRODUCTS

   Sales in 1994 were a record $271.5 million which represented 20 percent of
   total corporation revenues.  Sales were up over nine percent compared to
   1993 sales of $248.1 million, as the company gained market share in both
   residential and commercial water heaters.  Operating profits also set new
   highs, establishing a record for the fourth time in five years.

   Water Products markets residential gas and electric water heaters through
   a diverse network of plumbing wholesalers.  More than 80 percent of Water
   Products' sales is in the less cyclical replacement market although the
   new housing market is an important segment as well.  The residential water
   heater market remains highly competitive with Water Products and three
   other manufacturers supplying over 90 percent of market requirements.

   Water Products markets commercial water heating systems through a diverse
   network of plumbing wholesalers and manufacturers' representatives. 
   Commercial water heating systems are used in a wide range of applications
   including schools, nursing homes, hospitals, prisons, hotels, motels,
   laundries, restaurants, stadiums, amusement parks, car washes, and other
   large users of hot water.  The commercial market is characterized by
   competition from a broader range of products and competitors than occurs
   in the residential market.

   Water Products Company has signed a joint venture letter of intent to
   explore the feasibility of manufacturing water heaters in China.

   The principal competitors in the Water Products segment are Rheem
   Manufacturing, State Industries, Bradford-White and The American Water
   Heater Group (formerly SABH, Inc.).  Water Products believes it continues
   to be the largest manufacturer of commercial water heaters and is closing
   on being the third largest manufacturer of residential water heaters in
   the United States.

   FIBERGLASS PRODUCTS

   Sales of Smith Fiberglass Products Inc. totaled $57.9 million in 1994;
   down slightly from 1993 sales of $58.9 million.  The company overcame
   weakness in the domestic oil industry, increased competition in the
   important service station market, and a dearth of large orders to post
   this performance.  In 1994, the company was able to record profits
   comparable to 1993 even though 1993 benefitted from a one-time gain
   related to a recovery in a patent infringement suit. 

   Smith Fiberglass manufactures reinforced thermosetting resin piping used
   to carry corrosive materials.  Typical applications include chemical and
   industrial plant piping, oil field piping, and underground distribution at
   gasoline service stations.  Smith Fiberglass also manufactures high
   pressure fiberglass piping systems used in the petroleum production
   industry.  Its products are sold through a network of distributors.

   Smith Fiberglass installed a number of test lines in oil fields in
   northeastern China, and the possibility of a joint venture could become a
   reality in 1995.  

   Smith Fiberglass has two principal competitors which are Ameron
   Corporation and Fibercast Company.


   AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS

   Agricultural Products includes Harvestore and AgriStor.  Harvestore sales
   in 1994 were $37.4 million, which were about 12 percent higher than 1993
   sales of $33.3 million.  The increase was attributable to demand for water
   and agricultural waste storage systems due to growing environmental
   concerns.  Harvestore's operating profits improved due to the higher
   volumes.  AgriStor revenues in 1994 were $2.9 million, down 40 percent
   from $4.8 million in 1993.  The lower revenues resulted from a decline in
   the size of AgriStor's lending portfolio and represents management's
   continued progress toward its goal to downsize the agricultural finance
   business.  Agricultural Products sustained a pretax loss of $5.8 million
   between Harvestore and AgriStor operations which includes additional
   reserve provisions taken during the year.  The net after-tax loss for the
   agricultural businesses was $.17 per share for both 1994 and 1993.

   Harvestore manufactures and markets agricultural feed storage and handling
   systems, and industrial and potable water and bulk storage systems. 
   Harvestore products are distributed through a network of independent
   dealers.  AgriStor assists farm customers in the financing of
   Harvestore/R/ equipment out of offices in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Columbus,
   Ohio; and Memphis, Tennessee.

   Raw Material

   Raw materials for the corporation's operations, which consist primarily of
   steel, copper and aluminum, are generally available from several sources
   in adequate quantities.

   Seasonality

   The corporation's third quarter revenues and earnings have traditionally
   been lower than the other quarters due to Automotive Products' model year
   changeovers and customer plant shutdowns.

   Research and Development, Patents and Trademarks

   The corporation conducts new product and process development at its
   Corporate Technology Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and at its operating
   unit locations.  The objective of this activity is to increase the
   competitiveness of A. O. Smith and generate new products to fit the
   corporation's market knowledge.  Total expenditures for research and
   development in 1994, 1993 and 1992 were approximately $9.2 million, $7.6
   million, and $6.5 million, respectively.

   The corporation owns and uses in its businesses various trademarks, trade
   names, patents, trade secrets, and licenses.  While a number of these are
   important to the corporation, it does not consider a material part of its
   business to be dependent on any one of them.

   Employees

   The corporation and its subsidiaries employed approximately 12,100 persons
   in its operations as of December 31, 1994.  During 1995, a number of labor
   contracts are scheduled to be negotiated.  The majority of these contracts
   are related to the Automotive Products Company.

   Backlog

   Normally none of the corporation's operations sustain significant
   backlogs.  However, the Automotive Products Company has long term
   contracts to supply parts to the large auto and truck manufacturers.

   Environmental Laws

   Compliance with federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of
   materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of
   the environment has not had a material effect and is not expected to have
   a material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive
   position of the corporation.  See ITEM 3.

   Foreign Sales

   Total export sales from the U.S. were $114 million, $71 million, and $48
   million in 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.  The increase in export
   sales from 1993 to 1994 was largely attributable to increased Automotive
   Products Company exports to Canada.  The amount of revenue and operating
   profit derived from, or the assets attributable to, sales outside the
   North American geographic area are not a substantial portion of total
   corporation operations.


   ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES

   The corporation manufactures its products in 35 locations worldwide. 
   These facilities have an aggregate floor space of approximately 8,930,000
   square feet and are owned by the corporation with the exception of the
   following leased facilities:  three Automotive Products plants, including
   a plant of approximately 149,000 square feet in Corydon, Indiana, a plant
   of approximately 123,000 square feet in Rockford, Illinois and a third
   plant of approximately 41,000 square feet located in Barrie, Ontario,
   Canada; a Water Products Company plant with floor space of approximately
   84,000 square feet located in Seattle, Washington and a second plant of
   approximately 100,000 square feet in El Paso, Texas; and a Smith
   Fiberglass plant in Little Rock, Arkansas, with floor space of
   approximately 45,000 square feet.  A 258,000 square foot facility for the

   foot facility for the Automotive Products Company in Milan, Tennessee, and
   a 263,000 square foot facility for the Smith Fiberglass plant in Little
   Rock, Arkansas are being acquired on a lease-purchase basis and have been
   capitalized for accounting purposes.

   Of the corporation's facilities, thirteen are foreign plants with
   approximately 1,145,000 square feet of space, including approximately
   442,000 square feet which are leased.

   The manufacturing plants presently operated by the corporation are listed
   below by industry segment.  This data excludes five plants operated by a
   Mexican affiliate.

   equipment, winding machines, and furnace and painting equipment.  The
   corporation regards its plant and equipment as well-maintained and
   adequate for its needs.  Multishift operations are used where necessary.


   ITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS


   As of December 31, 1994, the corporation and A. O. Smith Harvestore
   Products, Inc. (Harvestore), a subsidiary of the corporation, were
   defendants in 23 cases alleging damages for economic losses claimed to
   have arisen out of alleged defects in Harvestore animal feed storage
   equipment.  Some plaintiffs are seeking punitive as well as compensatory
   damages.  The corporation believes that a significant number of these
   claims were related to the deteriorated general farm economy, including
   those filed in 1994.  In 1994, seven new cases were filed and ten cases
   were concluded.  The corporation and Harvestore continue to vigorously
   defend these cases.

   Two of the 23 pending cases contain class action allegations.  One of the
   cases is a New York State court action which names the corporation,
   Harvestore, and two of its dealers as defendants.  The court has not
   certified the class and has granted the defendants' motions dismissing
   some of the plaintiffs' allegations.  The plaintiffs are appealing the
   court's rulings.

   The second case is pending in the Federal District Court for the Southern
   District of Ohio.  It was filed in August 1992 and the court, in March
   1994, conditionally certified it as a class action on behalf of purchasers
   and lessees of Harvestore structures manufactured by the corporation and
   Harvestore.  A Notice of the certification was mailed to the purported
   class members in the third quarter of 1994, with approximately 5,500 "opt
   out" forms being filed with the court by the August 31, 1994 deadline, the
   impact of which is unknown.  Discovery in the case is ongoing and a trial
   of the liability issues only is scheduled to begin on October 16, 1995. 
   Damages would be tried at a later date and only after a liability finding.

   Based on the facts currently available to management and its prior
   experience with lawsuits alleging damages for economic loss resulting from
   use of the Harvestore animal feed storage equipment, management is
   confident that the class action suits can be defeated and that the
   lawsuits do not represent a material threat to the corporation.  The
   corporation believes that any damages, including any punitive damages,
   arising out of the pending cases are adequately covered by insurance and
   recorded reserves.  No range of reasonably possible losses can be
   estimated because, in most instances, the complaint is silent as to the
   amount of the claim or states it as an unspecified amount in excess of the
   jurisdictional minimum.  The corporation reevaluates its exposure
   periodically and makes adjustment of its reserves as appropriate.

   A lawsuit for damages and declaratory judgments in the Circuit Court of
   Milwaukee County, State of Wisconsin, in which the corporation and
   Harvestore are plaintiffs is pending against three insurance companies for
   failure to pay in accordance with liability insurance policies issued to
   the corporation.  The insurers have failed to pay, in full or in part,
   certain judgments, settlements, and defense costs incurred in connection
   with pending and closed lawsuits alleging damages for economic losses
   claimed to have arisen out of alleged defects in Harvestore animal feed
   storage equipment.  While the corporation has, in part, assumed
   applicability of this coverage, an adverse judgment should not be material
   to its financial condition.

   As part of its routine business operations, the corporation disposes of
   and recycles or reclaims certain industrial waste materials, chemicals and
   solvents at disposal and recycling facilities which are licensed by
   appropriate federal, state and local agencies.  In some instances, when
   those facilities are operated such that hazardous substances contaminate
   the soil and groundwater, the United States Environmental Protection
   Agency ("EPA") will designate the contaminated sites as Superfund sites,
   and will designate those parties which are believed to have contributed
   hazardous materials to the sites as potentially responsible parties
   ("PRPs").  Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
   and Liability Act ("CERCLA" or the "Superfund" law) and similar state
   laws, each PRP that contributes hazardous substances to a Superfund site
   is jointly and severally liable for the costs associated with cleaning up
   the site.  Typically, PRPs negotiate with the EPA and those state
   environmental agencies that are involved in the matter regarding the
   selection and implementation of a plan to clean up the Superfund site and
   the terms and conditions under which the PRPs will be involved in process. 
   PRPs also negotiate with each other regarding allocation of each PRP's
   share of the clean up costs.
     
   The corporation has compiled information regarding the cost to clean up
   all of the sites where the corporation has been designated a PRP by the
   EPA or a comparable state agency.  The following estimates include amounts
   that have already been spent at the sites and estimates of amounts that
   will be spent to complete remediation activities.  The corporation
   estimates that the total cost to clean up all of the sites is
   approximately $252.5 million.  The corporation's estimate of the portion
   of the total for which the corporation is or may be responsible is
   approximately $4.3 million, of which $3.5 million has already been paid by
   the corporation and its insurance companies.  The balance of the estimated
   cleanup costs is believed to be adequately covered by insurance and
   reserves which have been established by the corporation.  To the best of
   the corporation's knowledge, the insurers have the financial ability to
   pay any such covered claims, and the corporation has not incorporated any
   insurance proceeds in the calculation of its reserves for which recovery
   is not considered probable.  The corporation reevaluates its exposure
   periodically and makes adjustment of its reserves as appropriate.  With
   the exception of the former mining site in Colorado discussed below, the
   amount allocated to the corporation at any specific site, or in the
   aggregate for all sites, is not expected to be material.  A judgment as to
   materiality of the corporation's exposure at the former mining site in
   Colorado is premature given the early stage of the investigation, the
   uncertainty regarding appropriate remediation and its costs, and the
   potential liability of governmental agencies in this case.  Accordingly,
   it is impossible at this time to reasonably estimate the corporation's
   liability at this site, if any.

   The corporation is currently involved as a PRP in judicial and
   administrative proceedings initiated on behalf of the EPA seeking to clean
   up the environment at fifteen Superfund sites and to recover costs the EPA
   has or will incur as a result of the clean up.   Certain state
   environmental agencies have also asserted claims to recover their clean up
   costs in some of these actions.  The sites are as follows:

       Two separate sites in Kentucky involving related storage and disposal
       facilities.  Proceedings were commenced on behalf of the EPA in the
       United States District Court for the District of Kentucky, Louisville
       Division in March 1988 with respect to these sites.  A consent decree
       allocating liability among the PRPs for costs of remediation at the
       sites and the response costs of the EPA and the Commonwealth of
       Kentucky was executed by the corporation in September 1993.  The
       consent decree was lodged by the Court in 1994 and the corporation
       paid the entire amount allocated to it as its share of the clean up
       costs.  The corporation remains liable for a share of the cost
       overruns, but none are anticipated at this time.

       A site in Indiana used for storage, treatment, recycling, and disposal
       of waste chemicals.  In January 1984, the Company and several other
       PRPs became parties to an action that had been pending in the United
       States District Court for the District of Indiana since January 1980
       regarding this site.  In July 1988, the corporation executed a consent
       decree allocating liability among the PRPs for costs of remediation at
       the site and the EPA's response costs.  Remediation is well underway
       at the site.

       A municipal landfill in Michigan is the subject of a proceeding that
       was filed on behalf of the EPA in the United States District Court for
       the Western District of Michigan in this case in April 1991.  In 1994,
       the EPA became concerned that conditions at the site may be
       deteriorating and required that actions be taken to remove the point
       source contaminants immediately.  The actions the EPA required were
       taken and the point source contaminants were removed by the end of
       1994.  Work to determine the extent to which a long term groundwater
       remedy may be required will be undertaken in 1995.

       A county owned incinerator, ash disposal lagoon, and landfill in Ohio. 
       A proceeding was commenced on behalf of the EPA in the United States
       District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Western Division
       regarding this site in December 1989.  The final remedy has been
       selected and the consent decree, which was executed by the PRPs and
       the EPA, was entered by the Court in March 1993.  Work on the remedy
       began shortly after the consent decree was entered and has been
       progressing on schedule.

       An industrial and municipal waste landfill in Wisconsin.  Separate
       proceedings were commenced on behalf of the EPA and the State of
       Wisconsin in the United States District Court for the Eastern District
       of Wisconsin in November 1991 relative to this site.  The two actions
       were consolidated into a single matter in 1992.  The consent decree
       entered into by the PRPs, the EPA, and the State of Wisconsin divides
       the site into two operable units, the first of which deals with soil
       remediation and an interim groundwater remedy and the second of which
       is anticipated to deal with the long term groundwater remedy.  The cap
       on the landfill was completed in 1994 and work on the interim
       groundwater remedy is underway.  At this time, the extent to which
       long term groundwater treatment will be required with respect to the
       second operable unit has not been determined.

       A drum disposal site in Wisconsin.  In September 1992, the corporation
       joined a group of PRPs that attempted to negotiate with other PRPs and
       the EPA to come to agreement as to the respective liabilities of the
       PRPs involved at the site, the implementation of a plan to clean up
       the site, and the terms and conditions under which the PRPs would be
       involved in the process.  In May 1993, after those negotiations
       stalled, the EPA issued an order to 17 of the PRPs, one of which was
       the corporation, under Section 106 of CERCLA requiring them to take
       certain measures to clean up the site.  Since then, negotiations
       resumed and settlement was reached among the PRPs with respect to
       some, but not all of the issues related to liability under the Section
       106 order.  In 1994, the cap on the landfill was completed and
       construction of the groundwater monitoring and treatment system began.

       A former mining site in Colorado.  The corporation held the majority
       of stock of a Colorado mining operation for a period of time beginning
       in 1936 and ending in 1942.  Because of that stock ownership, the
       corporation was notified by the EPA in March 1993 that it is a PRP at
       the site.  Estimates of clean up costs at this site have been as high
       as $120,000,000.  The corporation believes that a large majority of
       those costs relate to contamination caused by a corporation that
       worked the mine in the 1980s, and the EPA has indicated that it does
       not believe the corporation is responsible to remediate the damage
       caused by those operations.  The EPA is not bound by that initial
       determination and may seek to impose joint and several liability upon
       the PRPs at the site.  However, the corporation believes that it has
       valid defenses to any liability at this site.  

       A manufacturing facility in Indiana.  In January 1994, the corporation
       received a general notice of potential liability from the EPA
       concerning a plant site the corporation operated in Indiana for a
       brief period of time in the mid-1980s.  A viable business has a valid
       obligation to the corporation to investigate and remediate
       contamination at this site at the cost and expense of the other
       business and that business has been working with the EPA to remediate
       the facility.  The EPA has not required the corporation to take any
       action with respect to the site following the corporation's response
       to the EPA's initial requests for information about its involvement at
       the site.  Accordingly, the corporation intends to monitor activity at
       the facility, but does not anticipate further involvement at this
       time.

       A drum recycling facility.  In 1992, the EPA commenced an action
       against a small group of PRPs in the United States District Court for
       the Western District of Michigan to recover its response costs and
       require the PRPs to clean up a Superfund site in Michigan.  Those PRPs
       filed a motion for summary judgment in this matter claiming they were
       not responsible for cleaning up the site.  The Court granted the
       motion and the government has appealed.  Those PRPs had previously
       commenced a third party contribution action against approximately
       eighty other parties which were involved at the subject site but were
       not named as defendants in the EPA's action.  The corporation became a
       third party defendant to that action in January 1994.  If the summary
       judgment is upheld by the Court of Appeals, the action against the
       corporation and the other third party defendants will be dismissed.

   CERCLA provides that the EPA has authority to enter into de minimis
   settlement agreements with those PRPs that are believed to have
   contributed relatively small ("de minimis") amounts of materials to a
   Superfund site as compared to major contributors at the site.  The
   corporation has settled its liability at sites in Indiana and Arkansas as
   a de minimis party.  Under those settlement agreements, the corporation
   may have additional liability to participate in cleaning up the affected
   site under certain circumstances, such as: changes in the scope of
   remedial action are required to the extent that costs to clean up the site
   are substantially increased, or new information is discovered that
   indicates that the corporation contributed more or different materials to
   the site than was previously believed.  There is no information at this
   time which would indicate that the corporation will incur any material
   additional liability at either site.  Further, the corporation has joined
   with similarly situated PRPs to negotiate settlements as de minimis
   parties at three sites in Indiana and Illinois.

   Over the past several years, the corporation has self-insured a portion of
   its product liability loss exposure and other business risks.  The
   corporation has established reserves which it believes are adequate to
   cover incurred claims.  For the year ended December 31, 1994, the
   corporation had $60 million of third-party product liability insurance for
   individual losses in excess of $1.5 million and for aggregate losses in
   excess of $10 million.

   Statements.

   ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

   Financial Review

   A. O. Smith Corporation achieved record earnings of $57.3 million or $2.75
   per share in 1994 versus $42.7 million or $2.08 per share in 1993.
   Automotive Products, Electrical Products, and Water Products established
   new sales records in 1994. Details of individual unit performance will be
   discussed later in this section.

   Working capital at December 31, 1994 was $113.6 million compared to $80.7
   million and $62.6 million at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
   Higher sales in 1994 resulted in increased working capital requirements,
   particularly for accounts receivable, customer tooling, and inventory,
   which were modestly offset by a related increase in trade payables. Higher
   sales in 1993 versus 1992 also led to increased working capital
   requirements, particularly for accounts receivable and inventory, which
   were partially offset by related increases in trade payables and accrued
   wages and benefits.  

   Capital expenditures in 1994 were the highest ever recorded at $76.1
   million compared to $54.7 million in 1993 and $46.9 million in 1992.
   Production equipment acquired under a master operating lease agreement
   totalled $12.7 million in 1994, $10.9 million in 1993, and $8.1 million in
   1992. Capital spending increased in 1994 due to new Automotive Products
   Company programs.

   The corporation projects it will use approximately $80 million of
   internally generated funds and $10 million of production equipment leases
   to support 1995 capital acquisitions of $90 million. The majority of this
   money will be spent by Automotive Products Company to support new product
   programs.

   Long-term debt, excluding debt of the finance subsidiary, decreased from
   $148.9 million at the end of 1993 to $136.8 million at the end of 1994.
   The long-term debt of the finance subsidiary has been reduced from
   $41.7 million at December 31, 1993 to $29.4 million at December 31, 1994
   as the planned liquidation of AgriStor Credit corporation continued. As a
   result of these reduced debt levels and 1994 earnings, the debt-to-equity
   ratio, excluding the finance subsidiary, decreased from 55.2 percent at
   December 31, 1993 to 43.7 percent at the end of 1994. The corporation
   anticipates that, assuming no major acquisitions, debt and debt-to-equity
   levels will decline further during 1995.

   On April 5, 1994, a $12.5 million term loan automatically converted from
   an 8.9 percent fixed rate to a floating interest rate and the maturity was
   extended from April 1996 to April 1999. In addition, on June 15, 1994, the
   corporation put in place a $140 million revolving credit agreement which
   replaced a $115 million A. O. Smith facility and a $30 million AgriStor
   Credit Corporation facility. The term of the agreement was extended two
   years to April 3, 1998. The agreement contains lower fees, reduced
   borrowing rates, and fewer restrictive covenants.

   The corporation uses futures contracts to fix the cost of portions of its
   expected raw materials needs, primarily for copper and aluminum, with the
   objective of reducing risk due to market price fluctuations. In addition,
   the corporation enters into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize
   the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on its income. Differences
   between the corporation's fixed price and current market prices on raw
   materials contracts are included as part of inventory cost when the
   contracts mature. Differences between the corporation's fixed price and
   current market prices on currency contracts are recognized in the same
   period in which gains or losses from the transactions being hedged are
   recognized and, accordingly, no net gain or loss is realized when
   contracts mature. The corporation does not engage in speculation in its
   derivatives strategies. The effect of these programs was not material on
   the results of operations for 1994, 1993, or 1992.  

   At the present time, the corporation is not a party to any contracts to
   manage its exposure to interest rate changes related to its borrowing. The
   corporation does not expect interest rate movements to significantly
   affect its liquidity or operating results in the foreseeable future. At
   December 31, 1994, the corporation's floating rate debt amounted to 43
   percent of its total obligations, including lease obligations.

   At its December 13, 1994 meeting, the A. O. Smith Corporation Board of
   Directors proposed an increase in the amounts of authorized Common and
   Class A Stock to 60 million and 14 million shares respectively. This
   proposal was made in light of the limitations of the corporation's current
   authorizations and to provide for flexibility in potential future
   financing. The proposal will be submitted to shareholders for a vote at
   the corporation's regular annual meeting to be held on April 5, 1995.

   On December 14, 1994, the A. O. Smith Common Stock (SMC) moved from the
   American Stock Exchange back to the New York Stock Exchange after an
   absence of ten years. This move was made to enhance the recognition of the
   corporation's Common Stock.  

   At its April 14, 1994 meeting, A. O. Smith Corporation's Board of
   Directors increased the regular quarterly dividend by 18 percent to $.13
   per share on its common stocks (Class A and Common) for the last three
   quarterly dividend payments of 1994, resulting in a total of $.50 per
   share being paid versus $.42 per share in 1993. A. O. Smith Corporation
   has paid dividends on its common stock for 55 consecutive years.

   Results of Operations

   Revenues in 1994 were $1.37 billion establishing a record and surpassing
   1993 revenues of $1.19 billion by 15 percent and 1992 revenues of $1.05
   billion by 30 percent.  Revenues in all of the corporation's product
   operations increased significantly in 1994 with the exception of
   Fiberglass Products where sales were slightly less than 1993.  The impact
   of a strong economy and excellent customer demand was particularly evident
   in the OEM segment of the corporation, which is comprised of the
   Automotive Products and Electrical Products companies and accounted for
   over 86 percent of the increased revenues in 1994.

   The corporation's gross profit margin in 1994 was 15.4 percent, reflecting
   a trend of continued improvement from gross margins of 14.9 percent, 13.6
   percent, and 11.1 percent in 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively.  The
   combination of increased volume and improved manufacturing efficiencies at
   Electrical Products was the major impetus to the increased margin. 
   Overtime and other costs to meet higher volumes along with higher new
   product launch costs at Automotive prevented additional growth in its 1994
   margin.

   The Automotive Products Company achieved record sales of $722.7 million in
   1994 surpassing the previous record of $606.3 million established in 1993
   by $116.4 million or 19.2 percent.  Sales in 1992 were $527.6 million. 
   The reasons for the record setting performance were twofold.  First, the
   North American automotive market experienced its best year since 1988
   despite rising interest rates and limited inventories of popular models. 
   As in the recent past, strong sales of light trucks in this market
   resulted in sustained demand for full frame assemblies and other light
   truck-related products manufactured by the Automotive Products Company. 
   Second, significant growth within the heavy truck industry resulted in
   near-capacity production schedules for the company to meet the demand for
   heavy truck frame rails.

   Operating profits at Automotive were higher in 1994 than 1993, and have
   been trending upward since 1991.  Although profits improved in 1994, the
   increase was substantially less than might be expected when considering
   the significant increase in Automotive's volume.  The impact of costs
   associated with the launch of new product programs and other major model
   revisions adversely affected profit margins.  The heavy order volume and
   associated costs required to meet very high customer demand at the
   manufacturing plants resulted in a further erosion of margins.  The
   company continues to aggressively address production capacity
   considerations, and, as the life cycle of new product programs progresses,
   margins should improve.

   Automotive continues to benefit from being a supplier for vehicles that
   have been well-received by the car-buying public.  The outlook for 1995
   suggests that it will be as challenging as 1994, with three new product
   programs and two major vehicle redesign efforts scheduled.  Although
   margins on existing product should improve in 1995, the heavy schedule of
   new product introductions may initially have an adverse impact on overall
   margins in 1995.  As 1995 progresses, expanded capacities should help
   alleviate this pressure.

   Late last year, the company was informed that it would not be
   participating in the GMT-800 program which is the replacement business for
   General Motors' light trucks and represents less than 10 percent of the
   corporation's business.  The loss of this business affects the 1999 model
   year with the full impact not being recognized by the company until the
   year 2000.  The company is confident that this business can be replaced
   with other programs that exist with domestic and international customers.

   Equity in the earnings of the corporation's 40 percent owned Mexican
   affiliate, Metalsa S.A., was $1.6 million in 1994 compared to $2.3 million
   and $3.5 million in 1993 and 1992, respectively.  In 1994, Metalsa's sales
   were approximately the same as the prior year as the Mexican economy
   remained weak.  Earnings in 1994 were lower than 1993 due to restructuring
   and product launch costs.  Due to lower sales, product mix, and
   restructuring costs, 1993 earnings were lower than 1992.  The net assets
   of Metalsa are translated in U.S. dollars using current exchange rates,
   with the resulting translation adjustments reflected as a separate
   component of stockholders' equity.  Due to the decline in the value of the
   peso in late 1994,  the corporation recorded a translation adjustment in
   1994 of $7.5 million.  There were no similar adjustments in 1993, as the
   value of the peso was fairly constant.  Metalsa has a program in place to
   hedge certain of its accounts denominated in foreign currencies.  To the
   extent foreign currency exposures are not hedged by Metalsa in 1995,
   further erosion of the value of the peso will result in transaction
   losses, its share of which the corporation would include in earnings.

   It appears as if the Mexican automotive industry may experience a
   significant decline in sales in 1995.  Metalsa is taking steps to deal
   with this possibility including reducing its labor force.  The corporation
   anticipates that its equity in earnings will be lower in 1995.  At this
   time, given the uncertainties surrounding the Mexican economy, it is
   difficult to project the extent to which earnings may be reduced.

   1994 was a turnaround year for the Electrical Products Company.  Sales in
   1994 increased $38.7 million or almost 16 percent to a record $281.2
   million from 1993 sales of $242.5 million.  Sales in 1992 were
   $225.6 million.  Many of the markets that utilize electric motors in their
   products experienced a significant recovery in 1994.  Enhancing the impact
   of this recovery was the relatively low finished goods inventory level at
   which some of these markets entered 1994.  This favorable impact was
   especially noticeable in the heating, ventilating, and air conditioning
   market, where sales growth resulted in increased demand for electric
   motors due to the lack of inventory.  Sales of air conditioning units were
   further bolstered by the combination of increased housing starts in early
   1994 and warm summer weather resulting in record unit volume.  Favorable
   general economic conditions resulted in substantial growth in most of the
   other segments of the business, including motors for garage door openers,
   pumps, and swimming pools and spas.  Sales of replacement motors increased
   significantly due to new merchandising and inventory strategies employed
   by the company.  Exports were also a source of increased revenues for
   Electrical Products as aggressive pursuit of the international markets
   continued in 1994.

   Profits for the Electrical Products Company in 1994 were substantially
   higher than the depressed earnings recorded in 1993 and over 75 percent
   higher than 1992 earnings.  Earnings in 1993 were adversely impacted by
   several million dollars of costs associated with transferring motor
   production to lower cost facilities.  The significantly improved earnings
   performance of Electrical Products was the direct result of increased
   volume coupled with the completion of the aforementioned program, which
   transferred production and greatly reduced manufacturing costs.

   Current projections for 1995 are positive as first quarter orders are at
   higher levels than the same period last year.

   Sales for the Water Products Company established a record for the third
   consecutive year in 1994, increasing more than nine percent to $271.5
   million from the previous record of $248.1 million in 1993.  Sales in 1992
   were $215.2 million.  While a portion of the sales increase was due to the
   underlying growth of seven percent in the domestic water heater industry,
   Water Products outperformed this growth by gaining market share in both
   the residential and commercial segments of the business.  Water Products'
   strong position in the plumbing wholesale channel of distribution resulted
   in continued penetration of the domestic residential market which is
   comprised predominantly of replacement units.

   Earnings for the Water Products Company increased significantly in 1994
   and established a record for the fourth time in the last five years.  The
   impact of the increased residential volume and favorable pricing on
   commercial product more than offset the impact of volume reductions
   experienced in the standard commercial product.

   New industrial and commercial product introductions scheduled for 1995
   should provide incremental future market penetration.  The possibility of
   designing and manufacturing water heaters for the Chinese market is closer
   to reality, as the company signed a letter of intent in the People's
   Republic of China in the third quarter of 1994.  Earnings in the first
   quarter of 1995 may fall short of 1994's first quarter, due to some shift
   in demand to the fourth quarter of 1994 in anticipation of an announced
   price increase January 1, 1995.  

   Smith Fiberglass Products Inc. 1994 sales of $57.9 million declined
   slightly from the record of $58.9 million established in 1993, but
   remained substantially higher than 1992 sales of $43.9 million.  The major
   factors responsible for the slight decrease in 1994 sales levels include:
   weakness in the domestic oil industry; increased competition in the
   service station market; and the lack of large orders similar to those
   shipped in 1993.  The chemical and industrial market demonstrated
   significant growth in 1994 as sales were over 50 percent higher than in
   1993.  Some of this growth was attributed to the introduction of the
   reformulated Chem Thread(R) line which is specifically designed for
   chemical processing applications.

   Earnings for Fiberglass Products in 1994 were about equal to those in 1993
   and almost double the 1992 earnings despite the slight drop in volume.

   The prospects for 1995 are good.  Although a gradual decline in the
   service station market is anticipated as compliance with federal
   regulations is near completion, a number of recent developments provide
   the basis for an optimistic outlook.  International demand for fiberglass
   pipe should increase as existing metallic pipe in older oil fields begins
   to corrode and requires replacement.  Smith Fiberglass installed a number
   of test lines in oil fields in northeastern China, and the possibility of
   a joint venture could become a reality in 1995.  

   Revenues for agricultural products were $40.2 million in 1994, an increase
   of $2.1 million and $6.2 million over 1993 and 1992, respectively.  The
   recent emphasis on environmental issues has stimulated demand for the
   Aquastore/R/ and Slurrystore/R/ product lines manufactured by A. O. Smith
   Harvestore Products, Inc. (Harvestore).  These structures are primarily
   used for water storage, waste water treatment, and animal waste storage. 
   Harvestore also increased its presence in the international markets in
   1994 and is seeking ISO-9001 certification in 1995 to enhance its
   international marketing activities.  Harvestore's 1994 earnings were much
   improved over both 1993 and 1992 as a result of higher volume.  Revenues
   for AgriStor Credit Corporation were $2.9 million, $4.8 million and $6.4
   million in 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.  This trend of decreasing
   revenues reflects management's commitment to an expeditious liquidation of
   this finance subsidiary.  Interest costs and administrative expenses have
   declined consistently throughout the liquidation process, however
   recognition of costs associated with non-performing contracts resulted in
   AgriStor's 1994 loss exceeding those of the prior two years.  The net
   after-tax loss for the agricultural businesses was $.17 per share for both
   1994 and 1993.

   Selling, general, and administrative expense for the corporation in 1994
   was $108.9 million compared to $96.5 million and $86.0 million in 1993 and
   1992, respectively.  The majority of the increase during this period was
   caused by higher employee incentive and profit sharing accruals, increased
   commissions and other expenses in support of additional sales volume, bad
   debt provisions, and re-marketing costs associated with repossessed
   equipment within the agricultural segment.  As a percent of sales,
   selling, general, and administrative expenses have declined steadily from
   8.2 percent in 1992 to 7.9 percent in 1994.

   Interest expense in 1994 was $12.1 million and compares favorably to
   interest of $13.4 million in 1993 and $17.9 million in 1992.  The decline
   in interest expense in 1994 reflected the reduction in debt levels whereas
   the decline from 1992 to 1993 was a function of both lower debt and
   declining interest rates.

   The corporation's effective income tax rate decreased to 38.3 percent in
   1994 from 41 percent in 1993 and 39 percent in 1992.  The lower rate in
   1994 was caused by the recognition of research and development and foreign
   tax credits.The rise in the rate from 1992 to 1993 was due to the one
   percent federal rate increase including the cumulative impact on prior
   years.  

   For purposes of determining 1994 net periodic pension expenses, a discount
   rate of 7.75 percent was used.  An increase in the discount rate to 8.5
   percent was made as of year-end to determine the benefit obligations at
   December 31, 1994.  The assumed rate of return on plan assets was 10.25
   percent in 1994 and 1993.  Management estimates that the effect of the
   discount rate change in combination with other components of periodic
   pension expense will not be significant for 1995.  As to postretirement
   benefits other than pensions, an increase in the discount rate assumption
   to 8.5 percent also was made.  This discount rate change also is
   anticipated to have only a minimal impact on future expense.

   A. O. Smith Corporation achieved record net earnings of $57.3 million or
   $2.75 per share in 1994, eclipsing the previous records of $42.7 million
   or $2.08 per share established in 1993.  In 1992, the corporation earned
   $28 million or $1.41 per fully diluted share before recognition of a $46.1
   million one-time after-tax charge for postretirement benefits.  The 1992
   net loss including this one-time adjustment was $18.2 million or $.84 per
   fully diluted share.

   Entering 1994, the corporation believed the foundation was in place to set
   sales and earnings records for a second consecutive year.  As evidenced by
   the financial results for 1994, the corporation was able to achieve this
   goal in a  convincing manner.  The challenge of a third consecutive
   record-setting year lies ahead.  The corporation's success in meeting this
   aggressive objective will depend upon the impact that factors such as
   interest rate levels, housing starts, union contract negotiations, and the
   volatility within the Mexican economy have on the markets served by A. O.
   Smith Corporation.

   REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS



   The Board of Directors and Stockholders
   A. O. Smith Corporation

   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of A. O. Smith
   Corporation as of December 31, 1994 and 1993 and the related consolidated
   statements of operations and retained earnings and cash flows for each of
   the three years in the period ended December 31, 1994.  Our audits also
   included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index in Item
   14(a).  These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of
   the corporation's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion
   on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

   We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
   standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
   obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
   free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test
   basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
   statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
   used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
   the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits
   provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
   in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of A. O.
   Smith Corporation at December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the consolidated
   results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years
   in the period ended December 31, 1994, in conformity with generally
   accepted accounting principles.  Also, in our opinion, the related
   financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
   financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material
   respects the information set forth therein.

   As discussed in Notes 9 and 10 to the financial statements, the
   corporation changed its method of accounting for post retirement benefits
   other than pensions and income taxes effective January 1, 1992.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

   1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

   Consolidation and Basis of Presentation.  The consolidated financial
   statements include the accounts of the corporation and its wholly-owned
   subsidiaries including the corporation's agricultural businesses which are
   being held for sale or liquidation.

   Foreign Currency Translation.  Financial statements for the corporation's
   subsidiaries outside of the United States are translated into U.S. dollars
   at year-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and weighted average
   exchange rates for revenues and expenses.  The resulting translation
   adjustments are recorded as a component of stockholders' equity.

   Inventory valuation.  Domestic inventories are carried at lower of cost or
   market determined on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.  Inventories of
   foreign subsidiaries and supplies are determined using the first-in,
   first-out (FIFO) method.

   Derivative instruments.  The corporation enters into futures contracts to
   fix the cost of certain raw material purchases, principally copper and
   aluminum, with the objective of minimizing cost risk due to market
   fluctuations.  Any differences between the corporation's fixed price and
   current market prices are included as part of the inventory cost when the
   contracts mature.  As of December 31, 1994, the corporation had contracts
   covering approximately 88 percent of its copper and 76 percent of its
   aluminum requirements for 1995, with varying maturities in 1995, the
   longest duration of which is December 1995.  These futures contracts limit
   the impact from both favorable and unfavorable price changes.  The effect
   of these programs was not material on the results of operations for 1994,
   1993, or 1992.

   As a result of having various foreign operations, the corporation is
   exposed to the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the U.S.
   dollar value of its foreign subsidiaries.  Further, the corporation and
   its subsidiaries conduct business in various foreign currencies.  To
   minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on its income, the
   corporation enters into foreign currency forward contracts.  The contracts
   are used to hedge known foreign currency transactions on a continuing
   basis for periods consistent with the corporation's exposures.  The
   corporation does not engage in speculation. The difference between market
   and contract rates is recognized in the same period in which gains or
   losses from the transactions being hedged are recognized and, accordingly,
   no net gain or loss is anticipated when the contracts mature.

   The following table summarizes, by currency, the corporation's forward
   exchange contracts.

                            =======    =======       =======        =====


   The contracts in place at December 31, 1994 and 1993 amounted to 58 and 85
   percent, respectively, of the corporation's anticipated subsequent year
   exposure for those currencies hedged.

   Property, plant, and equipment.  Property, plant, and equipment are stated
   at cost.  Depreciation is computed primarily by the straight-line method.

   Deferred model change.  Tool costs not reimbursed by customers and
   expenses associated with significant model changes are amortized over the
   estimated model life which ranges from four to ten years, with the shorter
   periods associated with automobile structural components and the longer
   periods associated with structural components for trucks.  

   Finance subsidiary.  Finance charges for retail contracts receivable are
   recognized as income as installments become due using the interest method. 
   For direct finance leases, income is recognized based upon a constant rate
   of return on the unrecovered lease investment over the term of the related
   lease.

   Revenue recognition.  The corporation recognizes revenue upon shipment of
   product to the customer.

   Income taxes.  The corporation accounts for income taxes using the
   liability method prescribed by FAS No. 109.

   Research and development.  Research and development costs are charged to
   expense as incurred and amounted to approximately $9.2, $7.6, and $6.5
   million during 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.

   Earnings (loss) per share of common stock.  Primary per share amounts are
   determined by dividing earnings (loss) applicable to common shareholders
   by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and materially
   dilutive common stock equivalents (stock options) outstanding.

   Fully diluted per share amounts include the dilutive effect, if any, of
   the assumed conversion in 1992 of the outstanding preferred stock into
   common stock with appropriate adjustments being made to earnings (loss)
   applicable to common stock for dividends on the preferred stock.  For
   1992, fully diluted net loss per share amounts are anti-dilutive because
   of the preferred stock conversion.

   Reclassifications.  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to
   conform to the 1994 presentation.

   2.  Statement of Cash Flows  

   For purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash
   equivalents include investments with original maturities of three months
   or less.  Supplemental cash flow information is as follows:

   During 1992, inventory reductions in certain operations resulted in
   liquidations of certain LIFO inventory quantities acquired at lower costs
   in prior years as compared with 1992 costs, the effect of which reduced
   the 1992 net loss by $2.8 million.


   4.      Investments in and Advances to Affiliated Companies

   Investments in affiliates in which ownership is 50 percent or less are
   accounted for under the equity method.  The corporation's equity in the
   undistributed earnings of such affiliates at December 31, 1994, amounted
   to approximately $16.1 million.  In 1993, the corporation advanced $1.2
   million to its Mexican affiliate with repayment due in 1996 and interest
   at 5 percent due quarterly.  In 1994, due to the decline in the value of
   the peso, the corporation recorded as a component of stockholders' equity,
   translation adjustments of approximately $7.5 million.  During 1994, 1993,
   and 1992, the corporation received dividends of $.8, $2.8, and $1.3
   million, respectively, from such affiliates.

                                                    ========  ========

   In June 1994, the corporation put in place a $140 million multi-year
   revolving credit agreement with a group of ten banks.  The agreement
   replaced a $115 million A. O. Smith facility and a $30 million AgriStor
   facility.  The agreement extends through April 3, 1998.  In addition to
   lower fees and lower borrowing rates, the agreement contains fewer
   restrictive covenants.  At its option, the corporation maintains either
   cash balances or pays fees for bank credit and services.

   In April 1994, the $12.5 million term loan agreement automatically
   converted from an 8.9 percent fixed rate to a floating interest rate.  The
   interest rate is set at 37.5 basis points over LIBOR, and the loan may be
   repaid at anytime without penalty.

   In 1993, the corporation entered into two loan facilities with insurance
   companies totalling $65 million.  Through December 31, 1994, the
   corporation had drawn down, under ten year terms, $30 million under these
   facilities.

   The corporation's credit agreement and term loans contain certain
   conditions and provisions which restrict the corporation's payment of
   dividends.  Under the most restrictive of these provisions, retained
   earnings of $93.1 million were unrestricted as of December 31, 1994.

   Borrowings under the bank credit lines and in the commercial paper market
   are supported by the revolving credit agreement and have been classified
   as long-term.  It has been the corporation's practice to renew or replace
   the credit agreement so as to maintain the availability of debt on a long-
   term basis and to provide 100 percent backup for its borrowings in the
   commercial paper market.

   Long-term debt, maturing within each of the five years subsequent to
   December 31, 1994, is as follows:  1995--$7.3; 1996--$5.0; 1997--$11.9;
   1998--$12.2; 1999--$8.1 million.

   The corporation sold, without recourse and at market rates, certain
   automotive-related receivables totalling $27.5 million at December 31,
   1994, compared to $16.0 million at December 31, 1993.  The receivables
   sale program is scheduled to expire on April 30, 1996, unless mutually
   extended.

   Future minimum payments under noncancelable operating leases total $113.7
   million and are due as follows:  1995--$21.8; 1996--$19.6; 1997--$17.6;
   1998--$16.8; 1999--$13.7; thereafter--$24.2 million.  Rent expense,
   including payments under operating leases, was $30.8, $28.2, and $27.5
   million in 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.

   Interest paid by the corporation was $13.3, $14.0, and $18.4 million in
   1994, 1993, and 1992 respectively.

   7.      Stockholders' Equity

   As of December 31, 1994, there were 7 million shares of Class A Common
   Stock $5 par value, 24 million shares of Common Stock $1 par value, and 3
   million shares of preferred stock $1 par value authorized.  The Common
   Stock has equal dividend rights with Class A Common Stock and is entitled,
   as a class, to elect 25 percent of the board of directors and has 1/10th
   vote per share on all other matters.

   On February 1, 1993, the Board of Directors declared a special $.25 per
   share dividend payable on March 22 to Common Stockholders of record March
   8. No special dividend was declared on the Class A Common Stock.  During
   1993, 2,009,683 shares of Class A Common Stock, including 623,362 shares
   held in Treasury, were converted by the holders into Common Stock.  An
   additional 49,304 shares of Class A Common Stock were converted into
   Common Stock during 1994.  Regular dividends paid on the Class A Common
   and Common Stock amounted to $.50, $.42, and $.40 per share in 1994, 1993,
   and 1992, respectively.

   Changes in certain components of stockholders' equity are as follows:

   


   In 1993, 5,930 shares of treasury stock were acquired under a purchase
   offer made to holders of less than 100 shares of Class A Common Stock and
   Common Stock.

   At December 31, 1994, 3,460 and 790,569 shares of Class A Common Stock and
   Common Stock, respectively, were held as treasury stock.

   8.  Stock Options

   During 1990, the corporation adopted a Long-Term Executive Incentive
   Compensation Plan (1990 Plan).  The 1990 Plan initially reserved 1 million
   shares of Common Stock for granting of nonqualified and incentive stock
   options.  In April 1994, shareholders approved a proposal to reserve an
   additional 1 million shares of Common Stock.  Each option entitles the
   holder, upon exercise, to obtain one share of Common Stock.  In addition,
   the corporation has a Long-Term Executive Incentive Compensation Plan
   (1980 Plan) which has terminated except as to outstanding options. 
   Options under both plans become exercisable one year from date of grant
   and, for active employees, expire ten years after date of grant.  The
   number of shares available for granting of options at December 31, 1994
   and 1993 was 659,600 and 25,400 respectively.

   Changes in option shares (all Common Stock) were as follows:

   9. Retirement Plans

   The corporation and its domestic subsidiaries have noncontributory defined
   benefit pension plans covering all employees.  Plans covering salaried
   employees provide benefits that are based on an employee's years of
   service and compensation.  Plans covering hourly employees provide
   benefits of stated amounts for each year of service.  The corporation's
   funding policy is to contribute amounts which are actuarially determined
   to provide the plans with sufficient assets to meet future benefit payment
   requirements consistent with the funding requirements of federal laws and
   regulations.  Plan assets consist primarily of marketable equities and
   debt securities.  The corporation also has several foreign pension plans,
   none of which are material.

   The following tables present the components of pension expense, the funded
   status, and the major assumptions used to determine these amounts for
   domestic pension plans:

   


   



   Major assumptions at year-end:
                                                 1994     1993     1992

   Discount rate                                8.50%    7.75%    8.75%
   Rate of increase in compensation level       4.50%    4.00%    5.50%
   Expected long-term rate of return
    on assets                                  10.25%   10.25%   10.50%


   Net periodic pension cost is determined using the assumptions as of the
   beginning of the year.  The funded status is determined using the
   assumptions as of the end of the year.

   The corporation has a defined contribution profit sharing and retirement
   plan covering salaried nonunion employees which provides for annual
   corporate contributions of 35 percent to 140 percent of qualifying
   contributions made by participating employees.  The amount of the
   corporation's contribution in excess of 35 percent is dependent upon the
   corporation's profitability.  The amount of the contribution was $5.2,
   $4.0, and $2.3 million for 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.

   Postretirement Benefits other than Pensions

   The corporation has several unfunded defined benefit postretirement plans
   covering certain hourly and salaried employees which provide medical and
   life insurance benefits from retirement to age 65.  Salaried employees
   retiring after January 1, 1995 will be covered by an unfunded defined
   contribution plan with benefits based on years of service.  Certain hourly
   employees retiring after January 1, 1996 will be subject to a maximum
   annual benefit limit.  Salaried employees hired after December 31, 1993
   are not eligible for postretirement medical benefits.

   Effective January 1, 1992, the corporation adopted FAS No. 106,
   "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions."

   Net periodic postretirement benefit cost included the following
   components:

   December 31 (dollars in thousands)                1994        1993

   The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated
   postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) was 10 percent in 1992, declining
   by 1 percent per year to 6 percent in 1996.  The weighted average discount
   rate used in determining the APBO was 8.50 percent and 7.75 percent at
   December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  If the health care cost trend
   rate was increased by 1 percent, the APBO at December 31, 1994 would
   increase by $3.3 million and net periodic postretirement benefit cost for
   1994 would increase by $.3 million.


   10. Income Taxes

   Effective January 1, 1992, the corporation adopted FAS No. 109,
   "Accounting for Income Taxes."

   The components of the provision for income taxes consisted of the

                                               ======     ======    ======

   Taxes paid amounted to $21.7, $12.2, and $5.4 million in 1994, 1993, and
   1992, respectively.

   The corporation has the following carryforwards for federal income tax
   purposes:

     -       Tax credits of $2.6 million which expire from 2002 through
             2007.
     -       Alternative Minimum Tax credits of $6.1 million which do not
             expire.

   No provision for U.S. income taxes has been made on the undistributed
   earnings of foreign subsidiaries as such earnings are considered to be
   permanently invested.  At December 31, 1994, the undistributed earnings
   amounted to $16.3 million.  It is not practical to determine the income
   tax liability that would result had such earnings been repatriated.  The
   amount of withholding taxes that would be payable upon such repatriation
   is estimated to be $.6 million.

   No provision for U.S. income taxes has been made on the cumulative net
   translation gains and other items of equity investees.  At December 31,
   1994, the amount of unrecognized U.S. tax liability for the net
   translation gains and other items of $10.3 million amounted to $3.6

   11.  Agricultural Businesses

   The corporation's strategic plan is to concentrate its resources in
   nonagricultural businesses and withdraw from the agricultural market.  The
   strategy includes plans to sell the agricultural business and to phase out
   AgriStor Credit Corporation (AgriStor), a wholly-owned finance subsidiary.

   Due to the uncertainties which continue to impact the farm sector, it is
   not possible to predict when the sale of the agricultural business will
   occur.  The corporation is continuing to phase out AgriStor's operations
   in an orderly manner.

   The corporation's consolidated balance sheet includes AgriStor.  A
   condensed, consolidated balance sheet of AgriStor is presented below:

   The retail contracts receivable and net investment in leases are net of
   bad debt reserves totalling $10.0 and $14.6 million at December 31, 1994
   and 1993, respectively.  AgriStor is the lessor in the direct finance
   leasing of Harvestore(R) equipment.  The equipment has an estimated
   economic life of 15 years and is leased under agreements with original
   terms of 5 to 12 years.

   There is no quoted market price available for the retail contracts and
   leases.  Management believes fair value approximates book value.  While
   some maturities extend beyond the year 2000, the portfolio is
   predominantly of two to three year duration carrying an average interest
   rate of 7.0 percent.

   As discussed in Note 6, in 1994 the corporation put in place a revolving
   credit agreement  which replaced separate facilities of the corporation
   and AgriStor.  At the same time, AgriStor terminated its commercial paper
   program.  Certain of AgriStor's financing needs are now being provided by
   the corporation.  In addition, at December 31, 1994, AgriStor had
   outstanding a $2.5 million term  loan with a final maturity in 1995. 
   AgriStor Credit Corporation - Canada (AgriStor Canada) had outstanding a
   $5.5 million Canadian dollar denominated note ($3.9 million U.S. dollar
   equivalent) with a final maturity in 1998.  AgriStor Canada also had a
   $10.0 million Canadian dollar denominated ($7.1 million U.S. dollar
   equivalent) credit facility  to meet its borrowing needs, none of which
   was outstanding at December 31, 1994.  Long-term debt maturing subsequent
   to December 31, 1994, is as follows:  1995--$3.5; 1996--$1.0; 1997--$1.0;
   1998--$1.0 million.

   A condensed consolidated statement of operations of AgriStor is presented
   below.  The 1994 statement of operations reflects repossession and
   contract settlement costs that previously were not recognized until final
   disposition of repossessed structures.

   $21.4, and $13.7 million in 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.


   12.     Litigation and Insurance Matters

   As of December 31, 1994, the corporation and A. O. Smith Harvestore
   Products, Inc. (Harvestore), a subsidiary of the corporation, were
   defendants in 23 cases alleging damages for economic losses claimed to
   have arisen out of alleged defects in Harvestore animal feed storage
   equipment.  Some plaintiffs are seeking punitive as well as compensatory
   damages.  The corporation believes that a significant number of these
   claims were related to the deteriorated general farm economy, including
   those filed in 1994.  In 1994, seven new cases were filed and ten cases
   were concluded.  The corporation and Harvestore continue to vigorously
   defend these cases.

   Two of the 23 pending cases contain class action allegations.  One of the
   cases is a New York state court action which names the corporation,
   Harvestore, and two of its dealers as defendants.  The court has not
   certified the class and has granted the defendants' motions dismissing
   some of the plaintiffs' allegations.  The plaintiffs are appealing the
   court's rulings.

   The second case is pending in the Federal District Court for the Southern
   District of Ohio.  It was filed in August 1992 and the court, in March
   1994, conditionally certified it as a class action on behalf of purchasers
   and lessees of Harvestore structures manufactured by the corporation and
   Harvestore.  A notice of the certification was mailed to the purported
   class members in the third quarter of 1994, with approximately 5,500 "opt
   out" forms being filed with the court by the August 31, 1994 deadline, the
   impact of which is unknown.  Discovery in the case is ongoing and a trial
   of the liability issues only is scheduled to begin on October 16, 1995. 
   Damages would be tried at a later date and only after a liability finding.

   Based on the facts currently available to management and its prior
   experience with lawsuits alleging damages for economic loss resulting 
   from use of the Harvestore animal feed storage equipment, management is
   confident that the class action suits can be defeated and that the
   lawsuits do not represent a material threat to the corporation.  The
   corporation believes that any damages, including any punitive damages,
   arising out of the pending cases are adequately covered by insurance and
   recorded reserves.  No range of reasonably possible losses can be
   estimated because, in most instances, the complaint is silent as to the
   amount of the claim or states it as an unspecified amount in excess of the
   jurisdictional minimum.  The corporation reevaluates its exposure
   periodically and makes adjustment of its reserves as appropriate.

   A lawsuit for damages and declaratory judgments in the Circuit Court of
   Milwaukee County, State of Wisconsin, in which the corporation and
   Harvestore are plaintiffs is pending against three insurance companies for
   failure to pay in accordance with liability insurance policies issued to
   the corporation.  The insurers have failed to pay, in full or part,
   certain judgments, settlements, and defense costs incurred in connection
   with pending and closed lawsuits alleging damages for economic losses
   claimed to have arisen out of alleged defects in Harvestore animal feed
   storage equipment.  While the corporation has, in part, assumed
   applicability of this coverage, an adverse judgment should not be material
   to its financial condition.

   The corporation is involved in other litigation and claims which arise in
   the ordinary course of its business including governmental proceedings
   regarding the disposal of hazardous waste at sites which are in various
   stages of the remediation process.  For some of the sites, total costs for
   remediation are not available because the final remedy has not been
   selected or for other reasons.  Further, the ultimate liability of the
   corporation, if any, has not been determined at all of the sites.  As a
   result, it is impossible at this time to estimate the total cost of
   remediation for all of the sites.  The total estimated cleanup costs
   identified at this time for all parties at all sites involving claims
   filed by the Environmental Protection Agency or similar state agencies
   where the corporation has been designated a potentially responsible party
   is approximately $252.5 million.  The estimated portion of the total for
   which the corporation is or may be responsible is approximately $4.3
   million, of which $3.5 million has been contributed towards the cleanup
   costs by the corporation and its insurance companies.  The balance of the
   identified potential cleanup costs is covered by insurance and established
   reserves set by the corporation which are believed to be adequate to cover
   the corporation's obligations with respect to the unpaid balance of the
   claims.  To the best of the corporation's knowledge, the insurers have the
   financial ability to pay any such covered claims and the corporation has
   not incorporated any insurance proceeds in the calculation of its reserves
   for which recovery is not considered probable.  The corporation
   reevaluates its exposure periodically and makes adjustment of its reserves
   as appropriate. 

   In March 1992, a subsidiary of the corporation, Smith Fiberglass Products
   Inc. (Smith Fiberglass), won a patent infringement suit filed against a
   competitor.  A judgment was entered in favor of Smith Fiberglass.  The
   judgment was appealed by the defendant.  However, the Court of Appeals
   affirmed the award and Smith Fiberglass recognized the judgment which
   amounted to $1.9 million after recognition of legal fees as income in the
   second quarter of 1993.

   A legal action against a supplier of certain automotive equipment alleging
   breach of warranty was settled in December 1992.  The corporation recorded
   the settlement, net of expenses, of $1.1 million as income in 1992.

   A lawsuit initiated by the corporation in connection with previously
   concluded antitrust action involving a former subsidiary was terminated in
   the second quarter of 1993 with a favorable settlement of $2.8 million.

   Over the past several years, the corporation has self-insured a portion of
   its product liability loss exposure and other business risks.  The
   corporation has established reserves which it believes are adequate to
   cover incurred claims.  For the year ended December 31, 1994, the
   corporation had $60 million of third-party product liability insurance for
   individual losses in excess of $1.5 million and for aggregate losses in
   excess of $10 million.


   13.  Operations by Segment

   

   Further discussion of the segment results, including Automotive Products
   and Electrical Products which comprise the OEM segment, can be found under
   "Management's Discussion and Analysis--Results of Operations."

   


   14.  Quarterly Results of Operations (Unaudited)

   

   Net earnings per share is computed separately for each period and,
   therefore, the sum of such quarterly per share amounts may differ from the
   total for the year.

   See note 6 for restrictions on the payment of dividends.

   The fourth quarter of 1994 includes, on an after-tax basis, approximately
   $.4 million of charges for additions to bad debt reserves partially offset
   by inventory adjustments.

   The fourth quarter of 1993 includes, on an after-tax basis, approximately
   $2.3 million of charges for additions to product liability and bad debt
   reserves and writedown of certain assets partially offset by inventory
   adjustments.

   For the purposes of complying with the amendments to the rules governing
   Form S-8 (effective July 13, 1990) under the Securities Act of 1933, the
   undersigned registrant hereby undertakes as follows, which undertaking
   shall be incorporated by reference into registrant's Registration
   Statements on Form S-8 Nos. 2-72542 filed on May 26, 1981, Post-Effective
   Amendment No. 1, filed on May 12, 1983, Post-Effective Amendment No. 2,
   filed on December 22, 1983, Post-Effective Amendment No. 3, filed on March
   30, 1987; 33-19015 filed on December 11, 1987; 33-21356 filed on April 21,
   1988; Form S-8 No. 33-37878 filed November 16, 1990; and Form S-8 No. 33-
   56827 filed December 13, 1994.

                Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising
           under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to
           directors, officers and controlling persons of the
           registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or
           otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the
           opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such
           indemnification is against public policy as expressed in
           the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore,
           unenforceable.  In the event that a claim for
           indemnification against such liabilities (other than the
           payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by
           a director, officer or controlling person of the
           registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit
           or proceedings) is asserted by such director, officer or
           controlling person in connection with the securities being
           registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of
           its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling
           precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction
           the question whether such indemnification by it is against
           public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed
           by the final adjudication of such issue.
