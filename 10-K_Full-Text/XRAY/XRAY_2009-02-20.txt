History and Overview

DENTSPLY International Inc. (“DENTSPLY” or the “Company”), a Delaware corporation, was created in 1899 as a manufacturer and distributor of artificial teeth, dental equipment and dental consumable products. Today, the Company continues to primarily focus on dental consumable products, dental laboratory products and dental specialty products.

DENTSPLY believes it is the world's largest designer, developer, manufacturer and marketer of a broad range of products for the dental market. The Company's worldwide headquarters and executive offices are located in York, Pennsylvania.

Sales of the Company's dental products accounted for approximately 97% of DENTSPLY's consolidated net sales, excluding precious metal content, for the year ended December 31, 2008. The remaining 3% of consolidated net sales are related to materials sold to the investment casting industry and various medical products. The presentation of net sales, excluding precious metal content, is
        considered a measure not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), and is therefore considered a non-GAAP measure. This non-GAAP measure is discussed further in “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and a reconciliation of net sales to net sales, excluding precious metal content, is provided.

Through the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company conducted its business through four operating segments, all of which were primarily engaged in the design, manufacture and distribution of dental products in three principal categories: 1) dental consumable products, 2) dental laboratory products and 3) dental specialty products.

In addition to the United States (“U.S.”), the Company conducts its business in over 120 foreign countries, principally through its foreign subsidiaries. DENTSPLY has a long-established presence in Canada and in the European market, particularly in Germany, Switzerland, France, Italy and the United Kingdom. The Company also has a significant market presence in Central and
        South America, South Africa and the Pacific Rim. DENTSPLY has also established marketing activities in Moscow, Russia to serve the countries of the former Soviet Union.

For 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company's net sales, excluding precious metal content, to customers outside the U.S., including export sales, accounted for approximately 62%, 59% and 58%, respectively. Reference is made to the information about the Company's U.S. and foreign sales by shipment origin set forth in Note 4, Segment and Geographic Information, to the consolidated financial
        statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Principal Products

The worldwide professional dental industry encompasses the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease and ailments of the teeth, gums and supporting bone. DENTSPLY's principal dental product categories are dental consumable products, dental laboratory products and dental specialty products. These products are produced by the Company in the U.S. and internationally and are
        distributed throughout the world under some of the most well-established brand names and trademarks in the industry, including ANKYLOS®, AQUASIL(TM), AQUASIL ULTRA(TM), BIOPURE®, CAULK®, CAVITRON®, CERAMCO®, CERCON®, CITANEST®, DELTON®, DENTSPLY®, DETREY®, ELEPHANT®, ESTHET.X®, FRIADENT®, FRIALIT®, GENIE®, GOLDEN GATE®, IN-OVATION®, INTERACTIVE MYSTIQUE®, MAILLEFER®, MIDWEST®, NUPRO®, ORAQIX®, PEPGEN
        P-15®, POLOCAINE®, PRIME & BOND®, PROFILE®, PROTAPER®, RINN®, R&R®, SANI-TIP®, SEAL&PROTECT(TM), SHADEPILOT(TM), SULTAN®, THERMAFIL®, TRUBYTE®, XENO®, XIVE®, XYLOCAINE®, and ZHERMACK®.

Dental Consumable Products

Dental consumable products consist of dental sundries and small equipment used in dental offices in the treatment of patients. Sales of dental consumable products, excluding precious metal content, accounted for approximately 34%, 35% and 40% of the Company’s consolidated sales for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

DENTSPLY’s dental sundry products in the dental consumable products category include dental anesthetics, prophylaxis paste, dental sealants, impression materials, restorative materials, tooth whiteners and topical fluoride. The Company manufactures thousands of different dental sundry consumable products marketed under more than one hundred brand names.

Small equipment products in the dental consumable products category consist of various durable goods used in dental offices for treatment of patients. DENTSPLY’s small equipment products include high and low speed handpieces, intraoral curing light systems, dental diagnostic systems and ultrasonic scalers and polishers.

Dental Laboratory Products

Dental laboratory products are used in the preparation of dental appliances by dental laboratories. Sales of dental laboratory products, excluding precious metal content, accounted for approximately 18%, 19% and 19% of the Company’s consolidated sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

DENTSPLY’s products in the dental laboratory products category include dental prosthetics, including artificial teeth, precious metal dental alloys, dental ceramics, and crown and bridge materials. Equipment in this category includes computer aided machining (CAM) ceramic systems and porcelain furnaces.

Dental Specialty Products

Dental specialty products are specialized treatment products used within the dental office and laboratory settings. Sales of dental specialty products, excluding precious metal content, accounted for approximately 45%, 43% and 38% of the Company’s consolidated sales for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. DENTSPLY’s products in this category
        include endodontic (root canal) instruments and materials, implants and related products, bone grafting materials, 3D digital implantology and orthodontic appliances and accessories.

Markets, Sales and Distribution

DENTSPLY distributes approximately 56% of its dental products through domestic and foreign distributors, dealers and importers. However, certain highly technical products such as precious metal dental alloys, dental ceramics, crown and bridge porcelain products, endodontic instruments and materials, orthodontic appliances, implants, and bone substitute and grafting materials are sold
        directly to the dental laboratory or dental professional in some markets. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, one customer, Henry Schein Incorporated, a dental distributor, accounted for 11%, 12% and 11%, respectively, of DENTSPLY’s consolidated net sales. No other single customer represented ten percent or more of DENTSPLY’s consolidated net sales during 2008, 2007 or 2006.

Reference is made to the information about the Company's foreign and domestic operations and export sales set forth in Note 4, Segment and Geographic Information, to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Although many of its sales are made to distributors, dealers and importers, DENTSPLY focuses its marketing efforts on the dentists, dental hygienists, dental assistants, dental laboratories and dental schools who are the end users of its products.

- 3 -

As part of this end-user “pull through” marketing approach, DENTSPLY employs approximately 2,700 highly trained, product-specific sales and technical staff to provide comprehensive marketing and service tailored to the particular sales and technical support requirements of the dealers and the end users. The Company conducts extensive distributor and end-user marketing programs and trains
        laboratory technicians and dentists in the proper use of its products, introducing them to the latest technological developments at its educational centers located throughout the world. The Company also maintains ongoing relationships with various dental associations and recognized worldwide opinion leaders in the dental field, although there is no assurance that these influential dental professionals will continue to support the Company’s products.

DENTSPLY believes that demand in a given geographic market for dental procedures and products vary according to the stage of social, economic, and technical development of the particular market. Geographic markets for DENTSPLY's dental products can be categorized into the following two stages of development:

The U.S., Canada, Western Europe, Japan, Australia, and certain other countries are highly developed markets that demand the most advanced dental procedures and products and have the highest level of expenditures on dental care. In these markets, the focus of dental care is increasingly upon preventive care and specialized dentistry. In addition to basic procedures such as the
        excavation and filling of cavities and tooth extraction and denture replacement, dental professionals perform an increasing volume of preventive and cosmetic procedures. These markets require varied and complex dental products, utilize sophisticated diagnostic and imaging equipment, and demand high levels of attention to protect against infection and patient cross-contamination.

In certain countries in Central America, South America, Eastern Europe, Pacific Rim, Middle East, and Africa, most dental care is often limited to the excavation and filling of cavities and other restorative techniques, reflecting more modest per capita expenditures for dental care. These markets demand diverse products such as high and low speed handpieces, restorative compounds,
        finishing devices, custom restorative devices, basic surgical instruments, bridgework and artificial teeth for dentures.

The Company offers products and equipment for use in markets at both of these stages of development. The Company believes that demand for more technically advanced products will increase as each of these markets develop. The Company also believes that its recognized brand names, high quality and innovative products, technical support services and strong international distribution
        capabilities position it well to take advantage of any opportunities for growth in all of the markets that it serves.

The Company believes that the market for its products will grow over the long-term based on the following factors:

•

Increasing worldwide population.

•

Growth of the population 65 or older – The percentage of the U.S., European, Japanese and other regions population over age 65 is expected to nearly double by the year 2030. In addition to having significant needs for dental care, the elderly are well positioned to pay for the required procedures since they control sizable amounts of discretionary income.

•

Natural teeth are being retained longer – Individuals with natural teeth are much more likely to visit a dentist in a given year than those without any natural teeth remaining.

•

The changing dental practice in North America and Western Europe – Dentistry in North America and Western Europe has been transformed from a profession primarily dealing with pain, infections and tooth decay to one with increased emphasis on preventive care and cosmetic dentistry.

•

Per capita and discretionary incomes are increasing in emerging nations – As personal incomes continue to rise in the emerging nations of the Pacific Rim, Commonwealth of Independent States (“CIS”) and Latin America, healthcare, including dental services, are a growing priority.

•

The Company’s business is less susceptible than other industries to general downturns in the economies in which it operates. Many of the products the Company offers relate to dental procedures that are considered necessary by patients regardless of the economic environment. Specialty products and products that support discretionary dental procedures are the most susceptible to recessionary
                        conditions.

Product Development

Technological innovation and successful product development are critical to strengthening the Company’s prominent position in worldwide dental markets, maintaining its leadership positions in product categories where it has a high market share and increasing market share in product categories where gains are possible. While many of DENTSPLY’s existing products undergo
        evolutionary improvements, the Company also continues to successfully launch innovative products that represent fundamental change.

New advances in technology are also anticipated to have a significant influence on future products in dentistry. As a result, the Company pursues research and development initiatives to support this technological development, including partnerships and collaborations with various research institutions and dental schools. Through its own internal research centers as well as through its
        collaborations and partnerships with external research institutions and dental schools, the Company directly invested approximately $52.3 million, $46.8 million and $44.4 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, in connection with the development of new products, improvement of existing products and advances in technology. The continued development of these areas is a critical step in meeting the Company's strategic goal as a leader in defining the future of dentistry.

In addition to the direct investment in product development and improvement, the Company also invests in these activities through acquisitions, by entering into licensing agreements and by purchasing technologies developed by third parties.

Acquisition Activities

DENTSPLY believes that the dental products industry continues to experience consolidation with respect to both product manufacturing and distribution, although it continues to be fragmented creating a number of acquisition opportunities. As a result, the Company has made several acquisitions in 2008, including a 60% ownership in Zhermack S.p.A., a dental consumable
        products manufacturer and distributor; E.S. Holding N.V., a manufacturer and sales and marketing organization of dental laboratory products; Dental Depot Lomberg B.V., a sales and marketing organization of orthodontic products; and Apollonia & Fama Impant S.r.l., a sales and marketing organization of dental implant products. The Company also purchased an additional interest in Materialise Dental in 2008. In 2007, the Company acquired one manufacturer of dental consumable
        products, one manufacturer of endodontic materials, two sales and marketing organizations for dental implant products, and one manufacturer of small dental diagnostic equipment.

The Company continues to view acquisitions as a key part of its growth strategy. These acquisition activities are intended to supplement the Company's core growth and assure ongoing expansion of its business, including new technologies, additional products, and geographic breadth.

Operating and Technical Expertise

DENTSPLY believes that its manufacturing capabilities are important to its success. The manufacture of the Company's products requires substantial and varied technical expertise. Complex materials technology and processes are necessary to manufacture the Company's products. The Company continues to automate its global manufacturing operations in order to remain a low cost
        producer.

Financing

DENTSPLY's total debt at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $427.7 million and $482.3 million, respectively, and the ratios of long-term debt to total capitalization were 21.2% and 24.1%. DENTSPLY defines total capitalization as the sum of total long-term debt, including the current portion, plus total stockholders’ equity. DENTSPLY may incur additional debt in the future,
        including, but not limited to, the funding of additional acquisitions and capital expenditures.

The Company's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased by $112.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2008 to $204.2 million. In 2008, the Company’s net borrowings decreased by $54.6 million. This change included a net reduction in borrowings of $86.3 million during the year ended 2008, plus an increase of $31.7 million due to exchange rate fluctuations
        on debt denominated in foreign currencies. The Company also repurchased $112.6 million in treasury stock in 2008.

Additional information about DENTSPLY's working capital, liquidity and capital resources is provided in “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Competition

The Company conducts its operations, both domestic and foreign, under highly competitive market conditions. Competition in the dental products industry is based primarily upon product performance, quality, safety and ease of use, as well as price, customer service, innovation and acceptance by professionals and technicians. DENTSPLY believes that its principal strengths include its
        well-established brand names, its reputation for high quality and innovative products, its leadership in product development and manufacturing, its commitment to customer satisfaction and support of the Company’s products by dental professionals.

The size and number of the Company's competitors vary by product line and from region to region. There are many companies that produce some, but not all, of the same types of products as those produced by the Company.

Regulation

The Company's products are subject to regulation by, among other governmental entities, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). In general, if a dental “device” is subject to FDA regulation, compliance with the FDA's requirements constitutes compliance with corresponding state regulations. In order to ensure that dental products distributed for human
        use in the U.S. are safe and effective, the FDA regulates the introduction, manufacture, advertising, labeling, packaging, marketing and distribution of, and record-keeping for, such products. The introduction and sale of dental products of the types produced by the Company are also subject to government regulation in the various foreign countries in which they are produced or sold. DENTSPLY believes that it is in substantial compliance with the FDA and foreign regulatory requirements
        that are applicable to its products and manufacturing operations.

Dental devices of the types sold by DENTSPLY are generally classified by the FDA into a category that renders them subject only to general controls that apply to all medical devices, including regulations regarding alteration, misbranding, notification, record-keeping and good manufacturing practices. In the European Union, DENTSPLY's products are subject to the medical devices laws
        of the various member states, which are based on a Directive of the European Commission. Such laws generally regulate the safety of the products in a similar way to the FDA regulations. DENTSPLY products in Europe bear the CE mark showing that such products adhere to the European regulations.

All dental amalgam filling materials, including those manufactured and sold by DENTSPLY, contain mercury. Various groups have alleged that dental amalgam containing mercury is harmful to human health and have actively lobbied state and federal lawmakers and regulators to pass laws or adopt regulatory changes restricting the use, or requiring a warning against alleged potential risks,
        of dental amalgams. The FDA's Dental Devices Classification Panel, the National Institutes of Health and the U.S. Public Health Service have each indicated that no direct hazard to humans from exposure to dental amalgams has been demonstrated. In response to concerns raised by certain consumer groups regarding dental amalgam, in 2006 the FDA formed an advisory committee to review peer-reviewed scientific literature on the safety of dental amalgam. In Europe, particularly in Scandinavia
        and Germany, the contents of mercury in amalgam filling materials have been the subject of public discussion. As a consequence, in 1994 the German health authorities required suppliers of dental amalgam to amend the instructions for use for amalgam filling materials to include a precaution against the use of amalgam for children less than eighteen years of age and to women of childbearing age. Additionally, some groups have asserted that the use of dental amalgam should be prohibited
        because of concerns about environmental impact from the disposition of mercury within dental amalgam, which has resulted in the sale of mercury containing products being banned in Sweden and severely curtailed in Norway. DENTSPLY also manufactures and sells non-amalgam dental filling materials that do not contain mercury.

Sources and Supply of Raw Materials and Finished Goods

The Company manufactures the majority of the products sold by the Company. All of the raw materials used by the Company in the manufacture of its products are purchased from various suppliers and are typically available from numerous sources. No single supplier accounts for a significant percentage of DENTSPLY's raw material requirements. In addition to those products both
        manufactured and sold by the Company, some finished goods products sold by the Company are purchased from third party suppliers. Of these finished goods products purchased from third party suppliers, a significant portion of the Company’s injectable anesthetic products, orthodontic products and cutting instruments are purchased from a limited number of suppliers.

Intellectual Property

Products manufactured by DENTSPLY are sold primarily under its own trademarks and trade names. DENTSPLY also owns and maintains more than 2,000 patents throughout the world and is licensed under a small number of patents owned by others.

- 6 -

DENTSPLY's policy is to protect its products and technology through patents and trademark registrations in the U.S. and in significant international markets for its products. The Company carefully monitors trademark use worldwide, and promotes enforcement of its patents and trademarks in a manner that is designed to balance the cost of such protection against obtaining the greatest
        value for the Company. DENTSPLY believes its patents and trademark properties are important and contribute to the Company's marketing position, but it does not consider its overall business to be materially dependent upon any individual patent or trademark.

Employees

As of December 31, 2008, the Company and its subsidiaries employed approximately 9,400 employees. A small percentage of the Company's employees are represented by labor unions. Hourly workers at the Company's Ransom & Randolph facility in Maumee, Ohio are represented by Local No. 12 of the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agriculture Implement Workers of
        America under a collective bargaining agreement that expires on January 31, 2012. Hourly workers at the Company's Midwest Dental Products facility in Des Plaines, Illinois are represented by International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, AFL-CIO in Chicago under a collective bargaining agreement that expires on May 31, 2009. In Germany, approximately 45% of DeguDent employees, approximately 30% of Friadent employees, approximately 23% of VDW employees and approximately
        30% of DeTrey employees are represented by labor unions. The Company provides pension and postretirement benefits to many of its employees (See Note 13, Benefits Plans, to the consolidated financial statements). The Company believes that its relationship with its employees is good.

Environmental Matters

DENTSPLY believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Maintaining this level of compliance has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on the Company's capital expenditures or on its business.

Other Factors Affecting the Business

The Company’s business is subject to quarterly fluctuations with net sales and operating profits historically being higher in the second and fourth quarters. The Company typically implements most of its price changes early in the fourth quarter or beginning of the year. These price changes, other marketing and promotional programs, the management of inventory levels by
        distributors and the implementation of strategic initiatives, may impact sales levels in a given period. Sales for the industry and the Company are generally strongest in the second and fourth calendar quarters and weaker in the first and third calendar quarters, due to the effects of the items noted above and due to the impact of summer holidays and vacations, particularly throughout Europe.

Securities and Exchange Act Reports

DENTSPLY makes available free of charge through its website at www.DENTSPLY.com its Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials are filed with or furnished to, the

Item 1A. Risk Factors

Following are the significant risk factors that could materially impact DENTSPLY’s business. The order in which these factors appear should not be construed to indicate its relative importance or priority.

Negative changes could occur in the dental markets, the general economic environments, or government reimbursement or regulatory programs of the regions in which the Company operates.

The success of the Company is largely dependent upon the continued strength of dental markets and is also somewhat dependent upon the general economic environments of the regions in which it operates. Negative changes to these markets and economies could materially impact the Company's results of operations and financial condition. In addition, many of the Company's markets are
        affected by government reimbursement and regulatory programs. In certain markets, government and regulatory programs have a more significant impact than other markets. Changes to these programs could have a positive or negative impact on the Company's results.

Prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions may affect the Company’s suppliers, customers and consumers, which could harm the Company’s financial position.

Prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions or disruptions of either or both of the financial and credit markets may affect the Company’s supply chain and the customers and consumers of the Company’s products and may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

Due to the Company’s international operations, the Company is exposed to the risk of changes in interest and foreign exchange rates.

DENTSPLY, with its significant international operations, is subject to fluctuations in exchange rates of various foreign currencies and other risks associated with foreign trade and the impact of currency fluctuations in any given period can be favorable or unfavorable. The Company’s balance sheet includes debt and net investment hedges that are sensitive to movements in
        interest and foreign exchange rates. Changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates may have an adverse effect on the Company’s statement of income.

Volatility in the capital markets or investment vehicles could limit our ability to access capital.

Although the Company has had continued solid operating cash flow, the disruption in the credit markets may reduce sources of liquidity available to us. The Company relies on multiple financial institutions to provide funding pursuant to existing and/or future credit agreements, and those institutions may not be able to provide funding in a timely manner, or at all, when the Company
        requires it. The cost of or lack of available credit could impact our ability to develop sufficient liquidity to maintain or grow our business, which in turn may adversely affect the Company’s businesses and results of operations.

The Company also manages cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments through various institutions. There may be a risk of loss on investments based on the volatility of the underlying instruments that will not allow the Company to recover the full principal of its investments.

The market price for the Company’s common stock may be volatile.

DENTSPLY experiences fluctuations in quarterly earnings. As a result, the Company may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause its stock price to decline. The Company’s business is subject to quarterly fluctuations with net sales and operating profits historically being higher in the second and fourth quarters. The Company
        typically implements most of its price changes in the beginning of the fourth quarter or beginning of the year. These price changes, other marketing and promotional programs, which are offered to customers from time to time in the ordinary course of business, the management of inventory levels by distributors and the implementation of strategic initiatives, may impact sales levels in a given period. Net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first and third
        quarters, primarily due not only to increased sales in the quarters preceding the first and third quarters, but also due to the impact of summer holidays and vacations, particularly throughout Europe.

In addition to fluctuations in quarterly earnings, a variety of other factors may have a significant impact on the market price of DENTSPLY’s common stock causing volatility. These factors include, but are not necessarily limited to, the publication of earnings estimates or other research reports and speculation in the press or investment community; changes in the
        Company’s industry and competitors; the Company’s financial condition and cash flows; any future issuances of DENTSPLY’s common stock, which may include primary offerings for cash, stock splits, issuances in connection with business acquisitions, restricted stock and the grant or exercise of stock options from time to time; general market and economic conditions; and any outbreak or escalation of hostilities in areas the Company does business.

Also, the NASDAQ National Market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on the NASDAQ. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of the Company’s common stock, regardless of actual operating performance. In the past, following periods of
        volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies. This type of litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could harm the Company’s business.

The dental supplies market is highly competitive, and there is no guarantee that the Company can compete successfully.

The worldwide market for dental supplies is highly competitive. There can be no assurance that the Company will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and market new products successfully, or that new products and technologies introduced by competitors will not render the Company's products obsolete or noncompetitive. Additionally, the size and number of the
        Company's competitors vary by product line and from region to region. There are many companies that produce some, but not all, of the same types of products as those produced by the Company. Certain of DENTSPLY's competitors may have greater resources than does the Company.

The Company may be unable to develop innovative products or obtain regulatory approval for new products.

DENTSPLY has identified new products as an important part of its growth opportunities. There can be no assurance that DENTSPLY will be able to continue to develop innovative products and that regulatory approval of any new products will be obtained, or that if such approvals are obtained, such products will be favorably accepted in the marketplace. Additionally, there
        is no assurance that entirely new technology or approaches to dental treatment or competitors’ new products will not be introduced that could render the Company's products obsolete.

The Company may fail to comply with regulations issued by the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies.

DENTSPLY's business is subject to periodic review and inspection by the FDA and similar foreign authorities to monitor DENTSPLY's compliance with the regulations administered by such authorities. There can be no assurance that these authorities will not raise compliance concerns. Failure to satisfy any such requirements can result in governmental enforcement actions, including
        possible product seizure, injunction and/or criminal or civil proceedings.

All dental amalgam filling materials, including those manufactured and sold by DENTSPLY, contain mercury. The FDA's Dental Devices Classification Panel, the National Institutes of Health and the U.S. Public Health Service have each indicated that no direct hazard to humans from exposure to dental amalgams has been demonstrated. If the FDA were to reclassify dental mercury and amalgam
        filling materials as classes of products requiring FDA pre-market approval, there can be no assurance that the required approval would be obtained or that the FDA would permit the continued sale of amalgam filling materials pending its determination.

Also, some groups have asserted that disposal of mercury containing products may be harmful to the environment. If governmental authorities elect to place restrictions or significant regulations on the disposal of dental amalgam, that could have an adverse impact on the Company’s sales of dental amalgam.

The Company may be unable to obtain a supply for certain finished goods purchased from third parties.

A significant portion of the Company’s injectible anesthetic products, orthodontic products and cutting instruments are purchased from a limited number of suppliers. As there are a limited number of suppliers for these products, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain an adequate supply of these products in the future.

The Company’s expansion through acquisition involves risks and may not result in the expected benefits.

The Company continues to view acquisitions as a key part of its growth strategy. The Company continues to be active in evaluating potential acquisitions although there is no assurance that these efforts will result in completed transactions as there are many factors that affect the success of such activities. If the Company does succeed in acquiring a business or product, there can be
        no assurance that the Company will achieve any of the benefits that it might anticipate from such an acquisition and the attention and effort devoted to the integration of an acquired business could divert management’s attention from normal business operations. If the Company makes acquisitions, it may incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or create additional expenses, any of which might adversely affect its financial results. Any financing that the Company might need for
        acquisitions may only be available to it on terms that restrict its business or that impose additional costs that reduce its operating results.

Changes in, or interpretations of, accounting principles could result in unfavorable accounting charges.

The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles can have a significant effect on the Company’s
        reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported activity.

The Company’s accounting principles have recently been changed by changes in the accounting principles for accounting for business combinations and related goodwill. In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (revised 2007), (“SFAS 141(R)”),
        “Business Combinations,” which changes the accounting for business combinations including the measurement of acquirer shares issued in consideration for a business combination, the recognition of contingent consideration, the accounting for pre-acquisition gain and loss contingencies, the recognition of capitalized in-process research and development, the accounting for acquisition related restructuring liabilities, the treatment of acquisition related transaction costs and
        the recognition of changes in the acquirer’s income tax valuation allowance. SFAS 141(R) is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS 141(R) will change the Company’s accounting treatment for business combinations on a prospective basis beginning in the first quarter of 2009.

If the Company’s goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, the Company may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.

Under U.S. GAAP, the Company reviews its goodwill and amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of the Company’s goodwill or
        amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in market capitalization or future cash flows, and slower growth rates in the dental industry. The Company may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the Company’s financial statements during the period in which any impairment of the Company’s goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, resulting in an impact on the Company’s results of operations.

Changes in, or interpretations of, tax rules, structures, country profitability mix and regulations may adversely affect the Company’s effective tax rates.

The Company is a U.S. based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Unanticipated changes in the Company’s tax rates could affect its future results of operations. The Company’s future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in, or interpretation of, tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which
        the Company does business, structural changes in the Company’s businesses, by unanticipated decreases in the amount of revenue or earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates, by lapses of the availability of the U.S. research and development tax credit, or by changes in the valuation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities.

The Company faces the inherent risk of litigation.

The Company’s business involves a risk of product liability and other claims, and from time to time the Company is named as a defendant in these cases. The primary risks to which the Company is exposed are related to those products manufactured by the Company. The Company has insurance policies, including product liability insurance, covering these risks in amounts that are
        considered adequate; however, the Company cannot provide assurance that the maintained coverage is sufficient to cover future claims or that the coverage will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost. A successful claim brought against the Company in excess of available insurance, or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against the Company, could harm its business and overall cash flows of the Company. Various parties, including the Company, own and
        maintain patents and other intellectual property rights applicable to the dental field. Although the Company believes it operates in a manner that does not infringe upon any third party intellectual property rights, it is possible that a party could assert that one or more of the Company’s products infringe upon such party’s intellectual property and force the Company to discontinue the sale of certain products.

The Company's success is dependent upon its management and employees

.

The Company's success is dependent upon its management and employees. The loss of senior management employees or any failure to recruit and train needed managerial, sales and technical personnel, could have a material adverse effect on the Company.

- 10 -

The Company may be unable to sustain the operational and technical expertise that is key to its success.

DENTSPLY believes that its manufacturing capabilities are important to its success. The manufacture of the Company's products requires substantial and varied technical expertise. Complex materials technology and processes are necessary to manufacture the Company's products. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain the necessary operational and technical
        expertise that is key to its success.

The Company may not generate sufficient cash flow to service its debt, pay its contractual obligations and operate the business.

DENTSPLY's ability to make payments on its indebtedness and contractual obligations, and to fund its operations depends on its future performance and financial results, which, to a certain extent, are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors and the interest rate environment that are beyond its control. Although Management believes that the
        Company has and will continue to have sufficient liquidity, there can be no assurance that DENTSPLY's business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service its debt, pay its contractual obligations and operate its business.

The Company may not be able to repay its outstanding debt in the event that cross default provisions are triggered due to a breach of loan covenants.

DENTSPLY's existing borrowing documentation contains a number of covenants and financial ratios, which it is required to satisfy. The most restrictive of these covenants pertain to asset dispositions, maintenance of certain levels of net worth, and prescribed ratios of indebtedness to total capital and operating income excluding depreciation and amortization of interest expense. Any
        breach of any such covenants or restrictions would result in a default under the existing borrowing documentation that would permit the lenders to declare all borrowings under such documentation to be immediately due and payable and, through cross default provisions, would entitle DENTSPLY's other lenders to accelerate their loans. DENTSPLY may not be able to meet its obligations under its outstanding indebtedness in the event that any cross default provision is triggered.

Certain provisions in the Company’s governing documents may discourage third party offers to acquire DENTSPLY that might otherwise result in the Company’s stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares.

Certain provisions of DENTSPLY's Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws and of Delaware law could have the effect of making it difficult for a third party to acquire control of DENTSPLY. Such provisions include the division of the Board of Directors of DENTSPLY into three classes, with the three-year term of a class expiring each year, a provision allowing the Board of Directors to
        issue preferred stock having rights senior to those of the common stock and certain procedural requirements which make it difficult for stockholders to amend DENTSPLY's By-laws and call special meetings of stockholders. In addition, members of DENTSPLY's management and participants in its Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”) collectively own approximately 5% of the outstanding common stock of DENTSPLY.

In addition, the Company maintains sales and distribution offices at certain of its foreign and domestic manufacturing facilities, as well as at various other U.S. and international locations. The Company maintains offices in Toronto, Mexico City, Paris, Rome, Weybridge, Hong Kong and Melbourne. Most of these various sites around the world that are used exclusively for sales and
        distribution are leased.

The Company also owns its corporate headquarters located in York, Pennsylvania.

DENTSPLY believes that its properties and facilities are well maintained and are generally suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

On January 5, 1999, the Department of Justice filed a Complaint against the Company in the U.S. District Court in Wilmington, Delaware alleging that the Company’s tooth distribution practices violated the antitrust laws and seeking an order for the Company to discontinue its practices. This case has been concluded and the District Court, upon the direction of the Court of
        Appeals, issued an injunction preventing DENTSPLY from taking action to restrict its tooth dealers in the U.S. from adding new competitive teeth lines.

Subsequent to the filing of the Department of Justice Complaint in 1999, a private party putative class action was filed based on allegations similar to those in the Department of Justice case, on behalf of dental laboratories who purchased Trubyte teeth or products containing Trubyte teeth. The District Court granted the Company’s Motion on the lack of standing of the
        laboratory class action to pursue damage claims. The Plaintiffs appealed this decision to the Third Circuit and the Court largely upheld the decision of the District Court in dismissing the Plaintiffs’ damages claims against DENTSPLY, with the exception of allowing the Plaintiffs to pursue a damage claim based on a theory of resale price maintenance between the Company and its tooth dealers. The Plaintiffs then filed an amended complaint in the District Court asserting that
        DENTSPLY and its tooth dealers, and the dealers among themselves, engaged in a conspiracy to violate the antitrust laws. The District Court has granted the Motions filed by DENTSPLY and the dealers, to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims, except for the resale price maintenance claims. The Plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal of these claims to the Third Circuit. Also pending is a case filed by a manufacturer of a competitive tooth line seeking unspecified damages alleged to have been
        incurred as a result of the Company’s tooth distribution practice found to be a violation of the antitrust law.

On June 18, 2004, Marvin Weinstat, DDS and Richard Nathan, DDS filed a class action suit in San Francisco County, California alleging that the Company misrepresented that its Cavitron® ultrasonic scalers are suitable for use in oral surgical procedures. The Complaint seeks a recall of the product and refund of its purchase price to dentists who have purchased it for use in oral
        surgery. The Court certified the case as a class action in June 2006 with respect to the breach of warranty and unfair business practices claims. The class is defined as California dental professionals who purchased and used one or more Cavitron® ultrasonic scalers for the performance of oral surgical procedures. The Company filed a motion for decertification of the class and this motion was granted. Plaintiffs have appealed the decertification of the class to the California Court
        of Appeals.

On December 12, 2006, a Complaint was filed by Carole Hildebrand, DDS and Robert Jaffin, DDS in the Eastern District of PA. The case was filed by the same law firm that filed the Weinstat case in California. The Complaint asserts putative class action claims on behalf of dentists located in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The Complaint seeks damages and asserts that the Company’s
        Cavitron® ultrasonic scaler was negligently designed and sold in breach of contract and warranty arising from misrepresentations about the potential uses of the product because it cannot assure the delivery of potable or sterile water. Plaintiffs have filed their Motion for class certification to which the Company has filed its response.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The nature and geographic scope of the Company’s business subjects it to changing economic, competitive, regulatory and technological risks and uncertainties. In accordance with the “Safe Harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the Company provides the following cautionary remarks regarding important factors, which, among others,
        could cause future results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, expectations and assumptions expressed or implied herein. All forward-looking statements made by the Company are subject to risks and uncertainties and are not guarantees of future performance. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the Company’s actual results, performance and achievements, or industry results to be
        materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These statements are identified by the use of such terms as “may,” “could,” “expect,” “intend,” “believe,” “plan,” “estimate,” “forecast,” “project,” “anticipate” or words of similar import.

Investors are cautioned that forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may materially affect the Company's business and prospects, and should be read in conjunction with the risk factors and uncertainties discussed within Item 1A, Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed on February 20, 2009. Investors are further cautioned that the risk factors in
        Item 1A, Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K may not be exhaustive and that many of these factors are beyond the Company’s ability to control or predict. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results. The Company undertakes no duty and has no obligation to update forward-looking statements.

OVERVIEW

DENTSPLY International Inc. believes it is the world's largest designer, developer, manufacturer and marketer of professional dental products. The Company is headquartered in the United States ("U.S.") and operates in more than 120 other countries, principally through its foreign subsidiaries. The Company also has strategically located distribution centers to enable it to better
        serve its customers and increase its operating efficiency. While the U.S. and Europe are the Company's largest markets, the Company serves all of the major professional dental markets worldwide.

The principal benchmarks used by the Company in evaluating its business are: (1) internal growth in the U.S., Europe and all other regions; (2) operating margins of each reportable segment; (3) the development, introduction and contribution of innovative new products; (4) growth through acquisition; and (5) continued focus on controlling costs and enhancing efficiency. The Company
        defines “internal growth” as the increase or decrease in net sales from period to period, excluding (1) precious metal content; (2) the impact of changes in currency exchange rates; and (3) the net sales, for a period of twelve months following the transaction date, of businesses that have been acquired or divested.

Management believes that an average overall internal growth rate of 4-6% is a long-term sustainable rate for the Company. The internal growth rate may vary outside of this range based on weaker or stronger economic conditions. Management expects the Company to operate below this range in the near future due to the current adverse economic conditions; however, history shows that
        growth in the dental industry typically performs better than the overall economy. Management expects this trend to continue in light of the current economic environment, although to a lesser degree. The Company typically implements most of its price changes in the beginning of the fourth quarter or beginning of the year. These price changes, other marketing and promotional programs offered to customers from time to time, the management of inventory levels by distributors and the
        implementation of strategic initiatives, may impact sales levels in a given period.

During 2008, the Company's overall internal growth was approximately 3.8% compared to 6.4% in 2007. The decrease in internal growth rate in the U.S. (37.8% of sales) was (0.9%) in 2008 compared to 4.2% in 2007. The internal growth rate in Europe (41.2% of sales) was 7.0% in 2008 compared to 7.3% in 2007. The internal growth rate in all other regions (21.0% of sales) was 7.0% in 2008
        compared to 9.4% in 2007. There can be no assurance that the Company’s assumptions concerning the growth rates in its markets or the dental market generally will continue in the future. If such rates are less than expected, the Company’s projected growth rates and results of operations may be adversely affected.

Due to the international nature of DENTSPLY’s business, movements in global foreign exchange rates may impact the statement of income. With over 60% of the Company’s sales located in regions outside the U.S., the Company’s sales are significantly impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar.

Product innovation is a key component of the Company's overall growth strategy. New advances in technology are anticipated to have a significant influence on future products in dentistry. As a result, the Company continues to pursue several research and development initiatives to support this technological development, including partnerships and collaborations with various research
        institutions and dental schools. In addition, the Company licenses and purchases technologies developed by third parties. Although the Company believes these activities will lead to new innovative dental products, they involve new technologies and there can be no assurance that commercialized products will be developed.

- 25 -

Although the professional dental market in which the Company operates has experienced consolidation, it is still a fragmented industry. The Company continues to focus on opportunities to expand the Company’s product offerings through acquisition. Management believes that there will continue to be adequate opportunities to participate as a consolidator in the industry for the
        foreseeable future (See also Acquisition Activity in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). As further discussed in Note 3, Business Acquisitions, to the consolidated financial statements, during 2008, the Company purchased several businesses.

The Company has always maintained its focus on minimizing costs and achieving operational efficiencies. In response to the recent credit crisis and the recessionary economic conditions, management is concentrating on cost containment that focuses the business on creating and maintaining operational and financial flexibility through control of both fixed and variable costs. Management
        expects to continue to consolidate operations or functions and reduce the cost of those operations and functions while improving service levels. In addition, the Company remains focused on enhancing efficiency through expanded use of technology and process improvement initiatives. The Company believes that the benefits from these opportunities will improve the cost structure and offset areas of rising costs such as energy, employee benefits, and regulatory oversight and
        compliance.

FACTORS IMPACTING COMPARABILITY BETWEEN YEARS

Adoption of SFAS 157, Fair Value Measurement

In 2008, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, (“SFAS 157”) Fair Value Measurement, which requires the Company to define fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), and expand disclosures about fair value measurements.
        As part of the provisions, the Company is required to determine the impact of credit risk on its financial instruments recorded at fair value. As a result, the Company recognized pretax income of $1.8 million during 2008.

Revisions in Classification

Certain revisions in classification have been made to prior years' data in order to conform to current year presentation.

RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS, 2008 COMPARED TO 2007

Net Sales

The discussion below summarizes the Company’s total sales growth, excluding precious metal content, into the following components: (1) internal growth; (2) net acquisition growth; and (3) the impact of foreign currency translation. These disclosures of net sales growth provide the reader with sales results on a comparable basis between periods.

Management believes that the presentation of net sales, excluding precious metal content, provides useful information to investors because a significant portion of DENTSPLY’s net sales is comprised of sales of precious metals generated through sales of the Company’s precious metal dental alloy products, which are used by third parties to construct crown and bridge
        materials. Due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and because the precious metal content of the Company’s sales is largely a pass-through to customers and has minimal effect on earnings, DENTSPLY reports sales both with and without precious metal content to show the Company’s performance independent of precious metal price volatility and to enhance comparability of performance between periods. The Company uses its cost of precious metal purchased as a proxy for the
        precious metal content of sales, since the precious metal content of sales is not separately tracked and invoiced to customers. The Company believes that it is reasonable to use the cost of precious metal content purchased in this manner since precious metal dental alloy sale prices are typically adjusted when the prices of underlying precious metals change.

The presentation of net sales, excluding precious metal content, is considered a measure not calculated in accordance with GAAP, and is therefore considered a non-GAAP measure. The Company provides the following reconciliation of net sales to net sales, excluding precious metal content. The Company’s definitions and calculations of net sales, excluding precious metal content,
        and other operating measures derived using net sales, excluding precious metal content, may not necessarily be the same as those used by other companies.

Internal Sales Growth

United States

The decrease in internal sales growth of (0.9%), excluding precious metal content, in the U.S. was negatively impacted by the supply issues with injectible anesthetics and softness in dental consumables businesses and in the dental specialty businesses in the fourth quarter, as the economy in the U.S. contracted.

Europe

In Europe, the internal sales growth of 7.0%, excluding precious metal content, was driven by strong performance in the dental specialty businesses and growth in the dental consumables businesses partially offset by softness in the dental laboratory businesses due to lower equipment and alloy product sales.

All Other Regions

During 2008, the internal growth of 7.0%, excluding precious metal content, was largely the result of strong growth in the dental specialty category. Asia, Australia, the Middle East and Latin America experienced strong growth.

During 2008, the Company recorded net restructuring, impairment and other costs of $32.4 million. The Company recorded costs of $24.2 million related to legal settlements and impairments of long-lived assets. Additionally, the Company initiated several restructuring plans primarily related to the closure and consolidation of certain production and selling facilities in the U.S.,
        Europe and Asia in order to better leverage the Company’s resources by reducing costs and obtaining operational efficiencies. These restructuring plans included charges of $5.9 million. Additionally, the Company expensed $2.3 million for the fair value of in-process research and development associated with acquired businesses (See Note 14, Restructuring, Impairment and Other Costs, to the consolidated financial statements).

During 2007, the Company recorded net restructuring, impairment and other costs of $10.5 million. Several restructuring plans were initiated during 2007, primarily related to the closure and consolidation of certain production and selling facilities in the U.S., Europe, Asia and South America in order to better leverage the Company’s resources by reducing costs and
        obtaining operational efficiencies. These restructuring plans included charges of $5.4 million. Additionally, the Company also recorded a total of $5.0 million in expenses related to several legal claims and $0.1 million of impairments of long-lived assets.

Net Interest Expense (Income)

The change from net interest income in 2007 to net interest expense in 2008 was mainly the result of the sharp divergence of lower U.S. dollar interest rates versus increased Euro and Swiss franc interest rates, combined with weaker U.S. dollar average exchange rates against both currencies. This resulted in net interest expense in 2008 versus net interest income in 2007 on the Euro
        and Swiss franc net investment hedges executed in the form of cross currency swaps. The impact of the Company’s net investment hedges typically move in the opposite direction of currency movements, reducing some of the volatility caused by movement in exchange rates on the Company’s income and equity. Partially offsetting the net investment hedge impact was higher average investment balances in Euros and lower average interest rates on U.S. dollar debt.

Other Expense (Income), Net

Other Expense (Income), net, in the 2008 period included $8.9 million of currency transaction losses and $0.6 million of other non-operating losses. The 2007 period included $0.5 million of currency transaction gains and $0.1 million of other non-operating gains. Currency exchange rate volatility was extremely high, especially during the fourth quarter of 2008, and global
        currencies weakened versus the U.S. dollar. The Company incurred transaction losses, mostly in the fourth quarter of 2008, on settlement of intercompany and third party transactions.

The Company’s effective tax rates for 2008 and 2007 were 20.1% and 27.5%, respectively. The Company’s operating tax rates for 2008 and 2007 were 25.9% and 30.4%, respectively. The Company benefited from various tax adjustments of $17.1 million and $9.9 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The 2008 and 2007 tax related adjustments primarily resulted from payments and
        settlements and expiration of statutes.

Net Income

Fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations during 2008 were $1.87 compared to $1.68 during the same period in 2007. Net income in 2008 includes an after tax impact from restructuring costs and charges related to in-process research and development of $19.8 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, a net tax benefit of $17.1 million, or $0.11 per diluted share due to
        tax related adjustments, and an after tax impact from provisions of a SFAS 157 adjustment of $1.1 million, or $0.01 per diluted share. Net income for 2007 includes an after tax impact from restructuring costs of $6.7 million, or $0.04 per diluted share and a net tax benefit of $9.9 million, or $0.06 per diluted share due to tax related adjustments.

Operating Segment Results

In January 2007, the Company reorganized its operating group structure expanding into four operating groups from the three groups under the prior management structure. These operating groups are considered the Company’s reportable segments under  SFAS131 as the Company’s chief operating decision-maker regularly reviews financial results at the operating group level
        and uses this information to manage the Company’s operations. Each of these operating groups covers a wide range of product categories and geographic regions.

- 29 -

The product categories and geographic regions often overlap across the groups. Further information regarding the details of each group is presented in Note 4, Segment and Geographic Information, to the consolidated financial statements. The management of each group is evaluated for performance and incentive compensation purposes on net third party sales, excluding precious metal content, and segment operating
        income.

Net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased 7.5% during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. This increase was driven by acquisition related growth and positive currency translation. Supply issues with injectible anesthetics as well as softness in the U.S. dental consumables businesses in the fourth quarter due to a weakening economy hindered the growth within
        the segment.

Operating income increased $24.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The increase was due to improved margins due to favorable product mix across most of the segment and acquisitions.

The net sales growth, excluding precious metal content, of 12.1% was comprised of 6.4% of internal growth, 4.1% of foreign currency translation and 1.6% related to acquisitions. The 6.4% internal growth was comprised of 4.2% in the U.S., 7.3% in Europe and 9.4% for all other regions combined.

Internal Sales Growth

United States

The internal sales growth of 4.2%, excluding precious metal content, in the U.S. was a result of continued growth in the dental specialty category, and improved growth in the dental laboratory and dental consumable product categories.

Europe

In Europe, the internal sales growth of 7.3%, excluding precious metal content, was driven by the continued strong sales growth in the dental specialty category and partially offset by lower internal growth in the dental consumables and dental laboratory categories. Additionally, the Company believes that a significant contraction in the alloy products market occurred, in part, due to
        the dramatic increase in the price of alloy metals and to the shift toward all ceramic products in the past few years.

All Other Regions

The internal growth of 9.4% in all other regions was largely the result of strong growth in the dental specialty category. In addition, during 2007, the Pacific Rim, Canada, Middle East and Australia regions experienced strong internal growth.

The remaining increase in SG&A expenses is primarily a result of increased sales and marketing expenditures to support growth in the dental specialty businesses and higher
        growth regions, partially offset by lower stock compensation expense as a result of accelerated vesting in 2006. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, excluding precious metal content, decreased from 37.4% in 2006 to 37.1% in 2007. The 2007 expense ratio was favorably impacted by lower stock based compensation and improved leverage on the investments in strategic initiatives.

During 2007, the Company recorded net restructuring, impairment and other costs of $10.5 million. The Company initiated several restructuring plans primarily related to the closure and consolidation of certain production and selling facilities in the U.S., Europe, Asia and South America in order to better leverage the Company’s resources by reducing costs and obtaining
        operational efficiencies. These restructuring plans included charges of $5.4 million. Additionally, the Company also recorded a total of $5.0 million in expenses related to several legal claims and $0.1 million of impairments of long-lived assets. (See also Note 14, Restructuring, Impairment and Other Costs, to the consolidated financial statements).

During 2006, the Company recorded net restructuring, impairment and other costs of $7.8 million. The net costs of $7.8 million were primarily for additional restructuring costs incurred related to the decision to shut down the pharmaceutical manufacturing facility in Chicago, Illinois and costs related to the consolidation of certain U.S. and European selling and production
        facilities. These restructuring costs were partially offset by the gain of $2.9 million on the sale of the assets previously associated with the pharmaceutical manufacturing facility, which the Company had announced in early 2006 that it would be closing. Additionally, these costs were further offset by the gain of $1.0 million on the sale of assets associated with a German manufacturing facility, which was closed down in 1998 as part of a restructuring plan.

Net Interest (Income) Expense

The change in net interest income in 2007 compared to 2006 was mainly the result of lower average debt and investment levels following the Euro 350.0 million Eurobond maturity in December, 2006, offset somewhat by higher average interest rates. In addition, higher average interest rates on Euro and Swiss franc basis swaps combined with weaker U.S. dollar average exchange rates against
        both currencies resulted in lower net interest received on the Company’s net investment hedges (See also Note 5, Other (Expense) Income, to the consolidated financial statements).

Net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased 9.8% during the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. This increase was driven by positive growth, acquisition related activity and positive currency translation. The implementation of the U.S Strategic Partnership Program hindered this segment in both 2007 and 2006.

Operating income decreased $4.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The decrease was due to higher expense allocation from Corporate headquarters of sales and marketing expenses to better reflect activity within the segment. This decrease was partially offset by the favorable impact from acquisition activity and currency translation.

France, United Kingdom, Italy, CIS, Middle East, Africa, Pacific Rim Businesses

Net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased 14.1%, including the favorable impact of currency translation, during the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. Strong growth occurred in CIS, Middle East, United Kingdom and Pacific Rim businesses.

Operating income increased $4.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase was primarily related to sales growth and currency translation.

Net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased 12.1%, including the favorable impact of currency translation, during the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. Strong growth occurred in the Orthodontic, Endodontic and Canadian businesses.

Operating income increased $9.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in operating profits was driven primarily by sales growth across the segment, partially offset by the additional operational investment into the combined Endodontic/Implant businesses in the U.S. The increase was also related to positive currency translation.

Global Dental Laboratory Business/Implants/Non-Dental

Net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased 12.7%, including favorable impact of currency translation, during the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. Strong growth occurred in the Implants business, and the U.S. dental laboratory business also grew at a faster rate in 2007. Additionally, the Company believes that a significant contraction in the alloy products
        market occurred, in part, due to the dramatic increase in the price of precious metals and the move to all ceramic products, such as the Company's Cercon® product, in the past few years.

Operating income increased $17.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in operating profits was driven primarily by the sales growth in the Implants business.  In addition, operating profit was positively impacted from currency translation.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

Since approximately 62% of the Company's 2008 net sales, excluding precious metal content, were generated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to those currencies affects the results of operations of the Company. The impact of currency fluctuations in any given period can be favorable or unfavorable. The impact of foreign currency
        fluctuations of European currencies on operating income is partially offset by sales in the U.S. of products sourced from plants and third party suppliers located overseas, principally in Germany and Switzerland.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES

The Company has identified below the accounting estimates believed to be critical to its business and results of operations. These critical estimates represent those accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments.

Accounts Receivable

The Company sells dental products both through a worldwide network of distributors and directly to end users. For customers on credit terms, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluation of those customers' financial condition and generally does not require collateral from them. The Company establishes allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability
        of its customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, their ability to make required payments may become impaired, and increases in these allowances may be required.  In addition, a negative impact on sales to those customers may occur.

- 35 -

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The cost of inventories is determined primarily by the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) or average cost methods, with a small portion being determined by the last in, first-out (“LIFO”) method. The Company establishes reserves for inventory estimated to be obsolete or unmarketable equal to the difference
        between the cost of inventory and estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those anticipated, additional inventory reserves may be required.

Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets

The Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (“SFAS 142”), “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” which requires that at least an annual impairment test be applied to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. The Company performs impairment tests on at least an annual basis using a fair value approach. If impairment related to
        goodwill is identified under SFAS 142, the resulting charge is determined by recalculating goodwill through a hypothetical purchase price allocation of the fair value and reducing the current carrying value to the extent it exceeds the recalculated goodwill. If impairment is identified on indefinite-lived intangibles, the resulting charge reflects the excess of the asset’s carrying cost over its fair value.

Other long-lived assets, such as definite intangible assets and fixed assets, are amortized or depreciated over their estimated useful lives. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 (“SFAS 144”), “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
        circumstances provide evidence that suggest that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable with impairment being based upon an evaluation of the identifiable undiscounted cash flows. If impaired, the resulting charge reflects the excess of the asset’s carrying cost over its fair value.

Assessment of the potential impairment of goodwill, indefinite-lived, definite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets is an integral part of the Company’s normal ongoing review of operations. Testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management’s best estimates at a particular point in time. The
        dynamic economic environments in which the Company’s businesses operate and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices, increased competition and introductions of new technologies can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests. Estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. Changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and
        magnitude of impairments, as well as the time at which such impairments are recognized. If there are unfavorable changes in these assumptions, particularly changes in the Company’s discount rates, earnings multiples and future cash flows, the Company may be required to recognize impairment charges. If the overall global economy continues to experience recessionary conditions, the economic outlook for the assets being evaluated could also result in impairment charges being
        recognized. Information with respect to the Company’s significant accounting policies on goodwill, indefinite-lived and definite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets are included in Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 (“SFAS 133”), “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” on January 1, 2001. This standard, as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138 (“SFAS 138”), “Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging
        Activities,” Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 149 (“SFAS 149”), “Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”, and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 155 (“SFAS 155”), “Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments - an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140,” requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and that changes
        in fair value be recorded each period in current earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Substantially all of the employees of the Company and its subsidiaries are covered by government or Company-sponsored defined benefit or defined contribution plans. Additionally, certain union and salaried employee groups in the U.S. are covered by postretirement healthcare plans. Costs for Company-sponsored plans are based on expected return on plan assets, discount rates,
        employee compensation increase rates and health care cost trends. Expected return on plan assets, discount rates and health care cost trend assumptions are particularly important when determining the Company’s benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs associated with postretirement benefits. Changes in these assumptions can impact the Company’s pretax earnings. In determining the cost of postretirement benefits, certain assumptions are established annually to
        reflect market conditions and plan experience to

- 36 -

appropriately reflect the expected costs as actuarially determined. These assumptions include medical inflation trend rates, discount rates, employee turnover and mortality rates. In establishing its discount rates, the Company predominantly uses observed indices of high-grade corporate bond yields with durations that are equivalent to the expected duration of the underlying liability. The discount rate
        for each plan is based on observed corporate bond yield indices in the respective economic region covered by the plan. The expected return on plan assets is the weighted average long-term expected return based upon asset allocations and historic average returns for the markets where the assets are invested, principally in foreign locations. Additional information related to the impact of changes in these assumptions is provided in Note 13, Benefit Plans, to the consolidated financial
        statements.

Litigation

The Company and its subsidiaries are from time to time parties to lawsuits arising out of their respective operations. The Company records liabilities when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. These estimates made by management are based on an analysis made by internal and external legal counsel who considers information known at the time. The Company believes it has
        estimated liabilities for probable losses well in the past; however, the unpredictability of litigation and court decisions could cause a liability to be incurred in excess of estimates. Legal costs related to these lawsuits are expensed as incurred.

Accruals for Product Returns, Customer Rebates and Product Warranties

The Company makes provisions for customer returns, customer rebates and for product warranties at the time of sale. These accruals are based on past history, projections of customer purchases and sales and expected product performance in the future. Because the actual results for product returns, rebates and warranties are dependent in part on future events, these matters require the
        use of estimates. The Company has a long history of product performance in the dental industry and thus has an extensive knowledge base from which to draw in measuring these estimates.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are determined using the liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 109 (“SFAS 109”), “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Under SFAS 109, tax expense includes the U.S. and international income taxes plus the provision for U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of international
        subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested.

Certain items of income and expense are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized in future years. The Company establishes a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for
        which realization is not likely. As of December 31, 2008, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $36.7 million against the benefit of certain net operating loss carryforwards of foreign and domestic subsidiaries.

The Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and in the normal course of business is examined in various jurisdictions. The reversal of the accruals is recorded when examinations are completed, statutes of limitation are closed or tax laws are changed.

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN 48”), “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes,” which clarifies the accounting for income taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for
        the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Interpretation requires that the Company recognize in the financial statements, the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and

Cash flows from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2008 were $336.0 million compared to $387.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease of $51.7 million was primarily the result of higher earnings in the 2008 period being offset by higher tax payments and unfavorable working capital changes versus the prior year. While net income from
        continuing operations increased by $24.2 million to $283.9 million, the Company had higher tax payments in 2008. The increase in tax payments versus the prior year is a result of higher earnings in the current year and utilization in 2007 of a net operating loss. Increased days in inventory and days outstanding in accounts receivable resulted in a $44.8 million use of cash flow. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the number of days for sales outstanding in accounts receivable and
        days in inventory were 54 days and 100 days, respectively, compared to the previous year of 51 days and 95 days, respectively.

Investing activities during 2008 include capital expenditures of $76.4 million. Activity related to the acquisition of businesses, for the year ended December 31, 2008, was $117.3 million, which was primarily due to the acquisition of Zhermack S.p.A., several small companies in 2008 and final payments on three acquisitions from previous years. (See Note 3, Business Acquisitions, to
        the consolidated financial statements).

At December 31, 2008, the Company had authorization to maintain up to 17.0 million shares of treasury stock under its stock repurchase program as approved by the Board of Directors. Under this program, the Company purchased approximately 3.0 million shares during 2008 at an average price of $37.91. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company held 14.2 million and 12.0 million shares
        of treasury stock, respectively. The Company also received proceeds of $12.7 million primarily as a result of 0.7 million stock option exercises during the year ended December 31, 2008.

DENTSPLY's total debt at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $427.7 million and $482.3 million, respectively. The Company’s long-term borrowings decreased by a net of $54.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. This change included a net reduction in borrowings of $86.3 million during the year ended 2008, plus an increase of $31.7 million due to exchange rate
        fluctuations on debt denominated in foreign currencies. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company’s ratio of long-term debt to total capitalization decreased to 21.2% compared to 24.1% at December 31, 2007.

Under its multi-currency revolving credit agreement, the Company is able to borrow up to $500.0 million through May 2010. This facility is unsecured and contains certain affirmative and negative covenants relating to its operations and financial condition. The most restrictive of these covenants pertain to asset dispositions and prescribed ratios of indebtedness to total capital and
        operating income, excluding depreciation and amortization, to interest expense. At December 31, 2008, the Company was in compliance with these covenants. The Company also has available an aggregate $250.0 million under its U.S. commercial paper facility. The multi-currency revolving credit facility serves as a back-up to the commercial paper facility. The total available credit under the commercial paper facility and the multi-currency facility in the aggregate is $500.0 million with
        $114.3 million outstanding under the multi-currency facility and none outstanding under the commercial paper facility at December 31, 2008.

The Company also has access to $65.2 million in uncommitted short-term financing under lines of credit from various financial institutions. The lines of credit have no major restrictions and are provided under demand notes between the Company and the lending institutions. At December 31, 2008, $21.8 million is outstanding under these short-term lines of credit.

At December 31, 2008, the Company had total unused lines of credit related to the revolving credit agreement and the uncommitted short-term lines of credit of $426.1 million. At December 31, 2008, the Company held $78.1 million of precious metals on consignment from several financial institutions. These consignment agreements allow the Company to acquire the precious metal at market rates at a point in time, which is approximately the same time, and for the same price as
        alloys are sold to the Company’s customers. In the event that the financial institutions would discontinue offering these consignment arrangements, and if the Company could not obtain other comparable arrangements, the Company may be required to obtain third party financing to fund an ownership position in the required precious metal inventory levels. The Company's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased $112.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2008 to
        $204.2 million. In 2008, the Company had net purchases of $112.6 million in treasury stock. The net reduction in borrowings was primarily due to the repatriation of $144.0 million and short-term intercompany loans of $160.0 million from foreign subsidiaries used to repay U.S. commercial paper of $159.3 million.

On July 25, 2008, the Company entered into a Term Loan Agreement with a group of lenders providing financing in the amount of 12.6 billion Japanese Yen at a floating rate of three month Yen Libor plus 72.5 basis points through March 28, 2012. The net proceeds after deducting fees and expenses of the loan are 12.5 billion Japanese Yen or approximately $117.9 million. The proceeds were
        used to refinance debt borrowed under the revolving credit facility. The obligations of the Company and the lenders are subject to the terms and conditions of the Term Loan Agreement.

On March 13, 2007, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with a group of initial purchasers, providing for the issuance of $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due in 2010 through a private placement. The net proceeds from the offering after deducting placement fees and expenses of the offering was $149.5 million. The obligations of
        DENTSPLY and the initial purchasers are subject to the terms and conditions of the Note Purchase Agreement.

Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2008, the Company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority; and therefore, $23.3 million of the unrecognized tax benefit has been excluded from the contractual
        obligations table above (See Note 12, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements).

The Company expects on an ongoing basis to be able to finance cash requirements, including capital expenditures, stock repurchases, debt service, operating leases and potential future acquisitions, from the current cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balances, funds generated from operations and amounts available under its existing credit facilities, which is further
        discussed in Note 10, Financing Arrangements. The Company continues to generate strong cash flows from operations, which is used to finance the Company’s activities.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141(R) (“SFAS 141(R)”), “Business Combinations.” It requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction, establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired
        and liabilities assumed, and requires the acquirer to disclose the nature and financial effect of the business combination. SFAS 141(R) is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160 (“SFAS 160”), “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements.” This Statement amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, “Consolidated Financial Statements,” to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a
        subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company will adopt SFAS 160 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009. The adoption will reclassify the minority interests currently reported in the liabilities section of the balance sheet to the equity section of the balance sheet.

In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 161 (“SFAS 161”), ”Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” SFAS 161 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. This statement amends and expands the disclosure requirements of SFAS 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
        Hedging.” The Company will adopt SFAS 161 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 and the adoption will further expand the Company’s footnotes for derivatives.

In May 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 162 (“SFAS 162”), “The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.” This statement identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are
        presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. This standard will have no impact on the Company’s financial statements.

In December 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) No. FAS 132(R)-1, “Employer’s Disclosure about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets.” The FSP provides guidance on an employer’s disclosure about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or
        other postretirement plan. The FSP is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009 with early application permitted. Upon initial application, the provisions of this staff position are not required for earlier periods that are presented for comparative periods. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting this staff position on its disclosures.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

The information provided below about the Company's market sensitive financial instruments includes “forward-looking statements” that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. The Company's major market risk exposures are changing interest rates, movements in foreign
        currency exchange rates and potential price volatility of commodities used by the Company in its manufacturing processes. The Company's policy is to manage interest rates through the use of floating rate debt and interest rate swaps to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate, based

upon market conditions. The Company employs foreign currency denominated debt and currency swaps which serve to partially offset the Company's exposure on its net
        investments in subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies. The Company's policy generally is to hedge major foreign currency transaction exposures through foreign exchange forward contracts. These contracts are entered into with major financial institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. In order to limit the unanticipated earnings fluctuations from volatility in commodity prices, the Company selectively enters into commodity swaps to convert variable raw material costs
        to fixed costs. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. The Company is subject to other foreign exchange market risk exposure in addition to the risks on its financial instruments, such as possible impacts on its pricing and production costs, which are difficult to reasonably predict, and have therefore not been included in the table below. All items described are non-trading and are stated in U.S. dollars.

Financial Instruments

The fair value of financial instruments is determined by reference to various market data and other valuation techniques as appropriate. The Company believes the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable (net of allowance for doubtful accounts), prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, income
        taxes payable and notes payable approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The Company estimates the fair value and carrying value of its total debt was $427.7 million as of December 31, 2008. The fair value of the Company’s long-term debt equaled its carrying value as the Company’s debt is variable rate and reflects current market rates. The interest rates on private placement notes, revolving debt and commercial paper are variable and
        therefore the fair value of these instruments approximates carrying values.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company employs derivative financial instruments to hedge certain anticipated transactions, firm commitments, and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Additionally, the Company utilizes interest rate swaps to convert floating rate debt to fixed rate, cross currency basis swaps to convert debt denominated in one currency to another currency and commodity swaps
        to fix its variable raw materials.

Foreign Exchange Risk Management

The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to selectively hedge assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Market value gains and losses are recognized in income currently and the resulting gains or losses offset foreign exchange gains or losses recognized on the foreign currency assets and
        liabilities hedged.

The Company selectively enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge anticipated purchases of product to effectively fix certain variable costs. These forwards are used to stabilize the cost of certain of the Company's products. The Company generally accounts for the forward foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133. As a result, the Company records the
        fair value of the contract primarily through other comprehensive income based on the tested effectiveness of the forward foreign exchange contracts. Realized gains or losses in other comprehensive income are released and recorded to costs of products sold as the products associated with the forward foreign exchange contracts are sold. The Company measures the effectiveness of cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions on a spot to spot basis rather than on a forward to forward basis.
        Accordingly, any time value component of the hedge fair value is deemed ineffective and will be reported currently as interest expense in the period which it is applicable. The spot to spot change in the derivative fair value will be deferred in other comprehensive income and released and recorded to costs of products sold as the products associated with the forward foreign exchange contracts are sold. Any cash flows associated with these instruments are included in cash from operations
        in accordance with the Company’s policy of classifying the cash flows from these instruments in the same category as the cash flows from the items being hedged.

Determination of hedge activity is based upon market conditions, the magnitude of the foreign currency assets and liabilities, and perceived risks. The Company’s significant contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2008 are summarized in the table that follows. These foreign exchange contracts generally have maturities of less than twelve months and the counterparties to the
        transactions are typically large international financial institutions.

The Company has numerous investments in foreign subsidiaries. The net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to volatility in currency exchange rates. Currently, the Company uses both non-derivative financial instruments, including foreign currency denominated debt held at the parent company level and derivative financial instruments to hedge some of this exposure. Translation gains
        and losses related to the net assets of the foreign subsidiaries are offset by gains and losses in the non-derivative and derivative financial instruments designated as hedges of net investments, which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income.

In the first quarter of 2005, the Company entered into cross currency interest rate swaps with a notional principal value of Swiss francs 457.5 million paying three month Swiss franc Libor and receiving three month U.S. dollar Libor on $384.4 million. In the first quarter of 2006, the Company entered into additional cross currency interest rate swaps with a notional
        principal value of Swiss francs 55.5 million paying three month Swiss franc Libor and receiving three month U.S. dollar Libor on $42.0 million. In the fourth quarter

of 2006, the Company entered into additional cross currency interest rate swaps with a notional principal value of Swiss francs 80.4 million paying three month Swiss franc Libor and receiving three month U.S. dollar Libor on $64.4 million. In the first quarter of 2007, the Company entered into
        additional cross currency interest rate swaps with a notional principal value of Swiss francs 56.6 million paying three month Swiss franc Libor and receiving three month U.S. dollar Libor on $46.3 million. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company entered into cross currency interest rate swaps with a notional principal value of Euro 358.0 million paying three month Euro Libor and receiving three month U.S. dollar Libor on $419.7 million. The Swiss franc and Euro cross
        currency interest rate swaps are designated as net investment hedges of the Swiss and Euro denominated net assets. The interest rate differential is recognized in the earnings as interest income or interest expense as it is accrued. The foreign currency revaluation is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax effects.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had Euro-denominated, Swiss franc-denominated, and Japanese yen-denominated debt and cross currency interest rate swaps (at the parent company level) to hedge the currency exposure related to a designated portion of the net assets of its European, Swiss and Japanese subsidiaries. The fair value of the cross currency interest rate swap
        agreements is the estimated amount the Company would (pay) receive at the reporting date, taking into account the effective interest rates and foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, the estimated net fair values of the cross currency interest rate swap agreements were negative $148.9 million and negative $138.1 million, respectively, which are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax effects. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the
        accumulated translation gains on investments in foreign subsidiaries, primarily denominated in Euros, Swiss francs and Japanese Yen, net of these net investment hedges, were $77.5 million and $156.8 million, respectively, which were included in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax effects. The Company’s outstanding debt denominated in foreign currencies and the outstanding cross currency interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2008 are summarized in the table that
        follows.

Interest Rate Risk Management

The Company uses interest rate swaps to convert a portion of its variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has three groups of significant variable rate to fixed rate interest rate swaps. One of the groups of swaps has notional amounts totaling 12.6 billion Japanese Yen, and effectively
        converts the underlying variable interest rates to an average fixed rate of 1.6% for a term of ten years, ending in March 2012. Another swap has a notional amount of 65.0 million Swiss francs, and effectively converts the underlying variable interest rates to a fixed rate of 4.2% for a term of seven years, ending in March 2012. A third group of swaps has a notional amount of $150.0 million, and effectively converts the underlying variable interest rates to a fixed rate of 3.9% for a
        term of two years, ending March 2010.

Commodity Risk Management

The Company selectively enters into commodity swaps to effectively fix certain variable raw material costs. These swaps are used purely to stabilize the cost of components used in the production of certain of the Company's products. The Company generally accounts for the commodity swaps as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133. As a
        result, the Company records the fair value of the swap primarily through other comprehensive income based on the tested effectiveness of the commodity swap. Realized gains or losses in other comprehensive income are released and recorded to costs of products sold as the products associated with the commodity swaps are sold. The Company measures the effectiveness of cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions on a spot to spot basis rather than on a forward to forward basis.
        Accordingly, any time value component of the hedge fair value is deemed ineffective and will be reported currently as interest expense in the period which it is applicable. The spot to spot change in the derivative fair value will be deferred in other comprehensive income and released and recorded to costs of products sold as the products associated with the forward foreign exchange contracts are sold. Any cash flows associated with these instruments are included in cash from operations
        in accordance with the Company’s policy of classifying the cash flows from these instruments in the same category as the cash flows from the items being hedged. The Company’s significant contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2008 are summarized in the table that follows.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

Consignment Arrangements

The Company consigns the precious metals used in the production of precious metal dental alloy products from various financial institutions. Under these consignment arrangements, the banks own the precious metal, and, accordingly, the Company does not report this consigned inventory as part of its inventory on its consolidated balance sheet. These agreements are cancelable by either
        party at the end of each consignment period, which typically run for a period of one to nine months; however, because the Company typically has access to numerous financial institutions with excess capacity, consignment needs created by cancellations can be shifted among the other institutions. The consignment agreements allow the Company to take ownership of the metal at approximately the same time customer orders are received and to closely match the price of the metal acquired to the
        price charged to the customer (i.e., the price charged to the customer is largely a pass through).

As precious metal prices fluctuate, the Company evaluates the impact of the precious metal price fluctuation on its target gross margins for precious metal dental alloy products and revises the prices customers are charged for precious metal dental alloy products

- 41 -

accordingly, depending upon the magnitude of the fluctuation. While the Company does not separately invoice customers for the precious metal content of precious metal dental alloy products, the underlying precious metal content is the primary component of the cost and sales price of the precious metal dental alloy products. For practical purposes, if the precious metal prices go up or down by a small
        amount, the Company will not immediately modify prices, as long as the cost of precious metals embedded in the Company’s precious metal dental alloy price closely approximates the market price of the precious metal. If there is a significant change in the price of precious metals, the Company adjusts the price for the precious metal dental alloys, maintaining its margin on the products.

At December 31, 2008, the Company had 113,263 troy ounces of precious metal, primarily gold, platinum and palladium, on consignment for periods of less than one year with a market value of $78.1 million. Under the terms of the consignment agreements, the Company also makes compensatory payments to the consignor banks based on a percentage of the value of the consigned precious metals
        inventory. At December 31, 2008, the average annual rate charged by the consignor banks was 1.91% These compensatory payments are considered to be a cost of the metals purchased and are recorded as part of the cost of products sold.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
        financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. A Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; provide reasonable assurance that transactions
        are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
        statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management of the Company has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008. In making its assessment, management used the criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
        (COSO). Based on its assessment management concluded that, as of December 31, 2008, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on the criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders

of DENTSPLY International Inc.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a) (1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of DENTSPLY International Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008 in
        conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
        December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and the financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
        reporting, included in “Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting” appearing under Item 15(a)(1). Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (U.S.). Those standards require that we plan
        and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
        overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a
        reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
        procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
        management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

DENTSPLY INTERNATIONAL INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

NOTE 1 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Significant accounting policies employed by the Company are discussed below and in other notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Description of Business

DENTSPLY designs, develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of products for the dental market. The Company believes that it is the world's leading manufacturer and distributor of dental prosthetics, precious metal dental alloys, dental ceramics, endodontic instruments and materials, prophylaxis paste, ultrasonic scalers and crown and bridge materials; the leading United
        States ("U.S.") manufacturer and distributor of dental handpieces, dental x-ray film holders and film mounts, and a leading worldwide manufacturer or distributor of dental injectable anesthetics, impression materials, orthodontic appliances, dental cutting instruments and dental implants. The Company distributes its dental products in over 120 countries under some of the most well established brand names in the industry.

DENTSPLY is committed to the development of innovative, high quality, cost effective products for the dental market.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all majority-owned subsidiaries in which the Company exercises control (collectively the "Company"). Investments in 20% to 50% owned companies in which the Company significantly influences operating and financial policy are accounted for by the equity method unless the investment is a consolidated variable
        interest entity. The Company’s equity in the net income (loss) of these companies is not material. The Company consolidates all variable interest entities where it is the primary beneficiary. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ("U.S. GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense
        during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates, if different assumptions are made or if different conditions exist.

- 52 -

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include deposits with banks as well as highly liquid time deposits with original maturities at the date of purchase of ninety days or less.

Short-term Investments

Short-term investments are highly liquid time deposits with original maturities at the date of purchase greater than ninety days and with remaining maturities of approximately one year or less.

Accounts and Notes Receivable-Trade

The Company sells dental products through a worldwide network of distributors and directly to end users. For customers on credit terms, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluation of those customers' financial condition and generally does not require collateral from them. The Company establishes allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of
        its customers to make required payments. Accounts and notes receivable-trade is stated net of these allowances that were $19.4 million and $18.9 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company recorded provisions for doubtful accounts, included in “Selling, general and administrative expenses,” of approximately $3.9 million for 2008, $2.7 million for 2007, and $2.1 million for 2006.

Certain of the Company’s customers are offered cash rebates based on targeted sales increases. In accounting for these rebate programs, the Company records an accrual as a reduction of net sales for the estimated rebate as sales take place throughout the year in accordance with EITF 01-09, “Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller
        of the Vendor's Products).”

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the cost of $9.6 million, or 3.1%, and $10.6 million, or 4.1%, respectively, of inventories was determined by the last in, first-out (“LIFO”) method. The cost of other inventories was determined by the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) or average cost methods. The Company
        establishes reserves for inventory estimated to be obsolete or unmarketable equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.

If the FIFO method had been used to determine the cost of LIFO inventories, the amounts at which net inventories are stated would be higher than reported at December 31, 2008 and 2007 by $3.5 million and $4.4 million, respectively.

Valuation of Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets

Assessment of the potential impairment of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets is an integral part of the Company’s normal ongoing review of operations. Testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management’s best estimates at a particular point in time. The dynamic
        economic environments in which the Company’s businesses operate and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices, increased competition and introductions of new technologies can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests. Estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. Changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude
        of impairments, as well as the time at which such impairments are recognized. If there are unfavorable changes in these assumptions, particularly changes in the Company's discount rates, earnings multiples and future cash flows, the Company may be required to recognize impairment charges. If the overall global economy continues to experience recessionary conditions, the economic outlook for the assets being evaluated could also result in impairment charges being recognized.
        Information with respect to the Company’s significant accounting policies on long-lived assets for each category of long-lived asset is discussed below.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Except for leasehold improvements, depreciation for financial reporting purposes is computed by the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: buildings - generally 40 years and machinery and equipment - 4 to 15 years. The cost of leasehold improvements is
        amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the term of the lease. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations; replacements and major improvements are capitalized. These assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 (“SFAS 144”), “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
        Assets.” Impairment is based upon an evaluation of the identifiable undiscounted cash flows.  If impaired, the resulting charge reflects the excess of the asset's carrying cost over its fair value.

- 53 -

Identifiable Finite-lived Intangible Assets

Identifiable finite-lived intangible assets, which primarily consist of patents, trademarks and licensing agreements, are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. These assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS 144. At
        a minimum, the Company reviews all of its intangible assets for impairment annually. The Company closely monitors intangible assets related to new technology for indicators of impairment as these assets have more risk of becoming impaired. Impairment is based upon an evaluation of the identifiable undiscounted cash flows. If impaired, the resulting charge reflects the excess of the asset’s carrying cost over its fair value.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

The Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (“SFAS 142”), “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” which requires that at least an annual impairment test be applied to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. The Company performs impairment tests on at least an annual basis using a fair value approach
        rather than an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows. If impairment is identified on goodwill under SFAS 142, the resulting charge is determined by recalculating goodwill through a hypothetical purchase price allocation of the fair value and reducing the current carrying value to the extent it exceeds the recalculated goodwill. If impairment is identified on indefinite-lived intangibles, the resulting charge reflects the excess of the asset’s carrying cost over its fair
        value.

The Company performed the required annual impairment tests for 2008 and no impairment was identified. This impairment assessment included an evaluation of eight reporting units. In addition to the annual impairment test, SFAS 142 also requires that impairment assessments be made more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill or
        indefinite-lived intangible assets might be impaired. As the Company learns of such changes in circumstances through periodic analysis of actual events or through the annual development of operating unit business plans in the fourth quarter of each year or otherwise, impairment assessments will be performed as necessary.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 (“SFAS 133”), “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” This standard, as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138 (“SFAS 138”), “Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities”,
        Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 149 (“SFAS 149”), “Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”, and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 155 (“SFAS 155”), “Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140,” requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value and that changes in fair
        value be recorded each period in current earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income.

The Company employs derivative financial instruments to hedge certain anticipated transactions, firm commitments, and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Additionally, the Company utilizes interest rate swaps to convert floating rate debt to fixed rate, fixed rate debt to floating rate, cross currency basis swaps to convert debt denominated in one currency to
        another currency, and commodity swaps to fix its variable raw materials costs.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Substantially all of the employees of the Company and its subsidiaries are covered by government or Company-sponsored defined benefit or defined contribution plans. Additionally, certain union and salaried employee groups in the U.S. are covered by postretirement healthcare plans. Costs for Company-sponsored plans are based on expected return on plan assets, discount rates, employee
        compensation increase rates and health care cost trends. Expected return on plan assets, discount rates and health care cost trend assumptions are particularly important when determining the Company’s benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs associated with postretirement benefits. Changes in these assumptions can impact the Company’s pretax earnings. In determining the cost of postretirement benefits, certain assumptions are established annually to reflect market
        conditions and plan experience to appropriately reflect the expected costs as actuarially determined. These assumptions include medical inflation trend rates, discount rates, employee turnover and mortality rates. The Company predominantly uses liability durations in establishing its discount rates, which are observed from indices of high-grade corporate bond yields in the respective economic regions of the plans. The expected return on plan assets is the weighted average long-term
        expected return based upon asset allocations and historic average returns for the markets where the assets are invested, principally in foreign locations. In accordance with

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158 (“SFAS 158”), “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans,” which is an amendment of SFAS No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R), the Company reports the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on its balance sheets as a net liability or asset. Additional
        information related to the impact of changes in these assumptions is provided in Note 13, Benefit Plans, to the consolidated financial statements.

Litigation

The Company and its subsidiaries are from time to time parties to lawsuits arising out of their respective operations. The Company records liabilities when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. These estimates are made by management based on an analysis made by internal and external legal counsel, which consider information known at the time. Legal costs related to these
        lawsuits are expensed as incurred.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

Accumulated other comprehensive income includes foreign currency translation adjustments related to the Company’s foreign subsidiaries, net of the related changes in certain financial instruments hedging these foreign currency investments. In addition, changes in the Company’s fair value of certain derivative financial instruments and changes in its unrecognized losses and
        prior service costs, net are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. These changes are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income net of any related tax effects. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, these adjustments were net of tax effects of $138.5 million, $111.3 million and $73.6 million, respectively, primarily related to foreign currency translation adjustments.

The balances included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets are as follows:

The cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments included translation gains of $278.1 million and $331.1 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, offset by losses of $108.5 million and $90.0 million, respectively, on loans designated as hedges of net investments.

Foreign Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated at exchange rates on the balance sheet date and revenue and expenses are translated at the average year-to-date rates of exchange. The effects of these translation adjustments are reported in stockholders' equity within accumulated other comprehensive income. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company had
        translation losses of $53.0 million, and losses of $18.5 million on its loans designated as hedges of net investments. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company had translation gains of $114.6 million, partially offset by losses of $8.4 million on its loans designated as hedges of net investments. During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company had translation gains of $89.0 million, partially offset by losses of $9.9 million on its loans designated as hedges of net
        investments.

Exchange gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved and translation adjustments in countries with highly inflationary economies are included in income. Exchange losses of $8.9 million, exchange gains of $0.5 million and exchange losses of $0.2 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, are included
        in “Other expense (income), net.”

Revenue Recognition

Revenue, net of related discounts and allowances, is recognized when the earnings process is complete. This occurs when products are shipped to or received by the customer in accordance with the terms of the agreement, title and risk of loss have been transferred, collectibility is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable. Net sales include shipping and handling costs
        collected from customers in connection with the sale. Sales taxes, value added taxes and other similar types of taxes collected from customers in connection with the sale are recorded by the Company on a net basis and are not included in the statement of income.

A portion of the Company’s net sales is comprised of sales of precious metals generated through its precious metal dental alloy product offerings. As the precious metal content of the Company’s sales is largely a pass-through to customers, the Company uses its cost of precious metal purchased as a proxy for the precious metal content of sales, as the precious metal content
        of sales is not separately tracked and invoiced to customers. The Company believes that it is reasonable to use the cost of precious metal content purchased in this manner since precious metal alloy sale prices are typically adjusted when the prices of underlying precious metals change. The precious metals content of sales was $199.9 million, $189.9 million and $187.4 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Cost of Sales

Cost of sales represents costs directly related to the manufacture and distribution of the Company’s products. Primary costs include raw materials, packaging, direct labor, overhead, shipping and handling, warehousing and the depreciation of manufacturing, warehousing and distribution facilities. Overhead and related expenses include salaries, wages, employee benefits,
        utilities, lease costs, maintenance and property taxes.

Warranties

The Company provides warranties on certain equipment products. Estimated warranty costs are accrued when sales are made to customers. Estimates for warranty costs are based primarily on historical warranty claim experience.

Selling, General and Administrative

Selling, general and administrative expenses represent costs incurred in generating revenues and in managing the business of the Company. Such costs include advertising and other marketing expenses, salaries, employee benefits, incentive compensation, research and development, travel, office expenses, lease costs, amortization of capitalized software and depreciation of administrative
        facilities.

Research and Development Costs

Research and development (“R&D”) costs relate primarily to internal costs for salaries and direct overhead costs. In addition, the Company contracts with outside vendors to conduct R&D activities. All such R&D costs are charged to expense when incurred. The Company capitalizes the costs of equipment that have general R&D uses and expenses such equipment
        that is solely for specific R&D projects. The depreciation related to the capitalized equipment is included in the Company’s R&D costs. R&D costs are included in “Selling, general and administrative expenses” and amounted to approximately $52.3 million, $46.8 million and $44.4 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Stock Compensation

The Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R) (“SFAS 123(R)”), “Share-Based Payments,” which requires that compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements. The cost of share-based payments is measured at the grant date, based on the calculated fair value of the award, and is
        recognized as an expense over the employee’s requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the equity awards). The compensation cost is only recognized for the portion of the awards that are expected to vest. The Company also follows the disclosure requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (“SFAS 123”), “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148
        (“SFAS 148”), “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure.”

- 56 -

Income Taxes

Income taxes are determined using the liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with SFAS 109. Under SFAS 109, tax expense includes the U.S. and international income taxes plus the provision for the U.S. taxes on

undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested. Tax credits and
        other incentives reduce tax expense in the year the credits are claimed. Certain items of income and expense are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized in future years. The Company establishes a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which realization is not
        likely.

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN 48”), “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes,” which clarifies the accounting for income taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for
        the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Interpretation requires that the Company recognize in the financial statements, the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and
        disclosure.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period, adjusted for the effect of an assumed exercise of all dilutive options outstanding at the end of the period.

Business Acquisitions

The Company frequently purchases businesses and occasionally purchases partial interests in businesses. These acquisitions are accounted for as purchases and result in the recognition of goodwill in the Company’s financial statements. This goodwill arises because the purchase prices for these businesses reflect a number of factors including the future earnings and cash flow
        potential of these businesses; the multiple to earnings, cash flow and other factors at which similar businesses have been purchased by other acquirers; the competitive nature of the process by which the Company acquired the business; and because of the complementary strategic fit and expected synergies these businesses bring to existing operations.

The Company makes an initial allocation of the purchase price at the date of acquisition based upon its understanding of the fair market value of the acquired assets and liabilities. The Company obtains this information during due diligence and through other sources. In the months after closing, as the Company obtains additional information about these assets and liabilities and
        learns more about the newly acquired business, it is able to refine the estimates of fair market value and more accurately allocate the purchase price. Examples of factors and information that the Company uses to refine the allocations include: tangible and intangible asset evaluations and appraisals; evaluations of existing contingencies and liabilities; product line integration information; and information systems compatibilities. The only items considered for subsequent adjustment
        are items identified as of the acquisition date. Subsequent to the purchase date, the Company continues to evaluate the initial purchase price allocations for the acquisitions and will adjust the allocations as additional information relative to the estimated integration costs of the acquired businesses and the fair market values of the assets and liabilities of the businesses become known. These purchase price adjustments can occur for up to one year from the acquisition
        date.

Segment Reporting

The Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131 (“SFAS 131”), “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.” SFAS 131 establishes standards for disclosing information about reportable segments in financial statements. The Company has numerous operating businesses covering a wide range of products and geographic
        regions, primarily serving the professional dental market. Professional dental products represented approximately 97% of sales in 2008, 2007 and 2006. In 2008, the Company had four reportable segments and a description of the activities of these segments is included in Note 4, Segment and Geographic Information, to the consolidated financial statements.

Fair Value Measurement

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157 (“SFAS 157”), “Fair Value Measurements,” which requires the Company to define fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and expand disclosures about fair value
        measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years.

- 57 -

On February 12, 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. SFAS 157-2, “Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157,” which amends SFAS 157 by delaying its effective date by one year for non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring
        basis.

Therefore, beginning on January 1, 2008, this standard applies prospectively to new fair value measurements of financial instruments and recurring fair value measurements of non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities. On January 1, 2009, the standard will also apply to all other fair value measurements. As a result of the adoption of SFAS 157 for financial assets and liabilities, the Company recognized pretax income of $1.8 million.
        The Company has presented the required disclosures in Note 16, Fair Value Measurement.

Fair Value Option

In February 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159 (“SFAS 159”), “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.” SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. This will allow
        entities the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently. SFAS 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2007. While SFAS 159 became effective for the Company’s 2008 fiscal year, the Company did not elect the fair value measurement option for any of the Company’s financial assets or liabilities not already recorded at fair value.

Revisions in Classification

Certain revisions of classification have been made to prior years' data in order to conform to current year presentation.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141(R) (“SFAS 141(R)”), “Business Combinations,” which changes the accounting for business combinations including the measurement of acquirer shares issued in consideration for a business combination, the recognition of contingent consideration, the accounting for pre-acquisition
        gain and loss contingencies, the recognition of capitalized in-process research and development, the accounting for acquisition related restructuring liabilities, the treatment of acquisition related transaction costs and the recognition of changes in the acquirer’s income tax valuation allowance. SFAS 141(R) is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS 141(R) will change the Company’s accounting treatment for business
        combinations on a prospective basis beginning in the first quarter of 2009.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160 (“SFAS 160”), “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements.” This Statement amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, “Consolidated Financial Statements,” to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a
        subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company will adopt SFAS 160 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009. The adoption will reclassify the minority interests currently reported in the liabilities section of the balance sheet to the equity section of the balance sheet.

In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 161 (“SFAS 161”), “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” SFAS 161 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. This statement amends and expands the disclosure requirements of SFAS 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
        Hedging.” The Company will adopt SFAS 161 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 and the adoption will have no impact on the Company’s financial statements. The adoption will further expand the Company’s footnotes for derivatives.

In May 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 162 (“SFAS 162”), “The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.” This statement identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are
        presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. This standard will have no impact on the Company’s financial statements.

In December 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) No. FAS 132(R)-1, “Employer’s Disclosure about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets.” The FSP provides guidance on an employer’s disclosure about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. The FSP is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009 with
        early application permitted. Upon initial application, the provisions of this staff position are not required for earlier periods that are presented for comparative periods. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting this staff position on its disclosures.

NOTE 2 - EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

On May 10, 2006, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend. This stock split became effective on July 17, 2006 and has been retroactively reflected for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share:

NOTE 3 - BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS

The Company accounts for all acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting; and accordingly, the results of the operations acquired are included in the accompanying financial statements for the periods subsequent to the respective dates of the acquisitions.

During 2008, the acquisition related activity was $117.3 million, net of cash and assumed debt. This activity was related to three business combinations, the acquisition and consolidation of two variable interest entities (“VIEs”), and three earn-out payments on acquisitions from prior years.

Business Combinations

The following list provides information about the companies acquired in 2008, excluding the VIEs:

•

In July 2008, the Company acquired Dental Depot Lomberg B.V. (“Lomberg”), which markets and sells various dental products, including but not limited to, orthodontic products and materials. Lomberg is included in the Canada/Latin America/ Endodontics/ Orthodontics segment and further strengthens the Company’s dental specialty
                        business.

- 60 -

•

In July 2008, the Company acquired E.S. Holding N.V. (“E.S. Holding”), which manufactures, markets and sells dental products, particularly dental laboratory products, and non-dental products. E.S. Holding is included in the Global Dental Laboratory Business/Implants/Non-Dental segment and further strengthens the Company’s dental
                        specialty and laboratory businesses.

•

In December 2008, the Company acquired the assets of Apollonia & Fama Impant S.r.l. (“AFI”), which markets and sells dental implant products in Italy. AFI is included in the France, United Kingdom, Italy, CIS, Middle East, Africa and Pacific Rim Businesses segment and further strengthens the Company’s dental specialty
                        business.

Variable Interest Entities

During 2006, the Company acquired a 40% interest in Materialise Dental N.V. (“Materialise”). The transaction provides the opportunity for the Company to acquire the remaining interest over time. The Company accounted for the initial purchase of 40% interest under the equity method.

In 2007, Materialise received a $2.7 million uncollateralized loan of which the Company funded $1.1 million, which was equivalent to its ownership interest. The loan has a five-year term and was issued to support Materialise’s working capital. If the Company purchases additional shares subsequent to December 31, 2009 under the provisions of the Sale and
        Purchase Agreement (“SPA”), the loan is repayable immediately.

In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company purchased an additional 6% interest in Materialise, a simulation software company and a leading manufacture of a variety of surgical guides to assist in the placement of dental implants. The purchase of additional interest increases the Company’s total ownership to 46%, and creates a reconsideration event under the
        provisions of FIN 46(R). The Company determined it was the primary beneficiary based on the purchase of the additional 6% ownership interest and existing provisions in the SPA. The results and preliminary estimates of fair values of assets acquired and liabilities of Materialise has been included in the Company’s financial statements and included in the Global Dental Laboratory Business/Implants/Non-Dental segment. The consolidation of Materialise further strengthens the
        Company’s product offerings in the dental specialty business.

On December 31, 2008, the Company acquired a 60% interest in Zhermack S.p.A. (“Zhermack”), a manufacturer, designer, marketer, and seller of dental consumables products. The Company determined that Zhermack is considered a VIE due to disproportionate voting rights. Under the provisions of FIN 46(R), the Company is considered the primary beneficiary
        based on its total ownership interest in Zhermack and its opportunity to acquire the remaining interest over time. The preliminary estimates of fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed of Zhermack has been included in the Company’s financial statements and included in the U.S., Germany, and Certain Other European Regions Consumable Businesses segment. The consolidation of Zhermack further strengthens the Company’s product offerings in the dental consumables
        businesses.

Additional Earn-out Payments

Several of the Company’s 2005 and 2007 acquisitions included provisions for possible additional payments based on the future performance of the individual businesses (generally for two to three years). During 2008, the Company paid $10.0 million in additional purchase price under these agreements. Several of the 2007 and 2008
        acquisitions still have potential additional payments based on future operating performance of the businesses that could be paid out over the next 5 years.

Purchase Price Allocations for the Business Acquisitions, VIEs, and Additional Earnout Payments

The purchase prices have been allocated on the basis of preliminary estimates of fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and have been included in the accompanying financial statements since the effective date of the respective transaction. The Company is currently evaluating the valuations assigned to the intangible assets for Zhermack, and expects to have the final
        valuations completed by June 30, 2009. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a total of $164.2 million in goodwill related to unallocated portions of the respective purchase prices for the three business combinations, two VIEs and additional earn-out payments on acquisitions from prior years. None of this goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

NOTE 4 - SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

Segment Information

The operating businesses are combined into operating groups, which have overlapping product offerings, geographical presence, customer bases, distribution channels and regulatory oversight. These operating groups are considered the Company's reportable segments under SFAS 131 as the Company's chief operating decision-maker regularly reviews financial results at
        the operating group level and uses this information to manage the Company's operations. The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described for the consolidated financial statements in the summary of significant accounting policies (See Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements). The Company measures segment income for reporting purposes as net operating profit before restructuring, impairment, interest and taxes. A
        description of the services provided within each of the Company’s four reportable segments is provided below. The disclosure below reflects the Company's segment reporting structure through December 31, 2008.

A description of the activities of the Company’s four reportable segments follows:

United States, Germany, and Certain Other European Regions Consumable Businesses

Significant interdependencies exist among the Company's operations in certain geographic areas. Inter-group sales are at prices intended to provide a reasonable profit to the manufacturing unit after recovery of all manufacturing costs and to provide a reasonable profit for purchasing locations after coverage of selling, general and administrative costs.

Generally, the Company evaluates performance of the operating groups based on the groups' operating income and net third party sales, excluding precious metal content. The Company considers net third party sales, excluding precious metal content, as the appropriate sales measurement due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and due to the fact that the precious metal content is
        largely a pass-through to customers and has minimal effect on earnings.

The following table sets forth information about the Company’s operating groups for the year-end December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.

NOTE 8 – GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET

The Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (“SFAS 142”), “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” This statement requires that the amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets be discontinued and instead an annual impairment test approach be applied. The impairment tests are required to be performed
        annually (or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets might be impaired) and are based upon a fair value approach rather than an evaluation of undiscounted cash flows. The Company performs its annual goodwill impairment test in the second quarter of each year. If goodwill impairment is identified, the resulting charge is determined by recalculating goodwill through a hypothetical purchase price allocation of the
        fair value and reducing the current carrying value to the extent it exceeds the

recalculated goodwill. If impairment is identified on indefinite-lived intangibles, the resulting charge reflects the excess of the asset’s carrying cost over its fair value. Other intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives.

The Company performed the required annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2008. No impairment of goodwill was identified in 200 and $2.7 million of impairment of definite-lived intangible assets was identified and recorded in 2008. This impairment assessment included an evaluation of eight reporting units. In addition to minimum annual impairment
        tests, SFAS 142 also requires that impairment assessments be made more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets might be impaired. As the Company learns of such changes in circumstances through periodic analysis of actual results or through the annual development of operating unit business plans in the fourth quarter of each year, for example, impairment assessments will be performed as necessary. The table below
        presents the net carrying values of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets.

The change in the net carrying value of goodwill from 2007 to 2008 was due to foreign currency translation adjustments, five acquisitions, additional payments based on the performance of the previously acquired businesses, and changes to the purchase price allocations. The purchase price allocation changes were primarily related to the reversal of pre-acquisition tax contingencies due
        to expiring statutes, and the finalization of purchase price allocation on 2007 acquisitions.

NOTE 10 - FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS

Short-Term Borrowings

Short-term bank borrowings amounted to $21.8 million and $1.1 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The weighted average interest rates of these borrowings were 5.3% and 3.4% at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Unused lines of credit for short-term financing at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $43.4 million and $34.8 million, respectively. Substantially all other short-term borrowings
        were classified as long-term as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, reflecting the Company's intent and ability to refinance these obligations beyond one year and are included in the table below. The unused lines of credit have no major restrictions and are provided under demand notes between the Company and the lending institution. Interest is charged on borrowings under these lines of credit at various rates, generally below prime or equivalent money rates.

The individual borrowings under the revolving credit agreement are structured to mature on a quarterly basis but because the Company has the intent and ability to extend them until the expiration date of the
        agreement, these borrowings are considered contractually due in May 2010 and March 2012.

The Company utilizes interest rate swaps to convert the Swiss franc denominated debt under the revolving facility to fixed rate debt. The Company utilizes interest rate swaps to convert the variable rate variable rate Japanese yen and U.S. dollar denominated private placement notes to fixed rate debt. The Company's use of interest rate swaps is further described in Note 15, Financial
        Instruments and Derivatives, to the consolidated financial statements.

The Company has a $500.0 million revolving credit agreement with participation from thirteen banks. The revolving credit agreements contain a number of covenants and two financial ratios, which the Company is required to satisfy. The most restrictive of these covenants pertain to asset dispositions and prescribed ratios of indebtedness to total capital and operating income excluding
        depreciation and amortization to interest expense. Any breach of any such covenants or restrictions would result in a default under the existing borrowing documentation that would permit the lenders to declare all borrowings under such documentation to be immediately due and payable and, through cross default provisions, would entitle the Company's other lenders to accelerate their loans. At December 31, 2008, the Company was in compliance with these covenants. The Company pays a
        facility fee of 0.10% annually on the amount of the commitment under the $500.0 million five-year facility. The entire $500.0 million revolving credit agreement has a usage fee of 0.10% annually if utilization exceeds 50% of the total available facility. Interest rates on amounts borrowed under the facility will depend on the maturity of the borrowing, the currency borrowed, the interest rate option selected, and the Company’s long-term credit rating from Standard and
        Poor’s.

The Company has a U.S. dollar commercial paper facility totaling $250.0 million, which has utilization, dealer and annual appraisal fees which on average cost 0.11% annually. The $500.0 million revolving credit facility acts as back-up credit to this commercial paper facility. The total available credit under the commercial paper facility and the revolving credit facility is
        $500.0million. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had no outstanding commercial paper and $114.3 million in revolving credit obligations.

On July 25, 2008, the Company entered into a Term Loan Agreement with a group of lenders providing financing in the amount of 12.6 billion Japanese Yen at a floating rate of three month Yen Libor plus 72.5 basis points through March 28, 2012. The net proceeds after deducting fees and expenses of the loan are 12.5 billion Japanese Yen or approximately $117.9
        million. The proceeds were used to refinance debt borrowed under the revolving credit facility. The obligations of the Company and the lenders are subject to the terms and conditions of the Term Loan Agreement.

On March 13, 2007, the Company entered into a note purchase agreement with a group of initial purchasers, providing for the issuance of $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due 2010 (the “Notes”) through a private placement.

The Company maintains the 2002 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) under which it may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSU”) and stock appreciation rights, collectively referred to as “Awards”. Awards are granted at exercise prices that approximate the fair market value of the
        common stock on the grant date. The Plan authorized grants of 14,000,000 shares of common stock, plus any unexercised portion of canceled or terminated stock options granted under the DENTSPLY International Inc. 1993 and 1998 Plans, subject to adjustment as follows: each January, if 7% of the total outstanding common shares of the Company exceed 14,000,000, the excess becomes available for grant under the Plan. No more than 2,000,000 shares may be awarded as restricted stock and
        restricted stock units, and no key employee may be granted restricted stock units in excess of 150,000 shares of common stock in any calendar year. The number of shares available for grant under the 2002 Plan as of December 31, 2008 is 4.1 million.

Stock options generally expire ten years after the date of grant under these plans and grants become exercisable over a period of three years after the date of grant at the rate of one-third per year, except when they become immediately exercisable upon death, disability or qualified retirement. Restricted stock units vest 100% on the third anniversary of the date of grant and are
        subject to a service condition, which requires grantees to remain employed by the Company during the three-year period following the date of grant. In addition to the service condition, certain key executives are subject to performance requirements. The fair value of each RSU

- 73 -

assumes that performance goals will be achieved. If such goals are not met, no compensation cost is recognized and any recognized compensation costs is reversed. Under the terms of the RSU’s, the three-year period is referred to as the restricted period. RSU’s and the rights under the award may not be sold, assigned, transferred, donated, pledged or otherwise disposed of during the three year
        restricted period prior to vesting. Upon the expiration of the applicable restricted period and the satisfaction of all conditions imposed, all restrictions imposed on RSU’s will lapse, and one share of common stock will be issued as payment for each vested RSU.

The stock option expense shown in the preceding table represents the aggregate fair value of shares vested during the year ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. There were 3.1 million non-qualified stock options unvested as of December 31, 2008. The remaining unamortized compensation cost related to non-qualified stock options is $22.8 million, which will be expensed over the
        weighted average remaining vesting period of the options, or 1.9 years. The unamortized compensation cost related to RSUs is $7.4 million, which will be expensed over the remaining weighted average restricted period of the RSUs, or 1.6 years.

Under SFAS 123(R), the Company continues to use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of each option awarded.

The Company has $24.7 million of foreign tax credit carryforwards $7.7 million, $7.1 million and $9.9 million will expire in 2015, 2016 and 2017 respectively.

Certain foreign and domestic subsidiaries of the Company have tax loss carryforwards of $544.1 million at December 31, 2008, of which $442.3 million expire through 2028 and $101.8 million may be carried forward indefinitely. The tax benefit of certain tax loss carryforwards and deferred tax assets has been offset by a valuation allowance as of December 31, 2008, because it is
        uncertain whether the benefits will be realized in the future. The valuation allowance at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $36.7 million and $50.3 million, respectively.

The Company has provided federal income taxes on certain undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries that the Company anticipates will be repatriated. Deferred federal income taxes have not been provided on $538.2 million of cumulative earnings of foreign subsidiaries that the Company has determined to be permanently reinvested. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of
        tax that might be payable on these permanently reinvested earnings.

Tax Contingencies

In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN 48”), “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes,” which clarifies the accounting for income taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement
        of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Interpretation requires that the

- 77 -

Company recognize in the financial statements, the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure.

The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2008, is approximately $23.3 million, of this total, approximately $21.9 million represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective income tax rate. It is reasonably possible that certain amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within
        12 months of the reporting date of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Expiration of statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions could include unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $0.8 million. A favorable unrecognized tax benefit of approximately $7.5 million could occur as a result of final settlement and resolution of outstanding tax matters in foreign jurisdictions during the next twelve months.

The total amounts of interest and penalties, as of December 31, 2008, were $6.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively, and at December 31, 2007, interest and penalties were $10.9 million and $3.6 million, respectively. The Company has consistently classified interest and penalties recognized in its consolidated financial statements as income taxes based on the accounting policy
        election of the Company.

The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. The significant jurisdictions include the U.S., Switzerland and Germany. The Company has substantially concluded all U.S. federal income tax matters for years through 2005, resulting in the years 2006 and 2007 being subject to future potential tax audit adjustments
        while years prior to 2006 are settled. The Company is under audit in Germany from 2001 through 2003. The taxable years that remain open for Switzerland are years 1998 through 2007. For Germany, the open years are from 2001 through 2007.

NOTE 13 - BENEFIT PLANS

Substantially all of the employees of the Company and its subsidiaries are covered by government or Company-sponsored benefit plans. Total costs for Company-sponsored defined benefit, defined contribution and employee stock ownership plans amounted to $21.2 million in 2008, $20.9 million in 2007 and $19.2 million in 2006.

Defined Contribution Plans

In December 2006, the Board of Directors amended the DENTSPLY Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”) and 401(k) plans to redesign the future distribution of allocations of “Covered Compensation,” with a targeted 3% going into the ESOP in Company stock and a targeted 3% going into the 401(k) as a Non-Elective Contribution (“NEC”) in cash. The
        principal driver of this redesign is to provide quicker diversification opportunity to the participants as the investment of the NEC is participant directed. The Company sponsors an employee 401(k) savings plan for its U.S. workforce to which enrolled participants may contribute up to IRS defined limits. The annual expense and cash contribution to the 401(k) is expected to be $5.0 million for 2008, and was $4.6 million in 2007.

The ESOP is a non-contributory defined contribution plan that covers substantially all of the U.S. based non-union employees of the Company. Contributions to the ESOP, net of forfeitures, are expected to be $1.6 million for 2008 (to be contributed in the first quarter of 2009), and were $0.2 million for 2007 (contributed in the first quarter of 2008), and were $0.4 million for
        2006 (contributed in the first quarter of 2007).

- 78 -

All future ESOP allocations will come from a combination of forfeited shares and shares acquired in the open market. The Company has targeted future ESOP allocations at 3% of “Covered Compensation.” The share allocation will be accounted at fair value at the point of allocation, each year-end, in accordance with SOP 93-6, “Employers' Accounting for Employee Stock
        Ownership Plans.”

Defined Benefit Plans

The Company maintains a number of separate contributory and non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement medical plans for certain union and salaried employee groups in the U.S. Pension benefits for salaried plans are based on salary and years of service; hourly plans are based on negotiated benefits and years of service. Annual contributions to
        the pension plans are sufficient to satisfy minimum funding requirements. Pension plan assets are held in trust and consist mainly of common stock and fixed income investments. The U.S. plans are funded in excess of the funding required by the U.S. Department of Labor.

The Company maintains defined benefit pension plans for its employees in Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Taiwan. These plans provide benefits based upon age, years of service and remuneration. Substantially all of the German plans are unfunded book reserve plans. Other foreign plans are not significant individually or in the aggregate. Most employees and retirees
        outside the U.S. are covered by government health plans.

Postretirement Healthcare

The plans for postretirement healthcare have no plan assets. The postretirement healthcare plans cover certain union and salaried employee groups in the U.S. and is contributory, with retiree contributions adjusted annually to limit the Company’s contribution for participants who retired after June 1, 1985. The Company also sponsors unfunded non-contributory postretirement
        medical plans for a limited number of union employees and their spouses and retirees of a discontinued operation.

NOTE 14 – RESTRUCTURING, IMPAIRMENT AND OTHER COSTS

Other costs of $26.5 million for 2008 included costs primarily related to settlements of legal matters and impairment of long-term assets. These other costs are reflected in Restructuring, Impairment and Other Costs in the income statement. Legal settlements are further discussed in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies.

Restructuring Costs

Restructuring costs of $5.9 million for 2008 are reflected in Restructuring, Impairment and Other Costs in the income statement and the associated liabilities are recorded in accrued liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the consolidated condensed balance sheet. These costs consist of employee severance benefits, payments due under operating contracts, and other
        restructuring costs.

During 2008, the Company initiated several restructuring plans primarily related to the integration, reorganization, and closure or consolidation of certain production and selling facilities in order to better leverage the Company’s resources by minimizing costs and obtaining operational efficiencies.

During 2007, the Company initiated several restructuring plans primarily related to the closure and consolidation of certain production and selling facilities in the U.S., Europe, Asia and South America in order to better leverage the Company’s resources by reducing costs and obtaining operational efficiencies.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company’s restructuring accruals were as follows:

NOTE 15 – FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVES

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

The Company's activities expose it to a variety of market risks, which primarily include the risks related to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and commodity prices. These financial exposures are monitored and managed by the Company as part of its overall risk management program. The objective of this risk management program is to reduce the
        volatility that these market risks may have on the Company's operating results and equity.

Certain of the Company's inventory purchases are denominated in foreign currencies, which expose the Company to market risk associated with exchange rate movements. The Company's policy generally is to hedge major foreign currency transaction exposures through foreign exchange forward contracts. These contracts are entered into with major financial institutions thereby minimizing the
        risk of credit loss. In addition, the Company's investments in foreign subsidiaries are denominated in foreign currencies, which create exposures to changes in exchange rates. The Company uses debt and derivatives denominated in the applicable foreign currency as a means of hedging a portion of this risk.

With the Company’s significant level of variable rate long-term debt and net investment hedges, changes in the interest rate environment can have a major impact on the Company’s earnings, depending upon its interest rate exposure. As a result, the Company manages its interest rate exposure with the use of interest rate swaps, when appropriate, based upon market
        conditions.

The manufacturing of some of the Company’s products requires the use of commodities, which are subject to market fluctuations. In order to limit the unanticipated impact on earnings from such market fluctuations, the Company selectively enters into commodity swaps for certain materials used in the production of its products. Additionally, the Company uses non-derivative methods,
        such as the precious metal consignment agreements to effectively hedge commodity risks.

The Company uses interest rate swaps to convert a portion of its variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has three groups of significant variable rate to fixed rate interest rate swaps. One of the groups of swaps has notional amounts totaling 12.6 billion Japanese yen, and effectively converts the underlying variable interest rates to an average
        fixed rate of 1.6% for a term of ten years, ending in March 2012. Another swap has a notional amount of 65.0 million Swiss francs, and effectively converts the underlying variable interest rates to a fixed rate of 4.2% for a term of seven years, ending in March 2012. A third group of swaps has a notional amount of $150.0 million, and effectively converts the underlying variable interest rates to a fixed rate of 3.9% for a term of two years, ending March 2010.

The Company selectively enters into commodity swaps to effectively fix certain variable raw material costs. At December 31, 2008, the Company had swaps in place to purchase 2,310 troy ounces of platinum bullion for use in the production of its impression material products. The average fixed rate of this agreement is $1,446.42 per troy ounce. In addition, the Company had swaps in place
        to purchase 204,000 troy ounces of silver bullion for use in the production of its amalgam products at an average fixed rate of $14.28 per troy ounce. The Company generally may hedge up to 80% of its projected annual needs related to these products.

The Company enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge the foreign currency exposure of its anticipated purchases of certain inventory from Japan. In addition, exchange contracts are used by certain of the Company's subsidiaries to hedge intercompany inventory purchases, which are denominated in non-local currencies. The forward contracts that are used in these programs typically
        mature in twelve months or less. The Company generally may hedge up to 80% of its anticipated purchases from the supplying locations.

As of December 31, 2008, $4.2 million of deferred net losses on derivative instruments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income are expected to be reclassified to current earnings during the next twelve months. This reclassification is primarily due to the sale of inventory that includes previously hedged purchases and interest rate swaps. The maximum term over which the
        Company is hedging exposures to variability of cash flows (for all forecasted transactions, excluding interest payments on variable-rate debt) is eighteen months. Overall, the derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are highly effective. Any cash flows associated with these instruments are included in cash from operations in accordance with the Company’s policy of classifying the cash flows from these instruments in the same category as the cash flows from the items being
        hedged.

The Company has numerous investments in foreign subsidiaries. The net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to volatility in currency exchange rates. Currently, the Company uses non-derivative financial instruments, including foreign currency denominated debt held at the parent company level and derivative financial instruments to hedge some of this exposure. Translation gains and
        losses related to the net assets of the foreign subsidiaries are offset by gains and losses in the non-derivative and derivative financial instruments designated as hedges of net investments.

In the first quarter of 2005, the Company entered into cross currency interest rate swaps with a notional principal value of Swiss francs 457.5 million paying three month Swiss franc Libor and receiving three month U.S. dollar Libor on $384.4 million. In the first quarter of 2006, the Company entered into additional cross currency interest rate swaps with a notional principal value of
        Swiss francs 55.5 million paying three month Swiss franc Libor and receiving three month U.S. dollar Libor on $42.0 million. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company entered into additional cross currency interest rate swaps with a notional principal value of Swiss francs 80.4 million paying three month Swiss franc Libor and receiving three month U.S. dollar Libor on $64.4 million. In the first quarter of 2007, the Company entered into additional cross currency interest rate swaps
        with a notional principal value of Swiss francs 56.6 million paying three month Swiss franc Libor and receiving three month U.S. dollar Libor on $46.3 million. Additionally, in the

- 86 -

fourth quarter of 2005, the Company entered into cross currency interest rate swaps with a notional principal value of Euro 358.0 million paying three month Euro Libor and receiving three month U.S. dollar Libor on $419.7 million. The Swiss franc and Euro cross currency interest rate swaps are designated as net investment hedges of the Swiss and Euro denominated net assets. The interest rate differential
        is recognized in the earnings as interest income or interest expense as it is accrued, the foreign currency revaluation is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax effects.

The fair value of these cross currency interest rate swap agreements is the estimated amount the Company would (pay) receive at the reporting date, taking into account the effective interest rates and foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, the estimated net fair values of the swap agreements were negative $148.9 million and negative $138.1 million,
        respectively, which are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax effects, other noncurrent liabilities and other noncurrent assets.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had Euro-denominated, Swiss franc-denominated, and Japanese yen-denominated debt and cross currency interest rate swaps (at the parent company level) to hedge the currency exposure related to a designated portion of the net assets of its European, Swiss and Japanese subsidiaries. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the accumulated translation
        gains on investments in foreign subsidiaries, primarily denominated in Euros, Swiss francs and Japanese yen, net of these net investment hedges, were $77.6 million and $156.8 million, respectively, which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax effects.

Other

As of December 31, 2008, on a pre-tax basis, the Company had recorded assets representing the fair value of derivative instruments of $4.5 million in “Prepaid expenses and other current assets,” and liabilities representing the fair value of derivative instruments of $8.5 million in “Accrued liabilities” and $157.4 million in “Other noncurrent
        liabilities.” The aggregate pre-tax net fair value of the Company's derivative instruments at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was negative $161.4 million and negative $141.6 million, respectively.

NOTE 16 – FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

The Company records financial instruments at fair value with unrealized gains and losses related to certain financial instruments reflected in AOCI on the consolidated condensed balance sheet. In addition, the Company records non-performance risk adjustments on its financial instruments to the income statement. The Company primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value
        measurements and endeavors to utilize the best available information. Accordingly, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.

The degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability. Pricing observability is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument. Financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices
        generally will have a higher degree of pricing observability and a lesser degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value. Conversely, financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted will generally have less, or no pricing observability and a higher degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value.

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, which among other things, requires enhanced disclosures about financial instruments carried at fair value. SFAS 157 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous
        market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participates on the measurement date. SFAS 157 establishes a hierarchal disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observability utilized in measuring financial instruments at fair value. The three broad levels defined by the SFAS 157 hierarchy are as follows:

Level 1 – Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date.

Level 2 – Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date. The nature of these financial instruments include, derivative instruments whose fair value have been derived using a model where inputs to the model are directly observable in the market, or can be derived principally from or
        corroborated by observable market data.

Level 3 – Instruments that have little to no pricing observability as of the reported date. These financial instruments do not have two-way markets and are measured using management’s best estimate of fair value, where the inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation.

- 87 -

Under SFAS 159, entities are permitted to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company did not elect the fair value measurement option under SFAS 159 for any of the Company’s financial assets or liabilities not already recorded at fair value.

The fair value of financial instruments is determined by reference to various market data and other valuation techniques as appropriate. The Company believes the carrying amounts of accounts receivable (net of allowance for doubtful accounts), prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, income taxes payable and notes payable approximate fair value
        due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The Company estimates the fair value and carrying value of its total debt was $427.7 million as of December 31, 2008. The fair value of the Company’s long-term debt equaled its carrying value as the Company’s debt is variable rate and reflects current market rates. The interest rates on private placement notes, revolving debt and commercial paper are variable and therefore the fair value of these instruments approximates
        their carrying values.

The following table sets forth by level within the fair value hierarchy the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2008, which are classified as “Cash and cash equivalents,” “Other noncurrent assets,” “Other noncurrent liabilities,” and “Accrued
        liabilities.” As required by SFAS 157, financial assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value as of the balance sheet date are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

Derivative valuations are based on observable inputs to the valuation model including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, future commodities prices and credit risks.

The commodity forward purchase contracts, interest rate swaps, and foreign exchange forward contracts are considered cash flow hedges and cross currency interest rate swaps are considered hedge of net investments in foreign operations as discussed in Note 15, Financial Instruments and Derivatives.

NOTE 17 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Leases

The Company leases automobiles and machinery and equipment and certain office, warehouse and manufacturing facilities under non-cancelable operating and capital leases. These leases generally require the Company to pay insurance, taxes and other expenses related to the leased property. Total rental expense for all operating leases was $29.5 million for 2008, $27.4 million for 2007 and
        $23.4 million for 2006.

Litigation

On January 5, 1999, the Department of Justice filed a Complaint against the Company in the U.S. District Court in Wilmington, Delaware alleging that the Company’s tooth distribution practices violated the antitrust laws and seeking an order for the Company to discontinue its practices. This case has been concluded and the District Court, upon the direction of the Court of
        Appeals, issued an injunction preventing DENTSPLY from taking action to restrict its tooth dealers in the U.S. from adding new competitive teeth lines.

Subsequent to the filing of the Department of Justice Complaint in 1999, a private party putative class action was filed based on allegations similar to those in the Department of Justice case, on behalf of dental laboratories who purchased Trubyte teeth or products containing Trubyte teeth. The District Court granted the Company’s Motion on the lack of standing of the
        laboratory class action to pursue damage claims. The Plaintiffs appealed this decision to the Third Circuit and the Court largely upheld the decision of the District Court in dismissing the Plaintiffs’ damages claims against DENTSPLY, with the exception of allowing the Plaintiffs to pursue a damage claim based on a theory of resale price maintenance between the Company and its tooth dealers. The Plaintiffs then filed an amended complaint in the District Court asserting that
        DENTSPLY and its tooth dealers, and the dealers among themselves, engaged in a conspiracy to violate the antitrust laws. The District Court has granted the Motions filed by DENTSPLY and the dealers, to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims, except for the resale price maintenance claims. The Plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal of these claims to the Third Circuit. Also pending is a case filed by a manufacturer of a competitive tooth line seeking unspecified damages alleged to have been
        incurred as a result of the Company’s tooth distribution practice found to be a violation of the antitrust law.

On June 18, 2004, Marvin Weinstat, DDS and Richard Nathan, DDS filed a class action suit in San Francisco County, California alleging that the Company misrepresented that its Cavitron® ultrasonic scalers are suitable for use in oral surgical procedures. The Complaint seeks a recall of the product and refund of its purchase price to dentists who have purchased it for use in oral
        surgery. The Court certified the case as a class action in June 2006 with respect to the breach of warranty and unfair business practices claims. The class is defined as California dental professionals who purchased and used one or more Cavitron® ultrasonic scalers for the performance of oral surgical procedures. The Company filed a motion for decertification of the class and this motion was granted. Plaintiffs have appealed the decertification of the class to the California Court
        of Appeals.

On December 12, 2006, a Complaint was filed by Carole Hildebrand, DDS and Robert Jaffin, DDS in the Eastern District of PA. The case was filed by the same law firm that filed the Weinstat case in California. The Complaint asserts putative class action claims on behalf of dentists located in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The Complaint seeks damages and asserts that the Company’s
        Cavitron® ultrasonic scaler was negligently designed and sold in breach of contract and warranty arising from misrepresentations about the potential uses of the product because it cannot assure the delivery of potable or sterile water. Plaintiffs have filed their Motion for class certification to which the Company has filed its response.

Other

The Company has no material non-cancelable purchase commitments.

The Company has employment agreements with its executive officers. These agreements generally provide for salary continuation for a specified number of months under certain circumstances. If all of the employees under contract were to be terminated by the Company without cause, as defined in the agreements, the Company's liability would be approximately $10.5 million at December 31,
        2008.
