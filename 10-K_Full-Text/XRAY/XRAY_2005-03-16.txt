History and Overview

   DENTSPLY  International Inc.  ("DENTSPLY" or the "Company"),  a Delaware
corporation,  was created by a merger of Dentsply  International Inc. ("Old
Dentsply")  and  GENDEX  Corporation  in 1993.  Old  Dentsply,  founded  in
1899,  was a  manufacturer  and  distributor  of artificial  teeth,  dental
equipment,  and dental consumable  products.  GENDEX,  founded in 1983, was
a manufacturer of dental x-ray  equipment and  handpieces.  On February 27,
2004 the Company  sold the x-ray  equipment  business of the former  GENDEX
Corporation to Danaher  Corporation for $102.5  million.  Reference is made
to the  information  about  discontinued  operations set forth in Note 6 of
the Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

   DENTSPLY is the world's largest  designer,  developer,  manufacturer and
marketer  of  a  broad  range  of  products  for  the  dental  market.  The
Company's  worldwide  headquarters  and  executive  offices  are located in
York, Pennsylvania.

   Through the year ended  December 31, 2004, the Company  operated  within
five  operating  segments  all  of  which  were  primarily  engaged  in the
design,   manufacture   and   distribution  of  dental  products  in  three
principal   categories:   1)  Dental  consumables,   2)  Dental  laboratory
products,  and 3) Specialty dental  products.  In January 2005, the Company
reorganized  its  operating  group  structure  by  consolidating  into four
operating  groups.  Sales of the Company's  dental  products  accounted for
approximately  98% of  DENTSPLY's  consolidated  sales  for the year  ended
December 31, 2004.  The  remaining 2% of  consolidated  sales are primarily
related to materials sold to the investment casting industry.

   The  Company  conducts  its  business  in over  120  foreign  countries,
principally   through   its   foreign   subsidiaries.    DENTSPLY   has   a
long-established   presence   in  Canada  and  in  the   European   market,
particularly  in  Germany,  Switzerland,   France,  Italy  and  the  United
Kingdom.  The Company  also has a  significant  market  presence in Central
and South  America  including  Brazil,  Mexico,  Argentina,  Colombia,  and
Chile;  in  South  Africa;   and  in  the  Pacific  Rim  including   Japan,
Australia,  New Zealand,  China  (including  Hong Kong),  Thailand,  India,
Philippines,  Taiwan,  Korea,  Vietnam  and  Indonesia.  DENTSPLY  has also
established  marketing activities in Moscow,  Russia to serve the countries
of the former Soviet Union.

   For 2004,  2003, and 2002, the Company's sales to customers  outside the
United States,  including export sales,  accounted for  approximately  60%,
58% and 56%,  respectively,  of consolidated  net sales.  Reference is made
to the information  about the Company's  United States and foreign sales by
shipment   origin  and  assets  set  forth  in  Note  4  of  the  Notes  to
Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

   As a  result  of the  Company's  significant  international  operations,
DENTSPLY is subject to  fluctuations  in exchange rates of various  foreign
currencies and other risks  associated  with foreign  trade.  The impact of
currency   fluctuations   in  any  given   period  can  be   favorable   or
unfavorable.  The  impact of  foreign  currency  fluctuations  of  European
currencies on operating  income is partially  offset by sales in the United
States of products  sourced from plants and third party  suppliers  located
overseas,  principally  in Germany  and  Switzerland.  The  Company  enters
into forward  foreign  exchange  contracts  to  selectively  hedge  assets,
liabilities and purchases  denominated in foreign currencies.  Reference is
made  to  the  information   regarding  foreign  exchange  risk  management
activities  set forth in  Quantitative  and  Qualitative  Disclosure  About
Market  Risk  under  Item  7A and  Note  16 of the  Notes  to  Consolidated
Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.





   The  success  of the  Company is largely  dependent  upon the  continued
strength of dental  markets and the general  economic  environments  of the
regions  in which it  operates.  Negative  changes  to  these  markets  and
economies could materially  impact the Company's  results of operations and
financial  condition.  In  addition,  many  of the  Company's  markets  are
affected by government  reimbursement  programs.  Changes to these programs
could have a positive or negative impact on the Company's results.

   Certain provisions of DENTSPLY's Certificate of Incorporation and
By-laws and of Delaware law could have the effect of making it difficult
for a third party to acquire control of DENTSPLY. Such provisions include
the division of the Board of Directors of DENTSPLY into three classes,
with the three-year term of a class expiring each year, a provision
allowing the Board of Directors to issue preferred stock having rights
senior to those of the common stock and certain procedural requirements
which make it difficult for stockholders to amend DENTSPLY's By-laws and
call special meetings of stockholders. In addition, members of DENTSPLY's
management and participants in its Employee Stock Ownership Plan
collectively own approximately 10% of the outstanding common stock of
DENTSPLY, which may discourage a third party from attempting to acquire
control of DENTSPLY in a transaction that is opposed by DENTSPLY's
management and employees.


Principal Products

     The worldwide professional dental industry encompasses the diagnosis,
treatment and prevention of disease and ailments of the teeth, gums and
supporting bone. DENTSPLY's principal dental product categories are dental
consumables, dental laboratory products and dental specialty products. These
products are produced by the Company in the United States and internationally
and are distributed throughout the world under some of the most well-established
brand names and trademarks in the industry, including ANKYLOS(R), AQUASIL(TM),
CAULK(R), CAVITRON(R), CERAMCO(R), CERCON(R), CITANEST(R), DELTON(R),
DENTSPLY(R), DETREY(R), ELEPHANT(R), ESTHET.X(R), FRIALIT(R), GAC
ORTHOWORKS(TM), GOLDEN GATE(R), IN-OVATION(TM), MAILLEFER(R), MIDWEST(R),
MYSTIQUE(TM), NUPRO(R), ORAQIX(R), PEPGEN P-15(TM), POLOCAINE(R), PROFILE(R),
PROTAPER(TM), RINN(R), R&R(R), SANI-TIP(R), THERMAFIL(R), TRUBYTE(R) and
XYLOCAINE(R).

Dental  Consumables.  Consumable  products  consist of dental sundries used
in dental  offices in the  treatment of patients and small  equipment  used
by the dental  professional.  DENTSPLY's  products in this category include
dental  anesthetics,   prophylaxis  paste,   dental  sealants,   impression
materials,   restorative   materials,   bone  grafting   materials,   tooth
whiteners,  and topical  fluoride.  The Company  manufactures  thousands of
different  consumable  products  marketed  under more than a hundred  brand
names.  Small equipment  products  consist of various durable goods used in
dental  offices for  treatment  of  patients.  DENTSPLY's  small  equipment
products  include  high and low speed  handpieces,  intraoral  curing light
systems and  ultrasonic  scalers  and  polishers.  Sales of general  dental
consumables  accounted for approximately 34% of the Company's  consolidated
sales for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Dental  Laboratory  Products.   Laboratory  products  are  used  in  dental
laboratories   in  the   preparation  of  dental   appliances.   DENTSPLY's
products  in  this   category   include   dental   prosthetics,   including
artificial  teeth,  precious  metal dental  alloys,  dental  ceramics,  and
crown and bridge  materials.  Equipment in this category  includes computer
aided machining  (CAM) ceramics  systems and porcelain  furnaces.  Sales of
dental  laboratory   products   accounted  for  approximately  33%  of  the
Company's consolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Dental  Specialty   Products.   Specialty  dental  products  are  used  for
specific  purposes  within  the  dental  office  and  laboratory  settings.
DENTSPLY's  products  in this  category  include  endodontic  (root  canal)
instruments  and  materials,   implants,  and  orthodontic  appliances  and
accessories.  Sales of specialty  products  accounted for approximately 31%
of the Company's consolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2004.






Markets, Sales and Distribution

   DENTSPLY  distributes  approximately  55% of its dental products through
domestic  and  foreign  distributors,   dealers  and  importers.   However,
certain  highly  technical  products such as precious  metal dental alloys,
dental   ceramics,   crown  and  bridge  porcelain   products,   endodontic
instruments  and  materials,  orthodontic  appliances,  implants  and  bone
substitute  and  grafting   materials  are  sold  directly  to  the  dental
laboratory  or dental  professional  in some  markets.  No single  customer
accounted for more than ten percent of consolidated net sales in 2004.

   Reference is made to the  information  about the  Company's  foreign and
domestic  operations  and export  sales set forth in Note 4 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

   Although  much of its  sales  are  made to  distributors,  dealers,  and
importers,  DENTSPLY focuses its marketing efforts on the dentists,  dental
hygienists,  dental assistants,  dental laboratories and dental schools who
are  the end  users  of its  products.  As  part  of  this  end-user  "pull
through" marketing  approach,  DENTSPLY employs  approximately 1,700 highly
trained,   product-specific   sales   and   technical   staff  to   provide
comprehensive  marketing and service  tailored to the particular  sales and
technical  support  requirements  of the  dealers  and the end  users.  The
Company  conducts  extensive  distributor and end-user  marketing  programs
and trains  laboratory  technicians  and  dentists in the proper use of its
products,  introducing  them to the latest  technological  developments  at
its  Educational  Centers  located  throughout  the  world  in  key  dental
markets.  The Company also  maintains  ongoing  relationships  with various
dental  associations  and  recognized  worldwide  opinion  leaders  in  the
dental  field,  although  there  is no  assurance  that  these  influential
dental professionals will continue to support our products.

   DENTSPLY  believes that demand in a given  geographic  market for dental
procedures and products varies  according to the stage of social,  economic
and  technical  development  that  the  market  has  attained.   Geographic
markets  for  DENTSPLY's  dental  products  can  be  categorized  into  the
following three stages of development:

   The United States,  Canada,  Western Europe, the United Kingdom,  Japan,
and  Australia are highly  developed  markets that demand the most advanced
dental  procedures and products and have the highest level of  expenditures
on  dental  care.   In  these   markets,   the  focus  of  dental  care  is
increasingly  upon preventive care and specialized  dentistry.  In addition
to basic  procedures  such as the  excavation  and filling of cavities  and
tooth extraction and denture replacement,  dental professionals  perform an
increasing  volume of  preventive  and cosmetic  procedures.  These markets
require  varied  and  complex  dental   products,   utilize   sophisticated
diagnostic  and imaging  equipment,  and demand high levels of attention to
protection against infection and patient cross-contamination.

   In certain  countries in Central America,  South America and the Pacific
Rim,  dental  care is  often  limited  to the  excavation  and  filling  of
cavities  and other  restorative  techniques,  reflecting  more  modest per
capita   expenditures   for  dental  care.  These  markets  demand  diverse
products  such as high and low  speed  handpieces,  restorative  compounds,
finishing devices and custom restorative devices.

   In the People's Republic of China, India,  Eastern Europe, the countries
of  the  former  Soviet  Union,  and  other  developing  countries,  dental
ailments  are  treated  primarily  through  tooth  extraction  and  denture
replacement.   These   procedures   require  basic  surgical   instruments,
artificial teeth for dentures and bridgework.

   The Company offers  products and equipment for use in markets at each of
these stages of  development.  The Company  believes  that as each of these
markets  develop,  demand  for  more  technically  advanced  products  will
increase.  The Company also believes that its recognized brand names,  high
quality and  innovative  products,  technical  support  services and strong
international   distribution   capabilities   position   it  well  to  take
advantage  of any  opportunities  for growth in all of the markets  that it
serves.





   The Company  believes  that the market for its products  will grow based
on the following factors:

o     Increasing worldwide population.

o     Growth of the  population 65 or older - The  percentage of the United
   States,  European  and  Japanese  population  over age 65 is expected to
   nearly  double by the year  2030.  In  addition  to  having  significant
   needs for dental care,  the elderly are well  positioned  to pay for the
   required  procedures since they control sizable amounts of discretionary
   income.

o     Natural teeth are being  retained  longer - Individuals  with natural
   teeth are much  more  likely  to visit a  dentist  in a given  year than
   those without any natural teeth remaining.

o     The  Changing  Dental  Practice  in the  U.S.  -  Dentistry  in North
   America has been  transformed from a profession  primarily  dealing with
   pain,  infections  and tooth  decay to one with  increased  emphasis  on
   preventive care and cosmetic dentistry.
o     Per capita and  discretionary  incomes  are  increasing  in  emerging
   nations - As personal  incomes  continue to rise in the emerging nations
   of the  Pacific  Rim and Latin  America,  healthcare,  including  dental
   services, are a growing priority.

o     The Company's  business is less  susceptible than other industries to
   general downturns in the economies in which it operates.  Several of the
   products  the  Company  offers  relate  to  dental  procedures  that are
   considered necessary by patients regardless of the economic environment.

Product Development

   Technological   innovation  and  successful   product   development  are
critical to  strengthening  the Company's  prominent  position in worldwide
dental   markets,   maintaining   its   leadership   positions  in  product
categories  where it has a high market share,  and increasing  market share
in product  categories  where gains are possible.  While many of DENTSPLY's
innovations represent  evolutionary  improvements of existing products, the
Company also  continues to  successfully  launch  products  that  represent
fundamental  change.  Its  research  centers  throughout  the world  employ
approximately 400 scientists,  Ph.D.'s, engineers,  technicians and support
staff dedicated to research and product  development.  Approximately  $44.6
million,  $43.3 million,  and $39.9 million,  respectively,  was internally
invested  by  the  Company  in  connection  with  the  development  of  new
products  and in the  improvement  of existing  products in the years ended
2004, 2003, and 2002,  respectively.  In addition, the Company licenses and
purchases  technologies  developed by other third  parties as part of these
activities.

   In 2004, the Company  established an Office of Advanced Technology which
will focus on new and emerging  technologies in dentistry.  The creation of
this function is a critical step in meeting the  Company's  strategic  goal
of taking a leadership role in defining the future of dentistry.

   There can be no  assurance  that  DENTSPLY  will be able to  continue to
develop  innovative  products  and  that  regulatory  approval  of any  new
products will be obtained,  or that if such  approvals  are obtained,  such
products  will be  favorably  accepted  in the  marketplace.  Additionally,
there is no  assurance  that  entirely  new  technology  or  approaches  to
dental  treatment  will not be  introduced  that could render the Company's
products obsolete.


Operating and Technical Expertise

   DENTSPLY believes that its  manufacturing  capabilities are important to
its  success.   The   manufacture  of  the  Company's   products   requires
substantial and varied technical  expertise.  Complex materials  technology
and processes  are necessary to  manufacture  the Company's  products.  The
Company  continues  to  automate  its global  manufacturing  operations  in
order to remain a low cost producer.





   The Company has  constructed  a major dental  anesthetic  filling  plant
outside  Chicago  which was  completed in 2004.  The Company  believes that
this plant will become  operational,  following the approval and validation
of the  manufacturing  practices by the Medicines and  Healthcare  products
Regulatory  Agency  ("MHRA"),  the  agency  responsible  for drug  products
approvals in the United  Kingdom.  The MHRA inspected the plant in November
2004 and we are  awaiting  their  approval.  Upon  approval by the MHRA and
subsequent  approval by the  relative  health  authorities,  the Plant will
begin to supply injectible  anesthetic  product to the Company's markets in
the  United  Kingdom,   Ireland,   Australia,  and  New  Zealand.  We  also
anticipate  making our formal  submission  for  approval to the FDA for the
U.S. and  Canadian  markets in the first  quarter of 2005.  Upon receipt of
FDA  approval,   the  plant  is  expected  to  supply  these  markets  with
injectible  anesthetic  product.  This  initiative is very important to the
Company  since  the  assets  acquired  from  AstraZeneca  did  not  include
production  facilities.  Since the  purchase,  the Company  has  contracted
with  AstraZeneca  and other  third  party  manufacturers  to  produce  the
Company's  injectible  anesthetic product  requirements at their facilities
on a contract  manufacturing  basis  until this plant can  produce  for the
respective  markets.  The supply contracts with AstraZeneca for the markets
in the United  Kingdom,  Ireland,  Australia,  and New Zealand have expired
in  April  2004  and  the  contracts  with  AstraZenaca  for the  U.S.  and
Canadian   markets  will  expire  in  June  2005.  The  Company  has  built
inventory of products  from the  contracted  manufacturers  in an effort to
meet  anticipated  needs  of  the  market  until  the  Company's  plant  is
approved;  however,  there is no assurance that the approvals from the MHRA
or the FDA will be received in a timely  manner to prevent an  interruption
of the supply of inventory.

   The  Company  has  completed  or has in  progress  a number of other key
initiatives  around the world  that are  focused  on  helping  the  Company
improve its operating margins.

o     A Corporate  Purchasing  office has been  established to leverage the
   buying power of Dentsply  around the world and reduce our product  costs
   through lower prices and reduced related overhead.

o     The Company has  centralized  its  warehousing  and  distribution  in
   North  America and Europe.  While the initial  gains from this  strategy
   have been realized,  ongoing efforts are in place to maximize additional
   opportunities  that  can be  gained  through  improving  our  functional
   expertise in supply chain  management.  In an effort to improve customer
   service  levels and reduce  costs,  the Company  relocated  its European
   warehouse from Nijmegen,  The Netherlands to Radolfzell,  Germany in the
   first quarter of 2004.

o     The  Company  considers  the  implementation  of  lean  manufacturing
   techniques as a fundamental  part of its supply chain  strategy.  With a
   focus on reducing  non-value added  activities,  numerous  manufacturing
   sites  have  dramatically  reduced  inventory  levels,  increased  space
   utilization  and  improved  labor  productivity.  This was  accomplished
   while  reducing  manufacturing  lead times and  improving  the Company's
   delivery performance to dealers and end-users.

o     DENTSPLY has seen improved  productivity and cost reductions from the
   formation of a North American Shared  Services  group. As a result,  the
   Company is currently in the process of  establishing  a European  Shared
   Services  group in  Yverdon,  Switzerland  which it  expects to be fully
   implemented by the first quarter of 2006.

o     Information  technology initiatives are underway to generate enhanced
   worldwide financial data, to standardize  worldwide  telecommunications,
   implement  improved  manufacturing and financial  accounting systems and
   an ongoing  training of IT users to maximize the  capabilities of global
   systems.

o     DENTSPLY continues to pursue  opportunities to leverage its assets by
   consolidating  business  units where  appropriate  and to  optimize  its
   diversity of worldwide manufacturing capabilities.







Financing

   DENTSPLY's  long-term  debt at December 31, 2004 was $781.5  million and
the  ratio  of  long-term  debt to total  capitalization  was  35.1%.  This
capitalization  ratio is down from 54.3% at December 31, 2001,  the quarter
in which the Degussa Dental  acquisition was completed.  DENTSPLY may incur
additional  debt  in  the  future,  including  the  funding  of  additional
acquisitions  and  capital   expenditures.   DENTSPLY's   ability  to  make
payments on its  indebtedness,  and to fund its  operations  depends on its
future performance and financial  results,  which, to a certain extent, are
subject to general economic, financial,  competitive,  regulatory and other
factors and the  interest  rate  environment  that are beyond its  control.
Although  Management  believes  that the Company  has and will  continue to
have  sufficient  liquidity,  there  can be no  assurance  that  DENTSPLY's
business will generate  sufficient  cash flow from operations in the future
to service its debt and operate its business.

   The Company's cash increased $342.6 million during the year ended
December 31, 2004 to $506.4 million. The Company has continued to
accumulate cash in 2004 rather than reduce debt due to pre-payment
penalties that would be incurred in retiring debt and the related
interest rate swap agreements in addition to the low cost of this debt,
net of earnings on the cash.

   DENTSPLY's  existing  borrowing   documentation  contains  a  number  of
covenants  and financial  ratios which it is required to satisfy.  The most
restrictive of these covenants pertain to asset  dispositions,  maintenance
of certain levels of net worth,  and prescribed  ratios of  indebtedness to
total capital and operating  income plus  depreciation  and amortization to
interest  expense.  Any breach of any such covenants or restrictions  would
result in a default under the existing  borrowing  documentation that would
permit the lenders to declare all borrowings  under such  documentation  to
be  immediately  due and payable and,  through  cross  default  provisions,
would  entitle   DENTSPLY's   other  lenders  to  accelerate  their  loans.
DENTSPLY  may not be able to meet its  obligations  under  its  outstanding
indebtedness  in the event that any cross  default  provision is triggered.
At December 31, 2004, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.

   The  Company has $69.8  million of  long-term  borrowings  coming due in
2005.  Additional  information about DENTSPLY's working capital,  liquidity
and  capital   resources  is  provided  in  "Management's   Discussion  and
Analysis of Financial  Condition and Results of  Operations" in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.


Competition

   The Company  conducts its operations,  both domestic and foreign,  under
highly competitive  market  conditions.  Competition in the dental products
industry is based primarily upon product performance,  quality,  safety and
ease  of  use,  as  well  as  price,   customer  service,   innovation  and
acceptance by  professionals  and technicians.  DENTSPLY  believes that its
principal   strengths  include  its   well-established   brand  names,  its
reputation  for  high-quality  and innovative  products,  its leadership in
product  development  and  manufacturing,  and its  commitment  to customer
satisfaction.

   The size and number of the  Company's  competitors  vary by product line
and from region to region.  There are many  companies  that  produce  some,
but not  all,  of the same  types of  products  as  those  produced  by the
Company.  Certain of  DENTSPLY's  competitors  may have  greater  resources
than does the Company in certain of its product offerings.

   The worldwide  market for dental supplies is highly  competitive.  There
can be no  assurance  that  the  Company  will  successfully  identify  new
product  opportunities  and develop and market new  products  successfully,
or that new products and  technologies  introduced by competitors  will not
render the Company's products obsolete or noncompetitive.






Regulation

   The  Company's  products  are  subject to  regulation  by,  among  other
governmental  entities,  the  United  States  Food and Drug  Administration
(the  "FDA").  In  general,   if  a  dental  "device"  is  subject  to  FDA
regulation,  compliance with the FDA's requirements  constitutes compliance
with  corresponding  state  regulations.  In order to  ensure  that  dental
products  distributed  for  human  use in the  United  States  are safe and
effective,  the FDA regulates the introduction,  manufacture,  advertising,
labeling,  packaging,  marketing and  distribution  of, and  record-keeping
for,  such  products.  The  anesthetic  products  sold by the  Company  are
regulated  as a  drug  by the  FDA  and by  all  other  similar  regulatory
agencies around the world.

   Dental  devices of the types sold by DENTSPLY are  generally  classified
by the FDA into a  category  that  renders  them  subject  only to  general
controls  that  apply  to  all  medical  devices,   including   regulations
regarding alteration,  misbranding,  notification,  record-keeping and good
manufacturing  practices.  DENTSPLY's  facilities  are  subject to periodic
inspection  by  the  FDA  to  monitor  DENTSPLY's   compliance  with  these
regulations.  There  can be no  assurance  that  the  FDA  will  not  raise
compliance  concerns.  Failure to satisfy  FDA  requirements  can result in
FDA enforcement  actions,  including  product  seizure,  injunction  and/or
criminal or civil proceedings.  In the European Union,  DENTSPLY's products
are  subject to the  medical  devices  laws of the  various  member  states
which  are  based on a  Directive  of the  European  Commission.  Such laws
generally  regulate  the safety of the products in a similar way to the FDA
regulations.  DENTSPLY  products  in Europe bear the CE sign  showing  that
such products adhere to the European regulations.

   All dental amalgam filling  materials,  including those manufactured and
sold by  DENTSPLY,  contain  mercury.  Various  groups  have  alleged  that
dental  amalgam  containing  mercury is  harmful  to human  health and have
actively  lobbied state and federal  lawmakers and  regulators to pass laws
or adopt  regulatory  changes  restricting  the use, or requiring a warning
against  alleged  potential  risks,  of dental  amalgams.  The FDA's Dental
Devices  Classification  Panel,  the National  Institutes of Health and the
United  States  Public Health  Service have each  indicated  that no direct
hazard to humans from  exposure to dental  amalgams has been  demonstrated.
If  the  FDA  were  to  reclassify   dental  mercury  and  amalgam  filling
materials as classes of products requiring FDA pre-market  approval,  there
can be no assurance  that the required  approval  would be obtained or that
the FDA would  permit  the  continued  sale of  amalgam  filling  materials
pending its  determination.  In Europe,  in particular in  Scandinavia  and
Germany,  the  contents of mercury in amalgam  filling  materials  has been
the  subject of public  discussion.  As a  consequence,  in 1994 the German
health  authorities  required  suppliers  of  dental  amalgam  to amend the
instructions  for  use  for  amalgam  filling   materials,   to  include  a
precaution  against the use of amalgam for children  under  eighteen  years
of age and to women of childbearing  age.  DENTSPLY also  manufactures  and
sells non-amalgam dental filling materials that do not contain mercury.

   The  introduction  and sale of dental  products of the types produced by
the  Company  are also  subject to  government  regulation  in the  various
foreign  countries  in which they are produced or sold.  DENTSPLY  believes
that  it  is  in  substantial   compliance  with  the  foreign   regulatory
requirements   that  are  applicable  to  its  products  and  manufacturing
operations.


Sources and Supply of Raw Materials

  All of the raw materials  used by the Company in the  manufacture  of its
products  are  purchased  from various  suppliers  and are  available  from
numerous   sources.   No  single   supplier   accounts  for  a  significant
percentage of DENTSPLY's raw material requirements.





Intellectual Property

   Products  manufactured  by  DENTSPLY  are sold  primarily  under its own
trademarks  and trade names.  DENTSPLY  also owns and  maintains  more than
2,000  patents  throughout  the world and is licensed  under a small number
of patents owned by others.

   DENTSPLY's  policy is to protect its  products  and  technology  through
patents  and   trademark   registrations   in  the  United  States  and  in
significant   international   markets   for  its   products.   The  Company
carefully  monitors  trademark use worldwide,  and promotes  enforcement of
its  patents  and  trademarks  in a manner  that is designed to balance the
cost of such  protection  against  obtaining  the  greatest  value  for the
Company.  DENTSPLY  believes  its  patents  and  trademark  properties  are
important and  contribute to the Company's  marketing  position but it does
not  consider  its overall  business to be  materially  dependent  upon any
individual patent or trademark.


Employees

   As of December  31,  2004,  the Company  and its  subsidiaries  employed
approximately  7,700  employees.   A  small  percentage  of  the  Company's
employees  are   represented  by  labor  unions.   Hourly  workers  at  the
Company's  Ransom & Randolph  facility in Maumee,  Ohio are  represented by
Local No. 12 of the International  Union, United Automobile,  Aerospace and
Agriculture  Implement  Workers of America  under a  collective  bargaining
agreement  that  expires  on  January  31,  2008.  Hourly  workers  at  the
Company's  Midwest Dental  Products  facility in Des Plaines,  Illinois are
represented  by  International  Association  of  Machinists  and  Aerospace
Workers,  AFL-CIO in Chicago under a collective  bargaining  agreement that
expires on May 31,  2006.  In addition,  approximately  30% of DeguDent and
25%  of  DeDent,   two  of  the  Company's   German  operating  units,  are
represented   by  labor   unions.   The   Company   provides   pension  and
postretirement  benefits  to many of these  employees  (see  Note 14 to the
consolidated   financial   statements).   The  Company  believes  that  its
relationship with its employees is good.

   The Company's  success is dependent  upon its  management and employees.
The loss of senior  management  employees  or any  failure to  recruit  and
train  needed  managerial,  sales  and  technical  personnel  could  have a
material adverse effect on the Company.

Acquisition Activities

   DENTSPLY believes that the dental products industry continues to
experience consolidation with respect to both product manufacturing and
distribution, although it continues to be fragmented creating a number of
acquisition opportunities. As a result, during the past five years, the
Company has made several acquisitions including three significant
acquisitions made during 2001. These acquisitions included the Degussa
Dental Group, Friadent Gmbh and the dental injectible anaesthetic assets
of AstraZeneca. The Company continues to view acquisitions as a key part
of its growth strategy. These acquisition activities are intended to
supplement the Company's core growth and assure ongoing expansion of its
business. In addition, acquisitions have provided DENTSPLY with new
technologies and additional product and geographic breadth. The Company
continues to be active in evaluating potential acquisitions although
there is no assurance that these efforts will result in completed
transactions as there are many factors that affect the success of such
activities. If we do succeed in acquiring a business or product, there
can be no assurance that we will achieve any of the benefits that we
might anticipate from such an acquisition and the attention and effort
devoted to the integration of an acquired business could divert
management's attention from normal business operations.  If we make
acquisitions, we may incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or create
additional expenses, any of which might adversely effect our financial
results.  Any financing that we might need for acquisitions may only be
available to us on terms that restrict our business or that impose
additional costs that reduce our operating results.






Environmental Matters

   DENTSPLY  believes that its operations  comply in all material  respects
with  applicable  environmental  laws  and  regulations.  Maintaining  this
level of  compliance  has not had,  and is not expected to have, a material
effect on the Company's capital expenditures or on its business.

Securities and Exchange Act Reports

   DENTSPLY  makes   available  free  of  charge  through  its  website  at
www.dentsply.com  its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form
10-Q,  current  reports on Form 8-K and  amendments  to these reports filed
or  furnished  pursuant  to  Section  13(a)  or  15(d)  of  the  Securities
Exchange  Act  of  1934  as  soon  as  reasonably  practicable  after  such
materials  are filed with or  furnished  to, the  Securities  and  Exchange
Commission.

   The public may read and copy any  materials  the Company  files with the
SEC at its Public Reference Room at the following address:

   450 Fifth Street, NW
   Washington, D.C. 20549

   The  public may  obtain  information  on the  operation  of this  Public
Reference  Room by calling the SEC at  1-800-SEC-0330.  In addition,  since
the Company is an  electronic  filer,  the public may access  reports,  the
proxy and information  statements and other  information filed or furnished
by  the   Company   at   the   Internet   site   maintained   by  the   SEC
(http://www.sec.gov).





Item 2.  Properties

      The   following   is  a   current   list  of   DENTSPLY's   principal
manufacturing and operating locations as of December 31, 2004:









    In addition,  the Company  maintains sales and distribution  offices at
certain of its foreign and domestic  manufacturing  facilities,  as well as
at various other United  States and  international  locations.  Most of the
various  sites  around  the world that are used  exclusively  for sales and
distribution are leased.

   DENTSPLY   believes  that  its   properties   and  facilities  are  well
maintained  and are  generally  suitable  and adequate for the purposes for
which they are used.






Item 3.  Legal Proceedings


   DENTSPLY and its subsidiaries are from time to time parties to lawsuits
arising out of their respective operations.  The Company believes it is
unlikely that pending litigation to which DENTSPLY is a party will have a
material adverse effect upon its consolidated financial position or
results of operations.

   In June 1995, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of
Justice initiated an antitrust investigation regarding the policies and
conduct undertaken by the Company's Trubyte Division with respect to the
distribution of artificial teeth and related products.  On January 5,
1999 the Department of Justice filed a Complaint against the Company in
the U.S. District Court in Wilmington, Delaware alleging that the
Company's tooth distribution practices violate the antitrust laws and
seeking an order for the Company to discontinue its practices.  The trial
in the government's case was held in April and May 2002. On August 14,
2003, the Judge entered a decision that the Company's tooth distribution
practices do not violate the antitrust laws. The Department of Justice
appealed this decision to the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals.  The
Third Circuit Court issued its decision on February 22, 2005 and reversed
the decision of the District Court. The effect of this decision, if it
withstands any appeal challenge by the Company, will be the issuance of
an injunction requiring DENTSPLY to discontinue its policy of not
allowing its tooth dealers to take on new competitive teeth lines.  This
decision relates only to the distribution of artificial teeth sold in the
U.S., which affects less than 2.5% of the Company's sales. While the
Company believes its tooth distribution practices do not violate the
antitrust laws, we are confident that we can continue to develop this
business regardless of the final legal outcome. The Company is currently
evaluating its legal options as well as its marketing and sales
strategies in light of the current court ruling.

   Subsequent to the filing of the Department of Justice Complaint in
1999, several private party class actions were filed based on allegations
similar to those in the Department of Justice case, on behalf of
laboratories, and denture patients in seventeen states who purchased
Trubyte teeth or products containing Trubyte teeth. These cases were
transferred to the U.S. District Court in Wilmington, Delaware.  The
private party suits seek damages in an unspecified amount.  The Court has
granted the Company's Motion on the lack of standing of the laboratory
and patient class actions to pursue damage claims. The Plaintiffs in the
laboratory case have appealed this decision to the Third Circuit and
briefs of the parties have been submitted.  Also, private party class
actions on behalf of indirect purchasers were filed in California and
Florida state courts.  The California and Florida cases have been
dismissed by the Plaintiffs following the decision by the Federal
District Court Judge issued in August 2003.

   On March 27, 2002, a Complaint was filed in Alameda County, California
(which was transferred to Los Angeles County) by Bruce Glover, D.D.S.
alleging, inter alia, breach of express and implied warranties, fraud,
unfair trade practices and negligent misrepresentation in the Company's
manufacture and sale of Advance(R) cement.  The Complaint seeks damages in
an unspecified amount for costs incurred in repairing dental work in
which the Advance(R) product allegedly failed. The Judge has entered an
Order granting class certification, as an Opt-in class (this means that
after Notice of the class action is sent to possible class members, a
party will have to determine they meet the class definition and take
affirmative action in order to join the class) on the claims of breach of
warranty and fraud.  In general, the Class is defined as California
dentists who purchased and used Advance(R) cement and were required,
because of failures of the cement, to repair or reperform dental
procedures.  The Notice of the class action was sent on February 23, 2005
to dentists licensed to practice in California during the relevant
period.  The Advance(R) cement product was sold from 1994 through 2000 and
total sales in the United States during that period were approximately
$5.2 million. The Company's insurance carrier has confirmed coverage for
the breach of warranty claims in this matter.

   On July 13, 2004, the Company was served with a Complaint filed by 3M
Innovative Properties Company in the U.S. District Court for the Western
District of Wisconsin, alleging that the Company's Aquasil(R) Ultra
silicone impression material, introduced in late 2002, infringes a 3M
patent. This case was settled in the first quarter of 2005, which was
within the range of loss for which the Company had previously recorded
accruals, and DENTSPLY obtained a paid up license under the 3M patent.

      The Company's management, with the participation of the Company's
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the
effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of

      (b)  Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

      Management's report on the Company's internal control over financial

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

   Certain statements made by the Company, including without limitation,
statements in the Overview section below and other statements containing
the words "plans", "anticipates", "believes", "expects", or words of
similar import may be deemed to be forward-looking statements and are
made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Investors are cautioned that
forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may
materially affect the Company's business and prospects, and should be
read in conjunction with the risk factors and uncertainties discussed
within Item I, Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

OVERVIEW

   Dentsply International Inc. is the world's largest manufacturer of
professional dental products. The Company is headquartered in the United
States, and operates in more than 120 other countries, principally
through its foreign subsidiaries. While the United States and Europe are
the Company's largest markets, the Company serves all of the major
professional dental markets worldwide.

   The Company monitors numerous benchmarks in evaluating its business,
including: (1) internal growth in the United States, Europe and all other
regions; (2) the development, introduction and contribution of innovative
new products; (3) growth through acquisition; and (4) continued focus on
controlling costs and enhancing efficiency.  We define "internal growth"
as the increase in our net sales from period to period, excluding
precious metal content, the impact of changes in currency exchange rates,
and the net sales, for a period of twelve months following the
transaction date, of businesses that we have acquired or divested.

   Management believes that an average overall internal growth rate of
4-6% is a long-term sustainable rate for the Company. During 2004, the
Company's overall internal growth was approximately 4.0% compared to 4.4%
in 2003. Our internal growth rates in the United States (43% of sales)
and Europe (38% of sales), the largest dental markets in the world, were
3.4% and 4.1%, respectively during 2004 compared to 3.3% and 8.3%,
respectively for 2003. Our internal growth rate in all other regions
during 2004, which represents approximately 19% of our sales, was 5.2%,
compared to 0.4% in 2003. Among the other regions, the Asian region, has
historically been one of our highest growth markets and management
believes it represents a long-term growth opportunity for the industry
and the Company. Also within the other region is the Japanese market,
which represents the third largest dental market in the world behind the
United States and Europe.  Although Japan's dental market growth has been
weak in the past few years, as it closely parallels its economic growth,
the Company also views this market as an important long-term growth
opportunity, both in terms of a recovery in the Japanese economy and the
opportunity to increase our market share. There can be no assurance that
the Company's assumptions concerning the growth rates in its markets or
the dental market generally will be correct and if such rates are less
than expected, the Company's projected growth rates and results of
operations may be adversely effected.

   Product innovation is a key component of the Company's overall growth
strategy. Historically, the company has introduced in excess of twenty
new products each year. During 2004, approximately 25 new products were
introduced around the world and the Company expects approximately 20 new
products to be introduced in 2005. Of specific note, in the fourth
quarter of 2004, the Company introduced its Oraqix(R) anesthetic gel
product, a revolutionary new non-injectible anesthetic for use in scaling
and root planing procedures. In addition, during 2004 the Company
introduced BioPure MTAD, an irrigant that is used to disinfect the tooth
canal as well as remove the smear layer that's created in a root canal
procedure.





   New advances in technology are anticipated to have a significant
influence on future products in dentistry. In anticipation of this, the
Company has pursued several new research and development initiatives to
support this development. Specifically, in 2004 the Company entered into
a five-year agreement with the Georgia Institute of Technology's Research
Institute to pursue potential new advances in dentistry. In addition, we
recently completed an agreement with Doxa AB to develop and commercialize
products within the dental field based upon Doxa's bioactive ceramic
technology.  The Doxa technology is designed to induce chemical
integration between the material and dentition or bone structure. These
agreements are consistent with the Company's strategy of being the
leading innovator in the industry. In addition, the Company licenses and
purchases technologies developed by other third parties. Specifically, in
2004, the Company purchased the rights to a unique compound called SATIF
from Sanofi-Aventis. The Company believes that this technology will
provide enhancements to future products with such benefits as greater
protection against enamel caries, the ability to desensitize exposed
dentin and the ability to retard, or to inhibit the formation of staining
on the enamel.

   Although the professional dental market in which the Company operates
has experienced consolidation, it is still a fragmented industry.  The
Company continues to focus on opportunities to expand the Company's
product offerings through acquisition.  Management believes that there
will continue to be adequate opportunities to participate as a
consolidator in the industry for the foreseeable future (See also
Acquisition Activity in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K).

   The Company also remains focused on reducing costs and improving
competitiveness.  Management expects to continue to consolidate
operations or functions and reduce the cost of those operations and
functions while improving service levels.  In addition, the Company
remains focused on enhancing efficiency through expanded use of
technology and process improvement initiatives. The Company believes that
the benefits from these opportunities will improve the cost structure and
offset areas of rising costs such as energy, benefits, regulatory
oversight and compliance and financial reporting in the United States.



FACTORS IMPACTING COMPARABILITY BETWEEN YEARS


   In the first and second quarters of 2003, the Company recorded charges
and reserve reversals which represented corrections of errors from prior
periods ("Charge and Reserve Errors"). Had the Charge and Reserve Errors
been recorded in the proper periods, reported net income from continuing
operations would have been higher by $1.3 million in 2003 and lower by
$3.4 million in 2002 (see Note 19 of the Consolidated Financial
Statements included in the Company's Form 10-K for the period ended
December 31, 2003).

Discontinued Operations

   In February 2004, the Company sold its Gendex equipment business to
Danaher Corporation. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2004 the
Company discontinued production of dental needles. The sale of the Gendex
business and discontinuance of dental needle production have been
accounted for as discontinued operations pursuant to Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets". The results of operations for all periods
presented have been restated to reclassify the results of operations for
both the Gendex equipment and the dental needle businesses as
discontinued operations.

Reclassifications

   Certain other  reclassifications  have been made to prior years' data in
order to conform to current year presentation.






RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS, 2004 COMPARED TO 2003

Net Sales

   The discussions below summarize the Company's sales growth, excluding
precious metals, from internal growth and net acquisition growth and
highlights the impact of foreign currency translation.  These disclosures
of net sales growth provide the reader with sales results on a comparable
basis between periods.

   As the presentation of net sales excluding precious metal content could
be considered a measure not calculated in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles (a non-GAAP measure), the Company provides
the following reconciliation of net sales to net sales excluding precious
metal content.  Our definitions and calculations of net sales excluding
precious metal content and other operating measures derived using net
sales excluding precious metal content may not necessarily be the same as
those used by other companies.



   Management believes that the presentation of net sales excluding
precious metal content provides useful information to investors because a
significant portion of DENTSPLY's net sales is comprised of sales of
precious metals generated through sales of the Company's precious metal
alloy products, which are used by third parties to construct crown and
bridge materials. Due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and
because the precious metal content of the Company's sales is largely a
pass-through to customers and has minimal effect on earnings, DENTSPLY
reports sales both with and without precious metal content to show the
Company's performance independent of precious metal price volatility and
to enhance comparability of performance between periods. The Company uses
its cost of precious metal purchased as a proxy for the precious metal
content of sales, as the precious metal content of sales is not
separately tracked and invoiced to customers.  The Company believes that
it is reasonable to use the cost of precious metal content purchased in
this manner since precious metal alloy sale prices are adjusted when the
prices of underlying precious metals change.

   Net sales in 2004 increased $126.2 million, or 8.1%, to $1,694.2
million. Net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased $117.5
million, or 8.6%, to $1,481.9 million.  Sales growth excluding precious
metal content was comprised of 4.0% internal growth and 4.6% of foreign
currency translation.  The 4.0% internal growth was comprised of 3.4% in
the United States, 4.1% in Europe and 5.2% for all other regions
combined.

   The internal sales growth, excluding precious metal content, in the
United States was driven by strong growth in specialty dental products,
offset by negative growth in anesthetic products due to competitive
pressures and in equipment products within the dental laboratory
category. In Europe strong internal sales growth in specialty dental
products was offset by flat growth in the dental consumable category. The
internal growth of 5.2% in all other regions was largely the result of
strong growth in the Asian region, Canada and the Middle East/Africa,
offset by lower sales in Japan.






Gross Profit


   Gross profit was $846.5  million in 2004  compared to $770.5  million in
2003,  an  increase  of $76.0  million,  or 9.9%.  Gross  profit,  measured
against sales including  precious metal content,  represented  50.0% of net
sales in 2004  compared  to  49.1% in 2003.  The  gross  profit  for  2004,
measured  against  sales  excluding  precious  metal  content,  represented
57.1% of net  sales  compared  to 56.5% in 2003.  This  margin  improvement
from 2003 to 2004 was due  primarily  to favorable  geographic  and product
mix shifts in addition to ongoing operational  improvements  related to the
Company's restructuring and process improvement initiatives.

Operating Expenses


   Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expense increased $45.4
million, or 9.1%, to $544.3 million during 2004 from $498.9 million in
2003.  The 9.1% increase in expenses reflects increases for the
translation impact from a weaker U.S. dollar of approximately $25.3
million. SG&A expenses, measured against sales including precious metal
content, increased to 32.1% compared to 31.8% in 2003. SG&A expenses, as
measured against sales excluding precious metal content, increased to
36.7% compared to 36.6% in 2003. The higher expense level in 2004 was
primarily related to litigation settlement costs, additional costs
related to the Sarbanes-Oxley compliance and costs related to the launch
of the Oraqix(R) product. In addition, the Company continued to leverage
expenses, including research and development costs, which served to
partially offset these additional costs. Moving forward, as the Company
leverages expenses, it expects to reinvest a portion of these savings to
further strengthen research and development and selling activities.

   During 2004, the Company recorded restructuring and other costs of $7.1
million ($5.0 million net of tax). These costs were primarily related to
the creation of a European Shared Services Center in Yverdon,
Switzerland, and the consolidation of certain sales/customer service and
distribution facilities in Europe and Japan. The primary objective of
these restructuring initiatives is to improve operational efficiencies
and to reduce costs within the related businesses. These plans are
expected to be fully complete by the first quarter of 2006. In addition,
restructuring costs were incurred related to the closure of the Company's
European central warehouse in Nijmegan, The Netherlands, and transfer of
this function to a Company-owned facility in Radolfzell, Germany, which
was substantially completed during the first quarter of 2004. This
transfer was completed in an effort to improve customer service levels
and reduce costs. The Company also incurred additional charges related to
the consolidation of its U.S. laboratory businesses, which was initiated
in the fourth quarter of 2003. The Company made the decision to
consolidate the United States laboratory businesses in order to improve
operational efficiencies, to broaden customer penetration and to
strengthen customer service.  This plan was substantially complete at the
end of 2004.

   The Company anticipates the remaining costs to complete these
restructuring initiatives will be approximately $1.5 million which will
be expensed primarily during the first half of 2005 as the related costs
are incurred. These plans are projected to result in future annual
expense reductions of $5 to $7 million when fully implemented in 2006.

   During 2003, the Company recorded  restructuring and other costs of $3.7
million  ($2.3  million  net of tax).  The  largest  portion of this was an
impairment   charge  related  to  certain   investments  made  in  emerging
technologies  that  the  Company  no  longer  viewed  as  recoverable.   In
addition,  as noted above,  in December  2003,  the Company  commenced  the
consolidation of its U.S.  laboratory  businesses and recorded a charge for
a portion of the costs to complete  the  consolidation  (see Note 15 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements).







Other Income and Expenses

   Net interest expense and other expenses were $21.0 million during 2004
compared to $16.8 million in 2003.  The 2004 period included $19.6
million of net interest expense, $1.2 million of currency transaction
losses and $0.2 million of other nonoperating costs. The 2003 period
included $24.2 million of net interest expense, $0.3 million of currency
transaction gains and $7.1 million of other nonoperating income, which
included gains on the PracticeWorks common stock and warrants sold in the
fourth quarter of 2003 of $7.4 million ($4.7 million net of tax). The
decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to increased interest
income generated from the Company's higher cash levels.

Income Taxes

   The effective tax rate decreased to 23.3% in 2004 from 32.4% in 2003.
During 2004, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $19.5 million
primarily from the reversal of previously accrued taxes from the
settlement of prior years' domestic and foreign tax audits, benefits of
additional R&D credits and other adjustments. The impact of this benefit
on the effective tax rate for 2004 was 7.1%. Management believes that the
effective tax rate for 2005 will be in the range of 31% to 32%.

Earnings

   Income from continuing operations increased $40.4 million, or 23.8%, to
$210.3 million in 2004 from $169.9 million in 2003. Fully diluted
earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.56 in 2004, an
increase of 21.3% from $2.11 in 2003. Income from continuing operations
and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2004
included the benefit of the tax adjustments ($19.5 million and $0.24 per
share) and the restructuring and other costs ($5.0 million and $0.06 per
share) described above. In addition, income from continuing operations
and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2003
included the gain on the sale of the PracticeWorks securities ($4.7
million and $0.06 per share) and the restructuring and other costs ($2.3
million and $0.03 per share) described above.

Discontinued Operations


   In February 2004, the Company sold its Gendex equipment business to
Danaher Corporation.  Also in the first quarter of 2004, the Company
discontinued production of dental needles.  Accordingly, the Gendex
equipment and needle businesses have been reported as discontinued
operations for all periods presented.

   Income from discontinued operations was $42.9 million during 2004 and
$4.3 million in 2003.  Fully diluted earnings per share from discontinued
operations were $0.53 and $0.05 for 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
income from discontinued operations in 2004 was almost entirely related
to the gain realized on the sale of Gendex business.


Operating Segment Results

   Through December 31, 2004, the Company had five operating groups, which
were managed by five Senior Vice Presidents and represented our operating
segments.  Each of these operating groups covered a wide range of product
categories and geographic regions.  The product categories and geographic
regions often overlap across the groups.  Further information regarding
the details of each group is presented in Note 4 of the Consolidated
Financial Statements. The management of each group is evaluated for
performance and incentive compensation purposes on net third party sales,
excluding precious metal content and segment operating income.






Dental Consumables--U.S. and Europe/Japan/Non-dental

   Net sales for this group were $284.6 million in 2004, a 7.5% increase
compared to $264.6 million in 2003.  Internal growth was 3.3% and
currency translation added 4.2% to sales in 2004.  The U.S. and European
consumables businesses had the highest growth in the group, which was
offset by lower sales in the Japanese market.

   Operating profit increased $4.7 million during 2004 to $87.1 million
from $82.4 million in 2003. Sales growth was the most significant
contributor to the increase.  Operating profit also benefited from
currency translation.

Endodontics/Professional Division Dental Consumables/Asia

   Net sales for this group increased $25.2 million during 2004, or 6.6%,
to $406.7 million up from $381.5 million in 2003.  Internal sales growth
was 4.9% and currency translation added 1.7% to 2004 sales. Sales growth
was driven by higher sales in the Endodontics and Asian businesses.

   Operating profit was $163.0 million in 2004, an increase of $9.0
million from $154.0 million in 2003. This increase was driven by
continued sales growth in the group's businesses.  In addition, operating
profit benefited from currency translation.

Dental Consumables--United Kingdom, France, Italy, CIS, Middle East,
Africa/European Dental Laboratory Business

   Net sales for this group was $344.5 million in 2004, an increase of
$37.9 million, or 12.4%, compared to $306.6 million in 2003.  Internal
growth was 2.1% and currency translation added 10.3% to sales in 2004.
The sales growth was driven by the Italian, Middle East, Africa and
France consumable businesses, offset by lower sales in the European
Dental Laboratory businesses, primarily in Germany, and lower sales in
the United Kingdom consumables business.

   Operating profit increased $13.3 million in 2004 to $43.8 million from
$30.5 million in 2003. The operating profit improvement was primarily
related to the sales growth and lower SG&A expenses as a percentage of
sales.  In addition, operating profit benefited from currency translation.

Australia/Canada/Latin America/U.S. Pharmaceutical

   Net sales for this group increased $5.4 million during 2004, or 4.8%,
to $118.6 million compared to $113.2 million in 2003.  Internal growth
was negative 0.7% and currency translation added 5.5%. The lower internal
sales growth was primarily driven by lower sales in the U.S
Pharmaceutical business and flat growth in the Latin American businesses
offset by the sales growth of the Canadian and Australian businesses.

   Operating profit was $15.6 million in 2004, a $3.6 million increase
from $12.0 million in 2003. This increase was driven by improved sales
and higher margins in the international operations in the group. In
addition, operating profit benefited from currency translation.






U.S. Dental Laboratory Business/Implants/Orthodontics

   Net sales for this group was $306.7 million in 2004, a 10.5% increase
compared to $277.6 million in 2003.  Internal growth was 7.7% and
currency translation added 2.8% to sales in 2004.  The internal growth
increase was primarily due to strong growth in the orthodontics and
dental implants businesses, offset by slower growth in the U.S. dental
laboratory business.

   Operating profit increased $12.4 million during 2004, to $53.8 million
from $41.4 million in 2003. This increase was driven by improved sales of
the orthodontics and dental implants businesses and lower SG&A expenses
at the U.S. dental laboratory business.  In addition, operating profit
benefited from currency translation.


RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS, 2003 COMPARED TO 2002


Net Sales

   Net sales in 2003 increased $152.1 million, or 10.7%, to $1,568.0
million. Net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased $134.0
million, or 10.9%, to $1,364.3 million.  Sales growth excluding precious
metal content was comprised of 4.4% internal growth, 6.6% foreign
currency translation less 0.1% for net acquisitions/divestitures.  The
4.4% internal growth was comprised of 8.3% in Europe, 3.3% in the United
States and 0.4% for all other regions combined.

   The internal sales growth in 2003, excluding precious metal content,
was highest in Europe with strong growth in the specialty dental category
and certain products within the dental laboratory category.   In the
United States internal sales growth was strongest in the specialty dental
category and in certain products within the dental consumable category,
offset by a softening in sales in the dental laboratory category.


Gross Profit

   Gross profit was $770.5  million in 2003  compared to $703.7  million in
2002,  an  increase  of $66.8  million,  or 9.5%.  Gross  profit,  measured
against sales including  precious metal content,  represented  49.1% of net
sales in 2003  compared  to  49.7% in 2002.  The  gross  profit  for  2003,
measured  against  sales  excluding  precious  metal  content,  represented
56.5% of net sales  compared  to 57.2% in 2002.  Gross  profit as  reported
would have been  higher by $2.8  million in 2003 and lower by $5.4  million
in 2002 had the Charge  and  Reserve  Errors  been  recorded  in the proper
periods.  In addition,  geographic mix negatively  influenced gross margins
in 2003 compared to 2002.

Operating Expenses

   SG&A expense  increased  $41.9  million,  or 9.2%, to $498.9  million in
2003 from  $457.0  million  in 2002.  The 9.2%  increase  in  expenses,  as
reported,  reflects  increases  for the  translation  impact  from a weaker
U.S.  dollar  of  approximately  $35.2  million.  SG&A  expenses,  measured
against  sales  including  precious  metal  content,   decreased  to  31.8%
compared  to  32.3% in 2002.  SG&A  expenses,  as  measured  against  sales
excluding  precious metal content,  decreased to 36.6% compared to 37.1% in
2002.  SG&A  would  have been  higher by $0.8  million in 2003 and lower by
$0.3 million in 2002,  had the Charge and Reserve  Errors been  recorded in
the  proper   periods.   The  leveraging  of  general  and   administrative
expenses  was the  primary  reason  for  the  percentage  decrease  in SG&A
expenses from 2002 to 2003.





   During 2003, the Company recorded  restructuring and other costs of $3.7
million.  The largest  portion of this was an impairment  charge related to
certain  investments  made in  emerging  technologies  that the  Company no
longer viewed as  recoverable.  In addition,  in December 2003, the Company
commenced  the  consolidation  of  its  U.S.   laboratory   businesses  and
recorded   a  charge  for  a  portion   of  the  costs  to   complete   the
consolidation.

   During  2002,  the Company  recorded  restructuring  and other income of
$2.7  million,  including  a  $3.7  million  benefit  which  resulted  from
changes in  estimates  related to prior period  restructuring  initiatives,
offset  somewhat  by a  restructuring  charge  for the  combination  of the
CeraMed and U.S.  Friadent  divisions of $1.7  million.  In  addition,  the
Company  recognized  a gain  of  $0.7  million  related  to  the  insurance
settlement   for  fire  damages   sustained  at  the  Company's   Maillefer
facility. (see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Other Income and Expenses

   Net interest expense and other expenses were $16.8 million in 2003
compared to $35.4 million in 2002. The 2003 period included $24.2 million
of net interest expense, $0.3 million of currency transaction gains and
$7.1 million of other nonoperating income, which included gains on the
PracticeWorks common stock and warrants sold in the fourth quarter of
2003 of $7.4 million. The year 2002 included: $27.4 million of net
interest; $3.5 million of currency transaction losses; a $1.1 million
loss realized on the share exchange with PracticeWorks, Inc.; and a $2.6
million mark-to-market loss related to PracticeWorks warrants.

Income Taxes/Earnings

   The effective tax rate decreased to 32.4% in 2003 from 32.9% in 2002.

   Income from continuing operations increased $26.3 million, or 18.3%, to
$169.9 million in 2003 from $143.6 million in 2002. Fully diluted
earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.11 in 2003, an
increase of 17.2% from $1.80 in 2002.  Had the Charge and Reserve Errors
described above been recorded in the proper periods, income from
continuing operations would have been higher by $1.3 million ($.02 per
diluted share) in 2003 and lower by $3.4 million ($.04 per diluted share)
in 2002.

Discontinued Operations

   Income from discontinued operations was $4.3 million in both 2003 and
2002.  Fully diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations were
$.05 in both 2003 and 2002.


Operating Segment Results

Dental Consumables--U.S. and Europe/Japan/Non-dental

   Net sales for this group were $264.6 million in 2003, a 9.3% increase
compared to $242.1 million in 2002.  Internal growth was 2.8% and
currency translation added 6.5% to sales in 2003.  The U.S. consumables
business had the highest growth in the group, which was offset by lower
sales in the Japanese market and low growth in the non-dental business.

   Operating profit increased $11.5 million to $82.4 million from $70.9
million in 2002.  Sales growth in the U.S. dental consumable business and
gross margin improvement in the European dental consumable business were
the most significant contributors to the increase.   Operating profit
benefited from currency translation.  Operating profit would have been
lower by $2.7 million in 2003 and higher by $1.6 million in 2002 if the
Charge and Reserve Errors had been recorded in the proper period.






Endodontics/Professional Division Dental Consumables/Asia

   Net sales for this group increased $23.9 million, or 6.7%, up from
$357.6 million in 2002.  Internal growth was 3.8% and currency
translation added 2.9% to 2003 sales.  Sales growth was strongest in the
endodontic business.  This was offset by lower sales in the dental
consumables business primarily in the U.S. market.

   Operating profit was $154.0 million, an increase of $12.4 million from
$141.6 million in 2002.  Continued growth in the endodontic business was
primarily responsible for the increase.  In addition, operating profit
benefited from currency translation partially offset by the negative
currency impact of intercompany transactions.   Operating profit would
have been lower by $0.7 million in 2003 and lower by $0.6 million in 2002
if the Charge and Reserve Errors had been recorded in the proper period.

Dental Consumables--United Kingdom, France, Italy, CIS, Middle East,
Africa/European Dental Laboratory Business

   Net sales for this group were $306.6 million in 2003, a 26.9% increase
compared to $241.6 million in 2002. Internal growth was 6.7% and currency
translation added 20.2% to sales in 2003.  The primary reason for the
sales growth was strong sales performance in Germany, France, CIS and
Africa.

   Operating profit increased $19.2 million to $30.6 million from $11.4
million in 2002.  The primary reason for the profit improvement was sales
increases and margin improvement in the European dental laboratory
business including improvements from the consolidation of the historical
Dentsply tooth business in Europe into the DeguDent business.  In
addition, operating profit benefited from currency translation.
Operating profit would have been lower by $0.3 million in 2003 if the
Charge and Reserve Errors had been recorded in the proper period.

Australia/Canada/Latin America/Pharmaceutical

   Net sales for this group increased $4.8 million, or 4.4%, compared to
$108.5 million in 2002.  Internal growth was 3.6% and currency
translation added 0.8% to 2003 sales.  Sales were strongest in the U.S.
pharmaceutical business and in Latin America.  Canada and Australia
experienced slower sales growth.

   Operating profit was $12.0 million, a $2.8 million decrease from $14.8
million in 2002.  Lower operating margins in Latin America hurt
profitability.  Operating profit would have been higher by $1.0 million
in 2003 and lower by $0.7 million in 2002 if the Charge and Reserve
Errors had been recorded in the proper period.

U.S. Dental Laboratory Business/Implants/Orthodontics

   Net sales for this group were $277.6 million in 2003, a 6.7% increase
compared to $260.1 million in 2002.  Internal growth was 3.0% and
currency translation added 3.7% to sales in 2003.  Sales growth was
adversely impacted by the soft U.S. dental laboratory market.  Sales
growth for implants in Europe and the orthodontic business showed
continued strong sales growth.

   Operating profit decreased $8.8 million to $41.4 million from $50.2
million in 2002.  The soft U.S. dental laboratory market and the negative
currency impact of intercompany transactions adversely impacted operating
profit.  Operating profit would have been higher by $4.7 million in 2003
and lower by $5.3 million in 2002 if the Charge and Reserve Errors had
been recorded in the proper period.






FOREIGN CURRENCY

   Since  approximately  55% of the Company's  2004 revenues were generated
in currencies other than the U.S.  dollar,  the value of the U.S. dollar in
relation  to those  currencies  affects the  results of  operations  of the
Company.  The impact of currency  fluctuations  in any given  period can be
favorable or unfavorable.  The impact of foreign  currency  fluctuations of
European  currencies  on operating  income is partially  offset by sales in
the U.S.  of  products  sourced  from  plants  and  third  party  suppliers
located overseas,  principally in Germany and Switzerland.  On a net basis,
net income  benefited  from  changes in currency  translation  in both 2004
and 2003 compared to the prior years.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES

   The Company has identified  below the accounting  estimates  believed to
be  critical to its  business  and results of  operations.  These  critical
estimates  represent  those  accounting  policies  that  involve  the  most
complex or subjective decisions or assessments.

Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets

   Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142 ("SFAS 142"), "Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets". This statement requires that the amortization of goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets be discontinued and instead an annual
impairment approach be applied. The Company performed the annual
impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets
during 2004, as required, and no impairment was identified. These
impairment tests are based upon a fair value approach rather than an
evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows. If impairment is identified
under SFAS 142, the resulting charge is determined by recalculating
goodwill through a hypothetical purchase price allocation of the fair
value and reducing the current carrying value to the extent it exceeds
the recalculated goodwill. If impairment is identified on
indefinite-lived intangibles, the resulting charge reflects the excess of
the asset's carrying cost over its fair value.

   Other long-lived assets, such as identifiable intangible assets and
fixed assets, are amortized or depreciated over their estimated useful
lives. These assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
circumstances provide evidence that suggest that the carrying amount of
the asset may not be recoverable with impairment being based upon an
evaluation of the identifiable undiscounted cash flows. If impaired, the
resulting charge reflects the excess of the asset's carrying cost over
its fair value.

   If market conditions become less favorable, future cash flows, the key
variable in assessing the impairment of these assets, may decrease and as
a result the Company may be required to recognize impairment charges.
Market conditions can change due to many factors including increased
competition, downturns in the economic environment and introductions of
new technologies.

   The Company's impairment tests relating to the perpetual license rights
to the trademarks and formulations for dental anaesthetic products
acquired from AstraZeneca in 2001 are highly sensitive to cash flow
assumptions resulting from the sale of these products and the Company's
success in completing and the timing of starting up the greenfield
sterile filling plant to produce these products in the United States.





Inventories

   Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.  The cost of
inventories is determined primarily by the first-in, first-out ("FIFO")
or average cost methods, with a small portion being determined by the
last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method. The Company establishes reserves for
inventory estimated to be obsolete or unmarketable equal to the
difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value based
upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual
market conditions are less favorable than those anticipated, additional
inventory reserves may be required.

Accounts Receivable

   The Company sells dental equipment and supplies both through a
worldwide network of distributors and directly to end users. For
customers on credit terms, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluation
of those customers' financial condition and generally does not require
collateral from them.  The Company establishes allowances for doubtful
accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its
customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of the
Company's customers were to deteriorate, their ability to make required
payments may become impaired, and increases in these allowances may be
required. In addition, a negative impact on sales to those customers may
occur.

Accruals for Product Returns, Customer Rebates and Product Warranties

   The Company makes provisions for customer returns, customer rebates and
for product warranties at the time of sale.   These accruals are based on
past history, projections of customer purchases and sales and expected
product performance in the future.  Because the actual results for
product returns, rebates and warranties are dependent in part on future
events, these matters require the use of estimates.   The Company has a
long history of product performance in the dental industry and thus has
an extensive knowledge base from which to draw in measuring these
estimates.

Income Taxes


   Income taxes are  determined  using the  liability  method of accounting
for income taxes in  accordance  with  Financial  Statement  of  Accounting
Standard No. 109  "Accounting  for Income Taxes"  ("SFAS 109").  Under SFAS
109,  tax  expense  includes  US and  international  income  taxes plus the
provision  for  US  taxes  on   undistributed   earnings  of  international
subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested.

  Certain  items of income and expense are not  reported in tax returns and
financial  statements  in the same year.  The tax effect of such  temporary
differences  is reported  as deferred  income  taxes.  Deferred  tax assets
are  recognized  if it is more  likely  than not that  the  assets  will be
realized in future years.  The Company  establishes  a valuation  allowance
for  deferred  tax  assets  for  which  realization  is not  likely.  As of
December  31,  2004,  the Company  recorded a valuation  allowance of $22.8
million  against the benefit of the net  operating  loss  carryforwards  of
foreign subsidiaries.

   The Company  operates within multiple  taxing  jurisdictions  and in the
normal  course of  business  is  examined  in  various  jurisdictions.  Tax
accruals  related  to the  estimated  outcome  of  these  examinations  are
recorded  in  accordance  with  Statement  of  Financial  Standards  No.  5
"Accounting for Contingencies"  ("SFAS 5"). The reversal of the accruals is
recorded when  examinations are completed,  statutes of limitation close or
tax laws  change.  A net  benefit of $5.5  million  was  recorded  from the
release of  previously  accrued  taxes  related  to  domestic  and  foreign
examinations  that were  concluded in 2004,  less current year tax accruals
for existing  examination  risks. Tax credits and other  incentives  reduce
tax  expense in the year the  credits  are  claimed.  In 2004,  the Company
filed  amended  returns  for prior  years and  received  federal  and state
refunds of $4.3 million for additional R&D credits.

   On  October  22,  2004,  the  American  Jobs  Creation  Act of 2004 (the
"AJCA") was signed into law.  The AJCA  enacted a provision  that  provides
the  Company  with the  opportunity  to  repatriate  up to $500  million of
reinvested  earnings  and  to  claim  a  deduction  equal  to  85%  of  the
repatriated  amount.  The  Company  did  not  elect  the  benefit  of  this
provision  in 2004.  The Company has not  determined  whether,  and to what
extent, an election will be made in 2005.







Litigation

   The Company and its subsidiaries are from time to time parties to
lawsuits arising out of their respective operations. The Company records
liabilities when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.
These estimates made by management are based on an analysis made by
internal and external legal counsel which considers information known at
the time. The Company believes it has estimated any liabilities for
probable losses well in the past; however, the unpredictability of court
decisions could cause liability to be incurred in excess of estimates.
Legal costs related to these lawsuits are expensed as incurred.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

   Cash flows from operating activities during the year ended December 31,
2004 were $306.3 million compared to $258.0 million during the year ended
December 31, 2003. The increase of $48.3 million results primarily from
increased earnings, favorable working capital changes and increased tax
benefits related to the higher level of stock option exercise activity
versus the prior year.

   Investing  activities during 2004 include capital  expenditures of $56.3
million.  The Company  expects  that capital  expenditures  will range from
$55 million to $60 million in 2005.  Acquisition-related  activity  for the
year ended  December 31, 2004 was $20.5  million which was primarily due to
the final  payment to  AstraZeneca  related to the  Oraqix(R)  product (see
Note  4  to  the  Consolidated   Condensed  Financial  Statements)  and  an
investment in new technology.  Additionally,  in February 2004, the Company
completed  the sale of its Gendex  equipment  business  and  received  cash
proceeds of $102.5 million.

   In December 2003, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of
up to 1.0 million shares of common stock for the year ended December 31,
2004 on the open market, with authorization expiring at the end of the
year. As a result of this program, the company repurchased 815,000 shares
at an average cost per share of $48.34 and a total cost of $39.4 million.
Of these shares purchased, 30,000, at a cost of $1.7 million, will settle
in 2005. In addition, in December 2004 the Board of Directors approved a
stock repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase shares of
stock in an amount to maintain up to 3,000,000 shares of treasury stock.
As of December 31, 2004, the Company held 757,000 shares of treasury
stock. The Company also received proceeds of $45.3 million as a result of
the exercise of 2,165,000 stock options during the year ended December
31, 2004.

   The Company's long-term borrowings increased by a net of $39.9 million
during the year ended December 31, 2004. This net change included an
increase of $62.1 million due to exchange rate fluctuations on debt
denominated in foreign currencies and changes in the value of interest
rate swaps and net repayments of $22.2 million of debt payments made
during the year. During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company's
ratio of long-term debt to total capitalization decreased to 35.1%
compared to 41.3% at December 31, 2003.

   Under its  multi-currency  revolving  credit  agreement,  the Company is
able  to  borrow  up to $250  million  through  May  2006  ("the  five-year
facility")  and $125  million  through  May 2005 ("the 364 day  facility").
The 364-day facility  terminates in May 2005, but may be extended,  subject
to certain  conditions,  for additional periods of 364 days. This revolving
credit  agreement is unsecured  and contains  various  financial  and other
covenants.  The Company also has available an aggregate  $250 million under
two commercial paper  facilities;  a $250 million U.S.  facility and a $250
million U.S.  dollar  equivalent  European  facility  ("Euro CP facility").
Under  the  Euro  CP  facility,  borrowings  can be  denominated  in  Swiss
francs,   Japanese  yen,  Euros,  British  pounds  and  U.S.  dollars.  The
multi-currency  revolving  credit  facility  serves as a  back-up  to these
commercial  paper   facilities.   The  total  available  credit  under  the
commercial  paper  facilities  and  the  multi-currency   facility  in  the
aggregate  is  $125  million  and  no  debt  was   outstanding   under  the
commercial paper facilities at December 31, 2004.






   The Company also has access to $54.0 million in  uncommitted  short-term
financing under lines of credit from various  financial  institutions.  The
lines of credit have no major  restrictions  and are provided  under demand
notes between the Company and the lending institutions.

   The Company had unused  lines of credit of $307.0  million  available at
December  31,  2004  subject  to  the  Company's  compliance  with  certain
affirmative  and  negative   covenants   relating  to  its  operations  and
financial  condition.  The most  restrictive of these covenants  pertain to
asset  dispositions,  maintenance  of  certain  levels  of net  worth,  and
prescribed  ratios of  indebtedness  to total capital and operating  income
plus  depreciation  and amortization to interest  expense.  At December 31,
2004, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.

   At December 31, 2004, the Company held $60.1 million of precious metals
on consignment from several financial institutions.  These consignment
agreements allow the Company to acquire the precious metal at
approximately the same time and for the same price as alloys are sold to
the Company's customers. In the event that the financial institutions
would discontinue offering these consignment arrangements, and if the
Company could not obtain other comparable arrangements, the Company may
be required to obtain third party financing to fund an ownership position
in the required precious metal inventory levels.

   The Company's cash increased $342.6 million during the year ended
December 31, 2004 to $506.4 million. The Company has continued to
accumulate cash in 2004 rather than reduce debt due to pre-payment
penalties that would be incurred in retiring debt and the related
interest rate swap agreements in addition to the low cost of this debt,
net of earnings on the cash. The Company anticipates that cash will
continue to build throughout 2005, subject to any uses of cash for
acquisitions, stock purchases and potential debt prepayment.



   The  Company  expects on an ongoing  basis,  to be able to finance  cash
requirements,  including  capital  expenditures,  stock  repurchases,  debt
service,  operating  leases and  potential  future  acquisitions,  from the
funds  generated from  operations and amounts  available under its existing
credit facilities.






NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

   In January 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")
released FASB Staff Position ("FSP") No. 106-1, "Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003." SFAS 106, "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions", requires a
company to consider current changes in applicable laws when measuring its
postretirement benefit costs and accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation. However, because of uncertainties of the effect of the
provisions of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003 (the "Act") on plan sponsors and certain
accounting issues raised by the Act, FSP 106-1 allows plan sponsors to
elect a one-time deferral of the accounting for the Act. The Company
elected the deferral provided by FSP 106-1 to analyze the impact of the
Act on prescription drug coverage provided to a limited number of
retirees from one of its business units. In May 2004, FASB released FSP
106-2 "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003." This FSP
provides final guidance on the accounting for the effects of the Act for
employers that sponsor postretirement health care plans that provide
prescription drug benefits. The FSP also requires those employers to
provide certain disclosures regarding the effect of the federal subsidy
provided by the Act.  FSP 106-2 superceded FSP 106-1 when it became
effective on July 1, 2004. The Company has not yet determined whether the
benefits provided under its postretirement benefit plans are actuarially
equivalent to Medicare Part D under The Act, and as a result, the
Company's benefit obligations or its net periodic service cost do not
reflect any amount associated with the subsidy. The Company does not
expect this act will have a material impact on the Company's
postretirement benefits liabilities or on its financial statements.

   In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123R ("SFAS 123R"), "Share-Based Payment".  This standard
eliminates the guidance of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees"  ("APB 25") and amends FASB
Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation" ("FAS 123").
The standard requires that all public companies report share-based
compensation expense at the grant date fair value of the related
share-based awards and no longer permits companies to account for options
under the intrinsic value approach of APB 25. SFAS 123R is effective for
interim and annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005. As the Company
has accounted for stock option grants under the APB 25 in the past, this
statement is expected to have a material impact on the Company's
financial statements once effective ($0.14 to $0.16 per diluted share on
an annualized basis). The Company is currently assessing its compensation
programs, its option valuation techniques and assumptions, and the
possible transition alternatives in order to determine the full impact of
adopting this standard.

   In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No 151, "Inventory Costs - An Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter
4".  This statement amends the guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4,
"Inventory Pricing", to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of
idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material
(spoilage).  Under ARB No. 43, in certain circumstances, items such as
idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double freight, and rehandling
costs that were considered to be unusually abnormal were required to be
treated as period charges.  Under FASB No. 151, these charges are
required to be treated as period charges regardless of whether they meet
the criterion of unusually abnormal.  Additionally, FASB No. 151 requires
that allocation of fixed production overhead to the cost of conversion
be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities.  FASB No.
151 is effective for all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005.  The
Company does not expect the application of this standard to have a
material impact on the Company's financial statements.

   In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 153, "Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets an amendment of APB
Opinion No. 29".  This statement amends Opinion 29 to eliminate the
exceptions that allowed for other than fair value measurement when
similar productive assets were exchanged, and replaced the exceptions
with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not
have commercial substance.  FASB Statement No 153 is effective for
nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after
June 15, 2005. The Company does not expect the application of this
statement to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.






QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK


   The information below provides information about the Company's market
sensitive financial instruments and includes "forward-looking statements"
that involve risks and uncertainties.  Actual results could differ
materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements.  The
Company's major market risk exposures are changing interest rates,
movements in foreign currency exchange rates and potential price
volatility of commodities used by the Company in its manufacturing
processes. The Company's policy is to manage interest rates through the
use of floating rate debt and interest rate swaps to adjust interest rate
exposures when appropriate, based upon market conditions.  A portion of
the Company's borrowings are denominated in foreign currencies which
serves to partially offset the Company's exposure on its net investments
in subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies.  The Company's policy
generally is to hedge major foreign currency transaction exposures
through foreign exchange forward contracts.  These contracts are entered
into with major financial institutions thereby minimizing the risk of
credit loss. In order to limit the unanticipated earnings fluctuations
from volatility in commodity prices, the Company selectively enters into
commodity price swaps to convert variable raw material costs to fixed
costs. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial
instruments for speculative or trading purposes.  The Company is subject
to other foreign exchange market risk exposure in addition to the risks
on its financial instruments, such as possible impacts on its pricing and
production costs, which are difficult to reasonably predict, and have
therefore not been included in the table below. All items described are
non-trading and are stated in U.S. dollars.

Financial Instruments
   The fair value of financial instruments is determined by reference to
various market data and other valuation techniques as appropriate. The
Company believes the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable (net of allowance for doubtful accounts), prepaid
expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities,
income taxes payable and notes payable approximate fair value due to the
short-term nature of these instruments.  The Company estimates the fair
value of its total long-term debt was $859.9 million versus its carrying
value of $851.3 million as of December 31, 2004. The fair value
approximated the carrying value since much of the Company's debt is
variable rate and reflects current market rates. The fixed rate Eurobonds
are effectively converted to variable rate as a result of an interest
rate swap and the interest rates on revolving debt and commercial paper
are variable and therefore the fair value of these instruments
approximates their carrying values. The Company has fixed rate Swiss
franc and Japanese yen denominated notes with estimated fair values that
differ from their carrying values. At December 31, 2004, the fair value
of these instruments was $245.7 million versus their carrying values of
$237.0 million. The fair values differ from the carrying values due to
lower market interest rates at December 31, 2004 versus the rates at
issuance of the notes.

Derivative Financial Instruments
   The Company employs  derivative  financial  instruments to hedge certain
anticipated  transactions,  firm  commitments,  or assets  and  liabilities
denominated  in foreign  currencies.  Additionally,  the  Company  utilizes
interest  rate swaps to convert  floating  rate debt to fixed  rate,  fixed
rate debt to floating  rate,  cross  currency  basis swaps to convert  debt
denominated  in one  currency to another  currency and  commodity  swaps to
fix its variable raw materials.

      Foreign  Exchange  Risk  Management  The Company  enters into forward
   foreign exchange  contracts to selectively  hedge assets and liabilities
   denominated  in foreign  currencies.  Market  value gains and losses are
   recognized in income  currently and the resulting gains or losses offset
   foreign  exchange  gains or losses  recognized  on the foreign  currency
   assets  and  liabilities  hedged.  Determination  of hedge  activity  is
   based upon market  conditions,  the  magnitude  of the foreign  currency
   assets and liabilities and perceived  risks.  The Company's  significant
   contracts  outstanding  as of December  31, 2004 are  summarized  in the
   table that follows.  These foreign  exchange  contracts  generally  have
   maturities  of less than  twelve  months and the  counterparties  to the
   transactions are typically large international financial institutions.






      The Company has numerous investments in foreign subsidiaries.  The
   net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to volatility in currency
   exchange rates.  Currently, the Company uses both non-derivative
   financial instruments, including foreign currency denominated debt held
   at the parent company level and long-term intercompany loans, for which
   settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future and
   derivative financial instruments to hedge some of this exposure.
   Translation gains and losses related to the net assets of the foreign
   subsidiaries are offset by gains and losses in the non-derivative and
   derivative financial instruments designated as hedges of net
   investments.

      At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had Euro-denominated,
   Swiss franc-denominated, and Japanese yen-denominated debt (at the
   parent company level) to hedge the currency exposure related to a
   designated portion of the net assets of its European, Swiss, and
   Japanese subsidiaries. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the accumulated
   translation gains on investments in foreign subsidiaries, primarily
   denominated in Euros, Swiss francs and Japanese yen, net of these debt
   hedges, were $179.4 million and $109.5 million, respectively, which was
   included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive income.


      Interest  Rate Risk  Management  The Company uses interest rate swaps
   to convert a portion of its  variable  rate debt to fixed rate debt.  As
   of  December  31,  2004,  the  Company  has two  groups  of  significant
   variable rate to fixed rate  interest  rate swaps.  One of the groups of
   swaps  was  entered  into in  January  2000  and  February  2001,  has a
   notional  amount  totaling 180 million  Swiss  francs,  and  effectively
   converts the underlying  variable  interest rates on the debt to a fixed
   rate of 3.3%  for a  period  of  approximately  four  years.  The  other
   significant  group of swaps entered into in February  2002, has notional
   amounts  totaling 12.6 billion  Japanese yen, and  effectively  converts
   the underlying  variable interest rates to an average fixed rate of 1.6%
   for a term of ten  years.  As part of  entering  into the  Japanese  yen
   swaps  in  February  2002,   the  Company   entered  into  reverse  swap
   agreements  with the same terms to offset 115 million of the 180 million
   of Swiss franc swaps.  Additionally,  in the third quarter of 2003,  the
   Company  exchanged  the remaining  portion of the Swiss franc swaps,  65
   million Swiss francs, for a forward-starting  variable to fixed interest
   rate swap at a fixed rate of 4.2% for a term of seven years  starting in
   March 2005.

      The Company uses interest rate swaps to convert a portion of its
   fixed rate debt to variable rate debt.  In December 2001, the Company
   issued 350 million in Eurobonds at a fixed rate of 5.75% maturing in
   December 2006 to partially finance the Degussa Dental acquisition.
   Coincident with the issuance of the Eurobonds, the Company entered into
   two integrated transactions:  (a) an interest rate swap agreement with
   notional amounts totaling Euro 350 million which converted the 5.75%
   fixed rate Euro-denominated financing to a variable rate (based on the
   London Interbank Borrowing Rate) Euro-denominated financing; and (b) a
   cross-currency basis swap which converted this variable rate
   Euro-denominated financing to variable rate U.S. dollar-denominated
   financing.

      The Euro 350 million interest rate swap agreement was designated as
   a fair value hedge of the Euro 350 million in fixed rate debt pursuant
   to SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
   Activities" (SFAS No. 133).  In accordance with SFAS No. 133, the
   interest rate swap and underlying Eurobond have been marked-to-market
   via the income statement.  As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the
   accumulated fair value of the interest rate swap was $14.7 million and
   $14.1 million, respectively, and was recorded in Prepaid Expenses and
   Other Current Assets and Other Noncurrent Assets.  The notional amount
   of the underlying Eurobond was increased by a corresponding amount at
   December 31, 2004 and 2003.






      From inception through the first quarter of 2003, the cross-currency
   element of the integrated transaction was not designated as a hedge and
   changes in the fair value of the cross-currency element of the
   integrated transaction were marked-to-market in the income statement,
   offsetting the impact of the change in exchange rates on the Eurobonds
   that were also recorded in the income statement. In the first quarter
   of 2003, the Company amended the cross-currency element of the
   integrated transaction to realize the $ 51.8 million of accumulated
   value of the cross-currency swap.  The amendment eliminated the final
   payment (at a fixed rate of $.90) of $315 million by the Company in
   exchange for the final payment of Euro 350 million by the counterparty
   in return for the counterparty paying the Company LIBOR plus 4.29% for
   the remaining term of the agreement or approximately $14.0 million on
   an annual basis.  Other cash flows associated with the cross-currency
   element of the integrated transaction, included the Company's
   obligation to pay on $315 million LIBOR plus approximately 1.34%. and
   the counterparty's obligation to pay on Euro 350 million LIBOR plus
   approximately 1.47%, remained unchanged by the amendment. Additionally,
   the cross-currency element of the integrated transaction continues to
   be marked-to-market. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the accumulated
   fair value of the cross-currency element of the integrated transaction
   was $33.0 million and $56.6 million, respectively, and was recorded in
   Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets and Other Noncurrent Assets.

      No gain or loss was recognized upon the amendment of the cross
   currency element of the integrated transaction, as the interest rate of
   LIBOR plus 4.29% was established to ensure that the fair value of the
   cash flow streams before and after amendment were equivalent. As a
   result of the amendment, the Company became economically exposed to the
   impact of exchange rates on the final principal payment on the Euro 350
   million Eurobonds and designated the Euro 350 million Eurobonds as a
   hedge of net investment, on the date of the amendment and thus the
   impact of translation changes related to the final principal payment
   are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.

      The fair value of these swap agreements is the estimated amount the
   Company would receive (pay) at the reporting date, taking into account
   the effective interest rates and foreign exchange rates. As of December
   31, 2004 and 2003, the estimated net fair values of the swap agreements
   was $35.7 million and $63.1 million, respectively.

      Commodity Price Risk Management  The Company selectively enters into
   commodity price swaps to effectively fix certain variable raw material
   costs. These swaps are used purely to stabilize the cost of components
   used in the production of certain of the Company's products. The
   Company generally accounts for the commodity swaps as cash flow hedges
   under SFAS 133. As a result, the Company records the fair value of the
   swap primarily through other comprehensive income based on the tested
   effectiveness of the commodity swap.  Realized gains or losses in other
   comprehensive income are released and recorded to costs of products
   sold as the products associated with the commodity swaps are sold.

Consignment Arrangements
   The Company consigns the precious metals used in the production of
precious metal alloy products from various financial institutions.  Under
these consignment arrangements, the banks own the precious metal, and,
accordingly, the Company does not report this consigned inventory as part
of its inventory on its consolidated balance sheet.  These agreements are
cancelable by either party at the end of each consignment period; however
because the Company has access to numerous financial institutions with
excess capacity, consignment needs created by cancellations can be
shifted among the other institutions. The consignment agreements allow
the Company to take ownership of the metal at approximately the same time
customer orders are received and to closely match the price of the metal
acquired to the price charged to the customer (i.e., the price charged to
the customer is largely a pass through).






   As precious metal prices fluctuate, the Company evaluates the impact of
the precious metal price fluctuation on its target gross margins for
precious metal alloy products and revises the prices customers are
charged for precious metal alloy products accordingly, depending upon the
magnitude of the fluctuation.  While the Company does not separately
invoice customers for the precious metal content of precious metal alloy
products, the underlying precious metal content is the primary component
of the cost and sales price of the precious metal alloy products.  For
practical purposes, if the precious metal prices go up or down by a small
amount, the Company will not immediately modify prices, as long as the
cost of precious metals embedded in the Company's precious metal alloy
price closely approximates the market price of the precious metal.  If
there is a significant change in the price of precious metals, the
Company adjusts the price for the precious metal alloys, maintaining its
margin on the products.

   At December 31, 2004, the Company had 142,505 troy ounces of precious
metal, primarily gold, platinum and palladium, on consignment for periods
of less than one year with a market value of $60.1 million.  Under the
terms of the consignment agreements, the Company also makes compensatory
payments to the consignor banks based on a percentage of the value of the
consigned precious metals inventory.  At December 31, 2004, the average
annual rate charged by the consignor banks was 1.3%.  These compensatory
payments are considered to be a cost of the metals purchased and are
recorded as part of the cost of products sold.











Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

      The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The
Company's internal control over financial reporting is designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company's internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that,
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

      Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness of internal controls over financial
reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

      The Company's management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004.  In
making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)
in Internal Control--Integrated Framework.  Based on its assessment
management concluded that, as of December 31, 2004, the Company's
internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those
criteria.

   Management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 has been audited
by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm as stated in their report which is included herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
of DENTSPLY International Inc.:

We have completed an integrated audit of DENTSPLY International Inc.'s
2004 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 and audits of its 2003 and
2002 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Our
opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index
appearing under Item 15(a)(1),  present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of DENTSPLY International Inc. and its
subsidiaries at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2004 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.  In addition, in our
opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing
under Item 15(a) (2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
consolidated financial statements.  These financial statements and
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our
audits.  We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement.  An audit of financial statements includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.


Internal control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management's assessment, included in "Management's
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting," appearing under
Item 9A, that the Company maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 based on criteria established
in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore,
in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework issued by the COSO.  The Company's management is responsible
for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and
for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on
management's assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company's
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects.  An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances.  We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.






A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.  A company's internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

DENTSPLY INTERNATIONAL INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


NOTE 1 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Description of Business

   DENTSPLY  designs,  develops,  manufactures and markets a broad range of
products  for  the  dental  market.  The  Company  believes  that it is the
world's  leading   manufacturer  and  distributor  of  dental  prosthetics,
precious metal dental alloys, dental ceramics,  endodontic  instruments and
materials,  prophylaxis  paste,  dental  sealants,  ultrasonic  scalers and
crown and bridge  materials;  the leading  United States  manufacturer  and
distributor of dental  handpieces,  dental x-ray film holders,  film mounts
and  bone   substitute/grafting   materials;   and  a   leading   worldwide
manufacturer or distributor of dental  injectible  anesthetics,  impression
materials,  orthodontic  appliances,  dental cutting instruments and dental
implants.   The  Company  distributes  its  dental  products  in  over  120
countries  under  some of the  most  well  established  brand  names in the
industry.

   DENTSPLY is committed to the  development of  innovative,  high-quality,
cost effective products for the dental market.

Principles of Consolidation

   The  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of the
Company and all  majority-owned  subsidiaries.  Intercompany  accounts  and
transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

   The  preparation  of financial  statements in conformity  with generally
accepted  accounting  principles in the United States  requires  management
to make  estimates  and  assumptions  that affect the  reported  amounts of
assets  and  liabilities  and  the  disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and
liabilities  as of the date of the  financial  statements  and the reported
amounts  of  revenue  and  expense  during  the  reporting  period.  Actual
results could differ from those  estimates,  if different  assumptions  are
made or if different conditions exist.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

   The Company  considers  all highly liquid  investments  with an original
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Accounts and Notes Receivable-Trade

   The  Company  sells  dental   equipment  and  supplies  both  through  a
worldwide   network  of  distributors   and  directly  to  end  users.  For
customers on credit terms, the Company  performs ongoing credit  evaluation
of those  customers'  financial  condition and  generally  does not require
collateral  from them.  The Company  establishes  allowances  for  doubtful
accounts  for  estimated   losses  resulting  from  the  inability  of  its
customers to make required  payments.  Accounts and notes  receivable-trade
are stated net of these  allowances  which  were  $17.2  million  and $16.3
million at December 31, 2004 and 2003,  respectively.  The Company recorded
provisions  for  doubtful  accounts,  included  in  "Selling,  general  and
administrative  expenses",  of approximately $2.1 million, $0.6 million and
$2.9 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

   Certain of the  Company's  customers  are offered cash rebates  based on
targeted  sales  increases.  In accounting for these rebate  programs,  the
Company  records an accrual as a reduction  of net sales for the  estimated
rebate as sales  take place  throughout  the year in  accordance  with EITF
01-09,  "  Accounting  for  Consideration  Given by a Vendor to a  Customer
(Including a Reseller of the Vendor's Products)".






Inventories

   Inventories  are stated at the lower of cost or market.  At December 31,
2004 and 2003,  the cost of $10.8  million,  or 5%, and $11.4  million,  or
6%,   respectively,   of   inventories   was  determined  by  the  last-in,
first-out  ("LIFO")  method.  The cost of other  inventories was determined
by the first-in,  first-out  ("FIFO") or average cost methods.  The Company
establishes   reserves   for   inventory   estimated   to  be  obsolete  or
unmarketable  equal to the  difference  between the cost of  inventory  and
estimated  market  value based upon  assumptions  about  future  demand and
market conditions.

   If the  FIFO  method  had  been  used  to  determine  the  cost  of LIFO
inventories,  the  amounts at which net  inventories  are  stated  would be
higher than  reported at December  31, 2004 and  December  31, 2003 by $1.4
million and $1.0 million, respectively.

Property, Plant and Equipment

   Property,  plant and  equipment are stated at cost,  net of  accumulated
depreciation.   Except  for  leasehold   improvements,   depreciation   for
financial  reporting purposes is computed by the straight-line  method over
the following  estimated  useful lives:  buildings - generally 40 years and
machinery  and   equipment  -  4  to  15  years.   The  cost  of  leasehold
improvements  is amortized  over the shorter of the  estimated  useful life
or  the  term  of  the  lease.  Maintenance  and  repairs  are  charged  to
operations;  replacements and major  improvements  are  capitalized.  These
assets  are  reviewed  for  impairment  whenever  events  or  circumstances
provide  evidence  that suggest  that the carrying  amount of the asset may
not  be  recoverable.  Impairment  is  based  upon  an  evaluation  of  the
identifiable  undiscounted  cash flows. If impaired,  the resulting  charge
reflects the excess of the asset's carrying cost over its fair value.


Identifiable Finite-lived Intangible Assets

   Identifiable  finite-lived intangible assets, which primarily consist of
patents,   trademarks  and  licensing   agreements,   are  amortized  on  a
straight-line  basis over their estimated  useful lives,  ranging from 5 to
40 years.  These  assets are  reviewed for  impairment  whenever  events or
circumstances  provide  evidence  that suggest that the carrying  amount of
the asset may not be recoverable.  The Company closely monitors  intangible
assets  related to new  technology  for  indicators  of impairment as these
assets have more risk of  becoming  impaired.  Impairment  is based upon an
evaluation of the identifiable  undiscounted  cash flows. If impaired,  the
resulting  charge  reflects  the excess of the asset's  carrying  cost over
its fair value.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

   Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142 ("SFAS 142"), "Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets". This statement requires that the amortization of goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets be discontinued and instead an annual
impairment approach be applied. The Company performed the annual
impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets
during 2004, as required, and no impairment was identified. These
impairment tests are based upon a fair value approach rather than an
evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows. If impairment is identified
under SFAS 142, the resulting charge is determined by recalculating
goodwill through a hypothetical purchase price allocation of the fair
value and reducing the current carrying value to the extent it exceeds
the recalculated value. If impairment is identified on indefinite-lived
intangibles, the resulting charge reflects the excess of the asset's
carrying cost over its fair value.






Derivative Financial Instruments

   The Company adopted Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards No. 133
("SFAS  133"),   "Accounting   for  Derivative   Instruments   and  Hedging
Activities",  on  January 1, 2001.  This  standard,  as amended by SFAS 138
and 149,  requires  that all  derivative  instruments  be  recorded  on the
balance  sheet at  their  fair  value  and that  changes  in fair  value be
recorded each period in current earnings or comprehensive income.

   The Company employs  derivative  financial  instruments to hedge certain
anticipated  transactions,  firm  commitments,  or assets  and  liabilities
denominated  in foreign  currencies.  Additionally,  the  Company  utilizes
interest  rate swaps to convert  floating  rate debt to fixed  rate,  fixed
rate debt to floating  rate,  cross  currency  basis swaps to convert  debt
denominated  in one currency to another  currency,  and commodity  swaps to
fix its variable raw materials costs.


Litigation

   The  Company  and its  subsidiaries  are from  time to time  parties  to
lawsuits  arising out of their respective  operations.  The Company records
liabilities  when a loss  is  probable  and  can be  reasonably  estimated.
These  estimates  are  made by  management  based  on an  analysis  made by
internal and external legal counsel which  considers  information  known at
the time. Legal costs related to these lawsuits are expensed as incurred.

Foreign Currency Translation

   The  functional  currency  for foreign  operations,  except for those in
highly  inflationary  economies,  has  been  determined  to  be  the  local
currency.

   Assets  and  liabilities  of  foreign  subsidiaries  are  translated  at
exchange  rates  on the  balance  sheet  date;  revenue  and  expenses  are
translated at the average  year-to-date  rates of exchange.  The effects of
these translation  adjustments are reported in stockholders'  equity within
"Accumulated   other   comprehensive   income".   During  the  years  ended
December  31,  2004,  2003 and 2002 the  Company had  translation  gains of
$104.9  million,  $153.0 million and $121.4 million,  respectively,  offset
by  losses   of  $35.0   million,   $57.0   million   and  $32.7   million,
respectively, on its loans designated as hedges of net investments.

   Exchange  gains and losses  arising from  transactions  denominated in a
currency  other than the  functional  currency of the entity  involved  and
translation  adjustments  in countries with highly  inflationary  economies
are  included in income.  Exchange  losses of $1.2 million in 2004 and $3.5
million in 2002 and  exchange  gains of $0.3  million in 2003 are  included
in "Other expense (income), net".

Revenue Recognition

   Revenue, net of related discounts and allowances, is recognized in
accordance with shipping terms and as title and risk of loss pass to
customers. Net sales include shipping and handling costs collected from
customers in connection with the sale.

   A significant portion of the Company's net sales is comprised of sales
of precious metals generated through its precious metal alloy product
offerings. The precious metals content of sales was $212.3 million,
$203.7 million and $185.5 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Warranties

    The Company provides warranties on certain equipment products.
Estimated warranty costs are accrued when sales are made to customers.
Estimates for warranty costs are based primarily on historical warranty
claim experience.






Research and Development Costs

   Research and  development  ("R&D")  costs  relate  primarily to internal
costs for  salaries and direct  overhead  costs.  In addition,  the Company
contracts  with  outside  vendors to conduct R&D  activities.  All such R&D
costs are charged to expense when  incurred.  The Company  capitalizes  the
costs of equipment  that have general R&D uses and expenses  such  equipment
that is solely for  specific  R&D  projects.  The  depreciation  related to
this  capitalized  equipment is included in the  Company's  R&D costs.  R&D
costs are included in "Selling,  general and  administrative  expenses" and
amounted to  approximately  $44.6 million,  $43.3 million and $39.9 million
for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Income Taxes

   Income taxes are  determined  using the  liability  method of accounting
for income taxes in  accordance  with  Financial  Statement  of  Accounting
Standard No. 109,  "Accounting  for Income Taxes" ("SFAS 109").  Under SFAS
109,  tax  expense  includes  US and  international  income  taxes plus the
provision  for  US  taxes  on   undistributed   earnings  of  international
subsidiaries  not  deemed  to be  permanently  invested.  Tax  credits  and
other  incentives  reduce tax expense in the year the credits are  claimed.
Certain  items of income and  expense  are not  reported in tax returns and
financial  statements  in the same year.  The tax effect of such  temporary
differences  is reported  as deferred  income  taxes.  Deferred  tax assets
are  recognized  if it is more  likely  than not that  the  assets  will be
realized in future years.  The Company  establishes  a valuation  allowance
for deferred tax assets for which realization is not likely.

   The Company  accounts for income tax  contingencies  in accordance  with
the   Statement   of   Financial   Standards   No.   5,   "Accounting   for
Contingencies".

Earnings Per Share

   Basic  earnings per share is  calculated by dividing net earnings by the
weighted  average  number of shares  outstanding  for the  period.  Diluted
earnings per share is  calculated  by dividing net earnings by the weighted
average  number of shares  outstanding  for the  period,  adjusted  for the
effect of an assumed  exercise of all dilutive  options  outstanding at the
end of the period.





Stock Compensation

   The  Company  has  stock-based  employee  compensation  plans  which are
described  more fully in Note 13. The Company  applies the intrinsic  value
method in  accordance  with  Accounting  Principles  Board  Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees",  and related interpretations in
accounting   for  stock   compensation   plans.   Under  this  method,   no
compensation  expense is recognized for fixed stock option plans,  provided
that the  exercise  price  is  greater  than or  equal to the  price of the
stock at the date of grant.  The following table  illustrates the effect on
net income and  earnings  per share if the  Company  had  applied  the fair
value   recognition   provisions  of  Statement  of  Financial   Accounting
Standards  No.  123,   "Accounting   for  Stock-Based   Compensation",   to
stock-based  employee  compensation  (see also  discussion  of SFAS 123R in
New Accounting Pronouncements).



Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

   Other comprehensive  income (loss) includes foreign currency translation
adjustments  related  to the  Company's  foreign  subsidiaries,  net of the
related  changes in certain  financial  instruments  hedging  these foreign
currency  investments.  In  addition,  changes  in the  fair  value  of the
Company's  available-for-sale  investment securities and certain derivative
financial  instruments  and changes in its minimum  pension  liability  are
recorded in other comprehensive  income (loss).  These changes are recorded
in other  comprehensive  income (loss) net of any related tax effects.  For
the years  ended 2004,  2003 and 2002,  these  adjustments  were net of tax
benefits,  primarily related to foreign currency  translation  adjustments,
of $32.0 million, $29.1 million and $32.9 million, respectively.

   The balances included in accumulated other  comprehensive  income in the
consolidated balance sheets are as follows:



   The  cumulative  foreign  currency   translation   adjustments  included
translation  gains of $297.9  million and $193.0 million as of December 31,
2004 and 2003,  respectively,  offset by losses of $118.5 million and $83.5
million, respectively, on loans designated as hedges of net investments.






Reclassifications

   Certain  reclassifications  have been made to prior years' data in order
to conform to the current year presentation.

New Accounting Pronouncements

   In January 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")
released FASB Staff Position ("FSP") No. 106-1, "Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003." SFAS 106, "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions", requires a
company to consider current changes in applicable laws when measuring its
postretirement benefit costs and accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation. However, because of uncertainties of the effect of the
provisions of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003 (the "Act") on plan sponsors and certain
accounting issues raised by the Act, FSP 106-1 allows plan sponsors to
elect a one-time deferral of the accounting for the Act. The Company
elected the deferral provided by FSP 106-1 to analyze the impact of the
Act on prescription drug coverage provided to a limited number of
retirees from one of its business units. In May 2004, FASB released FSP
106-2 "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003." This FSP
provides final guidance on the accounting for the effects of the Act for
employers that sponsor postretirement health care plans that provide
prescription drug benefits. The FSP also requires those employers to
provide certain disclosures regarding the effect of the federal subsidy
provided by the Act.  FSP 106-2 superceded FSP 106-1 when it became
effective on July 1, 2004. The Company has not yet determined whether the
benefits provided under its postretirement benefit plans are actuarially
equivalent to Medicare Part D under The Act, and as a result, the
Company's benefit obligations or its net periodic service cost do not
reflect any amount associated with the subsidy. The Company does not
expect this act will have a material impact on the Company's
postretirement benefits liabilities or on its financial statements.

   In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123R ("SFAS 123R"), "Share-Based Payment".  This standard
eliminates the guidance of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees"  ("APB 25") and amends FASB
Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation" ("FAS 123").
The standard requires that all public companies report share-based
compensation expense at the grant date fair value of the related
share-based awards and no longer permits companies to account for options
under the intrinsic value approach of APB 25. SFAS 123R is effective for
interim and annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005. As the Company
has accounted for stock option grants under the APB 25 in the past, this
statement is expected to have a material impact on the Company's
financial statements once effective ($0.14 to $0.16 per diluted share on
an annualized basis). The Company is currently assessing its compensation
programs, its option valuation techniques and assumptions, and the
possible transition alternatives in order to determine the full impact of
adopting this standard.

   In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No 151, "Inventory Costs - An Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter
4".  This statement amends the guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4,
"Inventory Pricing", to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of
idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material
(spoilage).  Under ARB No. 43, in certain circumstances, items such as
idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double freight, and rehandling
costs that were considered to be unusually abnormal were required to be
treated as period charges.  Under FASB No. 151, these charges are
required to be treated as period charges regardless of whether they meet
the criterion of unusually abnormal.  Additionally, FASB No. 151 requires
that allocation of fixed production overhead to the cost of conversion
be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities.  FASB No.
151 is effective for all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005.  The
Company does not expect the application of this standard to have a
material impact on the Company's financial statements.






   In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 153, "Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets an amendment of APB
Opinion No. 29".  This statement amends Opinion 29 to eliminate the
exceptions that allowed for other than fair value measurement when
similar productive assets were exchanged, and replaced the exceptions
with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not
have commercial substance.  FASB Statement No 153 is effective for
nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after
June 15, 2005. The Company does not expect the application of this
statement to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.


NOTE 2 - EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

   The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted
earnings per common share:



   Options to purchase 1.0 million, 1.4 million and 0.1 million shares of
common stock that were outstanding during the years ended 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted
earnings per share since the options' exercise prices were greater than
the average market price of the common shares and, therefore, the effect
would be antidilutive.







NOTE 3 - BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

Acquisitions
   The Company accounts for all  acquisitions  under the purchase method of
accounting;  accordingly,  the  results  of  the  operations  acquired  are
included  in  the  accompanying   financial   statements  for  the  periods
subsequent  to the  respective  dates  of the  acquisitions.  The  purchase
prices  are  allocated  on the  basis of  estimates  of the fair  values of
assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

   In January 2002, the Company acquired the partial denture business of
Austenal Inc. ("Austenal") in a cash transaction valued at approximately
$17.8 million. Previously headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, Austenal
manufactured dental laboratory products and was the world leader in the
manufacture and sale of systems used by dental laboratories to fabricate
partial dentures.

      In March 2001, the Company acquired the dental injectible anesthetic
assets of AstraZeneca ("AZ Assets"). The total purchase price of this
transaction was composed of an initial $96.5 million payment which was
made at closing in March 2001 and a $20 million contingency payment
(including related accrued interest) associated with the first year sales
of injectible dental anesthetic which was paid during the first quarter
of 2002.

   In a separate agreement, as amended, the Company acquired the know-how,
patent and trademark rights to the non-injectible periodontal anesthetic
product known as Oraqix(R) with a purchase price composed of the
following: a $2.0 million payment upon submission of a New Drug
Application ("NDA") in the U.S. and a Marketing Authorization Application
("MAA") in Europe for the Oraqix(R) product under development; payments
of $6.0 million and $2.0 million upon the approval of the NDA and MAA,
respectively, for licensing rights; and a $10.0 million prepaid royalty
payment upon approval of both applications. The $2.0 million payment
related to the application filings was accrued and classified within the
restructuring and other costs line item during the fourth quarter of 2001
and was paid during the first quarter of 2002. The MAA was approved in
Sweden, the European Union member reference state, and the Company made
the required $2.0 million payment to AstraZeneca in the second quarter of
2003. The NDA application was approved in December 2003 and as a result
the remaining payments of $16.0 million became due and were accrued in
2003 and the payments were made in January 2004.  These payments were
capitalized and will be amortized over the term of the licensing
agreements.

Divestitures

   On February 27, 2004, the Company sold the assets and related
liabilities of the Gendex business to Danaher Corporation for $102.5
million cash, plus the assumption of certain pension liabilities. This
transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $72.9 million ($43.0 million
after-tax).  Gendex is a manufacturer of dental x-ray equipment and
accessories and intraoral cameras.  The sale of Gendex narrows the
Company's product lines to focus primarily on dental consumables.



NOTE 4 - SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION


Segment Information

   The Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131
("SFAS 131"), "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information".  SFAS 131 establishes standards for disclosing information
about reportable segments in financial statements. The Company has
numerous operating businesses covering a wide range of products and
geographic regions, primarily serving the professional dental market.
Professional dental products represented approximately 98% of sales in
2004, 2003 and 2002.






   The operating businesses are combined into operating groups which have
overlapping product offerings, geographical presence, customer bases,
distribution channels, and regulatory oversight. These operating groups
are considered the Company's reportable segments under SFAS 131 as the
Company's chief operating decision-maker regularly reviews financial
results at the operating group level and uses this information to manage
the Company's operations. The accounting policies of the segments are
consistent with those described for the consolidated financial statements
in the summary of significant accounting policies (see Note 1).  The
Company measures segment income for reporting purposes as net operating
profit before restructuring, interest and taxes. A description of the
services provided within each of the Company's five reportable segments
is provided below. The disclosure below reflects the Company's segment
reporting structure through December 31, 2004. In January 2005, the
Company reorganized its operating group structure consolidating into four
operating groups. Segment information will be disclosed under this new
structure beginning in the first quarter of 2005.

NOTE 6 - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS


   On February 27, 2004, the Company sold the assets and related
liabilities of the Gendex business to Danaher Corporation for $102.5
million cash, plus the assumption of certain pension liabilities.
Although the sales agreement contained a provision for a post-closing
adjustment to the purchase price based on changes in certain balance
sheet accounts, no such adjustments were necessary.  This transaction
resulted in a pre-tax gain of $72.9 million ($43.0 million after-tax).
Gendex is a manufacturer of dental x-ray equipment and accessories and
intraoral cameras.  The sale of Gendex narrows the Company's product
lines to focus primarily on dental consumables.

   During the first quarter of the year 2004, the Company discontinued the
operations of the Company's dental needle business (see Note 9).

   The Gendex business and the dental needle business are distinguishable
as separate components of the Company in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 ("SFAS 144"), "Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets".  The Gendex business and
the needle business were classified as held for sale at December 31, 2003
in accordance with SFAS 144. The statements of operations and related
financial statement disclosures for all prior years have been restated to
present the Gendex business and needle business as discontinued
operations separate from continuing operations.

NOTE 9 - GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

   Effective  January 1, 2002, the Company  adopted  Statement of Financial
Accounting  Standards No. 142 ("SFAS 142"),  "Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets".  This  statement  requires that the  amortization  of goodwill and
indefinite-lived  intangible  assets be discontinued  and instead an annual
impairment test approach be applied.  The impairment  tests are required to
be  performed  annually  (or more  often if adverse  events  occur) and are
based  upon  a  fair  value   approach   rather  than  an   evaluation   of
undiscounted  cash  flows.  If  goodwill  impairment  is  identified,   the
resulting  charge  is  determined  by  recalculating   goodwill  through  a
hypothetical  purchase price  allocation of the fair value and reducing the
current   carrying  value  to  the  extent  it  exceeds  the   recalculated
goodwill.  If impairment is  identified  on  indefinite-lived  intangibles,
the  resulting  charge  reflects  the excess of the asset's  carrying  cost
over its fair  value.  Other  intangible  assets  with  finite  lives  will
continue to be amortized over their useful lives.

   The Company  performed the required annual  impairment tests of goodwill
and  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  in 2004  and no  impairment  was
identified.  This  impairment  assessment  included  an  evaluation  of  22
reporting units. In addition to minimum annual  impairment  tests, SFAS 142
also  requires  that  impairment  assessments  be made more  frequently  if
events  or  changes  in   circumstances   indicate  that  the  goodwill  or
indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  might  be  impaired.  As the  Company
learns of such  changes  in  circumstances  through  periodic  analysis  of
actual  results  or  through  the  annual  development  of  operating  unit
business   plans  in  the  fourth   quarter  of  each  year,  for  example,
impairment assessments are performed as necessary.


   The table below presents the net carrying values of goodwill and
   identifiable intangible assets.

   A reconciliation of changes in the Company's goodwill is as follows:

                                                    December 31,

   The change in the net carrying value of goodwill in 2004 was primarily
due to foreign currency translation adjustments, changes to the purchase
price allocations of the Degussa Dental and Friadent acquisitions and a
small acquisition. The purchase price allocation changes were primarily
related to the reversal of preacquisition tax contingencies due to
expiring statutes.






   The increase in indefinite-lived licensing agreements was due to
foreign currency translation adjustments. These intangible assets relate
exclusively to the royalty-free licensing rights to AstraZeneca's dental
products and trademarks, which are primarily denominated in Swiss francs.
The change in finite-lived identifiable intangible assets was due
primarily to amortization for the period, the purchase of new technology
and foreign currency translation adjustments.

   Goodwill by reportable segment is as follows:

    Finite-lived identifiable intangible assets consist of the following:



   Amortization expense for finite-lived identifiable intangible assets
for 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $8.5 million, $8.8 million and $9.0 million,
respectively. The annual estimated amortization expense related to these
intangible assets for each of the five succeeding fiscal years is $7.8
million, $7.0 million, $6.2 million, $5.8 million and $5.6 million for
2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively.

NOTE 11 - FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS

Short-Term Borrowings

   Short-term bank borrowings  amounted to $1.5 million and $0.8 million at
December 31, 2004 and 2003,  respectively.  The weighted  average  interest
rates of these  borrowings  were  3.3% and 4.8% at  December  31,  2004 and
2003,  respectively.  Unused  lines of credit for  short-term  financing at
December  31,  2004  and  2003  were  $52.5  million  and  $84.9   million,
respectively.  Substantially  all short-term  borrowings were classified as
long-term  as of  December  31,  2004 and 2003,  reflecting  the  Company's
intent and ability to refinance these  obligations  beyond one year and are
included  in the table  below.  The  unused  lines of credit  have no major
restrictions  and are provided  under demand notes  between the Company and
the  lending  institution.  Interest is charged on  borrowings  under these
lines of credit at  various  rates,  generally  below  prime or  equivalent
money rates.


Long-Term Borrowings




      The table below reflects the contractual maturity dates of the
various borrowings at December 31, 2004 (in thousands). The individual
borrowings under the revolving credit agreement are structured to mature
on a quarterly basis but because the Company has the intent and ability
to extend them until the expiration date of the agreement, these
borrowings are considered contractually due in May 2006.

           2005       $ 71,346
           2006        731,174
           2007         48,766
           2008             --

2010 and beyond             --
                      $851,286






   The Company utilizes interest rate swaps to convert the variable rate
Japanese yen-denominated debt under the revolving facility to fixed rate
debt. In addition, swaps are used to convert the fixed rate Eurobond to
variable rate financing.  The Company's use of interest rate swaps is
further described in " QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT
MARKET RISK" and in Note 16.

   The Company has a $375 million revolving credit agreement with
participation from fifteen banks. The revolving credit agreements contain
a number of covenants and financial ratios which it is required to
satisfy. The most restrictive of these covenants pertain to asset
dispositions, maintenance of certain levels of net worth, and prescribed
ratios of indebtedness to total capital and operating income plus
depreciation and amortization to interest expense. Any breach of any such
covenants or restrictions would result in a default under the existing
borrowing documentation that would permit the lenders to declare all
borrowings under such documentation to be immediately due and payable
and, through cross default provisions, would entitle the Company's other
lenders to accelerate their loans. At December 31, 2004, the Company was
in compliance with these covenants. The Company pays a facility fee of
0.125 % annually on the amount of the commitment under the $250 million
five year facility ("facility B") and 0.125% annually under the $125
million 364-day facility ("facility A").  Interest rates on amounts
borrowed under the facility will depend on the maturity of the borrowing,
the currency borrowed, the interest rate option selected, and the
Company's long-term credit rating from Moody's and Standard and Poors.

   The $125 million facility A may be extended, subject to certain
conditions, for additional periods of 364 days, which the Company intends
to extend annually. The entire $375 million revolving credit agreement
has a usage fee of 0.125 % annually if utilization exceeds 50% of the
total available facility.

   The Company has complementary U.S. dollar and Euro multicurrency
commercial paper facilities totaling $250 million which have utilization,
dealer, and annual appraisal fees which on average cost 0.11% annually.
The $125 million facility A acts as back-up credit to this commercial
paper facility. The total available credit under the commercial paper
facilities and the facility A is $125 million  There were no outstanding
commercial paper obligations at December 31, 2004.

   In March 2001, the Company issued  Series A and B private placement
notes to Prudential Capital Group totaling Swiss francs 166.9 million at
an average rate of 4.49% with six year final maturities.  The notes were
issued to finance the acquisition of the AZ Assets.  In October 2001, the
Company issued a Series C private placement note to Prudential Capital
Group for Swiss francs 80.4 million at a rate of 4.96% with a five year
final maturity.  The series A and B notes were also amended in October
2001 to increase the interest rate by 30 basis points, reflecting the
Company's higher leverage.  In December 2001, the Company issued a
private placement note through ABN AMRO for Japanese yen 6.2 billion at a
rate of 1.39% with a four year final maturity.  The Series C note and the
ABN note were issued to partially finance the Degussa Dental acquisition.

   In December 2001, the Company issued 350 million Eurobonds with a
coupon of 5.75%, maturing December 2006 at an effective yield of 5.89%.
These bonds were issued to partially finance the Degussa Dental
acquisition.

   At December 31, 2004, the Company had total unused lines of credit,
including lines available under its short-term arrangements, of $307.0
million.





NOTE 12 - STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

   In December 2003, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of
up to 1.0 million shares of common stock for the year ended December 31,
2004 on the open market, with authorization expiring at the end of the
year. As a result of this program, the company repurchased 815,000 shares
for a total cost of $39.4 million. Of these shares purchased, 30,000, at
a cost of $1.7 million, will settle in 2005. No share repurchases were
made during 2003 and 2002. In December 2004 the Board of Directors
approved a stock repurchase program under which the Company may
repurchase shares of stock in an amount to maintain up to 3,000,000
shares of treasury stock. As of December 31, 2004, the Company held
757,000 shares of treasury stock.

   The  Company has stock  options  outstanding  under  three stock  option
plans (1993  Plan,  1998 Plan and 2002  Plan).  Further  grants can only be
made  under the 2002  Plan.  Under  the 1993 and 1998  Plans,  a  committee
appointed  by  the  Board  of  Directors   granted  to  key  employees  and
directors of the Company  options to purchase  shares of common stock at an
exercise  price  determined by such  committee,  but not less than the fair
market  value of the common stock on the date of grant.  Options  generally
expire  ten years  after the date of grant  under  these  plans and  grants
become  exercisable  over a period of three  years  after the date of grant
at the rate of  one-third  per year,  except that they  become  immediately
exercisable upon death, disability or retirement.

   The 2002 Plan  authorized  grants of 7.0 million shares of common stock,
(plus any  unexercised  portion of canceled  or  terminated  stock  options
granted  under the DENTSPLY  International  Inc. 1993 and 1998 Stock Option
Plans),  subject to  adjustment  as  follows:  each  January,  if 7% of the
outstanding  common  shares of the Company  exceed 7.0 million,  the excess
becomes  available  for grant  under the Plan.  The 2002 Plan  enables  the
Company to grant "incentive  stock options"  ("ISOs") within the meaning of
Section  422 of the  Internal  Revenue  Code of 1986,  as  amended,  to key
employees  of the  Company,  and  "non-qualified  stock  options"  ("NSOs")
which do not constitute  ISOs to key employees and  non-employee  directors
of  the   Company.   Grants  of  options  to  key   employees   are  solely
discretionary  with the Board of Directors  of the  Company.  ISOs and NSOs
generally  expire ten years from date of grant and become  exercisable over
a period of three  years  after the date of grant at the rate of  one-third
per year,  except  that they  become  immediately  exercisable  upon death,
disability or retirement.  Such options are granted at exercise  prices not
less than the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date.

   Future  option  grants may only be made under the 2002 Plan,  which will
include the unexercised  portion of canceled or terminated  options granted
under the 1993 or 1998  Plans.  The  number of shares  available  for grant
under the 2002 plan as of December  31,  2004 was  5,249,000  shares.  Each
non-employee  director  receives  an  automatic  grant of NSOs to  purchase
9,000 shares of common  stock on the date he or she becomes a  non-employee
director and an additional  9,000 options on the third  anniversary  of the
date of the non-employee director was last granted an option.






   The  following  is a summary of the  status of the Plans as of  December
31,  2004,  2003 and 2002 and  changes  during  the  years  ending on those
dates:










   The Company uses the Black-Scholes  option pricing model to value option
awards.  The per share  weighted  average  fair value of stock  options and
the weighted  average  assumptions  used to  determine  these values are as
follows:

                                        Year Ended December 31,
                                   2004         2003           2002
Per share fair value          $   13.46     $   14.85     $   12.69
Expected dividend yield            0.44%         0.48%         0.50%
Risk-free interest rate            3.56%         3.36%         3.35%
Expected volatility                  20%           31%           34%
Expected life (years)              5.50          5.50          5.50


   The  Black-Scholes  option  pricing  model was  developed  for  tradable
options with short  exercise  periods and is therefore not  necessarily  an
accurate measure of the fair value of compensatory stock options.

   The rollforward of the common shares and the treasury shares
outstanding is as follows:


                                          Common       Treasury     Outstanding

   The Company's effective tax rate for 2004 was 23.3%.  During 2004, the
Company recorded a tax benefit of $19.5 million primarily from the
reversal of previously accrued taxes from the settlement of prior years'
domestic and foreign tax audits, refunds of additional R&D credits and
other adjustments.  The impact of this benefit on the effective tax rate
for 2004 was 7.1%.

   The Company  operates within multiple  taxing  jurisdictions  and in the
normal  course of  business  is  examined  in  various  jurisdictions.  Tax
accruals  related  to the  estimated  outcome  of  these  examinations  are
recorded  in  accordance  with  Statement  of  Financial  Standards  No.  5
"Accounting  for  Contingencies"  ("SFAS 5").  The reversal of the accruals
is recorded when  examinations are completed,  statutes of limitation close
or tax laws change.  A net benefit of $5.5  million was  recorded  from the
release of  previously  accrued  taxes  related  to  domestic  and  foreign
examinations  that were  concluded in 2004,  less current year tax accruals
for existing examination risks.

   Certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company have tax loss carryforwards
of $73.0 million at December 31, 2004, of which $14.3 million expire
through 2011 and $58.7 million may be carried forward indefinitely.  The
tax benefit of these tax loss carryforwards has been fully offset by a
valuation allowance at December 31, 2004, because it is uncertain whether
the benefits will be realized in the future.  The valuation allowance at
December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $22.8 million and $9.6 million,
respectively.

   The Company has provided federal income taxes on certain undistributed
earnings of its foreign subsidiaries that the Company anticipates will be
repatriated.  Deferred federal income taxes have not been provided on
$409 million of cumulative earnings of foreign subsidiaries that the
Company has determined to be permanently reinvested.  It is not
practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable on these
permanently reinvested earnings.

   On  October  22,  2004,  the  American  Jobs  Creation  Act of 2004 (the
"AJCA") was signed into law.  The AJCA  enacted a provision  that  provides
the  Company  with the  opportunity  to  repatriate  up to $500  million of
reinvested  earnings  and  to  claim  a  deduction  equal  to  85%  of  the
repatriated  amount.  The  Company  did  not  elect  the  benefit  of  this
provision  in 2004.  The Company has not  determined  whether,  and to what
extent, an election will be made in 2005.

   The pretax income from discontinued operations for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $72.8 million, $7.3 million and $6.9
million, respectively. The income tax expense related to discontinued
operations for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $29.9
million, $3.0 million and $2.6 million, respectively.






NOTE 14 - BENEFIT PLANS

   Substantially all of the employees of the Company and its subsidiaries
are covered by government or Company-sponsored benefit plans.  Total
costs for Company-sponsored defined benefit, defined contribution and
employee stock ownership plans amounted to $11.7 million in 2004, $13.5
million in 2003 and $11.5 million in 2002.

Defined Contribution Plans
   The DENTSPLY Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") is a
non-contributory defined contribution plan that covers substantially all
of the United States based non-union employees of the Company.
Contributions to the ESOP were $0.4 million for 2004, $2.2 million for
2003 and $2.2 million for 2002.  The Company makes annual contributions
to the ESOP of not less than the amounts required to service ESOP debt.
In connection with the refinancing of ESOP debt in March 1994, the
Company agreed to make additional cash contributions totaling at least
$0.6 million through 2003.  Dividends received by the ESOP on allocated
shares are either reinvested in participants' accounts or passed through
to Plan participants, at the participant's election.  Most ESOP shares
were initially pledged as collateral for its debt.  As the debt is
repaid, shares were released from collateral and allocated to active
employees based on the proportion of debt service paid in the year.  At
December 31, 2004, the ESOP held 5.8 million shares, all of which were
allocated to plan participants as the ESOP debt was fully repaid in
2004.  Unallocated shares were acquired prior to December 31, 1992 and
are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Position 76-3.
Accordingly, all shares held by the ESOP are considered outstanding and
are included in the earnings per common share computations.

   The ESOP loan was extinguished on March 31, 2004.  All future
allocations will come from a combination of forfeited shares and shares
acquired in the open market.  The Company has targeted future ESOP
allocations at 6% of pensionable earnings.  The share allocation will be
accounted at fair value at the point of allocation, each year-end, in
accordance with SOP 93-6. The 2005 estimated annual expense, net of
forfeitures, is estimated to be approximately $4.5 million based on the
current share price of $54.00.

   The Company sponsors an employee 401(k) savings plan for its United
States workforce to which enrolled participants may contribute up to IRS
defined limits.

Defined Benefit Plans
   The Company maintains a number of separate contributory and
non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plans and other
postretirement medical plans for certain union and salaried employee
groups in the United States.  Pension benefits for salaried plans are
based on salary and years of service; hourly plans are based on
negotiated benefits and years of service.  Annual contributions to the
pension plans are sufficient to satisfy legal funding requirements.
Pension plan assets are held in trust and consist mainly of common stock
and fixed income investments.

   The Company maintains defined benefit pension plans for its employees
in Germany, Japan, The Netherlands, and Switzerland.  These plans provide
benefits based upon age, years of service and remuneration.
Substantially all of the German plans are unfunded book reserve plans.
Other foreign plans are not significant individually or in the
aggregate.  Most employees and retirees outside the United States are
covered by government health plans.

Postretirement Healthcare
   The plans for postretirement healthcare have no plan assets.  The
postretirement healthcare plan covers certain union and salaried employee
groups in the United States and is contributory, with retiree
contributions adjusted annually to limit the Company's contribution for
participants who retired after June 1, 1985.  The Company also sponsors
unfunded non-contributory postretirement medical plans for a limited
number of union employees and their spouses and retirees of a
discontinued operation.

NOTE 15 - RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER COSTS (INCOME) AND OTHER CHARGES

Restructuring and Other Costs (Income)

   Restructuring and other costs (income) consists of the following:



   During the third and fourth quarters of 2004, the Company recorded
restructuring and other costs of $5.7 million. These costs were primarily
related to the creation of a European Shared Services Center in Yverdon,
Switzerland, which resulted in the identification of redundant personnel
in the Company's European accounting functions. In addition, these costs
related to the consolidation of certain sales/customer service and
distribution facilities in Europe and Japan. The primary objective of
these restructuring initiatives is to improve operational efficiencies
and to reduce costs within the related businesses. Included in this
charge were severance costs of $4.8 million and lease/contract
termination costs of $0.9 million. The plans include the elimination of
approximately 120 administrative and manufacturing positions primarily in
Germany. These plans are expected to be complete by the first quarter of
2006. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 105 of these positions
remained to be eliminated. The major components of these charges and the
remaining outstanding balances at December 31, 2004 are as follows:


                                       Amounts    Balance
                          2004         Applied  December 31,

                        $ 5,758      $  (583)     $5,175






   During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company recorded restructuring
and other costs of $4.5 million. These costs were primarily related to
impairment charges recorded to certain investments in emerging
technologies. The products related to these technologies were abandoned
and therefore these assets were no longer viewed as being recoverable. In
addition, certain costs were associated with the restructuring or
consolidation of the Company's operations, primarily its U.S. laboratory
businesses and the closure of its European central warehouse in Nijmegan,
The Netherlands. Included in this charge were severance costs of $0.9
million, lease/contract termination costs of $0.6 million and intangible
and other asset impairment charges of $3.0 million.  In addition, during
2004, the Company recorded charges of $1.4 million for additional
severance, lease termination and other restructuring costs incurred
during the period related to these plans. These restructuring plans will
result in the elimination of approximately 70 administrative and
manufacturing positions primarily in the United States, 18 of which
remain to be eliminated as of December 31, 2004. Certain of these
positions will need to be replaced at the consolidated site and therefore
the net reduction in positions is expected to be approximately 25. These
plans are expected to be complete by March 31, 2005. The major components
of these charges and the remaining outstanding balances at December 31,
2004 are as follows:



   During the second quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a charge of
$1.7 million for restructuring and other costs. The charge primarily
related to the elimination of duplicative functions created as a result
of combining the Company's Ceramed and U.S. Friadent divisions. Included
in this charge were severance costs of $0.6 million, lease/contract
termination costs of $0.9 million and $0.2 million of impairment charges
on fixed assets that were disposed of as a result of the restructuring
plan. This restructuring plan resulted in the elimination of
approximately 35 administrative and manufacturing positions in the United
States and was substantially complete as of December 31, 2002.






   As part of combining Austenal with the Company in 2002, $4.4 million of
liabilities were established through purchase accounting for the
restructuring of the acquired company's operations, primarily in the
United States and Germany. Included in this liability were severance
costs of $2.9 million, lease/contract termination costs of $1.4 million
and other restructuring costs of $0.1 million. During 2003 and 2004, the
Company reversed a total of $1.3 million, which was recorded to goodwill,
as a change in estimate as it determined the costs to complete the plan
were lower than originally estimated. This restructuring plan included
the elimination of approximately 75 administrative and manufacturing
positions in the United States and Germany. This plan was substantially
complete at March 31, 2004.

   The major components of the 2002 restructuring charges and the amounts
recorded through purchase price accounting and the remaining outstanding
balances at December 31, 2004 are as follows:



   In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a charge of $12.3
million for restructuring and other costs.  The charge included costs of
$6.0 million to restructure the Company's existing operations, primarily
in Germany, Japan and Brazil, as a result of the integration with Degussa
Dental. Included in this charge were severance costs of $2.1 million,
lease/contract termination costs of $1.1 million and other restructuring
costs of $0.2 million. In addition, the Company recorded $2.6 million of
impairment charges on fixed assets that were disposed of as a result of
the restructuring plan. The remaining charge of $6.3 million involves
impairment charges on intangible assets. During 2002 and 2003 the Company
reversed a net total of $1.0 million and $0.8 million, respectively, as a
change in estimate as it determined the costs to complete the plan were
lower than originally estimated. This restructuring plan resulted in the
elimination of approximately 160 administrative and manufacturing
positions in Germany, Japan and Brazil. As part of these reorganization
activities, some of these positions were replaced with lower-cost
outsourced services. This plan was complete at December 31, 2003.






   In the first quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a charge of $5.5
million related to reorganizing certain functions within Europe, Brazil
and North America. The primary objectives of this reorganization were to
consolidate duplicative functions and to improve efficiencies within
these regions. Included in this charge were severance costs of $3.1
million, lease/contract termination costs of $0.6 million and other
restructuring costs of $0.8 million. In addition, the Company recorded
$1.0 million of impairment charges on fixed assets that will be disposed
of as a result of the restructuring plan. This restructuring plan
resulted in the elimination of approximately 310 administrative and
manufacturing positions in Brazil and Germany. As part of these
reorganization activities, some of these positions were replaced with
lower-cost outsourced services. During the first quarter of 2002, this
plan was completed and the remaining accrual balances of $1.9 million
were reversed as a change in estimate.

   On January 25, 2001, the Company suffered a fire at its Maillefer
facility in Switzerland. The fire caused severe damage to a building and
to most of the equipment it contained. During the third quarter of 2002,
the Company received insurance proceeds for settlement of the damages
caused to the building. These proceeds resulted in the Company
recognizing a net gain on the damaged building of approximately $0.7
million. The Company also received insurance proceeds on the destroyed
equipment during the fourth quarter of 2001 and recorded the related
disposal gains of $5.8 million during that period.

   During the fourth quarter 2003, the Company made the decision to
discontinue the operations of its dental needle business. The business
consists of one manufacturing location which ceased operations on March
31, 2004. As a result of this decision, the Company recorded a charge in
the fourth quarter of 2003 of $1.6 million as a reduction in income from
discontinued operations. Included in this charge were severance costs of
$0.4 million, fixed asset impairment charges of $0.5 million, $0.4
million of impairment charges related to goodwill and other restructuring
costs of $0.3 million. In addition, during the year ended December 31,
2004, the Company recorded charges of $0.5 million for additional
severance, other restructuring costs and fixed asset impairment charges
incurred during the period related to this closing. This plan resulted in
the elimination of approximately 55 administrative and manufacturing
positions in the United States. This plan was substantially complete at
March 31, 2004. The major components of these charges are as follows:



Other Charges

   In the first and second quarters of 2003, the Company recorded charges
and reserve reversals which represented corrections of errors from prior
periods ("Charge and Reserve Errors"). Had the Charge and Reserve Errors
been recorded in the proper periods, reported net income from continuing
operations would have higher by $1.3 million in 2003, lower by $3.4
million in 2002, higher by $1.2 million in 2001 and higher by $0.8
million in 2000.

   The Company performed an analysis of the Charge and Reserve Errors on
both a qualitative and quantitative basis and concluded that the errors
were not material to the results of operations and financial position of
the Company for the years ended December 31, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003.
Accordingly, prior period financial statements were not restated. (see
Note 19 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the
Company's Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2003).





NOTE 16 - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVES

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

   The fair value of financial instruments is determined by reference to
various market data and other valuation techniques as appropriate. The
Company believes the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable (net of allowance for doubtful accounts), prepaid
expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities,
income taxes payable and notes payable approximate fair value due to the
short-term nature of these instruments.  The Company estimates the fair
value of its total long-term debt was $859.9 million versus its carrying
value of $851.3 million as of December 31, 2004. The fair value
approximated the carrying value since much of the Company's debt is
variable rate and reflects current market rates. The fixed rate Eurobonds
are effectively converted to variable rate as a result of an interest
rate swap and the interest rates on revolving debt and commercial paper
are variable and therefore the fair value of these instruments
approximates their carrying values. The Company has fixed rate Swiss
franc and Japanese yen denominated notes with estimated fair values that
differ from their carrying values. At December 31, 2004, the fair value
of these instruments was $245.7 million versus their carrying values of
$237.0 million. The fair values differ from the carrying values due to
lower market interest rates at December 31, 2004 versus the rates at
issuance of the notes.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

   The Company's activities expose it to a variety of market risks which
primarily include the risks related to the effects of changes in foreign
currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. These
financial exposures are monitored and managed by the Company as part of
its overall risk-management program. The objective of this risk
management program is to reduce the potentially adverse effects that
these market risks may have on the Company's operating results.

   Certain of the Company's inventory purchases are denominated in foreign
currencies which exposes the Company to market risk associated with
exchange rate movements.  The Company's policy generally is to hedge
major foreign currency transaction exposures through foreign exchange
forward contracts.  These contracts are entered into with major financial
institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss.  In addition,
the Company's investments in foreign subsidiaries are denominated in
foreign currencies, which creates exposures to changes in exchange rates.
The Company uses debt denominated in the applicable foreign currency as a
means of hedging a portion of this risk.

   With the Company's significant level of long-term debt, changes in the
interest rate environment can have a major impact on the Company's
earnings, depending upon its interest rate exposure. As a result, the
Company manages its interest rate exposure with the use of interest rate
swaps, when appropriate, based upon market conditions.

   The manufacturing of some of the Company's products requires the use of
commodities which are subject to market fluctuations.  In order to limit
the unanticipated earnings changes from such market fluctuations, the
Company selectively enters into commodity price swaps for certain
materials used in the production of its products.  Additionally, the
Company uses non-derivative methods, such as the precious metal
consignment agreement to effectively hedge commodity risks.

Cash Flow Hedges

   The  Company  uses  interest  rate  swaps to  convert a  portion  of its
variable  rate debt to fixed  rate  debt.  As of  December  31,  2004,  the
Company  has  two  groups  of  significant  variable  rate  to  fixed  rate
interest  rate  swaps.  One of the  groups  of swaps  was  entered  into in
January  2000  and  February  2001,  has a  notional  amount  totaling  180
million Swiss francs,  and  effectively  converts the  underlying  variable
interest  rates  on the  debt to a  fixed  rate of  3.3%  for a  period  of
approximately  four years.  The other  significant  group of swaps  entered
into  in  February  2002,  has  notional   amounts  totaling  12.6  billion
Japanese yen, and  effectively  converts the underlying  variable  interest
rates to an average  fixed  rate of 1.6% for a term of ten  years.  As part
of  entering  into the  Japanese  yen swaps in February  2002,  the Company
entered  into  reverse  swap  agreements  with the same terms to offset 115
million  of the 180  million of Swiss  franc  swaps.  Additionally,  in the
third quarter of 2003, the Company  exchanged the remaining  portion of the
Swiss  franc  swaps,  65  million  Swiss  francs,  for  a  forward-starting
variable  to fixed  interest  rate swap at a fixed  rate of 4.2% for a term
of seven years starting in March 2005.






   The Company selectively enters into commodity price swaps to
effectively fix certain variable raw material costs. At December 31,
2004, the Company had swaps in place to purchase 1,800 troy ounces of
platinum bullion for use in the production of its impression material
products. The average fixed rate of this agreement is $846.50 per troy
ounce. The Company generally hedges up to 80% of its projected annual
platinum needs related to these products.

   The Company enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge the foreign
currency exposure of its anticipated purchases of certain inventory from
Japan. In addition, exchange contracts are used by certain of the
Company's subsidiaries to hedge intercompany inventory purchases which
are denominated in non-local currencies. The forward contracts that are
used in these programs mature in twelve months or less. The Company
generally hedges up to 80% of its anticipated purchases from the
supplying locations.

   As of December 31, 2004, $0.2 million of deferred net gains on
derivative instruments recorded in "Accumulated other comprehensive gain
(loss)" are expected to be reclassified to current earnings during the
next twelve months. This reclassification is primarily due to the sale of
inventory that includes previously hedged purchases. The maximum term
over which the Company is hedging exposures to variability of cash flows
(for all forecasted transactions, excluding interest payments on
variable-rate debt) is eighteen months. Overall, the derivatives
designated as cash flow hedges are nearly 100% effective.

Fair Value Hedges

   The Company uses interest rate swaps to convert a portion of its fixed
rate debt to variable rate debt.  In December 2001, the Company issued
350 million in Eurobonds at a fixed rate of 5.75% maturing in December
2006 to partially finance the Degussa Dental acquisition.  Coincident
with the issuance of the Eurobonds, the Company entered into two
integrated transactions:  (a) an interest rate swap agreement with
notional amounts totaling Euro 350 million which converted the 5.75%
fixed rate Euro-denominated financing to a variable rate (based on the
London Interbank Borrowing Rate) Euro-denominated financing; and (b) a
cross-currency basis swap which converted this variable rate
Euro-denominated financing to variable rate U.S. dollar-denominated
financing.

   The Euro 350 million interest rate swap agreement was designated as a
fair value hedge of the Euro 350 million in fixed rate debt pursuant to
SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities" (SFAS No. 133).  In accordance with SFAS No. 133, the
interest rate swap and underlying Eurobond have been marked-to-market via
the income statement with no net impact to the income statement.  As of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, the accumulated fair value of the interest
rate swap was $14.7 million and $14.1 million, respectively, and was
recorded in Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets and Other
Noncurrent Assets.  The notional amount of the underlying Eurobond was
increased by a corresponding amount at December 31, 2004 and 2003.

   From inception through the first quarter of 2003, the cross-currency
element of the integrated transaction was not designated as a hedge and
changes in the fair value of the cross-currency element of the integrated
transaction were marked-to-market in the income statement, completely
offsetting the impact of the change in exchange rates on the Eurobonds
that were also recorded in the income statement. In the first quarter of
2003, the Company amended the cross-currency element of the integrated
transaction to realize the $ 51.8 million of accumulated value of the
cross-currency swap.  The amendment eliminated the final payment (at a
fixed rate of $.90) of $315 million by the Company in exchange for the
final payment of Euro 350 million by the counterparty in return for the
counterparty paying the Company LIBOR plus 4.29% for the remaining term
of the agreement or approximately $14.0 million on an annual basis.
Other cash flows associated with the cross-currency element of the
integrated transaction, included the Company's obligation to pay on $315
million LIBOR plus approximately 1.34% and the counterparty's obligation
to pay on Euro 350 million LIBOR plus approximately 1.47%, remained
unchanged by the amendment. Additionally, the cross-currency element of
the integrated transaction continues to be marked-to-market. As of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, the accumulated fair value of the
cross-currency element of the integrated transaction was $33.0 million
and $56.6 million, respectively, and was recorded in Prepaid Expenses and
Other Current Assets and Other Noncurrent Assets.






   No gain or loss was recognized upon the amendment of the cross currency
element of the integrated transaction, as the interest rate of LIBOR plus
4.29% was established to ensure that the fair value of the cash flow
streams before and after amendment were equivalent. As a result of the
amendment, the Company became economically exposed to the impact of
exchange rates on the final principal payment on the Euro 350 million
Eurobonds and designated the Euro 350 million Eurobonds as a hedge of net
investment, on the date of the amendment and thus the impact of
translation changes related to the final principal payment are recorded
in accumulated other comprehensive income.


Hedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations

   The Company has numerous investments in foreign subsidiaries.  The net
assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to volatility in currency
exchange rates.  Currently, the Company uses non-derivative financial
instruments, including foreign currency denominated debt held at the
parent company level and long-term intercompany loans, for which
settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future and
derivative financial instruments to hedge some of this exposure.
Translation gains and losses related to the net assets of the foreign
subsidiaries are offset by gains and losses in the non-derivative and
derivative financial instruments designated as hedges of net
investments.

   At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had Euro-denominated, Swiss
franc-denominated, and Japanese yen-denominated debt (at the parent
company level) to hedge the currency exposure related to a designated
portion of the net assets of its European, Swiss, and Japanese
subsidiaries. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the accumulated translation
gains on investments in foreign subsidiaries, primarily denominated in
Euros, Swiss francs and Japanese yen, net of these debt hedges, were
$179.4 million and $109.5 million, respectively, which was included in
Accumulated Other Comprehensive income.


Other

   As of December 31, 2004, the Company had recorded assets representing
the fair value of derivative instruments of $15.3 million in "Prepaid
expenses and other current assets" and $32.7 million in "Other noncurrent
assets" on the balance sheet and liabilities representing the fair value
of derivative instruments of $3.6 million in "Accrued liabilities" and
$8.4 million in "Other noncurrent liabilities".

   In accordance with SFAS 52, "Foreign Currency Translation", the Company
utilizes long-term intercompany loans to eliminate foreign currency
transaction exposures of certain foreign subsidiaries. Net gains or
losses related to these long-term intercompany loans, those for which
settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future, are
included "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)".






NOTE 17 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Leases
   The Company leases automobiles and machinery and equipment and certain
office, warehouse, and manufacturing facilities under non-cancelable
operating leases.  These leases generally require the Company to pay
insurance, taxes and other expenses related to the leased property.
Total rental expense for all operating leases was $22.0 million for 2004,
$20.7 million for 2003, and $17.4 million for 2002.

   Rental commitments, principally for real estate (exclusive of taxes,
insurance and maintenance), automobiles and office equipment are as
follows (in thousands):

2005                                       $ 18,725
2006                                         12,645
2007                                          6,788
2008                                          4,373
2009                                          3,051
2010 and thereafter                           5,207
                                           $ 50,789


Litigation


   DENTSPLY and its subsidiaries are from time to time parties to lawsuits
arising out of their respective operations.  The Company believes it is
unlikely that pending litigation to which DENTSPLY is a party will have a
material adverse effect upon its consolidated financial position or
results of operations.

   In June 1995, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of
Justice initiated an antitrust investigation regarding the policies and
conduct undertaken by the Company's Trubyte Division with respect to the
distribution of artificial teeth and related products.  On January 5,
1999 the Department of Justice filed a Complaint against the Company in
the U.S. District Court in Wilmington, Delaware alleging that the
Company's tooth distribution practices violate the antitrust laws and
seeking an order for the Company to discontinue its practices.  The trial
in the government's case was held in April and May 2002. On August 14,
2003, the Judge entered a decision that the Company's tooth distribution
practices do not violate the antitrust laws. The Department of Justice
appealed this decision to the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals.  The
Third Circuit Court issued its decision on February 22, 2005 and reversed
the decision of the District Court. The effect of this decision, if it
withstands any appeal challenge by the Company, will be the issuance of
an injunction requiring DENTSPLY to discontinue its policy of not
allowing its tooth dealers to take on new competitive teeth lines.  This
decision relates only to the distribution of artificial teeth sold in the
U.S., which affects less than 2.5% of the Company's sales. While the
Company believes its tooth distribution practices do not violate the
antitrust laws, we are confident that we can continue to develop this
business regardless of the final legal outcome. The Company is currently
evaluating its legal options as well as its marketing and sales
strategies in light of the current court ruling.

   Subsequent to the filing of the Department of Justice Complaint in
1999, several private party class actions were filed based on allegations
similar to those in the Department of Justice case, on behalf of
laboratories, and denture patients in seventeen states who purchased
Trubyte teeth or products containing Trubyte teeth. These cases were
transferred to the U.S. District Court in Wilmington, Delaware.  The
private party suits seek damages in an unspecified amount.  The Court has
granted the Company's Motion on the lack of standing of the laboratory
and patient class actions to pursue damage claims. The Plaintiffs in the
laboratory case have appealed this decision to the Third Circuit and
briefs of the parties have been submitted.  Also, private party class
actions on behalf of indirect purchasers were filed in California and
Florida state courts.  The California and Florida cases have been
dismissed by the Plaintiffs following the decision by the Federal
District Court Judge issued in August 2003.






   On March 27, 2002, a Complaint was filed in Alameda County, California
(which was transferred to Los Angeles County) by Bruce Glover, D.D.S.
alleging, inter alia, breach of express and implied warranties, fraud,
unfair trade practices and negligent misrepresentation in the Company's
manufacture and sale of Advance(R) cement.  The Complaint seeks damages in
an unspecified amount for costs incurred in repairing dental work in
which the Advance(R) product allegedly failed. The Judge has entered an
Order granting class certification, as an Opt-in class (this means that
after Notice of the class action is sent to possible class members, a
party will have to determine they meet the class definition and take
affirmative action in order to join the class) on the claims of breach of
warranty and fraud.  In general, the Class is defined as California
dentists who purchased and used Advance(R) cement and were required,
because of failures of the cement, to repair or reperform dental
procedures.  The Notice of the class action was sent on February 23, 2005
to dentists licensed to practice in California during the relevant
period.  The Advance(R) cement product was sold from 1994 through 2000 and
total sales in the United States during that period were approximately
$5.2 million. The Company's insurance carrier has confirmed coverage for
the breach of warranty claims in this matter.

   On July 13, 2004, the Company was served with a Complaint filed by 3M
Innovative Properties Company in the U.S. District Court for the Western
District of Wisconsin, alleging that the Company's Aquasil(R) Ultra
silicone impression material, introduced in late 2002, infringes a 3M
patent. This case was settled in the first quarter of 2005, which was
within the range of loss for which the Company had previously recorded
accruals, and DENTSPLY obtained a paid up license under the 3M patent.


Other

   The Company has no material non-cancelable purchase commitments.

   The Company has employment agreements with its executive officers.
These agreements generally provide for salary continuation for a
specified number of months under certain circumstances.  If all of the
employees under contract were to be terminated by the Company without
cause (as defined in the agreements), the Company's liability would be
approximately $12.7 million at December 31, 2004.
