History and Overview

   DENTSPLY  International Inc. ("DENTSPLY" or the "Company"),  a
Delaware  corporation,  was  created  by  a  merger  of  Dentsply
International  Inc. ("Old  Dentsply")  and GENDEX  Corporation in
1993  (the  "Merger").  Old  Dentsply,  founded  in  1899,  was a
manufacturer   and  distributor  of  artificial   teeth,   dental
equipment,  and dental consumable  products.  GENDEX,  founded in
1983,   was  a  manufacturer   of  dental  x-ray   equipment  and
handpieces.  Today,  DENTSPLY  is the world's  largest  designer,
developer,   manufacturer  and  marketer  of  a  broad  range  of
products  for  the  dental   market.   The  Company's   worldwide
headquarters   and   executive   offices  are  located  in  York,
Pennsylvania.

   The  Company  operates  in a  single  reporting  segment  as a
designer,  manufacturer  and  distributor  of dental  products in
two   principal   categories:   dental   consumables   and  small
equipment,  and large  equipment.  Sales of the Company's  dental
products   accounted   for   approximately   97%  of   DENTSPLY's
consolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2001.

   The  Company   conducts  its  business  in  over  120  foreign
countries,   principally   through  its   foreign   subsidiaries.
DENTSPLY  has a  long-established  presence  in Canada and in the
European market,  particularly in Germany,  Switzerland,  France,
Italy and the United  Kingdom.  Through  its recent  acquisitions
the Company has also gained access to other  European  markets in
the Netherlands  and Austria.  The Company also has a significant
market  presence in Central and South America  including  Brazil,
Mexico,  Argentina,  Colombia, and Chile; in South Africa; and in
the  Pacific  Rim  including   Australia,   New  Zealand,   China
(including  Hong Kong),  Thailand,  India,  Philippines,  Taiwan,
Korea,   Vietnam,   Indonesia   and  Japan.   DENTSPLY  has  also
established  marketing activities in Moscow,  Russia to serve the
countries of the former Soviet Union.

   For 2001,  2000 and 1999,  the  Company's  sales  outside  the
United   States,    including   export   sales,   accounted   for
approximately  49%, 42% and 45%,  respectively,  of  consolidated
net sales.  The  information  about the  Company's  United States
and  foreign  sales and  assets  set forth in Note 4 of the Notes
to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in  the  Company's  2001
Annual  Report  to  Shareholders   is   incorporated   herein  by
reference.

   As  a  result  of  the  Company's  significant   international
operations,  DENTSPLY  is subject  to  fluctuations  in  exchange
rates of various  foreign  currencies and other risks  associated
with foreign trade.  The impact of currency  fluctuations  in any
given  period  can be  favorable  or  unfavorable.  The impact of
foreign   currency   fluctuations   of  European   currencies  on
operating  income  is  partially  offset  by sales in the  United
States  of   products   sourced   from  plants  and  third  party
suppliers   located   overseas,   principally   in  Germany   and
Switzerland.  The Company  enters into forward  foreign  exchange
contracts  to   selectively   hedge   assets,   liabilities   and
purchases  denominated  in foreign  currencies.  The  information
regarding  foreign exchange risk management  activities set forth
in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements in
the   Company's   2001   Annual   Report   to   Shareholders   is
incorporated herein by reference.

   DENTSPLY believes that the dental products industry is
experiencing substantial consolidation with respect to both
product manufacturing and distribution, although it continues
to be fragmented. Between January 1999 and December 2001,
DENTSPLY completed nine acquisitions (five in 2000 and four in
2001). The activity in 2001 includes three significant
acquisitions. In January 2001, the Company acquired the
outstanding shares of Friadent GmbH ("Friadent"), a global
dental implant manufacturer and marketer headquartered in
Mannheim, Germany. In March 2001, the Company acquired the
dental injectible anaesthetic assets of AstraZeneca ("AZ
Assets"). In October 2001, the Company acquired the Degussa
Dental Group ("Degussa Dental"), a manufacturer and seller of
dental products, including precious metal alloys, ceramics,
dental laboratory equipment and chairside products
headquartered in Hanau, Germany. Information about these
acquisitions and the other acquisition and divestiture
activities is set forth in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in the Company's 2001 Annual Report to
Shareholders and is incorporated herein by reference.  These
acquisitions are intended to supplement DENTSPLY's core growth
and assure ongoing expansion of its business. In addition,
acquisitions continue to provide DENTSPLY with new technologies
and additional product breadth.


D1




   The acquisitions made by DENTSPLY involve a substantial
degree of risk. They are expected to result in benefits to
DENTSPLY, including expanding the products and services offered
by DENTSPLY to its customers and potential customers and
enhancing DENTSPLY's presence in the European and Japanese
market for dental products. Achieving the benefits of the
acquisitions, however, will depend on a number of factors,
including the integration of the operations and personnel of
DENTSPLY and the acquired companies in a timely and efficient
manner. The integration will be complicated by the need to
integrate geographically diverse operations. In general,
DENTSPLY cannot offer any assurances that it can successfully
integrate or realize the anticipated benefits of the
acquisitions. Failure to do so could result in the loss of key
personnel and have a material adverse effect on the acquired
businesses and DENTSPLY's financial condition and operating
results. In addition, the attention and effort devoted to the
integration of the acquired companies could significantly
divert management's attention from other important tasks and
could seriously harm DENTSPLY. Other risks include
unanticipated expenses related to technology integration,
difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls,
procedures and policies, the impairment of relationships with
employees and customers as a result of any integration of new
management personnel and potential unknown liabilities
associated with acquired businesses.

   Certain provisions of DENTSPLY's Certificate of
Incorporation and By-laws and of Delaware law could have the
effect of making it difficult for a third party to acquire
control of DENTSPLY. Such provisions include the division of
the Board of Directors of DENTSPLY into three classes, with the
three-year term of a class expiring each year, a provision
allowing the Board of Directors to issue preferred stock having
rights senior to those of the common stock and certain
procedural requirements which make it difficult for
stockholders to amend DENTSPLY's By-laws and which preclude
stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders. In
addition, members of DENTSPLY's management and participants in
its Employee Stock Ownership Plan collectively own
approximately 11% of the outstanding common stock of DENTSPLY,
which may discourage a third party from attempting to acquire
control of DENTSPLY in a transaction that is opposed by
DENTSPLY's management and employees.

Principal Products

   The worldwide  professional  dental  industry  encompasses the
diagnosis,  treatment  and  prevention of disease and ailments of
the teeth,  gums and  supporting  bone.  DENTSPLY's two principal
dental  product  lines are  consumables  and small  equipment and
large  equipment.  These  products are produced by the Company in
the  United  States  and   internationally  and  are  distributed
throughout  the  world  under  some of the most  well-established
brand names and  trademarks in the industry,  including  ACUCAM(R),
ANKYLOS(R),   AQUASIL(TM),  CAULK(R),  CAVITRON(R),   CERAMCO(R),   CERCON(R),
DELTON(R), DENOPTIX(TM),  DENTSPLY(R),  DETREY(R),  ELEPHANT(R),  ESTHET.X(R),
FRIALIT(R),  GAC  ORTHOWORKS(TM),  GENDEX(R),  IN-OVATION(TM),  MAILLEFER(R),

SANI-TIP(R), THERMAFIL(R) and TRUBYTE(R).

   Consumables   and   Small   Equipment.   Consumable   products
consist  of  dental  sundries  used  in  dental  offices  in  the
treatment  of  patients  and  in  dental   laboratories   in  the
preparation  of dental  appliances.  DENTSPLY's  products in this
category  include  dental   prosthetics,   including   artificial
teeth,   endodontic  (root  canal)   instruments  and  materials,
dental  injectable   anesthetics,   prophylaxis   paste,   dental
sealants,    implants,    impression    materials,    restorative
materials,  precious metal dental alloys, dental ceramics,  crown
and  bridge   materials,   tooth  whiteners,   topical  fluoride,
cutting instruments,  dental needles, and orthodontic  appliances
and   accessories.   The  Company   manufactures   thousands   of
different  consumable  and  laboratory  products  marketed  under
more  than  a  hundred  brand  names.  Small  equipment  products
consist  of various  durable  goods  used in dental  offices  for
treatment  of  patients  as  well  as  in  dental   laboratories.
DENTSPLY's  small equipment  products  include high and low speed
handpieces,  intraoral  lighting systems,  ultrasonic scalers and
polishers,  air abrasion  systems and porcelain  furnaces.  Sales
of consumable  and small  equipment  accounted for  approximately
90% of the  Company's  consolidated  sales  for  the  year  ended
December 31, 2001.

   Large Equipment.  Large equipment  products consist of various
durable   goods  used  in  dental   offices   primarily  for  the
diagnosis  of  patients  .  DENTSPLY's  large  equipment  product
lines include  conventional  and digital dental x-ray systems and
related support  equipment and  accessories,  intraoral  cameras,
computer  imaging  systems and related  software.  Sales of large
equipment   accounted  for  approximately  7%  of  the  Company's
consolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2001.

Markets, Sales and Distribution

   DENTSPLY  distributes   approximately  50-60%  of  its  dental
products through domestic and foreign  distributors,  dealers and
importers.  However,  certain highly  technical  products such as
precious metal dental alloys,  dental ceramics,  crown and bridge
porcelain   products,   endodontic   instruments  and  materials,
orthodontic   appliances,   implants  and  bone   substitute  and
grafting  materials  are sold  directly to the dental  laboratory
or  dentist  in  some  markets.  Sales  to  two  customers,  both
distributors,   accounted  for  11%  and  9%,  respectively,   of
consolidated net sales in 2001.

   The  information  about the  Company's  foreign  and  domestic
operations  and export  sales set forth in Note 4 of the Notes to
Consolidated  Financial  Statements in the Company's  2001 Annual
Report to Shareholders is incorporated herein by reference.

   Although   much  of  its  sales  are  made  to   distributors,
dealers,  and importers,  DENTSPLY focuses its marketing  efforts
on the dentists,  dental hygienists,  dental  assistants,  dental
laboratories  and  dental  schools  who are the end  users of its
products.  As part  of this  end-user  "pull  through"  marketing
approach,  DENTSPLY employs  approximately  1,700 highly trained,
product-specific   sales   and   technical   staff   to   provide
comprehensive  marketing and service  tailored to the  particular
sales and technical  support  requirements of the dealers and the
end  users.  The  Company  conducts  extensive   distributor  and
end-user  marketing  programs and trains  laboratory  technicians
and  dentists  in the  proper  use of its  products,  introducing
them   to   the   latest   technological   developments   at  its
Educational  Centers located in key dental  markets.  The Company
also  maintains   ongoing   relationships   with  various  dental
associations  and  recognized  worldwide  opinion  leaders in the
dental field.

   DENTSPLY  believes  that demand in a given  geographic  market
for  dental  procedures  and  products  varies  according  to the
stage of social,  economic  and  technical  development  that the
market has attained.  Geographic  markets for  DENTSPLY's  dental
products can be  categorized  into the following  three stages of
development:

   The  United  States,   Canada,   Western  Europe,  the  United
Kingdom,  Japan, and Australia are highly developed  markets that
demand the most  advanced  dental  procedures  and  products  and
have the highest  level of  expenditure  on dental care. In these
markets,   the  focus  of  dental  care  is   increasingly   upon
preventive care and specialized  dentistry.  In addition to basic
procedures  such as the  excavation  and filling of cavities  and
tooth extraction and denture  replacement,  dental  professionals
perform  an  increasing   volume  of   preventive   and  cosmetic
procedures.  These  markets  require  varied and  complex  dental
products,    utilize   sophisticated   diagnostic   and   imaging
equipment,  and demand high  levels of  attention  to  protection
against infection and patient cross-contamination.

   In certain  countries in Central  America,  South  America and
the Pacific Rim,  dental care is often limited to the  excavation
and  filling  of  cavities  and  other  restorative   techniques,
reflecting more modest per capita  expenditures  for dental care.
These  markets  demand  diverse  products  such as  high  and low
speed handpieces,  restorative  compounds,  finishing devices and
custom restorative devices.

   In the  People's  Republic of China,  India,  Eastern  Europe,
the countries of the former Soviet  Union,  and other  developing
countries,  dental ailments are treated  primarily  through tooth
extraction  and denture  replacement.  These  procedures  require
basic  surgical  instruments,  artificial  teeth for dentures and
bridgework, and anchoring devices such as posts.


D1




   The Company  offers  products and equipment for use in markets
at each of these  stages of  development.  The  Company  believes
that  as  each  of  these  markets   develop,   demand  for  more
technically  advanced  products will  increase.  The Company also
believes  that its  recognized  brand  names,  high  quality  and
innovative  products,   technical  support  services  and  strong
international  distribution  capabilities  position  it  well  to
take  advantage  of any  opportunities  for  growth in all of the
markets that it serves.

   The following  trends support the Company's  confidence in its
industry growth outlook:

o     Increasing   worldwide   population  -  Population   growth
   continues throughout the world.

o     Growth of the  population  65 or older - The  percentage of
   the  United  States  and  European  population  over age 65 is
   expected  to nearly  double by the year 2030.  In  addition to
   having  significant  needs for dental  care,  the  elderly are
   well  positioned  to pay for  the  required  procedures  since
   they control sizable amounts of discretionary income.

o     Natural teeth are being retained longer - Individuals  with
   natural  teeth  are much more  likely to visit a dentist  in a
   given year than those without any natural teeth remaining.

o     The  changing  dental  practice  in  developed  countries -
   Dentistry in developed  countries has been  transformed from a
   profession  primarily dealing with pain,  infections and tooth
   decay to one with  increased  emphasis on preventive  care and
   cosmetic   dentistry.   DENTSPLY's   product  lines  are  well
   positioned  to provide the new  sophisticated  solutions  that
   these advanced procedures require.

o     Per capita and  discretionary  incomes  are  increasing  in
   emerging  nations - As  personal  incomes  continue to rise in
   the  emerging  nations of the Pacific  Rim and Latin  America,
   healthcare,   including   dental   services,   are  a  growing
   priority.

o     Growth in the field of  aesthetic  dentistry  - Those among
   the  aging  "Baby  Boomer"  population  are not  only  keeping
   their  natural  teeth  longer  but are  interested  in looking
   their  best,  increasing  the demand for tooth  whitening  and
   other aesthetic procedures.

Product Development

   Technological  innovation and successful  product  development
are critical to strengthening  the Company's  prominent  position
in  worldwide   dental   markets,   maintaining   its  leadership
positions  in  product  categories  where  it has a  high  market
share,  and increasing  market share in product  categories where
gains  are  possible.   While  many  of  DENTSPLY's   innovations
represent  sequential  improvements  of  existing  products,  the
Company  also  continues to  successfully  launch  products  that
represent  fundamental  change.  Its research centers  throughout
the  world  employ   approximately   330   scientists,   Ph.D.'s,
engineers  and  technicians  dedicated  to  research  and product
development.  Approximately  $28.3 million,  $20.4  million,  and
$18.5  million,  respectively,  was  internally  invested  by the
Company in connection  with the  development  of new products and
in the  improvement  of  existing  products  in the  years  ended
2001,  2000 and 1999,  respectively.  There  can be no  assurance
that  DENTSPLY  will be able to  continue  to develop  innovative
products and that  regulatory  approval of any new products  will
be  obtained,  or that  if  such  approvals  are  obtained,  such
products will be accepted in the marketplace.

Operating and Technical Expertise

   DENTSPLY  believes  that its  manufacturing  capabilities  are
important  to its  success.  The  Company  continues  to automate
its  global  manufacturing  operations  in order to  remain a low
cost producer.

   The   manufacture   of   the   Company's   products   requires
substantial and varied  technical  expertise.  Complex  materials
technology  and  processes  are  necessary  to  manufacture   the
Company's products.

    DENTSPLY  has  completed  or has in  progress a number of key
initiatives  around  the world that are  focused  on helping  the
Company improve its operating margins.

o     The Company's primary operational  initiative over the next
   1-2  years  will  be  to  successfully  integrate  the  recent
   acquisitions.

o     The  Company  has  recently  acquired a plant site  outside
   Chicago,  where it will  establish a major  dental  anesthetic
   filling  plant.  The Company  believes  that the plant will be
   operational,   which   includes  the  FDA  validation  of  the
   manufacturing practices, at the end of 2003.

o     The Company is creating a Corporate  Quality and Purchasing
   initiative   to  help  ensure   product   quality  and  reduce
   purchased product costs throughout the organization.

o     The   Company   has   centralized   its   warehousing   and
   distribution   in  North   America  and   Europe.   This  will
   minimize   both   inventory   levels  and  multiple   customer
   shipments.  It also  helps  improve  product  forecasting  and
   service to our customers.

o     In the first quarter of 2001, DENTSPLY  reorganized certain
   functions  within  Europe,  Brazil and North  America with the
   objective   of   consolidating   duplicative   functions   and
   improving  efficiencies  within these regions.  These measures
   have  resulted  in  the  elimination  of   approximately   310
   administrative  and  manufacturing  positions  in  Brazil  and
   Germany. Most aspects of this plan have been completed.

o     The   Company   continues   to  focus  on   improving   its
   manufacturing   processes  at  several  of  its  manufacturing
   locations,  providing  improved  flexibility.  This will allow
   them to continue to reduce  inventories  and improve  response
   times to changes in customer demand.

o     DENTSPLY  has also  completed  its  North  American  Shared
   Service   initiative   focused   on  the   consolidation   and
   centralization   of   the   financial    accounting    support
   functions.

o     DENTSPLY is making significant  improvements in Information
   Technology  as  well.  The  new  manufacturing  and  financial
   accounting  system was  implemented  in 1999 and  provides the
   Company  with  common  software  systems for nearly all of its
   locations  around the world  excluding  Friadent  and  Degussa
   Dental.  Worldwide  telecommunications  are  currently  a  key
   focus, as we continue to drive efficiencies.

Financing

   DENTSPLY's  long-term  debt at  December  31,  2001 was $723.5
million and the related  long-term  debt to total  capitalization
was 54.3%.  DENTSPLY  may incur  additional  debt in the  future,
including the funding of additional  acquisitions;  however,  the
Company's  primary  focus  in  2002  is  the  integration  of its
already   competed   acquisitions  and  the  repayment  of  debt.
DENTSPLY's  ability to make payments on its indebtedness,  and to
fund  its  operations  depends  on  its  future  performance  and
financial  results,  which, to a certain  extent,  are subject to
general economic,  financial,  competitive,  regulatory and other
factors  that are beyond its  control.  There can be no assurance
that  DENTSPLY's  business  will  generate  sufficient  cash flow
from  operations  in the future to service  its debt and  operate
its business.

   DENTSPLY's   existing  borrowing   documentation   contains  a
number of  covenants  and  financial  ratios which it is required
to  satisfy.  Any breach of any such  covenants  or  restrictions
would  result  in  a  default   under  the   existing   borrowing
documentation  that  would  permit the  lenders  to  declare  all
borrowings  under such  documentation  to be immediately  due and
payable and,  through  cross  default  provisions,  would entitle
DENTSPLY's  other  lenders to  accelerate  their loans.  DENTSPLY
may not be able to meet its  obligations  under  its  outstanding
indebtedness  in the event that any cross  default  provision  is

   Additional   information  about  DENTSPLY's  working  capital,
liquidity  and  capital  resources  is  incorporated   herein  by
reference  to  the  material  under  the  caption   "Management's
Discussion  and  Analysis of Financial  Condition  and Results of
Operations" in the Company's 2001 Annual Report to Shareholders.

Competition

   The  Company  conducts  its  operations,   both  domestic  and
foreign,    under   highly    competitive    market   conditions.
Competition in the dental  products  industry is based  primarily
upon  product  performance,  quality,  safety and ease of use, as
well as price,  customer  service,  innovation  and acceptance by
professionals   and  technicians.   DENTSPLY  believes  that  its
principal  strengths  include its  well-established  brand names,
its reputation for  high-quality  and  innovative  products,  its
leadership  in product  development  and  manufacturing,  and its
commitment to customer service and technical support.

   The size  and  number  of the  Company's  competitors  vary by
product   line  and  from  region  to  region.   There  are  many
companies  that produce  some,  but not all, of the same types of
products   as  those   produced  by  the   Company.   Certain  of
DENTSPLY's  competitors may have greater  resources than does the
Company in certain of its product offerings.

   The  worldwide  market for dental  supplies  and  equipment is
highly  competitive.  There can be no assurance  that the Company
will   successfully   identify  new  product   opportunities  and
develop  and  market  new  products  successfully,  or  that  new
products and  technologies  introduced  by  competitors  will not
render the Company's products obsolete or noncompetitive.

Regulation

   The  Company's  products are subject to  regulation  by, among
other  governmental  entities,  the United  States  Food and Drug
Administration  (the  "FDA").  In general,  if a dental  "device"
is  subject  to  FDA   regulation,   compliance  with  the  FDA's
requirements  constitutes  compliance  with  corresponding  state
regulations.   In   order  to   ensure   that   dental   products
distributed  for  human  use in the  United  States  are safe and
effective,  the  FDA  regulates  the  introduction,  manufacture,
advertising,  labeling,  packaging,  marketing  and  distribution
of, and record-keeping for, such products.

   Dental  devices of the types sold by  DENTSPLY  are  generally
classified  by the FDA into a category  that renders them subject
only to  general  controls  that  apply to all  medical  devices,
including   regulations   regarding   alteration,    misbranding,
notification,  record-keeping and good  manufacturing  practices.
DENTSPLY's  facilities are subject to periodic  inspection by the
FDA to monitor  DENTSPLY's  compliance  with  these  regulations.
There  can  be  no   assurance   that  the  FDA  will  not  raise
compliance  concerns.  Failure to satisfy  FDA  requirements  can
result in FDA enforcement  actions,  including  product  seizure,
injunction   and/or  criminal  or  civil   proceedings.   In  the
European  Union,  DENTSPLY's  products are subject to the medical
devices  laws of the various  member  states which are based on a
Directive  of  the  European  Commission.   Such  laws  generally
regulate  the safety of the  products in a similar way to the FDA
regulations.  DENTSPLY  products  in  Europe  bear  the  CE  sign
showing that such products adhere to the European regulations.

   All  dental  amalgam   filling   materials,   including  those
manufactured  and  sold by  DENTSPLY,  contain  mercury.  Various
groups have alleged  that dental  amalgam  containing  mercury is
harmful  to human  health  and have  actively  lobbied  state and
federal   lawmakers   and   regulators  to  pass  laws  or  adopt
regulatory  changes  restricting  the use, or requiring a warning
against alleged  potential risks, of dental  amalgams.  The FDA's
Dental Devices  Classification  Panel, the National Institutes of
Health and the United  States  Public  Health  Service  have each
indicated  that no  direct  hazard  to humans  from  exposure  to
dental  amalgams  has  been  demonstrated.  If the  FDA  were  to
reclassify  dental  mercury  and  amalgam  filling  materials  as
classes of products  requiring  FDA  pre-market  approval,  there
can  be  no  assurance  that  the  required   approval  would  be
obtained  or that the FDA  would  permit  the  continued  sale of
amalgam filling materials pending its  determination.  In Europe,
in  particular  in  Scandinavia  and  Germany,  the  contents  of
mercury  in amalgam  filling  materials  had been the  subject of
public  discussion.  As a consequence,  in 1994 the German health
authorities  asked  suppliers  of dental  amalgam to amend,  as a
precautionary  measure,  the  instructions  for use  for  amalgam
filling  materials.  DENTSPLY  adhered to this request.  DENTSPLY
also   manufactures   and  sells   non-amalgam   dental   filling
materials that do not contain mercury.

   The  introduction  and sale of  dental  products  of the types
produced  by  the  Company   are  also   subject  to   government
regulation  in the various  foreign  countries  in which they are
produced  or sold.  Some of  these  regulatory  requirements  are
more  stringent  than  those  applicable  in the  United  States.
DENTSPLY  believes that it is in substantial  compliance with the
foreign  regulatory  requirements  that  are  applicable  to  its
products and manufacturing operations.

Sources and Supply of Raw Materials

  All  of  the  raw   materials   used  by  the  Company  in  the
manufacture   of  its   products  are   purchased   from  various
suppliers and are  available  from  numerous  sources.  No single
supplier,   except  for  the  supplier  of  precious   metal  raw
materials,  accounts for a  significant  percentage of DENTSPLY's
raw material  requirements.  There are  alternative  suppliers of
precious metal raw materials readily available.

Intellectual Property

   Products  manufactured  by DENTSPLY are sold  primarily  under
its own  trademarks  and  trade  names.  DENTSPLY  also  owns and
maintains  more than 1,000  patents  throughout  the world and is
licensed under a small number of patents owned by others.

   DENTSPLY's  policy is to protect its products  and  technology
through  patents  and  trademark   registrations  in  the  United
States  and  in   significant   international   markets  for  its
products.   The  Company   carefully   monitors   trademark   use
worldwide,   and   promotes   enforcement   of  its  patents  and
trademarks  in a manner  that is  designed to balance the cost of
such  protection  against  obtaining  the greatest  value for the
Company.    DENTSPLY   believes   its   patents   and   trademark
properties   are  important  and   contribute  to  the  Company's
marketing   position   but  it  does  not  consider  its  overall
business to be materially  dependent upon any  individual  patent
or trademark.

Employees

   As of December  31,  2001,  the  Company and its  subsidiaries
employed  approximately  7,500  employees.  A small percentage of
the  Company's   employees  are   represented  by  labor  unions.
Hourly  workers at the  Company's  Ransom & Randolph  facility in
Maumee,   Ohio  are   represented   by  Local   No.   12  of  the
International    Union,   United   Automobile,    Aerospace   and
Agriculture  Implement  Workers  of  America  under a  collective
bargaining  agreement  that expires on January 31,  2004.  Hourly
workers at the  Company's  Midwest  Dental  Products  facility in
Des  Plaines,  Illinois  are  represented  by  Tool & Die  Makers
Local 113 of the  International  Association  of  Machinists  and
Aerospace  Workers under a collective  bargaining  agreement that
expires  on June  1,  2003.  In  addition,  approximately  20% of
Degussa  Dental  Germany's  workforce  is  represented  by  labor
unions.  The  Company  believes  that its  relationship  with its
employees is good.

   The Company's  success is dependent  upon its  management  and
employees.  The  loss  of  senior  management  employees  or  any
failure  to  recruit  and  train  needed  managerial,  sales  and
technical  personnel could have a material  adverse effect on the
Company.

Environmental Matters

   DENTSPLY  believes that its operations  comply in all material
respects  with  applicable  environmental  laws and  regulations.
Maintaining  this  level of  compliance  has not had,  and is not
expected  to have,  a material  effect on the  Company's  capital
expenditures or on its business.

   In  addition,  the Company  maintains  sales and  distribution
offices at  certain of its  foreign  and  domestic  manufacturing
facilities,  as  well  as at  various  other  United  States  and
international  locations.  Of the various  sites around the world
that are used  exclusively  for sales and  distribution,  all but
three are leased.  The Company also  maintains  sales  offices in
various countries throughout the world.

   DENTSPLY  believes  that its  properties  and  facilities  are
well  maintained and are generally  suitable and adequate for the
purposes for which they are used.


Item 3.  Legal Proceedings

   DENTSPLY and its subsidiaries are from time to time parties
to lawsuits arising out of their respective operations.  The
Company believes that pending litigation to which DENTSPLY is a
party will not have a material adverse effect upon its
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In  June  1995,  the  Antitrust  Division  of the  United  States
Department  of  Justice  initiated  an  antitrust   investigation
regarding  the policies and conduct  undertaken  by the Company's
Trubyte  Division with respect to the  distribution of artificial
teeth and  related  products.  On January 5, 1999 the  Department
of Justice  filed a  complaint  against  the  Company in the U.S.
District  Court  in  Wilmington,   Delaware   alleging  that  the
Company's  tooth  distribution  practices  violate the  antitrust
laws and  seeking  an order for the  Company to  discontinue  its
practices.   Three  follow  on  private  class  action  suits  on
behalf  of  dentists,   laboratories   and  denture  patients  in
seventeen  states,  respectively,  who purchased Trubyte teeth or
products  containing  Trubyte teeth,  were filed and  transferred
to the U.S.  District  Court in Wilmington,  Delaware.  The class
action  filed on behalf of the  dentists  has been  dismissed  by
the  plaintiffs.  The  private  party  suits  seek  damages in an
unspecified   amount.  The  Company  filed  motions  for  summary
judgment  in all of the above  cases,  which  were  argued to the
court in December  2000.  The Court denied the  Company's  motion
for  summary   judgment   regarding  the  Department  of  Justice
action,  granted  the  motion  on the  lack  of  standing  of the
patient  class  action  and  granted  the  motion  on the lack of
standing  of  the  laboratory   class  action  to  pursue  damage
claims.  In an  attempt  to  avoid  the  effect  of  the  Court's
ruling,  the  attorneys for the  laboratory  class action filed a
new    complaint    naming    DENTSPLY   and   its   dealers   as
co-conspirators  with respect to DENTSPLY's  distribution policy.
The Company  filed a motion to dismiss this  re-filed  complaint.
The  Court  again  granted  DENTSPLY's  motion  on  the  lack  of
standing  of  the  laboratory   class  action  to  pursue  damage
claims.  The  attorneys  for the patient  class have also filed a
new  action  to avoid  the  effect of the  Court's  ruling.  This
action  is filed in the U.S.  District  Court in  Delaware.  Four
private  party  class  actions on behalf of  indirect  purchasers
were filed in  California  state court.  These cases are based on
allegations  similar  to  those  in  the  Department  of  Justice
case.  In  response  to the  Company's  motion,  these cases have
been  consolidated  in one Judicial  District in Los Angeles.  It
is the  Company's  position  that the conduct and  activities  of
the Trubyte division do not violate the antitrust laws.
