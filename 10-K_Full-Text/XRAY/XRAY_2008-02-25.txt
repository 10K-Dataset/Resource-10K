History and Overview

DENTSPLY International Inc. (“DENTSPLY” or the
        “Company”), a Delaware corporation, was created by a merger of DENTSPLY
        International Inc. (“Old DENTSPLY”) and GENDEX Corporation ("GENDEX") in 1993.
        Old DENTSPLY, founded in 1899, was a manufacturer and distributor of artificial teeth,
        dental equipment and dental consumable products. GENDEX, founded in 1983, was a
        manufacturer of dental x-ray equipment and handpieces. In early 2004, the Company divested
        the dental x-ray equipment portion of GENDEX in order to primarily focus the
        Company’s product lines on dental consumables, dental laboratory products and dental
        specialty products.

DENTSPLY believes it is the world's largest designer, developer,
        manufacturer and marketer of a broad range of products for the dental market. The Company's
        worldwide headquarters and executive offices are located in York, Pennsylvania.

Sales of the Company's dental products accounted for approximately 97% of
        DENTSPLY's consolidated net sales, excluding precious metal content, for the year ended
        December 31, 2007. The remaining 3% of consolidated sales are related to materials sold to
        the investment casting industry and various medical products. The presentation of net
        sales, excluding precious metal content, could be considered a measure not calculated in
        accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), and is
        therefore considered a non-GAAP measure. This non-GAAP measure is discussed further in
        “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
        Operations” and a reconciliation of net sales to net sales, excluding precious metal
        content, is provided.

Through the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company conducted its business
        through four operating segments, all of which were primarily engaged in the design,
        manufacture and distribution of dental products in three principal categories: 1) dental
        consumables, 2) dental laboratory products and 3) dental specialty products.

In addition to the United States (“U.S.”), the Company conducts
        its business in over 120 foreign countries, principally through its foreign subsidiaries.
        DENTSPLY has a long-established presence in Canada and in the European market, particularly
        in Germany, Switzerland, France, Italy and the United Kingdom. The Company also has a
        significant market presence in Central and South America including Brazil, Mexico,
        Argentina, Colombia and Chile; in South Africa; and in the Pacific Rim including Japan,
        Australia, New Zealand, China (including Hong Kong), Thailand, India, Philippines, Taiwan,
        South Korea, Vietnam and Indonesia. DENTSPLY has also established marketing activities in
        Moscow, Russia to serve the countries of the former Soviet Union.

For 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company's net sales, excluding precious metal
        content, to customers outside the United States, including export sales, accounted for
        approximately 59%, 58% and 56%, respectively, of consolidated net sales. Reference is made
        to the information about the Company's United States and foreign sales by shipment origin
        set forth in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form
        10-K.


Principal Products

The worldwide professional dental industry encompasses the
        diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease and ailments of the teeth, gums and
        supporting bone. DENTSPLY's principal dental product categories are dental consumables,
        dental laboratory products and dental specialty products. These products are produced by
        the Company in the United States and internationally and are distributed throughout the
        world under some of the most well-established brand names and trademarks in the industry,
        including ANKYLOS®, AQUASIL(TM), AQUASIL ULTRA(TM), BIOPURE(TM), CAULK®,
        CAVITRON®, CERAMCO®, CERCON®, CITANEST®, DELTON®, DENTSPLY®,
        DETREY®, ELEPHANT®, ESTHET.X®, FRIADENT®, FRIALIT®, GENIE(TM), GOLDEN
        GATE®, IN-OVATION(TM), INTERACTIVE MYSTIQUE(TM), MAILLEFER®, MIDWEST®,
        NUPRO®, ORAQIX®, PEPGEN P-15(TM), POLOCAINE®, PRIME & BOND®,
        PROFILE®, PROTAPER(TM), RINN®, R&R®, SANI-TIP®, SEAL&PROTECT(TM),
        SHADEPILOT(TM), SULTAN®, THERMAFIL®, TRUBYTE®, XENO®, XIVE® and
        XYLOCAINE®.

Dental Consumables

Dental consumable products consist of dental sundries and
        small equipment used in dental offices in the treatment of patients. Sales of dental
        consumables, excluding precious metal content, accounted for approximately 35% and 40% of
        the Company’s consolidated sales for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006,
        respectively.

DENTSPLY’s dental sundry products in the dental
        consumable category include dental anesthetics, prophylaxis paste, dental sealants,
        impression materials, restorative materials, tooth whiteners and topical fluoride. The
        Company manufactures thousands of different dental sundry consumable products marketed
        under more than one hundred brand names.

Small equipment products in the dental consumable category
        consist of various durable goods used in dental offices for treatment of patients.
        DENTSPLY’s small equipment products include high and low speed handpieces, intraoral
        curing light systems, dental diagnostic systems, and ultrasonic scalers and
        polishers.

Dental Laboratory Products

Dental laboratory products are used in the preparation of
        dental appliances by dental laboratories. Sales of dental laboratory products, excluding
        precious metal content, accounted for approximately 19% of the Company’s consolidated
        sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.

DENTSPLY’s products in the dental laboratory category
        include dental prosthetics, including artificial teeth, precious metal dental alloys,
        dental ceramics, and crown and bridge materials. Equipment in this category includes
        computer aided machining (CAM) ceramic systems and porcelain furnaces.

Dental Specialty Products

Dental specialty products are specialized treatment products
        used within the dental office and laboratory settings. Sales of specialty products,
        excluding precious metal content, accounted for approximately 43% and 38% of the
        Company’s consolidated sales for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006,
        respectively. DENTSPLY’s products in this category include endodontic (root canal)
        instruments and materials, implants and related products, bone grafting materials, and
        orthodontic appliances and accessories.

Markets, Sales and Distribution

DENTSPLY distributes approximately 55% of its dental products
        through domestic and foreign distributors, dealers and importers. However, certain highly
        technical products such as precious metal dental alloys, dental ceramics, crown and bridge
        porcelain products, endodontic instruments and materials, orthodontic appliances, implants,
        and bone substitute and grafting materials are sold directly to the dental laboratory or
        dental professional in some markets. During 2007 and 2006, one customer, Henry Schein
        Incorporated, a dental distributor, accounted for 11.6% and 10.9%, respectively, of
        DENTSPLY’s consolidated net sales. No other single customer represented ten percent
        or more of DENTSPLY’s consolidated net sales during 2007 or 2006.

Reference is made to the information about the Company's
        foreign and domestic operations and export sales set forth in Note 4 to the consolidated
        financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Although many of its sales are made to distributors, dealers
        and importers, DENTSPLY focuses its marketing efforts on the dentists, dental hygienists,
        dental assistants, dental laboratories and dental schools who are the end users of its
        products. As part of this end-user “pull through” marketing approach, DENTSPLY
        employs approximately 2,100 highly trained, product-specific sales and technical staff to
        provide comprehensive marketing and service tailored to the particular sales and technical
        support requirements of the dealers and the end


users. The Company conducts extensive distributor and
        end-user marketing programs and trains laboratory technicians and dentists in the proper
        use of its products, introducing them to the latest technological developments at its
        educational centers located throughout the world. The Company also maintains ongoing
        relationships with various dental associations and recognized worldwide opinion leaders in
        the dental field, although there is no assurance that these influential dental
        professionals will continue to support the Company’s products.

DENTSPLY believes that demand in a given geographic market
        for dental procedures and products vary according to the stage of social, economic and
        technical development of the particular market. Geographic markets for DENTSPLY's dental
        products can be categorized into the following two stages of development:

The United States, Canada, Western Europe, Japan, Australia
        and certain other countries are highly developed markets that demand the most advanced
        dental procedures and products and have the highest level of expenditures on dental care.
        In these markets, the focus of dental care is increasingly upon preventive care and
        specialized dentistry. In addition to basic procedures such as the excavation and filling
        of cavities and tooth extraction and denture replacement, dental professionals perform an
        increasing volume of preventive and cosmetic procedures. These markets require varied and
        complex dental products, utilize sophisticated diagnostic and imaging equipment, and demand
        high levels of attention to protect against infection and patient
        cross-contamination.

In certain countries in Central America, South America,
        Eastern Europe, Pacific Rim, Middle East and Africa, most dental care is often limited to
        the excavation and filling of cavities and other restorative techniques, reflecting more
        modest per capita expenditures for dental care. These markets demand diverse products such
        as high and low speed handpieces, restorative compounds, finishing devices, custom
        restorative devices, basic surgical instruments, bridgework and artificial teeth for
        dentures.

The Company offers products and equipment for use in markets
        at both of these stages of development. The Company believes that demand for more
        technically advanced products will increase as each of these markets develop. The Company
        also believes that its recognized brand names, high quality and innovative products,
        technical support services and strong international distribution capabilities position it
        well to take advantage of any opportunities for growth in all of the markets that it
        serves.

The Company believes that the market for its products will
        grow based on the following factors:

•

Increasing worldwide population.

•

Growth of the population 65 or older – The percentage of
                    the United States, European, Japanese and other regions population over age 65
                    is expected to nearly double by the year 2030. In addition to having
                    significant needs for dental care, the elderly are well positioned to pay for
                    the required procedures since they control sizable amounts of discretionary
                    income.

•

Natural teeth are being retained longer – Individuals with
                    natural teeth are much more likely to visit a dentist in a given year than
                    those without any natural teeth remaining.

•

The changing dental practice in North America and Western Europe
                    – Dentistry in North America and Western Europe has been transformed from
                    a profession primarily dealing with pain, infections and tooth decay to one
                    with increased emphasis on preventive care and cosmetic dentistry.

•

Per capita and discretionary incomes are increasing in emerging
                    nations – As personal incomes continue to rise in the emerging nations of
                    the Pacific Rim, Commonwealth of Independent States (“CIS”) and
                    Latin America, healthcare, including dental services, are a growing
                    priority.

•

The Company’s business is less susceptible than other
                    industries to general downturns in the economies in which it operates. Many of
                    the products the Company offers relate to dental procedures that are considered
                    necessary by patients regardless of the economic environment.

Product Development

Technological innovation and successful product development
        are critical to strengthening the Company’s prominent position in worldwide dental
        markets, maintaining its leadership positions in product categories where it has a high
        market share and increasing market share in product categories where gains are possible.
        While many of DENTSPLY’s existing products undergo evolutionary improvements, the
        Company also continues to successfully launch innovative products that represent
        fundamental change.


New advances in technology are
        also anticipated to have a significant influence on future products in dentistry. As a
        result, the Company pursues research and development initiatives to support this
        technological development, including partnerships and collaborations with various research
        institutions and dental schools.

Through its own internal research centers as
        well as through its collaborations and partnerships with external research institutions and
        dental schools, the Company directly invested approximately $48.5 million and $44.4 million
        for 2007 and 2006, respectively, in connection with the development of new products,
        improvement of existing products and advances in technology. The continued development of
        these areas is a critical step in meeting the Company's strategic goal of taking a
        leadership role in defining the future of dentistry.

In addition to the direct investment in product development
        and improvement, the Company also invests in these activities through acquisitions, by
        entering into licensing agreements and by purchasing technologies developed by third
        parties.

Acquisition Activities

DENTSPLY believes that the dental products industry continues
        to experience consolidation with respect to both product manufacturing and distribution,
        although it continues to be fragmented creating a number of acquisition opportunities. As a
        result, during the past three years, the Company has made several acquisitions, including
        one manufacturer of dental consumable products, one manufacturer of endodontic materials,
        two sales and marketing organizations for implant products, and one manufacturer of small
        dental diagnostic equipment in 2007, two small businesses in 2006, and a group of three
        orthodontic companies in 2005. Additionally, in 2006, DENTSPLY acquired a 40% interest in a
        simulation software company and a leading manufacturer of a variety of surgical guides to
        assist in the placement of dental implants. DENTSPLY also acquired the remaining 40%
        interest of a dental manufacturing business in Brazil during 2006 (the Company had owned
        60% of this business since 2001).

The Company continues to view acquisitions as a key part of
        its growth strategy. These acquisition activities are intended to supplement the Company's
        core growth and assure ongoing expansion of its business, including new technologies,
        additional products and geographic breadth.

Operating and Technical Expertise

DENTSPLY believes that its manufacturing capabilities are
        important to its success. The manufacture of the Company's products requires substantial
        and varied technical expertise. Complex materials technology and processes are necessary to
        manufacture the Company's products. The Company continues to automate its global
        manufacturing operations in order to remain a low cost producer.

Financing

DENTSPLY's total long-term debt, including the current
        portion of long-term debt, at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $482.3 million and $367.4
        million, respectively, and the ratios of long-term debt to total capitalization were 24.1%
        and 22.4%. DENTSPLY defines total capitalization as the sum of total long-term debt,
        including the current portion, plus total stockholders’ equity. DENTSPLY may incur
        additional debt in the future, including, but not limited to, the funding of additional
        acquisitions and capital expenditures.

The Company's cash, cash equivalents and short-term
        investments increased by $251.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2007 to $316.3
        million. In 2007, the Company had net borrowings of $99.0 million related to long-term
        borrowings and repurchased $125.4 million in treasury stock. The net borrowings of $99.0
        million were primarily due to the March 13, 2007 private placement note of $149.5 million,
        which was partially offset by repayments of $50.5 million primarily related to the Swiss
        franc denominated private placement notes.

Additional information about DENTSPLY's working capital,
        liquidity and capital resources is provided in “Management's Discussion and Analysis
        of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report on Form
        10-K.

Competition

The Company conducts its operations, both domestic and
        foreign, under highly competitive market conditions. Competition in the dental products
        industry is based primarily upon product performance, quality, safety and ease of use, as
        well as price, customer service, innovation and acceptance by professionals and
        technicians. DENTSPLY believes that its principal strengths include its well-established
        brand names, its reputation for high-quality and innovative products, its leadership in
        product development and manufacturing, its commitment to customer satisfaction, and support
        of the Company’s products by dental professionals.

The size and number of the Company's competitors vary by
        product line and from region to region. There are many companies that produce some, but not
        all, of the same types of products as those produced by the Company.


Regulation

The Company's products are subject to regulation by, among
        other governmental entities, the United States Food and Drug Administration (the
        “FDA”). In general, if a dental “device” is subject to FDA
        regulation, compliance with the FDA's requirements constitutes compliance with
        corresponding state regulations. In order to ensure that dental products distributed for
        human use in the United States are safe and effective, the FDA regulates the introduction,
        manufacture, advertising, labeling, packaging, marketing and distribution of, and
        record-keeping for, such products. The introduction and sale of dental products of the
        types produced by the Company are also subject to government regulation in the various
        foreign countries in which they are produced or sold. DENTSPLY believes that it is in
        substantial compliance with the FDA and foreign regulatory requirements that are applicable
        to its products and manufacturing operations.

Dental devices of the types sold by DENTSPLY are generally
        classified by the FDA into a category that renders them subject only to general controls
        that apply to all medical devices, including regulations regarding alteration, misbranding,
        notification, record-keeping and good manufacturing practices. In the European Union,
        DENTSPLY's products are subject to the medical devices laws of the various member states
        which are based on a Directive of the European Commission. Such laws generally regulate the
        safety of the products in a similar way to the FDA regulations. DENTSPLY products in Europe
        bear the CE mark showing that such products adhere to the European
        regulations.

All dental amalgam filling materials, including those
        manufactured and sold by DENTSPLY, contain mercury. Various groups have alleged that dental
        amalgam containing mercury is harmful to human health and have actively lobbied state and
        federal lawmakers and regulators to pass laws or adopt regulatory changes restricting the
        use, or requiring a warning against alleged potential risks, of dental amalgams. The FDA's
        Dental Devices Classification Panel, the National Institutes of Health and the United
        States Public Health Service have each indicated that no direct hazard to humans from
        exposure to dental amalgams has been demonstrated. In response to concerns raised by
        certain consumer groups regarding dental amalgam, in 2006 the FDA formed an advisory
        committee to review peer-reviewed scientific literature on the safety of dental amalgam. In
        Europe, particularly in Scandinavia and Germany, the contents of mercury in amalgam filling
        materials has been the subject of public discussion. As a consequence, in 1994 the German
        health authorities required suppliers of dental amalgam to amend the instructions for use
        for amalgam filling materials to include a precaution against the use of amalgam for
        children less than eighteen years of age and to women of childbearing age. Additionally,
        some groups have asserted that the use of dental amalgam should be prohibited because of
        concerns about environmental impact from the disposition of mercury within dental amalgam.
        Although the Company is not aware of any such prohibition being adopted, it is possible
        that such a limitation could be adopted in the future. DENTSPLY also manufactures and sells
        non-amalgam dental filling materials that do not contain mercury.

Sources and Supply of Raw Materials and Finished
        Goods

The Company manufactures the majority of the products sold by
        the Company. All of the raw materials used by the Company in the manufacture of its
        products are purchased from various suppliers and are typically available from numerous
        sources. No single supplier accounts for a significant percentage of DENTSPLY's raw
        material requirements. In addition to those products both manufactured and sold by the
        Company, some finished goods products sold by the Company are purchased from third party
        suppliers. Of these finished goods products purchased from third party suppliers, a
        significant portion of the Company’s injectable anesthetic products, orthodontic
        products and cutting instruments are purchased from a limited number of
        suppliers.

Intellectual Property

Products manufactured by DENTSPLY are sold primarily under
        its own trademarks and trade names. DENTSPLY also owns and maintains approximately 2,000
        patents throughout the world and is licensed under a small number of patents owned by
        others.

DENTSPLY's policy is to protect its products and technology
        through patents and trademark registrations in the United States and in significant
        international markets for its products. The Company carefully monitors trademark use
        worldwide, and promotes enforcement of its patents and trademarks in a manner that is
        designed to balance the cost of such protection against obtaining the greatest value for
        the Company. DENTSPLY believes its patents and trademark properties are important and
        contribute to the Company's marketing position but it does not consider its overall
        business to be materially dependent upon any individual patent or
        trademark.


Employees

As of December 31, 2007, the Company and its subsidiaries
        employed approximately 8,900 employees. A small percentage of the Company's employees are
        represented by labor unions. Hourly workers at the Company's Ransom & Randolph facility
        in Maumee, Ohio are represented by Local No. 12 of the International Union, United
        Automobile, Aerospace and Agriculture Implement Workers of America under a collective
        bargaining agreement. Hourly workers at the Company's Midwest Dental Products facility in
        Des Plaines, Illinois are represented by International Association of Machinists and
        Aerospace Workers, AFL-CIO in Chicago under a collective bargaining agreement that expires
        on May 31, 2009. In Germany, approximately 40% of DeguDent employees, approximately 30% of
        Friadent employees, approximately 20% VDW employees and approximately 30% of DeTrey
        employees are represented by labor unions. The Company provides pension and postretirement
        benefits to many of its employees (see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements).
        The Company believes that its relationship with its employees is good.

Environmental Matters

DENTSPLY believes that its operations comply in all material
        respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Maintaining this level of
        compliance has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on the Company's
        capital expenditures or on its business.

Other Factors Affecting the Business

The Company’s business is subject to quarterly
        fluctuations with net sales and operating profits historically being higher in the second
        and fourth quarters. The Company typically implements most of its price changes in the
        third or fourth quarters of the year. These price changes, other marketing and promotional
        programs, the management of inventory levels by distributors and the implementation of
        strategic initiatives, may impact sales levels in a given period. Sales for the industry
        and the Company are generally strongest in the second and fourth calendar quarters and
        weaker in the first and third calendar quarters, due to the effects of the items noted
        above and due to the impact of summer holidays and vacations, particularly throughout
        Europe.

Securities and Exchange Act Reports

DENTSPLY makes available free of charge through its website
        at www.DENTSPLY.com its Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current
        Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section
        13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable

Item 1A. Risk Factors

Following are the significant risk factors that could
        materially impact DENTSPLY’s business. The order in which these factors appear should
        not be construed to indicate its relative importance or priority.

Negative changes could occur in the dental markets, the
        general economic environments, or government reimbursement or regulatory programs of the
        regions in which the Company operates.

The success of the Company is largely dependent upon the
        continued strength of dental markets and is also somewhat dependent upon the general
        economic environments of the regions in which it operates. Negative changes to these
        markets and economies could materially impact the Company's results of operations and
        financial condition. In addition, many of the Company's markets are affected by government
        reimbursement and regulatory programs. In certain markets, government and regulatory
        programs have a more significant impact than other markets. Changes to these programs could
        have a positive or negative impact on the Company's results.

The Company may be unable to develop innovative products
        or obtain regulatory approval for new products.

DENTSPLY has identified new products as an important part of
        its growth opportunities. There can be no assurance that DENTSPLY will be able to continue
        to develop innovative products and that regulatory approval of any new products will be
        obtained, or that if such approvals are obtained, such products will be favorably accepted
        in the marketplace. Additionally, there is no assurance that entirely new technology or
        approaches to dental treatment or competitors’ new products will not be introduced
        that could render the Company's products obsolete.

The dental supplies market is highly competitive, and
        there is no guarantee that the Company can compete successfully.

The worldwide market for dental supplies is highly
        competitive. There can be no assurance that the Company will successfully identify new
        product opportunities and develop and market new products successfully, or that new
        products and technologies introduced by competitors will not render the Company's products
        obsolete or noncompetitive. Additionally, the size and number of the Company's competitors
        vary by product line and from region to region. There are many companies that produce some,
        but not all, of the same types of products as those produced by the Company. Certain of
        DENTSPLY's competitors may have greater resources than does the Company.

The Company’s expansion through acquisition involves
        risks and may not result in the expected benefits.

The Company continues to view acquisitions as a key part of
        its growth strategy. The Company continues to be active in evaluating potential
        acquisitions although there is no assurance that these efforts will result in completed
        transactions as there are many factors that affect the success of such activities. If the
        Company does succeed in acquiring a business or product, there can be no assurance that the
        Company will achieve any of the benefits that it might anticipate from such an acquisition
        and the attention and effort devoted to the integration of an acquired business could
        divert management’s attention from normal business operations. If the Company makes
        acquisitions, it may incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or create additional
        expenses, any of which might adversely affect its financial results. Any financing that the
        Company might need for acquisitions may only be available to it on terms that restrict its
        business or that impose additional costs that reduce its operating
        results.

The Company may not generate sufficient cash flow to
        service its debt, pay its contractual obligations and operate the
        business.

DENTSPLY's ability to make payments on its indebtedness and
        contractual obligations, and to fund its operations depends on its future performance and
        financial results, which, to a certain extent, are subject to general economic, financial,
        competitive, regulatory and other factors and the interest rate environment that are beyond
        its control. Although Management believes that the Company has and will continue to have
        sufficient liquidity, there can be no assurance that DENTSPLY's business will generate
        sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service its debt, pay its contractual
        obligations and operate its business.

The Company may be unable to sustain the operational and
        technical expertise that is key to its success.

DENTSPLY believes that its manufacturing capabilities are
        important to its success. The manufacture of the Company's products requires substantial
        and varied technical expertise. Complex materials technology and processes are necessary to
        manufacture the Company's products. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able
        to maintain the necessary operational and technical expertise that is key to its
        success.


The Company may not be able to repay its outstanding debt
        in the event that cross default provisions are triggered due to a breach of loan
        covenants.

DENTSPLY's existing borrowing documentation contains a number
        of covenants and financial ratios which it is required to satisfy. The most restrictive of
        these covenants pertain to asset dispositions, maintenance of certain levels of net worth,
        and prescribed ratios of indebtedness to total capital and operating income excluding
        depreciation and amortization to interest expense. Any breach of any such covenants or
        restrictions would result in a default under the existing borrowing documentation that
        would permit the lenders to declare all borrowings under such documentation to be
        immediately due and payable and, through cross default provisions, would entitle DENTSPLY's
        other lenders to accelerate their loans. DENTSPLY may not be able to meet its obligations
        under its outstanding indebtedness in the event that any cross default provision is
        triggered.

The Company’s international operations are subject
        to inherent risks that could adversely affect the operating results.

DENTSPLY, with its significant international operations, is
        subject to fluctuations in exchange rates of various foreign currencies and other risks
        associated with foreign trade and the impact of currency fluctuations in any given period
        can be favorable or unfavorable.

The Company may fail to comply with regulations issued by
        the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies.

DENTSPLY's business is subject to periodic review and
        inspection by the FDA and similar foreign authorities to monitor DENTSPLY's compliance with
        the regulations administered by such authorities. There can be no assurance that these
        authorities will not raise compliance concerns. Failure to satisfy any such requirements
        can result in governmental enforcement actions, including possible product seizure,
        injunction and/or criminal or civil proceedings.

All dental amalgam filling materials, including those
        manufactured and sold by DENTSPLY, contain mercury. The FDA's Dental Devices Classification
        Panel, the National Institutes of Health and the United States Public Health Service have
        each indicated that no direct hazard to humans from exposure to dental amalgams has been
        demonstrated. If the FDA were to reclassify dental mercury and amalgam filling materials as
        classes of products requiring FDA pre-market approval, there can be no assurance that the
        required approval would be obtained or that the FDA would permit the continued sale of
        amalgam filling materials pending its determination.

The Company may be unable to obtain a supply for certain
        finished goods purchased from third parties.

A significant portion of the Company’s injectable
        anesthetic products, orthodontic products and cutting instruments are purchased from a
        limited number of suppliers. As there are a limited number of suppliers for these products,
        there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain an adequate supply of
        these products in the future.

The Company's success is dependent upon its management and
        employees

.

The Company's success is dependent upon its management and
        employees. The loss of senior management employees or any failure to recruit and train
        needed managerial, sales and technical personnel, could have a material adverse effect on
        the Company.

The Company faces the inherent risk of
        litigation.

The Company’s business involves a risk of product
        liability and other claims, and from time to time the Company is named as a defendant in
        these cases. The primary risks to which the Company is exposed are related to those
        products manufactured by the Company. The Company has insurance policies, including product
        liability insurance, covering these risks in amounts that are considered adequate; however,
        the Company cannot provide assurance that the maintained coverage is sufficient to cover
        future claims or that the coverage will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable
        cost. A successful claim brought against the Company in excess of available insurance, or
        any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against the Company, could harm its
        business. Various parties, including the Company, own and maintain patents and other
        intellectual property rights applicable to the dental field. Although the Company believes
        it operates in a manner that does not infringe upon any third party intellectual property
        rights, it is possible that a party could assert that one or more of the Company’s
        products infringe upon such party’s intellectual property and force the Company to
        discontinue the sale of certain products.


The Company may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of
        securities analysts and investors, which could cause its stock price to
        decline.

DENTSPLY experiences fluctuations in quarterly earnings. As a
        result, the Company may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and
        investors, which could cause its stock price to decline. The Company’s business is
        subject to quarterly fluctuations with net sales and operating profits historically being
        higher in the second and fourth quarters. The Company typically implements most of its
        price changes in the third or fourth quarters of the year. These price changes, other
        marketing and promotional programs, which are offered to customers from time to time in the
        ordinary course of business, the management of inventory levels by distributors and the
        implementation of strategic initiatives, may impact sales levels in a given period. Net
        sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first and third quarters,
        primarily due not only to increased sales in the quarters preceding the first and third
        quarters, but also due to the impact of summer holidays and vacations, particularly
        throughout Europe.

The market price for the Company’s common stock may
        become volatile.

A variety of factors may have a significant impact on the
        market price of DENTSPLY’s common stock causing volatility. These factors include,
        but are not necessarily limited to: the publication of earnings estimates or other research
        reports and speculation in the press or investment community; changes in the
        Company’s industry and competitors; the Company’s financial condition, results
        of operations and cash flows; any future issuances of DENTSPLY’s common stock, which
        may include primary offerings for cash, stock splits, issuances in connection with business
        acquisitions, restricted stock and the grant or exercise of stock options from time to
        time; general market and economic conditions; and any outbreak or escalation of hostilities
        in areas the Company does business.

In addition, the NASDAQ National Market can experience
        extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the
        operating performance of the companies listed on the NASDAQ. Broad market and industry
        factors may negatively affect the market price of the Company’s common stock,
        regardless of actual operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in
        the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has
        often been instituted against companies. This type of litigation, if instituted, could
        result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources,
        which would harm the Company’s business.

Certain provisions in the Company’s governing
        documents may discourage third-party offers to acquire DENTSPLY that might otherwise result
        in the Company’s stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their
        shares.

Certain provisions of DENTSPLY's Certificate of Incorporation
        and By-laws and of Delaware law could have the effect of making it difficult for a third
        party to acquire control of DENTSPLY. Such provisions include the division of the Board of
        Directors of DENTSPLY into three classes, with the three-year term of a class expiring each
        year, a provision allowing the Board of Directors to issue preferred stock having rights
        senior to those of the common stock and certain procedural requirements which make it
        difficult for stockholders to amend DENTSPLY's By-laws and call special meetings of
        stockholders. In addition, members of DENTSPLY's management and participants in its
        Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”)

collectively own
        approximately 5% of the outstanding common stock of DENTSPLY.

The Company is exposed to the risk of changes in interest
        and foreign exchange rates.

The Company’s balance sheet includes debt and net
        investment hedges that are sensitive to movements in interest and foreign exchange rates.
        Changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates may have an adverse effect on the
        Company’s statement of income.

        various other United States and international locations. The Company maintains offices in
        Toronto, Mexico City, Paris, Rome, Weybridge, Hong Kong and Melbourne. Most of these
        various sites around the world that are used exclusively for sales and distribution are
        leased.

The Company also owns its corporate headquarters located in York,
        Pennsylvania.

DENTSPLY believes that its properties and facilities are well
        maintained and are generally suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are
        used.


Item 3. Legal Proceedings

On January 5, 1999, the Department of Justice filed a
        Complaint against the Company in the United States District Court in Wilmington, Delaware
        alleging that the Company’s tooth distribution practices violated the antitrust laws
        and seeking an order for the Company to discontinue its practices. This case has been
        concluded and the District Court, upon the direction of the Court of Appeals, issued an
        injunction preventing DENTSPLY from taking action to restrict its tooth dealers from adding
        new competitive teeth lines. This decision relates only to the distribution of artificial
        teeth in the United States and, notwithstanding the outcome of this case, the Company is
        confident that it can continue to develop this business.

Subsequent to the filing of the Department of Justice
        Complaint in 1999, several private party class actions were filed based on allegations
        similar to those in the Department of Justice case, on behalf of dental laboratories, and
        denture patients in seventeen states who purchased Trubyte teeth or products containing
        Trubyte teeth. These cases were transferred to the United States District Court in
        Wilmington, Delaware. The Court granted the Company’s Motion on the lack of standing
        of the laboratory and patient class actions to pursue damage claims. The Plaintiffs in the
        laboratory case appealed this decision to the Third Circuit and the Court largely upheld
        the decision of the District Court in dismissing the Plaintiffs’ damages claims
        against DENTSPLY, with the exception of allowing the Plaintiffs to pursue a damage claim
        based on a theory of resale price maintenance between the Company and its tooth dealers.
        The Plaintiffs in the laboratory case filed an amended complaint in the District Court
        asserting that DENTSPLY and its tooth dealers, and the dealers among themselves, engaged in
        a conspiracy to violate the antitrust laws. DENTSPLY and the dealers filed Motions to
        dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims, except for the resale price maintenance claims. The
        District Court has granted the Motions filed by DENTSPLY and the dealers, leaving only the
        resale price maintenance claim. The Plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal of their claims
        to the Third Circuit. Additionally, manufacturers of two competitive tooth lines and a
        dealer, as a putative class action, have filed separate actions seeking unspecified damages
        alleged to have been incurred as a result of the Company’s tooth distribution
        practice found to be a violation of the antitrust law.

On March 27, 2002, a Complaint was filed in Alameda County,
        California (which was transferred to Los Angeles County) by Bruce Glover, DDS alleging,
        inter alia, breach of express and implied warranties, fraud, unfair trade practices and
        negligent misrepresentation in the Company’s manufacture and sale of Advance®
        cement. The Judge entered an Order granting class certification, as an opt-in class, which
        was later converted to an opt-out class. In general, the Class is defined as California
        dentists who purchased and used Advance® cement and were required, because of failures
        of the cement, to repair or reperform dental procedures for which they were not paid. The
        parties entered a settlement agreement, which was approved by the Court at a fairness
        hearing on June 15, 2007. The settlement establishes a procedure by which dentists, who
        believe they were required to perform dental work because of a problem caused by
        Advance® cement, can submit claims for review and reimbursement of unpaid fees. The
        Company’s primary level insurance carrier has confirmed coverage for claims in this
        matter up to one million dollars, their asserted policy limits. Litigation is pending with
        the Company’s excess insurance carrier regarding the level and coverage of its
        insurance for this case.

On June 18, 2004, Marvin Weinstat, DDS and Richard Nathan,
        DDS filed a class action suit in San Francisco County, California alleging that the Company
        misrepresented that its Cavitron® ultrasonic scalers are suitable for use in oral
        surgical procedures. The Complaint seeks a recall of the product and refund of its purchase
        price to dentists who have purchased it for use in oral surgery. The Court certified the
        case as a class action in June 2006 with respect to the breach of warranty and unfair
        business practices claims. The class is defined as California dental professionals who
        purchased and used one or more Cavitron® ultrasonic scalers for the performance of oral
        surgical procedures. The Company filed a motion for decertification of the class and this
        motion was granted. Plaintiffs have appealed the decertification of the class to the
        California Court of Appeals.

On December 12, 2006, a Complaint was filed by Carole
        Hildebrand, DDS and Robert Jaffin, DDS in the Eastern District of PA. The case was filed by
        the same law firm that filed the Weinstat case in California. The Complaint asserts
        putative class action claims on behalf of dentists located in New Jersey and Pennsylvania
        based on assertions that the Company’s Cavitron® ultrasonic scaler was sold in
        breach of contract and warranty arising from misrepresentations about the potential uses of
        the product because it cannot deliver potable or sterile water. The Complaint seeks a
        refund of the purchase price paid for Cavitron® ultrasonic scalers. Plaintiffs have
        filed their Motion for class certification to which the Company has filed its
        response.

OVERVIEW

DENTSPLY International Inc. believes it is the world's
        largest manufacturer of professional dental products. The Company is headquartered in the
        United States and operates in more than 120 other countries, principally through its
        foreign subsidiaries. The Company also has strategically located distribution centers to
        enable it to better serve its customers and increase its operating efficiency.

While the United States and Europe are the Company's largest markets, the
        Company serves all of the major professional dental markets worldwide.

The principal benchmarks used by the Company in evaluating
        its business are: (1) internal growth in the United States, Europe and all other regions;
        (2) operating margins of each reportable segment; (3) the development, introduction and
        contribution of innovative new products; (4) growth through acquisition; and (5) continued
        focus on controlling costs and enhancing efficiency. The Company defines “internal
        growth” as the increase in net sales from period to period, excluding precious metal
        content, the impact of changes in currency exchange rates and the net sales, for a period
        of twelve months following the transaction date, of businesses that have been acquired or
        divested.

Management believes that an average overall internal growth
        rate of 4-6% is a long-term sustainable rate for the Company. This annualized growth rate
        expectation typically includes approximately 1-2% of price increases. The Company typically
        implements most of its price changes in the third or fourth quarters of the year. These
        price changes, other marketing and promotional programs offered to customers from time to
        time, the management of inventory levels by distributors and the implementation of
        strategic initiatives, may impact sales levels in a given period.

During 2007, the Company's overall internal growth was
        approximately 6.4% compared to 4.3% in 2006. Internal growth rates in the United States
        (40.5% of sales) and Europe (39.0% of sales), the largest dental markets in the world, were
        4.2% and 7.3%, respectively during 2007 compared to 1.2% and 7.4%, respectively for 2006.
        As discussed further within the Overview section and the Results of Continuing Operations,
        the internal growth in the United States during 2007 was led by solid growth in the
        Orthodontic and Implant businesses. The internal growth in the United States during 2007 as
        compared to 2006 was negatively impacted by the U.S Strategic Partnership Program for the
        first nine months of the year and positively impacted in the last quarter of 2007. The
        program was announced in the third quarter of 2006 and implemented in the fourth quarter of
        2006. Additionally, as discussed further within the Results of Continuing Operations, the
        internal growth rate in Europe during 2007 as compared to 2006 was favorably impacted by
        the continued strong performance in all of the dental specialty businesses. The internal
        growth rate in all other regions (20.5% of sales), was 9.4% in 2007 compared to 5.6% in
        2006. The 9.4% internal growth in all other regions during 2007 was driven by strong growth
        in Japan, Canada, Middle East and Australia. There can be no assurance that the
        Company’s assumptions concerning the growth rates in its markets or the dental market
        generally will continue in the future, and if such rates are less than expected, the
        Company’s projected growth rates and results of operations may be adversely
        affected.

Product innovation is a key component of the Company's
        overall growth strategy. During both 2006 and 2007, the Company continued to introduce
        multiple new products or significant product enhancements. New advances in technology are
        anticipated to have a significant influence on future products in dentistry. As a result,
        the Company has pursued several research and development initiatives to support this
        technological development, including partnerships and collaborations with various research
        institutions and dental schools. In addition, the Company licenses and purchases
        technologies developed by third parties. Although the Company believes these activities
        will lead to new innovative dental products, they involve new technologies and there can be
        no assurance that commercialized products will be developed.


Although the professional dental market in which the Company
        operates has experienced consolidation, it is still a fragmented industry. The Company
        continues to focus on opportunities to expand the Company’s product offerings through
        acquisition. Management believes that there will continue to be adequate opportunities to
        participate as a consolidator in the industry for the foreseeable future (see also
        Acquisition Activity in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). As further
        discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, during 2007, the Company has
        purchased several small businesses.

The Company also remains focused on reducing costs and
        achieving operational efficiencies. Management expects to continue to consolidate
        operations or functions and reduce the cost of those operations and functions while
        improving service levels. In addition, the Company remains focused on enhancing efficiency
        through expanded use of technology and process improvement initiatives. The Company
        believes that the benefits from these opportunities will improve the cost structure and
        offset areas of rising costs such as energy, benefits, financial reporting, regulatory
        oversight and compliance.

In late 2006, the Company entered into a U.S. Strategic
        Partnership Program, designed to significantly improve its ability to collaborate with,
        provide value to its key distributor partners, and gain improved access to end user data.
        Currently, this program encompasses most of the Company’s divisions selling through
        the United States dental distributors and has resulted in a consolidated network of United
        States distributors.

In late 2005, the Company closed its Chicago-based
        pharmaceutical manufacturing facility and outsourced the production of the injectable
        dental anesthetic products and the non-injectable Oraqix® products. The Company
        currently has contract manufacturing relationships for the supply of injectable dental
        anesthetic products. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to
        obtain an adequate supply of its injectable products in the future.

FACTORS IMPACTING COMPARABILITY BETWEEN
        YEARS

Adoption of SFAS 158

In 2007, the Company early adopted the provision of Statement
        of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158 (“SFAS 158”), “Employers’
        Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans” for December
        31, 2006. SFAS 158, which is an amendment of SFAS No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R), requires the
        alignment of the measurement date and the year-end balance sheet date. The Company adopted
        this provision for the 2007 fiscal year with the only impact being to the Swiss pension
        plan that has been measured as of September 30 in prior years. As allowed under SFAS 158,
        the Company computed the net benefit expense for the period from the early measurement date
        of September 30, 2006 through December 31, 2007, which is the end of the fiscal year of
        adoption. The Company recognized three months of the net benefit expense as an adjustment
        to retained earnings in 2007. The net of tax adjustment to retained earnings is $0.4
        million.

Adoption of FIN 48

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
        (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN 48”),
        “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an interpretation of FASB Statement No.
        109, Accounting for Income Taxes,” which clarifies the accounting for income taxes.
        FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial
        statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a
        tax return. The Interpretation requires that the Company recognize in the financial
        statements, the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being
        sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. FIN 48 also provides
        guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
        periods and disclosure. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective beginning January 1,
        2007 with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an
        adjustment to opening retained earnings. As a result of the implementation the Company
        recognized a $3.8 million increase to reserves for uncertain tax
        positions.

The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, as of
        the date of adoption, is approximately $48.7 million. Of this total, approximately $37.8
        million (net of the federal benefit of state issues) represents the amount of unrecognized
        tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective income tax rate. It is
        reasonably possible that certain amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly
        increase or decrease within 12 months of the reporting date of the Company’s
        consolidated financial statements. Expiration of statutes of limitation in various
        jurisdictions could include unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $7.1 million, $2.0
        million of which will have no impact upon the effective income tax rate. A decrease of
        unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $ 10.7 million, $5.1 million of which will have
        no impact upon the effective income tax rate could occur as a result of final settlement
        and resolution of outstanding tax matters in foreign jurisdictions during the next twelve
        months.

Revisions in Classification

Certain revisions in classification have been made to prior
        years' data in order to conform to current year presentation.


RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS, 2007 COMPARED TO

Net Sales

The discussion below summarizes the Company’s sales
        growth, excluding precious metal content, from internal growth and net acquisition growth,
        and highlights the impact of foreign currency translation. These disclosures of net sales
        growth provide the reader with sales results on a comparable basis between
        periods.

Management believes that the presentation of net sales,
        excluding precious metal content, provides useful information to investors because a
        significant portion of DENTSPLY’s net sales is comprised of sales of precious metals
        generated through sales of the Company’s precious metal alloy products, which are
        used by third parties to construct crown and bridge materials. Due to the fluctuations of
        precious metal prices and because the precious metal content of the Company’s sales
        is largely a pass-through to customers and has minimal effect on earnings, DENTSPLY reports
        sales both with and without precious metal content to show the Company’s performance
        independent of precious metal price volatility and to enhance comparability of performance
        between periods. The Company uses its cost of precious metal purchased as a proxy for the
        precious metal content of sales, as the precious metal content of sales is not separately
        tracked and invoiced to customers. The Company believes that it is reasonable to use the
        cost of precious metal content purchased in this manner since precious metal alloy sale
        prices are typically adjusted when the prices of underlying precious metals
        change.

The presentation of net sales, excluding precious metal
        content, could be considered a measure not calculated in accordance with generally accepted
        accounting principles (GAAP), and is therefore considered a non-GAAP measure. The Company
        provides the following reconciliation of net sales to net sales, excluding precious metal
        content. The Company’s definitions and calculations of net sales, excluding precious
        metal content, and other operating measures derived using net sales, excluding precious
        metal content, may not necessarily be the same as those used by other
        companies.

The internal sales growth of 4.2%, excluding precious metal
        content, in the United States was a result of continued growth in the dental specialty
        category, and improved growth in the dental laboratory and dental consumable product
        categories.

Europe

In Europe, the internal sales growth of 7.3%, excluding
        precious metal content, was driven by the continued strong sales growth in the dental
        specialty category and partially offset by lower internal growth in the dental consumables
        and dental laboratory categories. Additionally, the Company believes that a significant
        contraction in the precious metal alloy market occurred, in part, due to the dramatic
        increase in the price of precious metals and to the shift toward all ceramic products in
        the past few years.


All Other Regions

The internal growth of 9.4% in all other regions was largely
        the result of strong growth in the dental specialty category. In addition, during 2007, the
        Pacific Rim, Canada, Middle East and Australia regions experienced strong internal
        growth.

The 11.4% increase in SG&A expenses reflects additional

        currency translation impacts of approximately $25.7 million. The remaining increase in
        SG&A expenses is primarily a result of increased sales and marketing expenditures to
        support growth in the dental specialty businesses and higher growth regions, partially
        offset by a reduction in stock compensation expense as a result of accelerated vesting in
        2006. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, excluding precious metal content,
        decreased from 37.4% in 2006 to 37.1% in 2007. The 2007 expense ratio was favorably
        impacted by lower stock based compensation and improved leverage on the investments in

During 2007, the Company recorded net restructuring,
        impairment and other costs of $10.5 million. The Company initiated several restructuring
        plans primarily related to the closure and consolidation of certain production and selling
        facilities in the United States, Europe, Asia and South America in order to better leverage
        the Company’s resources by reducing costs and obtaining operational efficiencies.
        These restructuring plans included charges of $5.4 million. Additionally, the Company also
        recorded a total of $5.0 million in expenses related to several legal claims (see also Note
        14 to the consolidated financial statements).


During 2006, the Company recorded net restructuring,
        impairment and other costs of $7.8 million. The net costs of $7.8 million were primarily
        for additional restructuring costs incurred related to the decision to shut down the
        pharmaceutical manufacturing facility in Chicago, Illinois and costs related to the
        consolidation of certain United States and European selling and production facilities.
        These restructuring costs were partially offset by the gain of $2.9 million on the sale of
        the assets previously associated with the pharmaceutical manufacturing facility which the
        Company had announced in early 2006 that it would be closing. Additionally, these costs
        were further offset by the gain of $1.0 million on the sale of assets associated with a
        German manufacturing facility which was closed down in 1998 as part of a restructuring
        plan.

The change in net interest income in 2007 compared to 2006
        was mainly the result of lower average debt and investment levels following the 350.0
        million Eurobond maturity in December, 2006, offset somewhat by higher average interest
        rates. In addition, higher average interest rates on Euro and Swiss franc basis swaps
        combined with weaker U.S. dollar average exchange rates against both currencies resulted in
        lower net interest received on the Company’s net investment hedges (see also Note 5

Income Taxes

The Company’s effective tax rates for 2007 and 2006
        were 27.5% and 28.9%, respectively. The Company’s operating tax rates for 2007 and
        2006 were 30.3% and 30.5%, respectively. The Company benefited from various tax adjustments
        of $9.9 million and $4.8 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively (see also Note 12 to the
        consolidated financial statements).

Net Income

Fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations
        during 2007 were $1.68 compared to $1.41 during the same period in 2006. Net income for the
        2007 period included the after tax impact from restructuring costs of $6.7 million, or
        $0.04 per diluted share and a net tax benefit of $9.9 million, or $0.06 per diluted share
        due to tax related adjustments. The net income for the 2006 period included the after tax
        impact from restructuring costs of $5.0 million, or $0.03 per diluted share and a net tax
        benefit of $4.8 million, or $0.03 per diluted share due to tax related
        adjustments.


Operating Segment Results

In January 2007, the Company reorganized its operating group
        structure expanding into four operating groups from the three groups under the prior
        management structure. These operating groups are considered the Company’s reportable
        segments under SFAS 131 as the Company’s chief operating decision-maker regularly
        reviews financial results at the operating group level and uses this information to manage
        the Company’s operations. Each of these operating groups covers a wide range of
        product categories and geographic regions. The product categories and geographic regions
        often overlap across the groups. Further information regarding the details of each group is
        presented in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. The management of each group
        is evaluated for performance and incentive compensation purposes on net third party sales,
        excluding precious metal content, and segment operating income.

Net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased 9.8%
        during the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. This increase was driven by
        positive internal growth, the acquisition of Sultan Healthcare, and positive currency
        translation. The implementation of the U.S Strategic Partnership Program hindered this
        segment in both 2007 and 2006.

Operating income decreased $4.6 million during the year ended
        December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The decrease was due to higher expense allocation from
        Corporate headquarters of sales and marketing expenses to better reflect activity within
        the segment. This decrease was partially offset by the favorable impact from acquisition
        activity and currency translation.

        2007 compared to 2006. Strong internal growth occurred in CIS, Middle East, United Kingdom
        and Pacific Rim businesses.

Operating income increased $4.2 million during the year ended
        December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase was primarily related to sales growth and
        currency translation.

        2007 compared to 2006. Strong internal growth occurred in the Orthodontic, Endodontic, and
        Canadian businesses.

Operating income increased $9.4 million during the year ended
        December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in operating profits was driven primarily
        by sales growth across the segment, partially offset by the additional operational
        investment into the combined Endodontic/Implant businesses in the United States. The
        increase was also related to positive currency translation.

Global Dental Laboratory
        Business/Implants/Non-Dental

Net sales, excluding precious metal content, increased 12.7%,
        including favorable impact of currency translation, during the year ended December 31, 2007
        compared to 2006. Strong internal growth occurred in the Implants business, and the United
        States dental laboratory business also grew at a faster rate in 2007. Additionally, the
        Company believes that a significant contraction in the precious metal alloy market
        occurred, in part, due to the dramatic increase in the price of precious metals and the
        move to all ceramic products, such as the Company's Cercon® product, in the past few
        years.

Operating income increased $17.8 million during the year
        ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in operating profits was driven
        primarily by the sales growth in the Implants business.  In addition, operating profit
        was positively impacted from currency translation.

United States

The internal sales growth of 1.2%, excluding precious metal
        content, in the United States was a result of moderate growth in the dental specialty
        category, partially offset by lower sales in the dental consumable and dental laboratory
        product categories. This below average growth rate was mainly the result of the internal
        growth rate of negative 5.5% in the fourth quarter of 2006 that was primarily attributable
        to the impact of the U.S. Strategic Partnership Program that was announced at the end of
        the third quarter and implemented in the fourth quarter of 2006. In line with expectations,
        the fourth quarter internal sales growth for the United States region was significantly
        impacted by the lower sales to discontinued distributors, the contraction of distributor
        inventories as a result of the use of residual inventories purchased during the third
        quarter ahead of the early fourth quarter price increase, the balancing of promotional
        activities between distributors and end-users, as well as the contraction of dealer
        inventories as a result of the U.S. Strategic Partnership Program. The impact from these
        items primarily related to the dental consumable and the dental laboratory product
        categories.

In addition to the impact from the items discussed above, the
        full year internal growth rate in the United States dental laboratory product category was
        unfavorably impacted by the consolidation of distributors, particularly with regard to
        tooth products.

Europe

In Europe, the internal sales growth of 7.4%, excluding
        precious metal content, was driven by the continued strong sales growth in the endodontic,
        orthodontic and implant products within the dental specialty product category. The growth
        rate was partially offset by lower growth in the dental laboratory product category,
        particularly in Germany, where the Company believed that the market was negatively impacted
        by reimbursement changes enacted in 2005 and by a significant contraction in the precious
        metal alloy market due to the dramatic increase in the price of precious metals over the
        past few years impacting the value-added sales portion of the precious metal alloy
        business. In 2006, the Company overcame these market issues in part through the
        introduction of new technologies and the continued strong growth of its all ceramic crown
        and bridge Cercon® product.

All Other Regions

The internal growth of 5.6% in all other regions was largely
        the result of strong growth in the dental specialty category in most countries included in
        the other regions, primarily led by Asia, Latin America, Canada and Australia. In addition,
        during 2006 the Asia, Middle East and Australia regions experienced strong internal sales
        growth in the dental consumable product category, partially offset by lower sales in the
        consumable product category for the Japan and Canada regions. Finally, the Latin America
        and Middle East regions experienced strong internal growth in the dental laboratory product
        category, partially offset by lower sales in the dental laboratory product category in the
        Canada and Australia regions.

The 0.9% increase from 2005 to 2006 in the gross profit as a

        shifts in the product and geographic mix, improved leveraging of resources, lean
        manufacturing initiatives, as well as a reduction in expenditures, as a result of the
        Company’s decision to close its Chicago-based pharmaceutical manufacturing facility.
        These favorable impacts were partially offset by the impact on sales in the fourth quarter
        of 2006 from the U.S. Strategic Partnership Program.

The 7.7% increase in SG&A expenses reflects additional
        SG&A expenses of $1.3 million from acquired companies and increases from unfavorable
        currency translation impacts of approximately $3.0 million. SG&A expenses, measured
        against sales, including precious metal content, increased to 33.5% compared to 32.8% in
        2005. SG&A expenses, as measured as a percentage of sales, excluding precious metal
        content, increased to 37.4% compared to 36.5% in 2005. The 2006 expense ratio was
        negatively impacted by $18.5 million of pre-tax stock-based compensation expense as a
        result of the adoption of SFAS 123(R) on January 1, 2006, as well as costs related to the
        implementation of the U.S. Strategic Partnership Program and the merger of the United
        States Endodontic and Implant divisions. This increase in expenses was partially offset by
        the favorable impact of the decision to shut down the pharmaceutical manufacturing facility
        in Chicago, Illinois. The 2005 expense ratio was negatively impacted as a result of higher
        expense levels in 2005 related to costs associated with the global tax project and the
        biennial International Dental Show (“IDS”).

During 2006, the Company recorded net restructuring,
        impairment and other costs of $7.8 million. The net costs of $7.8 million were primarily
        for additional restructuring costs incurred related to the decision to shut down the
        pharmaceutical manufacturing facility in Chicago, Illinois and costs related to the
        consolidation of certain United States and European selling and production facilities.
        These restructuring costs were partially offset by the gain of $2.9 million on the sale of
        the assets previously associated with the pharmaceutical manufacturing facility which the
        Company had announced in early 2006 that it would be closing. Additionally, these costs
        were further offset by the gain of $1.0 million on the sale of assets associated with a
        German manufacturing facility which was closed down in 1998 as part of a restructuring
        plan.

During 2005, the Company recorded restructuring and other
        costs of $232.8 million. This amount was mainly attributable to the impairment of the
        indefinite-lived injectable anesthetic intangible acquired from AstraZeneca in 2001 as well
        as the impairment of the fixed assets associated with the pharmaceutical manufacturing
        facility. Included in the $232.8 million charge were restructuring charges of $3.1 million
        that were recorded during 2005 largely as a result of the decision to shut down the
        anesthetics manufacturing facility in Chicago, Illinois. These costs were partially offset
        by a change in estimate of $1.2 million primarily related to the reversal of accrued
        severance costs associated with the 2004 European Shared Services Center that were no
        longer necessary.

The change from net interest expense in 2005 to net interest

        currency interest rate swaps designated as net investment hedges, lower average debt levels
        and higher average cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment levels. The cross
        currency interest rate swaps were put into place throughout 2005 and the first quarter of
        2006.

Other (Income) Expense, Net

Other (Income) Expense in the 2006 period included $0.1
        million of currency transaction losses and $1.5 million of other non-operating losses. The
        2005 period included $6.7 million of currency transaction gains and $0.2 million of other
        non-operating gains. The currency transaction gain in 2005 was primarily the result of a
        transaction involving the transfer in 2005 of intangible assets between legal entities with
        different functional currencies. Exchange transaction gains or losses occur from movement
        of foreign currency rates between the date of the transaction and the date of final
        financial settlement.

Fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations
        during 2006 were $1.41 compared to $0.28 during the same period in 2005. Net income for the
        2006 period included the after tax impact of expensing stock options of $13.3 million, or
        $0.08 per diluted share, the after tax impact from restructuring costs of $5.0 million, or
        $0.03 per diluted share and a net tax benefit of $4.8 million, or $0.03 per diluted share
        due to tax related adjustments. The net income for the 2005 period included the negative
        after tax impact of $178.9 million, or $1.10 per diluted share from impairment and
        restructuring charges primarily associated with the injectable anesthetic facility and
        indefinite-lived intangible assets. The negative impacts during the 2005 period related to
        the impairment and restructuring charges were partially offset by net non-recurring
        benefits related to tax reorganization and repatriation activities of $8.9 million, or
        $0.05 per diluted share. Stock option expense was not included in net income until January
        1, 2006 upon the Company’s adoption of SFAS 123(R).

Operating Segment Results

In January 2007, the Company reorganized its operating group
        structure into four operating groups from the three groups under the prior management
        structure. These operating groups are considered the Company’s reportable segments
        under SFAS 131 as the Company’s chief operating decision-maker regularly reviews
        financial results at the operating group level and uses this information to manage the
        Company’s operations. Each of these operating groups covers a wide range of product
        categories and geographic regions. The product categories and geographic regions often
        overlap across the groups. Further information regarding the details of each group is
        presented in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. The management of each group
        is evaluated for performance and incentive compensation purposes on net third party sales,

        continued growth occurred in the Endodontic business, partially offset by lower sales in
        Latin America.


Operating income increased $10.6 million during the year
        ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in operating profits was driven
        primarily by sales growth in the Orthodontic business.

        translation also added to the positive growth.

Operating income increased $10.1 million during the year
        ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in operating profits was driven
        primarily by the sales growth in the Implant business, slightly offset by the Global Dental
        Laboratory business.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

Since approximately 59% of the Company's 2007 net sales,
        excluding precious metal content, were generated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar,
        the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to those currencies affects the results of
        operations of the Company. The impact of currency fluctuations in any given period can be
        favorable or unfavorable. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of European
        currencies on operating income is partially offset by sales in the United States of
        products sourced from plants and third party suppliers located overseas, principally in
        Germany and Switzerland. On a net basis, net income benefited from changes in currency
        translation in 2007 and 2006 compared to prior years.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND
        ESTIMATES

The Company has identified below the accounting estimates
        believed to be critical to its business and results of operations. These critical estimates
        represent those accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions
        or assessments.

Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets

The Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting
        Standards No. 142 (“SFAS 142”), “Goodwill and Other Intangible
        Assets,” which requires that at least an annual impairment test be applied to
        goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. The Company performs impairment tests on
        at least an annual basis using a fair value approach rather than an evaluation of the
        undiscounted cash flows. If impairment related to goodwill is identified under SFAS 142,
        the resulting charge is determined by recalculating goodwill through a hypothetical
        purchase price allocation of the fair value and reducing the current carrying value to the
        extent it exceeds the recalculated goodwill. If impairment is identified on
        indefinite-lived intangibles, the resulting charge reflects the excess of the asset’s
        carrying cost over its fair value.

Other long-lived assets, such as identifiable intangible
        assets and fixed assets, are amortized or depreciated over their estimated useful lives. In
        accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 (“SFAS
        144”), “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,”
        these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances provide evidence
        that suggest that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable with impairment
        being based upon an evaluation of the identifiable undiscounted cash flows. If impaired,
        the resulting charge reflects the excess of the asset’s carrying cost over its fair
        value.

Assessment of the potential impairment of goodwill,
        indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets is an integral part of the
        Company’s normal ongoing review of operations. Testing for potential impairment of
        these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects
        management’s best estimates at a particular point in time. The dynamic economic
        environments in which the Company’s businesses operate and key economic and business
        assumptions with respect to projected selling prices, increased competition and
        introductions of new technologies can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests.
        Estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. Changes
        in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant
        impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments, as well as the time at which such
        impairments are recognized. If there are unfavorable changes in these environments or
        assumptions, future cash flows, the key variable in assessing the impairment of these
        assets, may decrease and as a result the Company may be required to recognize impairment
        charges. Future changes in the environment and the economic outlook for the assets being
        evaluated could also result in additional impairment charges being recognized. Information
        with respect to the Company’s significant accounting policies on long-lived assets is
        included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.


Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The
        cost of inventories is determined primarily by the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”)
        or average cost methods, with a small portion being determined by the last-in, first-out
        (“LIFO”) method. The Company establishes reserves for inventory estimated to be
        obsolete or unmarketable equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and
        estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If
        actual market conditions are less favorable than those anticipated, additional inventory
        reserves may be required.

Accounts Receivable

The Company sells dental equipment and supplies both through
        a worldwide network of distributors and directly to end users. For customers on credit
        terms, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluation of those customers' financial
        condition and generally does not require collateral from them. The Company establishes
        allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its
        customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of the Company’s
        customers were to deteriorate, their ability to make required payments may become impaired,
        and increases in these allowances may be required. In addition, a negative impact on sales
        to those customers may occur.

Accruals for Product Returns, Customer Rebates and Product
        Warranties

The Company makes provisions for customer returns, customer
        rebates and for product warranties at the time of sale. These accruals are based on past
        history, projections of customer purchases and sales and expected product performance in
        the future. Because the actual results for product returns, rebates and warranties are
        dependent in part on future events, these matters require the use of estimates. The Company
        has a long history of product performance in the dental industry and thus has an extensive
        knowledge base from which to draw in measuring these estimates.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are determined using the liability method of
        accounting for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
        No. 109 (“SFAS 109”), “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Under SFAS
        109, tax expense includes the United States and international income taxes plus the
        provision for Unites States taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries
        not deemed to be permanently invested.

Certain items of income and expense are not reported in tax
        returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary
        differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if it
        is more likely than not that the assets will be realized in future years. The Company
        establishes a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which realization is not
        likely. As of December 31, 2007, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $50.3
        million against the benefit of certain net operating loss carryforwards of foreign and
        domestic subsidiaries.

The Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and
        in the normal course of business is examined in various jurisdictions. The reversal of the
        accruals is recorded when examinations are completed, statutes of limitation are closed or
        tax laws are changed.

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
        (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN 48”),
        “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an interpretation of FASB Statement No.
        109, Accounting for Income Taxes,” which clarifies the accounting for income taxes.
        FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial
        statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a
        tax return. The Interpretation requires that the Company recognize in the financial
        statements, the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being
        sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. FIN 48 also provides
        guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
        periods and disclosure. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective beginning January 1,
        2007 with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an
        adjustment to opening retained earnings. As a result of the implementation the Company
        recognized a $3.8 million increase to reserves for uncertain tax
        positions.


Pension and Other Postretirement
        Benefits

Substantially all of the employees of the Company and its
        subsidiaries are covered by government or Company-sponsored defined benefit or defined
        contribution plans. Additionally, certain union and salaried employee groups in
        the U.S. are covered by postretirement healthcare plans. Costs for Company-sponsored
        plans are based on expected return on plan assets, discount rates, employee compensation
        increase rates and health care cost trends. Expected return on plan assets, discount rates
        and health care cost trend assumptions are particularly important when determining the
        Company’s benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs associated with
        postretirement benefits. Changes in these assumptions can impact the Company’s pretax
        earnings. In determining the cost of postretirement benefits, certain assumptions are
        established annually to reflect market conditions and plan experience to appropriately
        reflect the expected costs as actuarially determined. These assumptions include medical
        inflation trend rates, discount rates, employee turnover and mortality rates. In
        establishing its discount rates, the Company predominantly uses observed indices of
        high-grade corporate bond yields with durations that are equivalent to the expected
        duration of the underlying liability. The discount rate for each plan is based on observed
        corporate bond yield indices in the respective economic region covered by the plan. The
        expected return on plan assets is the weighted average long-term expected return based upon
        asset allocations and historic average returns for the markets where the assets are
        invested, principally in foreign locations.

Additional information
        related to the impact of changes in these assumptions is provided in Note 13 to the
        consolidated financial statements.

The Company adopted the FASB issued SFAS 158. SFAS 158, which
        is an amendment of SFAS No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R), requires the Company to report the
        funded status of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on its
        balance sheets as a net liability or asset. As allowed under SFAS 158, the Company computed
        the net benefit expense for the period from the early measurement date of September 30,
        2006 through December 31, 2007, which is the end of the fiscal year of adoption. The
        Company recognized three months of the net benefit expense as an adjustment to retained
        earnings in 2007. The net of tax adjustment to retained earnings is $0.4 million (see also
        Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements).

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company employs derivative financial instruments to hedge
        certain anticipated transactions, firm commitments, or assets and liabilities denominated
        in foreign currencies. Additionally, the Company utilizes interest rate swaps to convert
        floating rate debt to fixed rate, fixed rate debt to floating rate, cross currency basis
        swaps to convert debt denominated in one currency to another currency, and commodity swaps
        to fix its variable raw materials costs. The Company complies with Statement of Financial
        Accounting Standards No. 133 (“SFAS 133”), “Accounting for Derivative
        Instruments and Hedging Activities.” This standard, as amended by SFAS 138 and 149,
        requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair
        value and that changes in fair value be recorded each period in current earnings or
        comprehensive income.

Litigation

The Company and its subsidiaries are from time to time
        parties to lawsuits arising out of their respective operations. The Company records
        liabilities when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. These estimates made
        by management are based on an analysis made by internal and external legal counsel who
        consider information known at the time. The Company believes it has estimated liabilities
        for probable losses well in the past; however, the unpredictability of court decisions
        could cause a liability to be incurred in excess of estimates. Legal costs related to these
        lawsuits are expensed as incurred.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash flows from operating activities during the year ended
        December 31, 2007 were $387.7 million compared to $271.9 million during the year ended
        December 31, 2006. The increase of $115.8 million was primarily the result of higher
        earnings in the 2007 period and favorable working capital changes. Improvements in
        inventory and accounts receivable management contributed $39.1 million to the improvement
        in cash flow. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the number of days for sales
        outstanding in accounts receivable and inventory were 51 days and 95 days, respectively,
        compared to the previous year of 57 days and 96 days, respectively. Current income taxes
        paid and deferred tax provisions benefited the Company’s 2007 cash flow improvement
        by $50.8 million. This improvement is a result of a net operating loss utilization from the
        2005 Pharmaceutical impairment. This increase is also a result of the one time payment of
        approximately $23.0 million in taxes during 2006, primarily associated with the 2005
        repatriation of earnings.

Investing activities during 2007 include capital expenditures
        of $64.2 million. The Company expects that capital expenditures will range from $70.0
        million to $80.0 million in 2008. During 2007, the Company had expenditures related to the
        acquisition of identifiable intangible assets of $1.7 million. Also, activity related to
        the acquisition of businesses, for the year ended December 31, 2007, was $101.5 million
        which was primarily due to the acquisition of several small companies in 2007 and final
        payments on two 2005 acquisitions (see also Note 3 to the consolidated financial
        statements).

At December 31, 2007, the Company had authorization to
        maintain up to 14,000,000 shares of treasury stock under its stock repurchase program as
        approved by the Board of Directors. Under this program, the Company purchased 3,389,969
        shares during 2007 at an average price of $37.00. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the
        Company held 11,953,884 and 10,984,633 shares of treasury stock, respectively. The Company
        also received proceeds of $45.6 million primarily as a result of 2,342,965 stock option
        exercises during the year ended December 31, 2007.

DENTSPLY's total long-term debt, including the current
        portion of long-term debt, at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $482.3 million and $367.4
        million, respectively. The Company’s long-term borrowings increased by a net of
        $114.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. This net change included net new
        borrowings of $99.0 million during the year ended 2007, plus an increase of $15.9 million
        due to exchange rate fluctuations on debt denominated in foreign currencies During the year
        ended December 31, 2007, the Company’s ratio of long-term debt to total
        capitalization increased to 24.1% compared to 22.4% at December 31, 2006.

Under its multi-currency revolving credit agreement, the
        Company is able to borrow up to $500.0 million through May 2010. This facility is unsecured
        and contains certain affirmative and negative covenants relating to its operations and
        financial condition. The most restrictive of these covenants pertain to asset dispositions
        and prescribed ratios of indebtedness to total capital and operating income excluding
        depreciation and amortization to interest expense. At December 31, 2007, the Company was in
        compliance with these covenants. The Company also has available an aggregate $250.0 million
        under two commercial paper facilities; a $250.0 million United States facility and a $250.0
        million U.S. dollar equivalent European facility (“Euro CP facility”). Under
        the Euro CP facility, borrowings can be denominated in Swiss francs, Japanese yen, Euros,
        British pounds and U.S. dollars. The multi-currency revolving credit facility serves as a
        back-up to these commercial paper facilities. The total available credit under the
        commercial paper facilities and the multi-currency facility in the aggregate is $500.0
        million with $225.0 million outstanding under the multi-currency facility and $106.1
        million outstanding under the commercial paper facilities at December 31,
        2007.

The Company also has access to $35.9 million in uncommitted
        short-term financing under lines of credit from various financial institutions. The lines
        of credit have no major restrictions and are provided under demand notes between the
        Company and the lending institutions. At December 31, 2007, $1.1 million is outstanding
        under these short-term lines of credit.

At December 31, 2007, the Company had total unused lines of
        credit related to the revolving credit agreement and the uncommitted short-term lines of
        credit of $203.7 million.

At December 31, 2007, the Company held $91.9 million of
        precious metals on consignment from several financial institutions. These consignment
        agreements allow the Company to acquire the precious metal at market rates at a point in
        time which is approximately the same time and for the same price as alloys are sold to the
        Company’s customers. In the event that the financial institutions would discontinue
        offering these consignment arrangements, and if the Company could not obtain other
        comparable arrangements, the Company may be required to obtain third party financing to
        fund an ownership position in the required precious metal inventory
        levels.

The Company's cash, cash equivalents and short-term
        investments increased $251.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2007 to $316.3
        million. In 2007, the Company had net new borrowings of $99.0 million and repurchased
        $125.4 million in treasury stock. The net new borrowings of $99.0 million were primarily
        due to the proceeds from the March 13, 2007 private placement note of $149.5 million, which
        was partially offset by repayments of $50.5 million related to the Swiss franc denominated
        private placement notes.

On March 13, 2007, the Company entered into a note purchase
        agreement with a group of initial purchasers, providing for the issuance of $150.0 million
        aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due 2010 (the “Notes”)
        through a private placement. The net proceeds from the offering after deducting placement
        fees and expenses of the offering was $149.5 million. The obligations of DENTSPLY and the
        initial purchasers are subject to the terms and conditions of the Note
        Agreement.

The Company expects on an ongoing basis to be able to finance
        cash requirements, including capital expenditures, stock repurchases, debt service,
        operating leases and potential future acquisitions, from the current cash, cash equivalents
        and short-term investment balances, funds generated from operations and amounts available
        under its existing credit facilities.

Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future
        cash flows associated with the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits at December 31,
        2007, the Company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash
        settlement with the respective taxing authority. Therefore, $50.8 million of the
        unrecognized tax benefit has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above
        (see also Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements).

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
        Accounting Standards No. 141(R) (“SFAS 141(R)”), “Business
        Combinations.” SFAS 141(R) provides greater consistency in the accounting and
        financial reporting of business combinations. It requires the acquiring entity in a
        business combination to recognize all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the
        transaction, establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for
        all assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and requires the acquirer to disclose the
        nature and financial effect of the business combination. SFAS 141(R) is effective for
        fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company will adopt SFAS 141(R) in the
        first quarter of fiscal year 2009 and is currently evaluating the impact the adoption will
        have on the Company’s financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
        Accounting Standards No. 160 (“SFAS 160”), “Noncontrolling Interests in
        Consolidated Financial Statements.” This Statement amends Accounting Research
        Bulletin No. 51, “Consolidated Financial Statements,” to establish accounting
        and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the
        deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
        December 15, 2008. The Company will adopt SFAS 160 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009
        and is currently evaluating the impact the adoption will have on the Company’s
        financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
        Accounting Standards No. 159 (“SFAS 159”), “The Fair Value Option for
        Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.” SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to
        measure financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently
        required to be measured at fair value. This will allow entities the opportunity to mitigate
        volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities
        differently. SFAS 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
        beginning after November 15, 2007. The Statement should not be applied retrospectively to
        fiscal years beginning prior to that effective date, except as permitted for early
        adoption. The Company is still evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 159 on the financial
        statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157 (“SFAS
        157”), “Fair Value Measurements,” which requires the Company to define
        fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting
        principles (GAAP), and expand disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement
        applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value
        measurements. Accordingly, this Statement does not expand the use of fair value to any new
        circumstances. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
        beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The
        Company is still evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 157 on the financial
        statements.


QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET
        RISK

The information provided below about the Company's market
        sensitive financial instruments includes “forward-looking statements” that
        involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those
        expressed in the forward-looking statements. The Company's major market risk exposures are
        changing interest rates, movements in foreign currency exchange rates and potential price
        volatility of commodities used by the Company in its manufacturing processes. The Company's
        policy is to manage interest rates through the use of floating rate debt and interest rate
        swaps to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate, based upon market conditions. The
        Company employs foreign currency denominated debt and currency swaps which serve to
        partially offset the Company's exposure on its net investments in subsidiaries denominated
        in foreign currencies. The Company's policy generally is to hedge major foreign currency
        transaction exposures through foreign exchange forward contracts. These contracts are
        entered into with major financial institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss.
        In order to limit the unanticipated earnings fluctuations from volatility in commodity
        prices, the Company selectively enters into commodity swaps to convert variable raw
        material costs to fixed costs. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial
        instruments for speculative or trading purposes. The Company is subject to other foreign
        exchange market risk exposure in addition to the risks on its financial instruments, such
        as possible impacts on its pricing and production costs, which are difficult to reasonably
        predict, and have therefore not been included in the table below. All items described are
        non-trading and are stated in U.S. dollars.

Financial Instruments

The fair value of financial instruments is determined by
        reference to various market data and other valuation techniques as appropriate. The Company
        believes the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments,
        accounts receivable (net of allowance for doubtful accounts), prepaid expenses and other
        current assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, income taxes payable and notes
        payable approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The
        Company estimates the fair value and carrying value of its total long-term debt was $482.3
        million as of December 31, 2007. The fair value of the Company’s long-term
        debt equaled its carrying value as the Company’s debt is variable rate and
        reflects current market rates. The interest rates on private placement notes, revolving
        debt and commercial paper are variable and therefore the fair value of these instruments
        approximates their carrying values.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company employs derivative financial instruments to hedge
        certain anticipated transactions, firm commitments, or assets and liabilities denominated
        in foreign currencies. Additionally, the Company utilizes interest rate swaps to convert
        floating rate debt to fixed rate, cross currency basis swaps to convert debt denominated in
        one currency to another currency and commodity swaps to fix its variable raw
        materials.

Foreign Exchange Risk Management

The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to selectively
        hedge assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Market value gains and
        losses are recognized in income currently and the resulting gains or losses offset foreign
        exchange gains or losses recognized on the foreign currency assets and liabilities
        hedged.

The Company selectively enters into forward foreign exchange
        contracts to hedge anticipated purchases of product to effectively fix certain variable
        costs. These forwards are used to stabilize the cost of certain of the Company's products.
        The Company generally accounts for the forward foreign exchange contracts as cash flow
        hedges under SFAS 133. As a result, the Company records the fair value of the swap
        primarily through other comprehensive income based on the tested effectiveness of the
        forward foreign exchange contracts. Realized gains or losses in other comprehensive income
        are released and recorded to costs of products sold as the products associated with the
        forward foreign exchange contracts are sold. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company
        elected to prospectively measure the effectiveness of cash flow hedges of anticipated
        transactions on a spot to spot basis rather than on a forward to forward basis.
        Accordingly, any time value component of the hedge fair value is deemed ineffective and
        will be reported currently as interest expense in the period which it is applicable. The
        spot to spot change in the derivative fair value will be deferred in other comprehensive
        income and released and recorded to costs of products sold as the products associated with
        the forward foreign exchange contracts are sold. Any cash flows associated with these
        instruments are included in cash from operations in accordance with the Company’s
        policy of classifying the cash flows from these instruments in the same category as the
        cash flows from the items being hedged.

Determination of hedge activity is based upon market
        conditions, the magnitude of the foreign currency assets and liabilities and perceived
        risks. The Company’s significant contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2007 are
        summarized in the table that follows. These foreign exchange contracts generally have
        maturities of less than twelve months and the counterparties to the transactions are
        typically large international financial institutions.

The Company has numerous investments in foreign subsidiaries.
        The net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to volatility in currency exchange rates.
        Currently, the Company uses both non-derivative financial instruments, including foreign
        currency denominated debt held at the parent company level and derivative financial
        instruments to hedge some of this exposure. Translation gains and losses related to the net
        assets of the foreign subsidiaries are offset by gains and losses in the non-derivative and
        derivative financial instruments designated as hedges of net investments, which are
        included in accumulated other comprehensive income.


In the first quarter of 2005, the Company entered into cross
        currency interest rate swaps with a notional principal value of Swiss francs 457.5 million
        paying three month Swiss franc Libor and receiving three month U.S. dollar Libor on $384.4
        million. In the first quarter of 2006, the Company entered into additional cross currency
        interest rate swaps with a notional principal value of Swiss francs 55.5 million paying
        three month Swiss franc Libor and receiving three month U.S. dollar Libor on $42.0 million.
        In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company entered into additional cross currency interest
        rate swaps with a notional principal value of Swiss francs 80.4 million paying three month
        Swiss franc Libor and receiving three month U.S. dollar Libor on $64.4 million. In the
        first quarter of 2007, the Company entered into additional cross currency interest rate
        swaps with a notional principal value of Swiss francs 56.6 million paying three month Swiss
        franc Libor and receiving three month U.S. dollar Libor on $46.3 million. Additionally, in
        the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company entered into cross currency interest rate swaps
        with a notional principal value of Euro 358.0 million paying three month Euro Libor and
        receiving three month U.S. dollar Libor on $419.7 million. The Swiss franc and Euro cross
        currency interest rate swaps are designated as net investment hedges of the Swiss and Euro
        denominated net assets. The interest rate differential is recognized in the earnings as
        interest income or interest expense as it is accrued. The foreign currency revaluation is
        recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax effects.

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had
        Euro-denominated, Swiss franc-denominated, and Japanese yen-denominated debt and cross
        currency interest rate swaps (at the parent company level) to hedge the currency exposure
        related to a designated portion of the net assets of its European, Swiss and Japanese
        subsidiaries. The fair value of the cross currency interest rate swap agreements is the
        estimated amount the Company would (pay) receive at the reporting date, taking into account
        the effective interest rates and foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2007 and
        December 31, 2006, the estimated net fair values of the cross currency interest rate swap
        agreements were negative $138.1 million and negative $48.1 million, respectively, which are
        recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax effects. At December 31,
        2007 and 2006, the accumulated translation gains on investments in foreign subsidiaries,
        primarily denominated in Euros, Swiss francs and Japanese yen, net of these net investment
        hedges, were $156.8 million and $105.8 million, respectively, which were included in
        accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax effects. The Company’s outstanding
        debt denominated in foreign currencies and the outstanding cross currency interest rate
        swaps as of December 31, 2007 are summarized in the table that follows.

Interest Rate Risk Management

The Company uses interest rate swaps to convert a portion of its variable
        rate debt to fixed rate debt. As of December 31, 2007, the Company has three groups of
        significant variable rate to fixed rate interest rate swaps. One of the groups of swaps has
        notional amounts totaling 12.6 billion Japanese yen, and effectively converts the
        underlying variable interest rates to an average fixed rate of 1.6% for a term of ten
        years, ending in March 2012. Another swap has a notional amount of 65.0 million Swiss
        francs, and effectively converts the underlying variable interest rates to a fixed rate of
        4.2% for a term of seven years, ending in March 2012. A third group of swaps has a notional
        amount of $150.0 million, and effectively converts the underlying variable interest rates
        to a fixed rate of 3.9% for a term of two years, ending March, 2010.

Commodity Risk Management

The
        Company selectively enters into commodity swaps to effectively fix certain variable raw
        material costs. These swaps are used purely to stabilize the cost of components used in the
        production of certain of the Company's products. The Company generally accounts for the
        commodity swaps as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133. As a result, the Company records the
        fair value of the swap primarily through other comprehensive income based on the tested
        effectiveness of the commodity swap. Realized gains or losses in other comprehensive income
        are released and recorded to costs of products sold as the products associated with the
        commodity swaps are sold. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company elected to
        prospectively measure the effectiveness of cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions on
        a spot to spot basis rather than on a forward to forward basis. Accordingly, any time value
        component of the hedge fair value is deemed ineffective and will be reported currently as
        interest expense in the period which it is applicable. The spot to spot change in the
        derivative fair value will be deferred in other comprehensive income and released and
        recorded to costs of products sold as the products associated with the forward foreign
        exchange contracts are sold. Any cash flows associated with these instruments are included
        in cash from operations in accordance with the Company’s policy of classifying the
        cash flows from these instruments in the same category as the cash flows from the items
        being hedged. The Company’s significant contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2007
        are summarized in the table that follows.


Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

Consignment Arrangements

The Company consigns the precious metals used in the
        production of precious metal alloy products from various financial institutions. Under
        these consignment arrangements, the banks own the precious metal, and, accordingly, the
        Company does not report this consigned inventory as part of its inventory on its
        consolidated balance sheet. These agreements are cancelable by either party at the end of
        each consignment period, which typically run for a period of one to nine months; however,
        because the Company typically has access to numerous financial institutions with excess
        capacity, consignment needs created by cancellations can be shifted among the other
        institutions. The consignment agreements allow the Company to take ownership of the metal
        at approximately the same time customer orders are received and to closely match the price
        of the metal acquired to the price charged to the customer (i.e., the price charged to the
        customer is largely a pass through).

As precious metal prices fluctuate, the Company evaluates the
        impact of the precious metal price fluctuation on its target gross margins for precious
        metal alloy products and revises the prices customers are charged for precious metal alloy
        products accordingly, depending upon the magnitude of the fluctuation. While the Company
        does not separately invoice customers for the precious metal content of precious metal
        alloy products, the underlying precious metal content is the primary component of the cost
        and sales price of the precious metal alloy products. For practical purposes, if the
        precious metal prices go up or down by a small amount, the Company will not immediately
        modify prices, as long as the cost of precious metals embedded in the Company’s
        precious metal alloy price closely approximates the market price of the precious metal. If
        there is a significant change in the price of precious metals, the Company adjusts the
        price for the precious metal alloys, maintaining its margin on the
        products.

At December 31, 2007, the Company had 117,983 troy ounces of
        precious metal, primarily gold, platinum and palladium, on consignment for periods of less
        than one year with a market value of $91.9 million. Under the terms of the consignment
        agreements, the Company also makes compensatory payments to the consignor banks based on a
        percentage of the value of the consigned precious metals inventory. At December 31, 2007,
        the average annual rate charged by the consignor banks was 1.8%. These compensatory
        payments are considered to be a cost of the metals purchased and are recorded as part of
        the cost of products sold.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial
        Reporting

The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and
        maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in
        Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
        The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
        reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
        of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles
        generally accepted in the United States of America. A Company’s internal control over
        financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance
        of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
        dispositions of the assets of the Company; provide reasonable assurance that transactions
        are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
        generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company
        are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
        Company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
        unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have
        a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
        reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
        effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
        because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
        procedures may deteriorate.

Management of the Company has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's
        internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007. In making its
        assessment, management used the criteria established in

Internal
        Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
        Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on its assessment
        management concluded that, as of December 31, 2007, the Company’s internal control
        over financial reporting was effective based on the criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO.


Report
        of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the
        Board of Directors and Stockholders

of DENTSPLY
        International Inc.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index
        appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
        position of DENTSPLY International Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
        and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the
        period ended

December 31, 2007

in conformity
        with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
        in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index

appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the
        information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated

financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
        material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
        2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control -
        Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
        Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible
        for these financial statements and the financial statement schedule, for maintaining
        effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
        effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in “Management's
        Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting” appearing under Item 15(a)(1).
        Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial
        statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on
        our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
        Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
        plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
        statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over
        financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial
        statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
        disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
        significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
        presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
        understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
        material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness
        of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such
        other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
        audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process
        designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
        and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
        generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial
        reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
        of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
        dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
        transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
        accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
        expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
        management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
        regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
        of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
        statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
        reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
        effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
        because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
        procedures may deteriorate.

DENTSPLY
        INTERNATIONAL INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
        accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
        America.

NOTE 1 -
        SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Significant accounting policies employed by the Company are discussed below
        and in other notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Description of Business

DENTSPLY designs, develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of
        products for the dental market. The Company believes that it is the world's leading
        manufacturer and distributor of dental prosthetics, precious metal dental alloys, dental
        ceramics, endodontic instruments and materials, prophylaxis paste, dental sealants,
        ultrasonic scalers and crown and bridge materials; the leading United States manufacturer
        and distributor of dental handpieces, dental x-ray film holders, film mounts and bone
        substitute/grafting materials; and a leading worldwide manufacturer or distributor of
        dental injectable anesthetics, impression materials, orthodontic appliances, dental cutting
        instruments and dental implants. The Company distributes its dental products in over 120
        countries under some of the most well established brand names in the industry.

DENTSPLY is committed to the development of innovative, high-quality, cost
        effective products for the dental market.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
        and all majority-owned subsidiaries in which the Company exercises control (collectively
        the “Company”). Investments in 20% to 50% owned companies in which the Company
        significantly influences operating and financial policy are accounted for by the equity
        method. The Company’s equity in the net income (loss) of these companies is not
        material. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in
        consolidation.

Use
        of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
        accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make
        estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
        the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial
        statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period.
        Actual results could differ from those estimates, if different assumptions are made or if
        different conditions exist.

Cash
        and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include deposits with banks as well as highly
        liquid time deposits with original maturities at the date of purchase of ninety days or
        less.

Short-term Investments

Short-term investments are highly liquid time deposits with original
        maturities at the date of purchase greater than ninety days and with remaining maturities
        of approximately one year or less.

Accounts and Notes Receivable-Trade

The Company sells dental products through a worldwide network of
        distributors and directly to end users. For customers on credit terms, the Company performs
        ongoing credit evaluation of those customers' financial condition and generally does not
        require collateral from them. The Company establishes allowances for doubtful accounts for
        estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments.
        Accounts and notes receivable-trade are stated net of these allowances that were $18.9
        million and $16.6 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company recorded
        provisions for doubtful accounts, included in “Selling, general and administrative
        expenses,” of approximately $2.7 million for 2007, $2.1 million for 2006, and $3.2
        million for 2005.

Certain of the Company’s customers are offered cash rebates based on
        targeted sales increases. In accounting for these rebate programs, the Company records an
        accrual as a reduction of net sales for the estimated rebate as sales take place throughout
        the year in accordance with EITF 01-09, “ Accounting for Consideration Given by a
        Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor's Products).”


Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. At December 31, 2007
        and 2006, the cost of $10.6 million, or 4.1%, and $11.2 million, or 4.8%, respectively, of
        inventories was determined by the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method. The cost
        of other inventories was determined by the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) or
        average cost methods. The Company establishes reserves for inventory estimated to be
        obsolete or unmarketable equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and
        estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market
        conditions.

If the FIFO method had been used to determine the cost of LIFO inventories,
        the amounts at which net inventories are stated would be higher than reported at December
        31, 2007 and 2006 by $4.4 million and $3.3 million, respectively.

Valuation of Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Other
        Long-Lived Assets

Assessment of the potential impairment of goodwill, indefinite-lived
        intangible assets and other long-lived assets is an integral part of the Company’s
        normal ongoing review of operations. Testing for potential impairment of these assets is
        significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management’s best
        estimates at a particular point in time. The dynamic economic environments in which the
        Company’s businesses operate and key economic and business assumptions with respect
        to projected selling prices, increased competition and introductions of new technologies
        can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests. Estimates based on these
        assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. Changes in factors and
        assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the
        existence and magnitude of impairments, as well as the time at which such impairments are
        recognized. If there are unfavorable changes in these environments or assumptions, future
        cash flows, the key variable in assessing the impairment of these assets, may decrease and
        as a result the Company may be required to recognize impairment charges. Future changes in
        the environment and the economic outlook for the assets being evaluated could also result
        in additional impairment charges being recognized. Information with respect to the
        Company’s significant accounting policies on long-lived assets for each category of
        long-lived asset is discussed below.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated
        depreciation. Except for leasehold improvements, depreciation for financial reporting
        purposes is computed by the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:
        buildings - generally 40 years and machinery and equipment - 4 to 15 years. The cost of
        leasehold improvements is amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the
        term of the lease. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations; replacements and
        major improvements are capitalized. These assets are reviewed for impairment whenever
        events or circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of the asset may not be
        recoverable in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144
        (“SFAS 144”), “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
        Assets.” Impairment is based upon an evaluation of the identifiable undiscounted cash
        flows. If impaired, the resulting charge reflects the excess of the asset’s carrying
        cost over its fair value.

Identifiable Finite-lived Intangible Assets

Identifiable finite-lived intangible assets, which primarily consist of
        patents, trademarks and licensing agreements, are amortized on a straight-line basis over
        their estimated useful lives. These assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
        circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable in
        accordance with SFAS 144. The Company closely monitors intangible assets related to new
        technology for indicators of impairment as these assets have more risk of becoming
        impaired. Impairment is based upon an evaluation of the identifiable undiscounted cash
        flows. If impaired, the resulting charge reflects the excess of the asset’s carrying
        cost over its fair value.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

The Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142
        (“SFAS 142”), “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” which
        requires that at least an annual impairment test be applied to goodwill and
        indefinite-lived intangible assets. The Company performs impairment tests on at least an
        annual basis using a fair value approach rather than an evaluation of the undiscounted cash
        flows. If impairment is identified on goodwill under SFAS 142, the resulting charge is
        determined by recalculating goodwill through a hypothetical purchase price allocation of
        the fair value and reducing the current carrying value to the extent it exceeds the
        recalculated goodwill. If impairment is identified on indefinite-lived intangibles, the
        resulting charge reflects the excess of the asset’s carrying cost over its fair
        value.

The Company performed the required annual impairment tests for 2007 and no
        impairment was identified. This impairment assessment included an evaluation of
        approximately twenty-five reporting units. In addition to the annual impairment test, SFAS
        142 also requires that impairment assessments be made more frequently if events or changes
        in circumstances indicate that the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets might be
        impaired. As the Company learns of such changes in circumstances through periodic analysis
        of actual events or through the annual development of operating unit business plans in the
        fourth quarter of each year or otherwise, impairment assessments are performed as
        necessary.


Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133
        (“SFAS 133”), “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
        Activities,” on January 1, 2001. This standard, as amended by Statement of Financial
        Accounting Standards No. 138 (“SFAS 138”), “Accounting for Certain
        Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities”, Statement of Financial
        Accounting Standards No. 149 (“SFAS 149”), “Amendment of Statement 133 on
        Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”, and Statement of Financial Accounting
        Standards No. 155 (“SFAS 155”), “Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial
        Instruments—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140”, requires that all
        derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value and that
        changes in fair value be recorded each period in current earnings or accumulated other
        comprehensive income.

The Company employs derivative financial instruments to hedge certain
        anticipated transactions, firm commitments, or assets and liabilities denominated in
        foreign currencies. Additionally, the Company utilizes interest rate swaps to convert
        floating rate debt to fixed rate, fixed rate debt to floating rate, cross currency basis
        swaps to convert debt denominated in one currency to another currency, and commodity swaps
        to fix its variable raw materials costs.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Substantially all of the employees of the Company and its subsidiaries are
        covered by government or Company-sponsored defined benefit or defined contribution plans.
        Additionally, certain union and salaried employee groups in the United States are covered
        by postretirement healthcare plans. Costs for Company-sponsored plans are based on expected
        return on plan assets, discount rates, employee compensation increase rates and health care
        cost trends. Expected return on plan assets, discount rates and health care cost trend
        assumptions are particularly important when determining the Company’s benefit
        obligations and net periodic benefit costs associated with postretirement benefits. Changes
        in these assumptions can impact the Company’s pretax earnings. In determining the
        cost of postretirement benefits, certain assumptions are established annually to reflect
        market conditions and plan experience to appropriately reflect the expected costs as
        actuarially determined. These assumptions include medical inflation trend rates, discount
        rates, employee turnover and mortality rates. The Company predominantly uses liability
        durations in establishing its discount rates, which are observed from indices of high-grade
        corporate bond yields in the respective economic regions of the plans. The expected return
        on plan assets is the weighted average long-term expected return based upon asset
        allocations and historic average returns for the markets where the assets are invested,
        principally in foreign locations. Additional information related to the impact of changes
        in these assumptions is provided in Note 13 to the consolidated financial
        statements.

The Company adopted FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
        No. 158 (“SFAS 158”), “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit
        Pension and Other Postretirement Plans” for December 31, 2006. SFAS 158, which is an
        amendment of SFAS No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R), requires the Company to report the funded
        status of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on its balance
        sheets as a net liability or asset. As allowed under SFAS 158, the Company computed the net
        benefit expense for the period from the early measurement date of September 30, 2006
        through December 31, 2007, which is the end of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company
        recognized three months of the net benefit expense as an adjustment to retained earnings in
        2007. The net of tax adjustment to retained earnings is $0.4 million (see also Note 13 to
        the consolidated financial statements).

Litigation

The Company and its subsidiaries are from time to time parties to lawsuits
        arising out of their respective operations. The Company records liabilities when a loss is
        probable and can be reasonably estimated. These estimates are made by management based on
        an analysis made by internal and external legal counsel, which consider information known
        at the time. Legal costs related to these lawsuits are expensed as incurred.

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currency for foreign operations, except for those in highly
        inflationary economies, has been determined to be the local currency.

Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated at exchange
        rates on the balance sheet date; revenue and expenses are translated at the average
        year-to-date rates of exchange. The effects of these translation adjustments are reported
        in stockholders' equity within accumulated other comprehensive income. During the year
        ended December 31, 2007, the Company had translation gains of $114.6 million, partially
        offset by losses of $8.4 million on its loans designated as hedges of net investments.
        During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company had translation gains of $89.0
        million, partially offset by losses of $9.9 million on its loans designated as hedges of
        net investments. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company had translation
        losses of $173.3 million, partially offset by gains of $50.1 million on its loans
        designated as hedges of net investments.


Exchange gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in a
        currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved and translation
        adjustments in countries with highly inflationary economies are included in income.
        Exchange gains of $0.5 million, exchange losses of $0.2 million and exchange gains of $6.7
        million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, are included in “Other (income)
        expense, net.”

Revenue Recognition

Revenue, net of related discounts and allowances, is recognized when the
        earnings process is complete. This occurs when products are shipped to or received by the
        customer in accordance with the terms of the agreement, title and risk of loss have been
        transferred, collectibility is probable and pricing is fixed or determinable. Net sales
        include shipping and handling costs collected from customers in connection with the sale.
        Sales taxes, value added taxes and other similar types of taxes collected from customers in
        connection with the sale are recorded by the Company on a net basis and are not included in
        the statement of income.

A portion of the Company’s net sales is comprised of sales of precious
        metals generated through its precious metal alloy product offerings. As the precious metal
        content of the Company’s sales is largely a pass-through to customers, the Company
        uses its cost of precious metal purchased as a proxy for the precious metal content of
        sales, as the precious metal content of sales is not separately tracked and invoiced to
        customers. The Company believes that it is reasonable to use the cost of precious metal
        content purchased in this manner since precious metal alloy sale prices are typically
        adjusted when the prices of underlying precious metals change. The precious metals content
        of sales was $189.9 million, $187.4 million and $172.4 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005,
        respectively.

Warranties

The Company provides warranties on certain equipment products. Estimated
        warranty costs are accrued when sales are made to customers. Estimates for warranty costs
        are based primarily on historical warranty claim experience.

Research and Development Costs

Research and development (“R&D”) costs relate primarily to
        internal costs for salaries and direct overhead costs. In addition, the Company contracts
        with outside vendors to conduct R&D activities. All such R&D costs are charged to
        expense when incurred. The Company capitalizes the costs of equipment that have general
        R&D uses and expenses such equipment that is solely for specific R&D projects. The
        depreciation related to this capitalized equipment is included in the Company’s
        R&D costs. R&D costs are included in “Selling, general and administrative
        expenses” and amounted to approximately $48.5 million, $44.4 million and $47.0
        million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are determined using the liability method of accounting for
        income taxes in accordance with SFAS 109. Under SFAS 109, tax expense includes United
        States and international income taxes plus the provision for United States taxes on
        undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested.
        Tax credits and other incentives reduce tax expense in the year the credits are claimed.
        Certain items of income and expense are not reported in tax returns and financial
        statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as
        deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not
        that the assets will be realized in future years. The Company establishes a valuation
        allowance for deferred tax assets for which realization is not likely.

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
        issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN 48”), “Accounting for Uncertainty
        in Income Taxes - an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income
        Taxes,” which clarifies the accounting for income taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a
        recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and
        measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The
        Interpretation requires that the Company recognize in the financial statements, the impact
        of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit,
        based on the technical merits of the position. FIN 48 also provides guidance on
        derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and
        disclosure.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net earnings by the
        weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share is
        calculated by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares outstanding
        for the period, adjusted for the effect of an assumed exercise of all dilutive options
        outstanding at the end of the period.


Business
        Acquisitions

The Company frequently purchases businesses and occasionally purchases
        partial interests in businesses. These acquisitions are accounted for as purchases and
        result in the recognition of goodwill in the Company’s financial statements. This
        goodwill arises because the purchase prices for these businesses reflect a number of
        factors including the future earnings and cash flow potential of these businesses; the
        multiple to earnings, cash flow and other factors at which similar businesses have been
        purchased by other acquirers; the competitive nature of the process by which the Company
        acquired the business; and because of the complementary strategic fit and expected
        synergies these businesses bring to existing operations.

The Company makes an initial allocation of the purchase price at the date of
        acquisition based upon its understanding of the fair market value of the acquired assets
        and liabilities. The Company obtains this information during due diligence and through
        other sources. In the months after closing, as the Company obtains additional information
        about these assets and liabilities and learns more about the newly acquired business, it is
        able to refine the estimates of fair market value and more accurately allocate the purchase
        price. Examples of factors and information that the Company uses to refine the allocations
        include: tangible and intangible asset evaluations and appraisals; evaluations of existing
        contingencies and liabilities; product line integration information; and information
        systems compatibilities. The only items considered for subsequent adjustment are items
        identified as of the acquisition date. Subsequent to the purchase date, the Company
        continues to evaluate the initial purchase price allocations for the acquisitions and will
        adjust the allocations as additional information relative to the estimated integration
        costs of the acquired businesses and the fair market values of the assets and liabilities
        of the businesses become known. These purchase price adjustments can occur for up to one
        year from the acquisition date.

Stock
        Compensation

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS
        123(R), “Share-Based Payments,” requiring that compensation cost relating to
        share-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements. The cost of
        share-based payments is measured at the grant date, based on the calculated fair value of
        the award, and is recognized as an expense over the employee’s requisite service
        period (generally the vesting period of the equity awards). The compensation cost is only
        recognized for the portion of the awards that are expected to vest. Prior to January 1,
        2006, the Company applied the intrinsic value method and accounted for share-based
        compensation to employees in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25
        (“APB 25”), “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related
        interpretations. The Company also followed the disclosure requirements of Statement of
        Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (“SFAS 123”), “Accounting for
        Stock-Based Compensation,” as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
        No. 148 (“SFAS 148”), “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition
        and Disclosure.”

The Company adopted SFAS 123(R) using the modified prospective method and,
        accordingly, the consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods ended December
        31, 2006 reflect the impact of adopting SFAS 123(R). Also in accordance with the
        modified prospective method of adoption, the financial statement amounts for periods prior
        to January 1, 2006 presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have not been restated to
        reflect the fair value method of recognizing compensation cost relating to non-qualified
        stock options.

In addition to the requirement to recognize compensation cost for those
        awards granted subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), SFAS 123(R) also requires that
        stock-based compensation be recognized for stock-based awards granted prior to the adoption
        of SFAS 123(R), but not yet vested as of the date of adoption. This compensation cost is
        based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of
        SFAS 148 and SFAS 123.

SFAS 123(R) also amended SFAS No. 95 (“SFAS No. 95”),
        “Statement of Cash Flows,” to require that excess tax benefits from exercised
        options be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid.
        Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), the Company recorded all tax benefits from deductions
        in excess of compensation expense as an operating cash flow in accordance with SFAS No. 95.
        Upon the adoption of SFAS 123(R) on January 1, 2006, the Company began to reflect the tax
        benefits from deductions in excess of compensation expense as an inflow from financing
        activities in the Statement of Cash Flows rather than as an operating cash flow as in prior
        periods. As the Company has adopted SFAS 123(R) using the modified prospective method, no
        adjustment has been made to the prior period reported in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
        (see also Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements)

Segment Reporting

The Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131
        (“SFAS 131”), “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
        Information.” SFAS 131 establishes standards for disclosing information about
        reportable segments in financial statements. The Company has numerous operating businesses
        covering a wide range of products and geographic regions, primarily serving the
        professional dental market. Professional dental products represented approximately 97% of
        sales in 2007, 2006 and 2005. In 2007, the Company had four reportable segments and a
        description of the activities of these segments is included in Note 4 to the consolidated
        financial statements.


Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) includes foreign currency
        translation adjustments related to the Company’s foreign subsidiaries, net of the
        related changes in certain financial instruments hedging these foreign currency
        investments. In addition, changes in the fair value of the Company’s
        available-for-sale investment securities and certain derivative financial instruments and
        changes in its minimum pension liability are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
        income (loss). These changes are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
        net of any related tax effects. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, these
        adjustments were net of tax effects of $111.3 million, $73.6 million and $48.1 million,
        respectively, primarily related to foreign currency translation adjustments.

The balances included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the
        consolidated balance sheets are as follows:

The cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments included translation
        gains of $331.1 million and $216.4 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively,
        offset by losses of $90.0 million and $81.6 million, respectively, on loans designated as
        hedges of net investments.

Revisions in Classification

Certain revisions of classification have been made to prior years' data in
        order to conform to current year presentation.

Cost
        of Sales

Cost of sales represents costs directly related to the manufacture and
        distribution of the Company’s products. Primary costs include raw materials,
        packaging, direct labor, overhead, shipping and handling, warehousing and the depreciation
        of manufacturing, warehousing and distribution facilities. Overhead and related expenses
        include salaries, wages, employee benefits, utilities, lease costs, maintenance and
        property taxes.

Selling, General and Administrative

Selling, general and administrative expenses represent costs incurred in
        generating revenues and in managing the business of the Company. Such costs include
        advertising and other marketing expenses, salaries, employee benefits, incentive
        compensation, research and development, travel, office expenses, lease costs, amortization
        of capitalized software and depreciation of administrative facilities.

New
        Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
        Standards No. 141(R) (“SFAS 141(R)”), “Business Combinations.” SFAS
        141(R) provides greater consistency in the accounting and financial reporting of business
        combinations. It requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all
        assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction, establishes the
        acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and
        liabilities assumed, and requires the acquirer to disclose the nature and financial effect
        of the business combination. SFAS 141(R) is effective for fiscal years beginning after
        December 15, 2008. The Company will adopt SFAS 141(R) in the first quarter of fiscal year
        2009 and is currently evaluating the impact the adoption will have on the Company’s
        financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
        Standards No. 160 (“SFAS 160”), “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated
        Financial Statements.” This Statement amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51,
        “Consolidated Financial Statements,” to establish accounting and reporting
        standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a
        subsidiary. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The
        Company will adopt SFAS 160 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 and is currently
        evaluating the impact the adoption will have on the Company’s financial
        statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
        Standards No. 159 (“SFAS 159”), “The Fair Value Option for Financial
        Assets and Financial Liabilities.” SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure
        financial instruments and certain other items at


fair
        value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. This will allow
        entities the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring
        related assets and liabilities differently. SFAS 159 is effective for financial statements
        issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Statement should not be
        applied retrospectively to fiscal years beginning prior to that effective date, except as
        permitted for early adoption The Company is still evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS
        159 on the financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157 (“SFAS 157”),
        “Fair Value Measurements,” which requires the Company to define fair value,
        establish a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles
        (GAAP), and expand disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement applies under
        other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value
        measurements. Accordingly, this Statement does not expand the use of fair value to any
        new circumstances. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
        beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The
        Company is still evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 157 on the financial
        statements.

NOTE 2 -
        EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

On May 10, 2006, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared
        a two-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend. This stock split became
        effective on July 17, 2006 and has been retroactively reflected for all periods presented
        in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings
        per common share:

        respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share since the
        options' exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the common shares
        and, therefore, the effect would be antidilutive.


NOTE 3 -
        BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS

The Company accounts for all acquisitions under the purchase method of
        accounting; accordingly, the results of the operations acquired are included in the
        accompanying financial statements for the periods subsequent to the respective dates of the
        acquisitions.

During 2007, the Company acquired Sultan Healthcare, Inc., DFT Dis Hekimligi
        Irunleri A.S. Ata Anil (“DFT”), NEKS Technologies, Inc., TMV Medica SA and
        Sportswire LLC. The Company purchased Sultan Healthcare, Inc. and NEKS Technologies to
        further strengthen its dental consumable business through product offerings. The Company
        purchased Sportswire LLC, DFT and TMV Medica SA to further strengthen its dental specialty
        business. As a result of the acquisitions, the Company expects a range of $50.0 million to
        $65.0 million in incremental annual sales, excluding precious metal content. The aggregate
        purchase price, net of cash acquired, was $97.2 million.

The following list provides information about the acquired
        companies:

•

Sultan Healthcare, Inc., based in New Jersey, is a well-known
                    United States dental consumable manufacturer recognized primarily for infection
                    control products, dental materials and preventive products;

•

DFT Dis Hekimligi Urunleri A.S. Ata Anil (“DFT”) is
                    a sales and marketing organization for implant products in Turkey;

•

NEKS Technologies, Inc. is a dental equipment manufacturer in
                    Quebec, Canada, which develops and commercializes proprietary, non-invasive,
                    handheld dental instruments for early diagnosis of pathologies;

•

TMV Medica SA is a sales and marketing organization for implant
                    products in Spain; and

•

Sportswire LLC is a manufacturer of endodontic materials based
                    in Oklahoma.

The results of operations for the five businesses have been included in the
        accompanying financial statements since the effective date of the respective transaction.
        The purchase prices of these acquisitions have been allocated based on estimates of fair
        values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The aggregate purchase price allocation
        for these acquisitions is as follows (in thousands):

Current assets

$ 17,031

Property, plant and equipment

2,265

Identifiable intangible assets and goodwill

85,978

Other long-term assets


Total assets

$ 105,502

Current liabilities

(7,877)

Long-term liabilities

(418)

Total liabilities

$ (8,295)

Net assets

$ 97,207

As a result of the 2007 acquisitions, the Company has recorded a total of
        $9.8 million in intangible assets. Of this total amount of intangible assets, $7.9 million
        was recorded as trademarks and brand names with an average weighted life of 15 years, and
        $1.9 million was allocated to other intangible assets with an average weighted life of 18
        years.

The Company has recorded a total of $76.2 million in goodwill related to the
        unallocated portions of the respective purchase prices. Of this total amount of goodwill,
        $73.9 million is expected to be fully deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill was assigned to
        the following three segments:

•

$65.6 million to United States, Germany, and Certain Other
                    European Regions Consumable Businesses;

•

$8.3 million Canada/ Latin America/ Endodontics/ Orthodontics;
                    and,

•

$2.3 million to Global Dental Laboratory Business/
                    Implants/Non-Dental.

The purchase agreements for the Sultan Healthcare, Inc., NEKS Technologies,
        Inc. and DFT acquisitions provide for additional payments to be made based upon the
        operating performance of the businesses.

Several of the Company’s 2005 acquisitions included provisions for
        possible additional payments based on the performance of the individual businesses post
        closing (generally for two to three years). During 2007, the Company paid $8.3 million in
        additional purchase price under these agreements. Additionally in 2007, the Company
        recorded $2.1 million in additional purchase price as a result of the attainment of certain
        provisions within the purchase price agreements. This amount was paid in 2008.


During 2006, the Company acquired a small dental business in Asia, an
        implant distribution business in Italy, and the remaining 40% interest of a dental
        manufacturing business in Brazil (the Company had owned 60% of this business since 2001).
        The aggregate purchase price for these three transactions was approximately $6.6 million
        (net of cash acquired of $0.3 million). The purchase agreement for the business in Asia
        also provides for an additional payment to be made based upon the operating performance of
        the business during the five-year period ending in February 2011. The results of operations
        for the Asian and Italian businesses have been included in the accompanying financial
        statements since the effective date of the transactions, and the purchase prices have been
        allocated based on preliminary estimates of the fair values of assets acquired and
        liabilities assumed. As the Company had previously owned a controlling 60% interest in the
        Brazilian business, the balance sheet and the results of operations of that business have
        been consolidated in the Company’s financial statements since 2001, with the
        resulting immaterial minority interest in net income or net loss being removed through
        Other (income) expense, net and the minority share of equity being shown on the balance
        sheet in Minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries.

During 2006, the Company also acquired a 40% interest in Materialise Dental
        N.V. (“Materialise"), a simulation software company and a leading manufacture of a
        variety of surgical guides to assist in the placement of dental implants. The 40% interest
        was purchased for approximately $25.5 million and the transaction provides the opportunity
        for the Company to acquire the remaining 60% interest over time. The Company will account
        for this investment under the equity method due to the Company’s ability to exercise
        significant influence over operational and financial policy, as evidenced by the Company
        assuming two Director seats of Materialise. As required by APB 18, “The Equity Method
        of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock,” the difference between the cost of an
        equity investment and the underlying equity in the net assets of the investee should be
        accounted for according to its nature. As such, the Company has determined the difference
        between the cost of the investment in Materialise and the Company’s proportionate
        share of the underlying equity in the net assets of Materialise, and has evaluated this
        difference to determine its nature. Based on this evaluation, the Company has determined
        that the investment in Materialise exceeds the Company’s underlying equity in the net
        assets by approximately $24.5 million, of which $2.8 million is attributable primarily to
        patents and other intangible assets, with the remainder being attributable to goodwill. The
        amount attributable to patents and other intangible assets will be amortized over five to
        nine years, which is the estimated useful life of the underlying assets. The
        Company’s equity in the net income (loss) of Materialise is not material and is
        included in “Other (income) expense, net.”

The Company has evaluated its investment in Materialise in accordance with
        the provisions in FASB Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest
        Entities,” and has determined that the Company should not consolidate Materialise.
        The Company will continue to evaluate its investment in Materialise under the provisions of
        FIN 46, which may result in the future consolidation of Materialise by the
        Company.

In January 2005, the Company acquired all the outstanding capital stock of
        GAC SA from the Gebroulaz Foundation. GAC SA is primarily a distributor of orthodontic
        products with subsidiaries in Switzerland, France, Germany and Norway. The Company
        purchased GAC SA primarily to further strengthen its orthodontic business through the
        acquired company's presence in the orthodontic market in Europe. In May 2005, the Company
        acquired the assets of Raintree Essix, L.L.C. (“Raintree”). Raintree is a brand
        leader for specialty plastic sheets used in orthodontic treatment, as well as other
        accessories for the orthodontic market. The Company purchased Raintree primarily to further
        strengthen its orthodontic product offerings. In May 2005, the Company also acquired all
        the outstanding capital stock of Glenroe Technologies, Inc. (“Glenroe”).
        Glenroe is a manufacturer of orthodontic accessory products including elastic force
        materials, specialty plastics and intricate molded plastic parts. The Company purchased
        Glenroe primarily to further strengthen its orthodontic product offerings. The above
        described transactions included aggregate payments at closing of approximately $18.1
        million (net of cash acquired of $2.7 million). Each transaction included provisions for
        possible additional payments based on the performance of the individual businesses post
        closing (generally for two to three years). All of these acquired companies are included in
        the “Canada/ Latin America/ Endodontics/ Orthodontics “ operating
        segment.

The results of operations of the acquired companies are included in the
        accompanying financial statements since the effective dates of the transactions. The
        purchase price of these acquisitions has been allocated on the basis of estimates of the
        fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The aggregate purchase price

NOTE 4 -
        SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

Segment Information

The operating businesses are combined into operating groups which have
        overlapping product offerings, geographical presence, customer bases, distribution channels
        and regulatory oversight. These operating groups are considered the Company's reportable
        segments under SFAS 131 as the Company's chief operating decision-maker regularly reviews
        financial results at the operating group level and uses this information to manage the
        Company's operations. The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those
        described for the consolidated financial statements in the summary of significant
        accounting policies (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements). The Company
        measures segment income for reporting purposes as net operating profit before
        restructuring, impairment, interest and taxes. A description of the services provided
        within each of the Company’s four reportable segments is provided below. The
        disclosure below reflects the Company's segment reporting structure through December 31,
        2007.

A description of the activities of the Company’s four reportable
        segments follows:

United States, Germany, and Certain Other European Regions Consumable
        Businesses

This business group includes responsibility for the design, manufacturing,
        sales and distribution for certain small equipment and chairside consumable products in the
        United States, Germany and certain other European regions.

France, United Kingdom, Italy, CIS, Middle East, Africa, Pacific Rim
        Businesses

This business group includes responsibility for the sales and distribution
        for chairside consumable products and certain small equipment, certain laboratory products
        and certain endodontic products in France, United Kingdom, Italy, CIS, Middle East, Africa,
        Asia, Japan and Australia, as well as the sale and distribution of implant products and
        bone substitute/grafting materials in Italy, Asia and Australia. This business group also
        includes the manufacturing and sale of orthodontic products and the manufacturing of
        certain laboratory products in Japan, and the manufacturing of certain laboratory
        products and certain endodontic products in Asia.

Canada/Latin America/Endodontics/Orthodontics

This business group includes responsibility for the design, manufacture
        and/or sales and distribution of chairside consumable and laboratory products in Brazil. It
        also has responsibility for the sales and distribution of most Company dental products sold
        in Latin America and Canada. This business group also includes the responsibility for the
        design and manufacturing for endodontic products in the United States, Switzerland and
        Germany and is responsible for sales and distribution of certain Company endodontic
        products in the United States, Canada, Switzerland, Benelux, Scandinavia and Eastern
        Europe, and certain endodontic products in Germany. This business group is also responsible
        for the world-wide sales and distribution, excluding Japan, as well as some manufacturing
        of the Company’s orthodontic products. This business group is also responsible for
        sales and distribution in the United States for implant and bone substitute/grafting
        materials and the distribution of implants in Brazil.

Global Dental Laboratory Business/Implants/Non-Dental

This business group includes the responsibility for the design, manufacture,
        world-wide sales and distribution for laboratory products, excluding certain laboratory
        products mentioned earlier, and the design, manufacture and/or sales and distribution of
        the Company’s dental implant products and bone substitute/grafting materials,
        excluding sales and distribution of implants and bone substitute/grafting materials in the
        United States, Italy, Asia, Australia and sales and distribution of implants in Brazil.
        This business group is also responsible for the Company’s non-dental
        business.

Significant interdependencies exist among the Company's operations in
        certain geographic areas. Inter-group sales are at prices intended to provide a reasonable
        profit to the manufacturing unit after recovery of all manufacturing costs and to provide a
        reasonable profit for purchasing locations after coverage of selling, general and
        administrative costs.

Generally, the Company evaluates performance of the operating groups based
        on the groups' operating income and net third party sales, excluding precious metal
        content. The Company considers net third party sales, excluding precious metal content, as
        the appropriate sales measurement due to the fluctuations of precious metal prices and due
        to the fact that the precious metal content is largely a pass-through to customers and has
        minimal effect on earnings.


The following table sets forth information about the Company’s
        operating groups for 2007, 2006 and 2005.

Dental consumable products consist of dental sundries and small equipment
        products used in dental offices in the treatment of patients. DENTSPLY’s products in
        this category include dental anesthetics, infection control products, prophylaxis paste,
        dental sealants, impression materials, restorative materials, bone grafting materials,
        tooth whiteners and topical fluoride. The Company manufactures thousands of different
        consumable products marketed under more than a hundred brand names. Small equipment
        products consist of various durable goods used in dental offices for treatment of patients.
        DENTSPLY’s small equipment products include high and low speed handpieces, intraoral
        curing light systems and ultrasonic scalers and polishers.

Dental laboratory products are used in dental laboratories in the
        preparation of dental appliances. DENTSPLY’s products in this category include dental
        prosthetics, including artificial teeth, precious metal dental alloys, dental ceramics,
        crown and bridge materials, and equipment products used in laboratories consisting of
        computer aided machining (CAM) ceramic systems and porcelain furnaces.

Dental specialty products are specialized treatment products used within the
        dental office and laboratory settings. DENTSPLY’s products in this category include
        endodontic (root canal) instruments and materials, implants and related products, and
        orthodontic appliances and accessories.

NOTE 8
        – GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

The Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142
        (“SFAS 142”), “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” This
        statement requires that the amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets
        be discontinued and instead an annual impairment test approach be applied. The impairment
        tests are required to be performed annually (or more often if events or changes in
        circumstances indicate that the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets might be
        impaired) and are based upon a fair value approach rather than an evaluation of
        undiscounted cash flows. If goodwill impairment is identified, the resulting charge is
        determined by recalculating goodwill through a hypothetical purchase price allocation of
        the fair value and reducing the current carrying value to the extent it exceeds the
        recalculated goodwill. If impairment is identified on indefinite-lived intangibles, the
        resulting charge reflects the excess of the asset’s carrying cost over its fair
        value. Other intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful
        lives.

The Company performed the required annual impairment tests of goodwill and
        indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2007. No impairment of goodwill was identified and
        $0.2 million of impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets was identified. This
        impairment assessment included an evaluation of approximately twenty-five reporting units.
        In addition to minimum annual impairment tests, SFAS 142 also requires that impairment
        assessments be made more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
        goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets might be impaired. As the Company learns of
        such changes in circumstances through periodic analysis of actual results or through the
        annual development of operating unit business plans in the fourth quarter of each year, for
        example, impairment assessments will be performed as necessary.

The change in the net carrying value of goodwill from 2006 to 2007 was due
        to foreign currency translation adjustments, five acquisitions, additional payments based
        on the performance of the previously acquired businesses, and changes to the purchase price
        allocations of the Degussa Dental and Friadent acquisitions. The purchase price allocation
        changes were primarily related to the reversal of pre-acquisition tax contingencies due to
        expiring statutes.

NOTE 10 - FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS

Short-Term Borrowings

Short-term bank borrowings amounted to $1.1 million and $2.8 million at
        December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The weighted average interest rates of these
        borrowings were 3.4% and 14.0% at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Unused lines of
        credit for short-term financing at December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $34.8 million and $26.4
        million, respectively. Substantially all other short-term borrowings were classified as
        long-term as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, reflecting the Company's intent and ability to
        refinance these obligations beyond one year and are included in the table below. The unused
        lines of credit have no major restrictions and are provided under demand notes between the
        Company and the lending institution. Interest is charged on borrowings under these lines of
        credit at various rates, generally below prime or equivalent money rates.

        Company has the intent and ability to extend them until the expiration date of the
        agreement, these borrowings are considered contractually due in May 2010.

The Company utilizes interest rate swaps to convert the variable rate
        Japanese yen and Swiss franc denominated debt under the revolving facility to fixed rate
        debt. The Company utilizes interest rate swaps to convert the variable rate U.S. dollar
        denominated private placement notes to fixed rate debt. The Company's use of interest rate
        swaps is further described in Note 15 – Financial Instruments and Derivatives to the
        consolidated financial statements.


The Company
        has a $500 million revolving credit agreement with participation from thirteen banks. The
        revolving credit agreements contain a number of covenants and two financial ratios which
        the Company is required to satisfy. The most restrictive of these covenants pertain to
        asset dispositions and prescribed ratios of indebtedness to total capital and operating
        income excluding depreciation and amortization to interest expense. Any breach of any such
        covenants or restrictions would result in a default under the existing borrowing
        documentation that would permit the lenders to declare all borrowings under such
        documentation to be immediately due and payable and, through cross default provisions,
        would entitle the Company's other lenders to accelerate their loans. At December 31, 2007,
        the Company was in compliance with these covenants. The Company pays a facility fee of
        0.10% annually on the amount of the commitment under the $500 million five year facility.
        The entire $500 million revolving credit agreement has a usage fee of 0.10% annually if
        utilization exceeds 50% of the total available facility. Interest rates on amounts borrowed
        under the facility will depend on the maturity of the borrowing, the currency borrowed, the
        interest rate option selected, and the Company’s long-term credit rating from
        Standard and Poor’s.

The Company has complementary U.S. dollar and Euro multicurrency commercial
        paper facilities totaling $250 million which have utilization, dealer and annual appraisal
        fees which on average cost 0.11% annually. The $500 million revolving credit facility acts
        as back-up credit to these commercial paper facilities. The total available credit under
        the commercial paper facilities and the revolving credit facility is $500 million.
        Outstanding commercial paper and revolving credit obligations were $106.1 million and
        $225.0 million, respectively, at December 31, 2007.

On March 13, 2007, the Company entered into a note purchase agreement with a
        group of initial purchasers, providing for the issuance of $150.0 million aggregate
        principal amount of floating rate senior notes due 2010 (the “Notes”) through a
        private placement. The net proceeds from the offering after deducting placement fees and
        expenses of the offering were $149.5 million. The obligations of DENTSPLY and the initial
        purchasers are subject to the terms and conditions of the Note Purchase
        Agreement.

At December 31, 2007, the Company had total unused lines of credit,
        including lines available under its short-term arrangements and revolving credit agreement,
        of $203.7 million.

In March 2001, the Company issued Series A and B private placement notes to
        Prudential Capital Group totaling Swiss francs 166.9 million at an average rate of 4.49%
        with six year final maturities. In October 2001, the Company issued a Series C private
        placement note to Prudential Capital Group for Swiss francs 80.4 million at a rate of 4.96%
        with a five year final maturity. The series A and B notes were also amended in October 2001
        to increase the interest rate by 30 basis points, reflecting the Company’s higher
        leverage. The private placement notes contain a number of covenants and two financial
        ratios which the Company is required to satisfy. The most restrictive of these covenants
        pertain to asset dispositions, maintenance of certain levels of net worth, and prescribed
        ratios of indebtedness to total capital and operating income excluding depreciation and
        amortization to interest expense. In December 2001, the Company issued a private placement
        note through ABN AMRO for Japanese yen 6.2 billion at a rate of 1.39% with a four year
        final maturity. The Series C note and the ABN note were issued to partially finance the
        Degussa Dental acquisition. The Company has completely retired the ABN note. The Company
        has completely retired the Series A, B and C notes.


NOTE 11
        - STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

The Board of Directors has authorized the Company to repurchase shares under
        its stock repurchase program in an amount up to 14,000,000 shares of treasury stock. Under
        its stock repurchase program, the Company purchased 3,389,969 shares during 2007 at an
        average price of $37.00. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company held 11,953,884 and
        10,984,633 shares of treasury stock, respectively. During 2007, the Company repurchased
        $125.4 million in treasury stock. The Company also received proceeds of $45.6 million
        primarily as a result of the exercise of 2,342,965 stock options during the year ended
        December 31, 2007.

The Company has stock options outstanding under three stock option plans
        (1993 Plan, 1998 Plan and 2002 Amended and Restated Plan (“the 2002 Plan”)).
        Further grants can only be made under the 2002 Plan. Under the 1993 and 1998 Plans, a
        committee appointed by the Board of Directors granted to key employees and directors of the
        Company, options to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price determined by the
        fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Stock options generally expire
        ten years after the date of grant under these plans and grants become exercisable over a
        period of three years after the date of grant at the rate of one-third per year, except
        that they become immediately exercisable upon death, disability or qualified
        retirement.

Effective May 15, 2007, the stockholders of the Company approved an
        amendment to the 2002 Plan. The purpose of the amendment was to eliminate the automatic
        stock option grants to outside directors and include performance criteria with respect to
        the grant of performance-based restricted stock and restricted stock units. Under the
        amended 2002 Plan, no more than 2,000,000 shares may be awarded as restricted stock and
        restricted stock units, and no key employee may be granted restricted stock units in excess
        of 150,000 shares of common stock in any calendar year

The 2002 Plan authorized grants of 14,000,000 shares of common stock, plus
        any unexercised portion of cancelled or terminated stock options granted under the DENTSPLY
        International Inc. 1993 and 1998 Plans, subject to adjustment as follows: each January, if
        7% of the outstanding common shares of the Company exceed 14,000,000, the excess becomes
        available for grant under the Plan. The 2002 Plan enables the Company to grant
        “incentive stock options” (“ISOs”) within the meaning of Section
        422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, to key employees of the Company, and
        “non-qualified stock options” (“NSOs”), which do not constitute
        ISOs to key employees and non-employee directors of the Company. The 2002 Plan also enables
        the Company to grant stock, which is subject to certain forfeiture risks and restrictions
        (“Restricted Stock”), stock delivered upon vesting of units (“Restricted
        Stock Units” or “RSUs”) and stock appreciation rights
        (“SARs”). ISOs and NSOs are collectively referred to as “options.”
        Options, Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units and SARs are collectively referred to as
        “awards.” Such awards are granted at exercise prices not less than the fair
        market value of the common stock on the date of grant. The number of shares available for
        grant under the 2002 Plan as of December 31, 2007 was 5,493,563.

Non-Qualified Stock Options

The total compensation cost related to non-qualified stock options
        recognized in the operating results for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was
        $11.2 million and $19.6 million, respectively. These amounts represent the aggregate fair
        value of options vested during 2007 and 2006, including stock-based awards granted prior to
        January 1, 2007 and 2006, but not yet vested as of that date. These costs were allocated
        appropriately to either the cost of products sold or selling, general and administrative
        expenses. The associated future


income tax
        benefit recognized during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $6.7 million and
        $5.3 million, respectively.

There were 2,936,121 non-qualified stock options unvested as of December 31,
        2007. The remaining unamortized compensation cost related to non-qualified stock options is
        $22.4 million which will be expensed over the weighted average remaining vesting period of
        the options, or 1.7 years. Cash received from stock option exercises for the years ended
        December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $45.6 million and $53.6 million, respectively. It is the
        Company’s practice to issue shares from treasury stock when options are exercised.
        The future estimated cash tax benefit to be realized for the options exercised in the years
        ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $13.5 million and $18.9 million, respectively.
         The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended
        December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $41.1 million and $53.6 million, respectively. The aggregate
        intrinsic value of the outstanding stock options as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 was
        $192.3 million and $83.0 million, respectively.

Under SFAS 123(R), the Company continues to use the Black-Scholes
        option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of each option awarded. The following table
        sets forth the assumptions used to determine compensation cost for the Company’s
        non-qualified stock options issued during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and
        2005:

Substantially all stock options issued during the year ended December 31,
        2005 were issued with an exercise price that was equal to the market value of the
        underlying stock at the grant date. As a result, under APB No. 25, there was no
        compensation recognized for these shares. The following table sets forth pro forma
        information for these shares as if compensation cost had been determined consistent with
        the requirements of SFAS No. 123 for the year ended December 31, 2005:

In addition to those shares issued during the year ended December 31, 2005
        that had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying stock at the grant
        date, the Company also issued a limited number of non-qualified stock options that had an
        exercise price less than the market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. As a
        result, under APB No. 25, compensation cost of $1.0 million related to non-qualified stock
        options was recognized in the operating results for the year ended December 31,
        2005.

Restricted Stock Units

During 2007, the Company granted a total of 223,100 RSUs to key employees
        and Board members. As of December 31, 2007, a total of 13,090 RSUs were cancelled and
        210,010 RSUs remained outstanding. The RSUs outstanding have a weighted-average fair value
        per share of $30.99, which was the fair value of the Company’s stock as measured on
        the date of grant. RSUs vest 100% on the third anniversary of the date of grant and are
        subject to a service condition, which requires grantees to remain employed by the Company
        during the three year period following the date of grant. In addition to the service
        condition, certain key executives are subject to performance requirements. The fair value
        of each RSU assumes that performance goals will be achieved. If such goals are not met, no
        compensation cost is recognized and any recognized compensation cost is reversed. Under the
        terms of the RSUs, the three year period is referred to as the restricted period. RSUs and
        the rights under the award may not be sold, assigned, transferred, donated, pledged or
        otherwise disposed of during the three year restricted period prior to vesting. Upon the
        expiration of the applicable restricted period and the satisfaction of all conditions
        imposed, all restrictions imposed on Restricted Stock Units will lapse, and one share of
        common stock will be issued as payment for each vested RSU.

During the restricted period, the Company will pay cash dividends on the
        RSUs, in the form of additional RSUs on each date that the Company pays a cash dividend to
        holders of common stock. The additional RSUs are subject to the same terms and conditions
        as the original RSUs and vest when the restrictions lapse.

The total compensation cost related to RSUs recognized in the operating
        results for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $1.7 million. These amounts represent the
        aggregate fair value of stock units that were expensed during 2007, but not yet vested as
        of that date. These costs were included in the cost of products sold and selling, general
        and administrative expenses. The associated future income tax benefit recognized during the
        year ended December 31, 2007 was $0.5 million, respectively. All 210,666 RSUs and RSU
        dividends remained unvested as of December 31, 2007. The unamortized compensation cost
        related to RSUs is $4.4 million, which will be expensed over the remaining restricted
        period of the RSUs, or 2.1 years. The aggregate intrinsic value of the outstanding RSUs as
        of December 31, 2007 was $9.5 million.

The Company has $ 32.6 million of foreign tax credit carryforwards. $ 15.3
        million, $ 7.2 million and $ 10.1 million will expire in 2015, 2016 and 2017
        respectively.

Certain foreign and domestic subsidiaries of the Company have tax loss
        carryforwards of $594.7 million at December 31, 2007, of which $488.3 million expire
        through 2027 and $106.4 million may be carried forward indefinitely. The tax benefit of
        certain tax loss carryforwards and deferred tax assets has been offset by a valuation
        allowance as of December 31, 2007, because it is uncertain whether the benefits will be
        realized in the future. The valuation allowance at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $50.3
        million and $49.4 million, respectively.

The Company has provided federal income taxes on certain undistributed
        earnings of its foreign subsidiaries that the Company anticipates will be repatriated.
        Deferred federal income taxes have not been provided on $347.1 million of cumulative
        earnings of foreign subsidiaries that the Company has determined to be permanently
        reinvested. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable on
        these permanently reinvested earnings.

Tax
        Contingencies

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
        issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN 48”), “Accounting for Uncertainty
        in Income Taxes - an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income
        Taxes,” which clarifies the accounting for income taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a
        recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and
        measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be


taken in
        a tax return. The Interpretation requires that the Company recognize in the financial
        statements, the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being
        sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. FIN 48 also provides
        guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
        periods and disclosure. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective beginning January 1,
        2007 with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an
        adjustment to opening retained earnings. As a result of the implementation the Company
        recognized a $3.8 million increase to reserves for uncertain tax positions.

The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, as of the date of
        adoption, is approximately $48.7 million. Of this total, approximately $37.8 million (net
        of the federal benefit of state issues) represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits
        that, if recognized, would affect the effective income tax rate. It is reasonably possible
        that certain amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease
        within 12 months of the reporting date of the Company’s consolidated financial
        statements. Expiration of statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions could include
        unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $ 3.8 million, $0.1 million of which will have
        no impact upon the effective income tax rate. A decrease of unrecognized tax benefits of
        approximately $ 11.0 million, $5.3 million of which will have no impact upon the effective
        income tax rate could occur as a result of final settlement and resolution of outstanding
        tax matters in foreign jurisdictions during the next twelve months.

The total amounts of interest and penalties, as of the date of adoption,
        were $7.9 million and $3.9 million, respectively. At December 31, 2007, the total amounts
        of interest and penalties were $10.9 million and $3.6 million, respectively. The Company
        has consistently classified interest and penalties recognized in its consolidated financial
        statements as income taxes based on the accounting policy election of the
        Company.

The Company is subject to United States federal income tax as well as income
        tax of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. The significant jurisdictions include the
        United States, Switzerland and Germany. The Company has substantially concluded all United
        States federal income tax matters for years through 2003, resulting in the years 2004
        through 2007 being subject to future potential tax audit adjustments. The Company is under
        audit for United States Federal Income Tax purposes for the tax year 2005 and for Germany
        from 2001 through 2003. The taxable years that remain open for Switzerland are years 1997
        through 2007. For Germany the open years are from 2000 through 2007.

The Company had the following activity recorded for unrecognized tax

NOTE
        13 - BENEFIT PLANS

Substantially all of the employees of the Company and its subsidiaries are
        covered by government or Company-sponsored benefit plans. Total costs for Company-sponsored
        defined benefit, defined contribution and employee stock ownership plans amounted to $20.9
        million in 2007, $19.2 million in 2006 and $17.7 million in 2005.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158 (“SFAS 158”),
        “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
        Plans.” SFAS 158, which is an amendment of SFAS No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R), requires
        the Company to report the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other
        postretirement benefit plans on its balance sheets as a net liability or asset as of
        December 31, 2006. The Company adopted SFAS 158 for the December 31, 2006 year end
        using the prospective method as required by the statement.

Using the prospective recognition of the funded status of the
        Company’s defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans to
        record the previously unrecognized transition obligation, unrecognized prior service cost,
        and unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses on a tax effected basis had the following
        impact on the Company’s balance sheet in 2006: a decrease in long-term assets of $4.7
        million, an increase in short-term liabilities of $4.0 million, an increase in long-term
        liabilities of $6.2 million and a net decrease to accumulated other comprehensive income of
        $14.9 million.


In 2007, the Company early adopted the provision of SFAS 158 that requires
        the alignment of the measurement date and the year-end balance sheet date. The Company
        adopted this provision for the 2007 fiscal year with the only impact being to the Swiss
        pension plan which has been measured as of September 30 in prior years. As allowed under
        SFAS 158, the Company computed the net benefit expense for the period from the early
        measurement date of September 30, 2006 through December 31, 2007 which is the end of the
        fiscal year of adoption. The Company recognized three months of the net benefit expense as
        an adjustment to retained earnings in 2007. The net of tax adjustment to retained earnings
        is $0.4 million.

Defined Contribution Plans

In December, 2006 the Board of Directors amended the DENTSPLY Employee Stock
        Ownership Plan (“ESOP”) and 401(k) plans to redesign the future distribution of
        allocations of “Covered Compensation”, with a targeted 3% going into the ESOP
        in Company stock and a targeted 3% going into the 401(k) as a Non-Elective Contribution
        (“NEC”) in cash. The principal driver of this redesign is to provide quicker
        diversification opportunity to the participants as the investment of the NEC is participant
        directed. The Company sponsors an employee 401(k) savings plan for its United States
        workforce to which enrolled participants may contribute up to IRS defined limits. The
        annual expense and cash contribution to the 401(k) is expected to be $4.9 million for
        2007.

The ESOP is a non-contributory defined contribution plan that covers
        substantially all of the United States based non-union employees of the Company.
        Contributions to the ESOP, net of forfeitures, are expected to be $0.2 million for 2007 (to
        be contributed in the first quarter of 2008), and were $0.4 million for 2006 (contributed
        in the first quarter of 2007), and $4.3 million for 2005. Beginning in 2005, annual
        contributions to the ESOP are made in the first quarter of the subsequent year based upon
        “Covered Compensation” at a rate determined annually by the Board of Directors.
        Prior to 2005, the Company made annual contributions to the ESOP of not less than the
        amounts required to service ESOP debt, which was extinguished in 2004. In connection with
        the refinancing of ESOP debt in March 1994, the Company agreed to make additional cash
        contributions totaling at least $0.6 million through 2003. Dividends received by the ESOP
        on allocated shares are either reinvested in participants’ accounts or passed through
        to Plan participants, at the participant’s election. Most ESOP shares were initially
        pledged as collateral for its debt. As the debt was repaid, shares were released from
        collateral and allocated to active employees based on the proportion of debt service paid
        in the year. At December 31, 2005, the ESOP held 5.0 million shares, all of which were
        allocated to plan participants as the ESOP debt was fully repaid in 2004. Shares acquired
        prior to December 31, 1992 are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Position
        (“SOP”) 76-3, “Accounting Practices for Certain Employee Stock Ownership
        Plans.” Accordingly, all shares held by the ESOP are considered outstanding and are
        included in the earnings per common share computations.

All future ESOP allocations will come from a combination of forfeited shares
        and shares acquired in the open market. The Company has targeted future ESOP allocations at
        3% of “Covered Compensation.” The share allocation will be accounted at fair
        value at the point of allocation, each year-end, in accordance with SOP 93-6,
        “Employers' Accounting for Employee Stock Ownership Plans.”

Defined Benefit Plans

The Company maintains a number of separate contributory and non-contributory
        qualified defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement medical plans for certain
        union and salaried employee groups in the United States. Pension benefits for salaried
        plans are based on salary and years of service; hourly plans are based on negotiated
        benefits and years of service. Annual contributions to the pension plans are sufficient to
        satisfy legal funding requirements. Pension plan assets are held in trust and consist
        mainly of common stock and fixed income investments. The U.S. plans are funded in excess of
        the funding required by the U.S. Department of Labor.

The Company maintains defined benefit pension plans for its employees in
        Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Taiwan. These plans provide benefits based
        upon age, years of service and remuneration. Substantially all of the German plans are
        unfunded book reserve plans. Other foreign plans are not significant individually or in the
        aggregate. Most employees and retirees outside the United States are covered by government
        health plans.

Postretirement Healthcare

The plans for postretirement healthcare have no plan assets. The
        postretirement healthcare plans cover certain union and salaried employee groups in the
        United States and is contributory, with retiree contributions adjusted annually to limit
        the Company’s contribution for participants who retired after June 1, 1985. The
        Company also sponsors unfunded non-contributory postretirement medical plans for a limited
        number of union employees and their spouses and retirees of a discontinued
        operation.

        Plans

During 2005, the Company initiated several restructuring plans including the
        shutdown of the pharmaceutical manufacturing facility outside of Chicago. In addition,
        these costs related to the consolidation of certain United States production facilities in
        order to better leverage the Company’s resources by reducing costs and obtaining
        operational efficiencies. The plans include the elimination of approximately 155
        administrative and manufacturing positions, all within the United States, with 150 of these
        positions having been eliminated as of December 31, 2007. The Company does not expect any
        significant future expenditures related to these plans. The major components of the

        Plans

During 2004, the Company initiated several restructuring plans primarily
        related to the creation of a European Shared Services Center in Yverdon, Switzerland, which
        resulted in the identification of redundant personnel in the Company's European accounting
        functions. In addition, these costs related to the consolidation of certain sales/customer
        service and distribution facilities in Europe and Japan. The primary objective of these
        restructuring initiatives is to improve operational efficiencies and to reduce costs within
        the related businesses. The plans include the elimination of approximately 105
        administrative and manufacturing positions primarily in Germany. Certain of these positions
        need to be replaced at the European Shared Services Center and therefore the net reduction
        in positions is expected to be 52. As of December 31, 2007, 43 of these positions have been
        eliminated. The Company does not expect any significant future expenditures related to
        these plans. The major components of these charges and the remaining outstanding balances

Other
        Income (Costs)

During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company recorded a net charge
        of $5.0 million related to several legal claims.

During the third quarter of 2006, the Company sold the land, buildings,
        machinery and equipment previously associated with the Chicago based pharmaceutical
        manufacturing facility in exchange for cash of $3.0 million and a long-term note receivable
        with a fair value of $9.8 million. The Company had announced in early 2006 that it would be
        closing the pharmaceutical manufacturing facility (see also 2005 Plans under Restructuring
        Costs). This sale resulted in the recognition of a gain of $2.9 million. The assets sold in
        this transaction had been classified as available for sale beginning in the first quarter
        of 2006, and as such had been included in Prepaid and other current assets at their fair
        value less cost to sell of $9.9 million.

Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company sold land and
        buildings related to a German manufacturing facility in exchange for 4.3 million euros
        (approximately $5.5 million). This facility was closed down in 1998 as part of a
        restructuring plan. The sale resulted in a gain of 0.8 million euros (approximately $1.0
        million). The assets sold in this transaction were classified as fixed assets due to
        uncertainty related to when these assets would be sold.

During 2006, the Company also recorded a charge of $0.5 million associated
        with a pension settlement related to the Gendex business that was sold in 2004.


NOTE 15
        – FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVES

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The fair value of financial instruments is determined by reference to
        various market data and other valuation techniques as appropriate. The Company believes the
        carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable
        (net of allowance for doubtful accounts), prepaid expenses and other current assets,
        accounts payable, accrued liabilities, income taxes payable and notes payable approximate
        fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The Company estimates the
        fair value and carrying value of its total long-term debt was $482.3 million as of December
        31, 2007. The fair value of the Company’s long-term debt equaled its carrying value
        as the Company’s debt is variable rate and reflects current market rates. The
        interest rates on private placement notes, revolving debt and commercial paper are variable
        and therefore the fair value of these instruments approximates their carrying
        values.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

The Company's activities expose it to a variety of market risks which
        primarily include the risks related to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange
        rates, interest rates and commodity prices. These financial exposures are monitored and
        managed by the Company as part of its overall risk management program. The objective of
        this risk management program is to reduce the volatility that these market risks may have
        on the Company's operating results and equity.

Certain of the Company's inventory purchases are denominated in foreign
        currencies, which expose the Company to market risk associated with exchange rate
        movements. The Company's policy generally is to hedge major foreign currency transaction
        exposures through foreign exchange forward contracts. These contracts are entered into with
        major financial institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. In addition, the
        Company's investments in foreign subsidiaries are denominated in foreign currencies, which
        create exposures to changes in exchange rates. The Company uses debt and derivatives
        denominated in the applicable foreign currency as a means of hedging a portion of this
        risk.

With the Company’s significant level of variable rate long-term debt
        and net investment hedges, changes in the interest rate environment can have a major impact
        on the Company’s earnings, depending upon its interest rate exposure. As a result,
        the Company manages its interest rate exposure with the use of interest rate swaps, when
        appropriate, based upon market conditions.

The manufacturing of some of the Company’s products requires the use
        of commodities which are subject to market fluctuations. In order to limit the
        unanticipated impact on earnings from such market fluctuations, the Company selectively
        enters into commodity swaps for certain materials used in the production of its products.
        Additionally, the Company uses non-derivative methods, such as the precious metal
        consignment agreements to effectively hedge commodity risks.

The Company uses interest rate swaps to convert a portion of its variable
        rate debt to fixed rate debt. As of December 31, 2007, the Company has three groups of
        significant variable rate to fixed rate interest rate swaps. One of the groups of swaps has
        notional amounts totaling 12.6 billion Japanese yen, and effectively converts the
        underlying variable interest rates to an average fixed rate of 1.6% for a term of ten
        years, ending in March 2012. Another swap has a notional amount of 65.0 million Swiss
        francs, and effectively converts the underlying variable interest rates to a fixed rate of
        4.2% for a term of seven years, ending in March 2012. A third group of swaps has a notional
        amount of $150.0 million, and effectively converts the underlying variable interest rates
        to a fixed rate of 3.9% for a term of two years, ending March, 2010.


The Company selectively enters into commodity swaps to effectively fix
        certain variable raw material costs. At December 31, 2007, the Company had swaps in place
        to purchase 540 troy ounces of platinum bullion for use in the production of its impression
        material products. The average fixed rate of this agreement is $1,283.92 per troy ounce. In
        addition, the Company had swaps in place to purchase 90,000 troy ounces of silver bullion
        for use in the production of its amalgam products at an average fixed rate of $12.37 per
        troy ounce. The Company generally may hedge up to 80% of its projected annual needs related
        to these products.

The Company enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge the foreign
        currency exposure of its anticipated purchases of certain inventory from Japan. In
        addition, exchange contracts are used by certain of the Company's subsidiaries to hedge
        intercompany inventory purchases which are denominated in non-local currencies. The forward
        contracts that are used in these programs typically mature in twelve months or less. The
        Company generally may hedge up to 80% of its anticipated purchases from the supplying
        locations.

As of December 31, 2007, $2.1 million of deferred net gains on derivative
        instruments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income are expected to be
        reclassified to current earnings during the next twelve months. This reclassification is
        primarily due to the sale of inventory that includes previously hedged purchases and
        interest rate swaps. The maximum term over which the Company is hedging exposures to
        variability of cash flows (for all forecasted transactions, excluding interest payments on
        variable-rate debt) is eighteen months. Overall, the derivatives designated as cash flow
        hedges are highly effective. Any cash flows associated with these instruments are included
        in cash from operations in accordance with the Company’s policy of classifying the
        cash flows from these instruments in the same category as the cash flows from the items
        being hedged.

The Company has numerous investments in foreign subsidiaries. The net assets
        of these subsidiaries are exposed to volatility in currency exchange rates. Currently, the
        Company uses non-derivative financial instruments, including foreign currency denominated
        debt held at the parent company level and derivative financial instruments to hedge some of
        this exposure. Translation gains and losses related to the net assets of the foreign
        subsidiaries are offset by gains and losses in the non-derivative and derivative financial
        instruments designated as hedges of net investments.

In the first quarter of 2005, the Company entered into cross currency
        interest rate swaps with a notional principal value of Swiss francs 457.5 million paying
        three month Swiss franc Libor and receiving three month U.S. dollar Libor on $384.5
        million. In the first quarter of 2006, the Company entered into additional cross currency
        interest rate swaps with a notional principal value of Swiss francs 55.5 million paying
        three month Swiss franc Libor and receiving three month U.S. dollar Libor on $42.0 million.
        In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company entered into additional cross currency interest
        rate swaps with a notional principal value of Swiss francs 80.4 million paying three month
        Swiss franc Libor and receiving three month U.S. dollar Libor on $64.4 million. In the
        first quarter of 2007, the Company entered into additional cross currency interest rate
        swaps with a notional principal value of Swiss francs 56.6 million paying three month Swiss
        franc Libor and receiving three month U.S. dollar Libor on $46.3 million. Additionally, in
        the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company entered into cross currency interest rate swaps
        with a notional principal value of Euro 358.0 million paying three month Euro Libor and
        receiving three month U.S. dollar Libor on $419.7 million. The Swiss franc and Euro cross
        currency interest rate swaps are designated as net investment hedges of the Swiss and Euro
        denominated net assets. The interest rate differential is recognized in the earnings as
        interest income or interest expense as it is accrued, the foreign currency revaluation is
        recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax effects.

The fair value of these cross currency interest rate swap agreements is the
        estimated amount the Company would (pay) receive at the reporting date, taking into account
        the effective interest rates and foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2007 and
        December 31, 2006, the estimated net fair values of the swap agreements were negative
        $138.1 million and negative $48.1 million, respectively, which are recorded in accumulated
        other comprehensive income, net of tax effects, other noncurrent liabilities and other
        noncurrent assets.


At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had Euro-denominated, Swiss
        franc-denominated, and Japanese yen-denominated debt and cross currency interest rate swaps
        (at the parent company level) to hedge the currency exposure related to a designated
        portion of the net assets of its European, Swiss and Japanese subsidiaries. At December 31,
        2007 and 2006, the accumulated translation gains on investments in foreign subsidiaries,
        primarily denominated in Euros, Swiss francs and Japanese yen, net of these net investment
        hedges, were $156.8 million and $105.8 million, respectively, which are included in
        accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax effects.

Other

As of December 31, 2007, on a pre-tax basis, the Company had recorded assets
        representing the fair value of derivative instruments of $3.7 million in “Prepaid
        expenses and other current assets” and $0.1 million in “Other noncurrent
        assets” and liabilities representing the fair value of derivative instruments of $2.9
        million in “Accrued liabilities” and $142.5 million in “Other noncurrent
        liabilities.” The aggregate pre-tax net fair value of the Company's derivative
        instruments at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was negative $141.6 million and negative $53.4
        million, respectively.

Leases

The Company leases automobiles and machinery and equipment and certain
        office, warehouse and manufacturing facilities under non-cancelable operating leases. These
        leases generally require the Company to pay insurance, taxes and other expenses related to
        the leased property. Total rental expense for all operating leases was $27.4 million for
        2007, $23.4 million for 2006 and $23.0 million for 2005.

Litigation

On January 5, 1999, the Department of Justice filed a Complaint against the
        Company in the United States District Court in Wilmington, Delaware alleging that the
        Company’s tooth distribution practices violated the antitrust laws and seeking an
        order for the Company to discontinue its practices. This case has been concluded and the
        District Court, upon the direction of the Court of Appeals, issued an injunction preventing
        DENTSPLY from taking action to restrict its tooth dealers from adding new competitive teeth
        lines. This decision relates only to the distribution of artificial teeth in the United
        States and, notwithstanding the outcome of this case, the Company is confident that it can
        continue to develop this business.

Subsequent to the filing of the Department of Justice Complaint in 1999,
        several private party class actions were filed based on allegations similar to those in the
        Department of Justice case, on behalf of dental laboratories and denture patients in
        seventeen states who purchased Trubyte teeth or products containing Trubyte teeth. These
        cases were transferred to the United States District Court in Wilmington, Delaware. The
        Court granted the Company’s Motion on the lack of standing of the laboratory and
        patient class actions to pursue damage claims. The Plaintiffs in the laboratory case
        appealed this decision to the Third Circuit and the Court largely upheld the decision of
        the District Court in dismissing the Plaintiffs’ damages claims against DENTSPLY,
        with the exception of allowing the Plaintiffs to pursue a damage claim based on a theory of
        resale price maintenance between the Company and its tooth dealers. The Plaintiffs in the
        laboratory case filed an amended complaint in the District Court asserting that DENTSPLY
        and its tooth dealers, and the dealers among themselves, engaged in a conspiracy to violate
        the antitrust laws. DENTSPLY and the dealers filed Motions to dismiss Plaintiffs’
        claims, except for the resale price maintenance claims. The District Court has granted the
        Motions filed by DENTSPLY and the dealers, leaving only the resale price maintenance claim.
        The Plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal of their claims to the Third Circuit.
        Additionally, manufacturers of two competitive tooth lines and a dealer, as a putative
        class action, have filed separate actions seeking unspecified damages alleged to have been
        incurred as a result of the Company’s tooth distribution practice found to be a
        violation of the antitrust law.


On March 27, 2002, a Complaint was filed in Alameda County, California
        (which was transferred to Los Angeles County) by Bruce Glover, DDS alleging, inter alia,
        breach of express and implied warranties, fraud, unfair trade practices and negligent
        misrepresentation in the Company’s manufacture and sale of Advance® cement. The
        Judge entered an Order granting class certification, as an opt-in class, which was later
        converted to an opt-out class. In general, the Class is defined as California dentists who
        purchased and used Advance® cement and were required, because of failures of the
        cement, to repair or reperform dental procedures for which they were not paid. The parties
        entered a settlement agreement, which was approved by the Court at a fairness hearing on
        June 15, 2007. The settlement establishes a procedure by which dentists, who believe they
        were required to perform dental work because of a problem caused by Advance® cement,
        can submit claims for review and reimbursement of unpaid fees. The Company’s primary
        level insurance carrier has confirmed coverage for claims in this matter up to one million
        dollars, their asserted policy limits. Litigation is pending with the Company’s
        excess insurance carrier regarding the level and coverage of its insurance for this
        case.

On June 18, 2004, Marvin Weinstat, DDS and Richard Nathan,
        DDS filed a class action suit in San Francisco County, California alleging that the Company
        misrepresented that its Cavitron® ultrasonic scalers are suitable for use in oral
        surgical procedures. The Complaint seeks a recall of the product and refund of its purchase
        price to dentists who have purchased it for use in oral surgery. The Court certified the
        case as a class action in June 2006 with respect to the breach of warranty and unfair
        business practices claims. The class is defined as California dental professionals who
        purchased and used one or more Cavitron® ultrasonic scalers for the performance of oral
        surgical procedures. The Company filed a motion for decertification of the class and this
        motion was granted. Plaintiffs have appealed the decertification of the class to the
        California Court of Appeals.

On December 12, 2006, a Complaint was filed by Carole
        Hildebrand, DDS and Robert Jaffin, DDS in the Eastern District of PA. The case was filed by
        the same law firm that filed the Weinstat case in California. The Complaint asserts
        putative class action claims on behalf of dentists located in New Jersey and Pennsylvania
        based on assertions that the Company’s Cavitron® ultrasonic scaler was sold in
        breach of contract and warranty arising from misrepresentations about the potential uses of
        the product because it cannot deliver potable or sterile water. The Complaint seeks a
        refund of the purchase price paid for Cavitron® ultrasonic scalers. Plaintiffs have
        filed their Motion for class certification to which the Company has filed its
        response.

Other

The Company has no material non-cancelable purchase commitments.

The Company has employment agreements with its executive officers. These
        agreements generally provide for salary continuation for a specified number of months under
        certain circumstances. If all of the employees under contract were to be terminated by the
        Company without cause, as defined in the agreements, the Company's liability would be
        approximately $10.5 million at December 31, 2007.
