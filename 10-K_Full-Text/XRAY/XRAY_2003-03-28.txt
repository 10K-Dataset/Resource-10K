Item 1.  Business

   Certain  statements  made by the  Company,  including  without  limitation,
statements   containing   the  words   "plans",   "anticipates",   "believes",
"expects",  or words of  similar  import  may be deemed to be  forward-looking
statements  and  are  made  pursuant  to the  safe  harbor  provisions  of the
Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995.  Investors  are cautioned
that  forward-looking  statements  involve risks and  uncertainties  which are
described  in this  Item 1 and  which  may  materially  affect  the  Company's
business and prospects.

History and Overview

   DENTSPLY  International  Inc.  ("DENTSPLY"  or the  "Company"),  a Delaware
corporation,  was created by a merger of  Dentsply  International  Inc.  ("Old
Dentsply")  and GENDEX  Corporation  in 1993.  Old Dentsply,  founded in 1899,
was a manufacturer  and  distributor of artificial  teeth,  dental  equipment,
and dental consumable  products.  GENDEX,  founded in 1983, was a manufacturer
of dental  x-ray  equipment  and  handpieces.  Today,  DENTSPLY is the world's
largest  designer,  developer,  manufacturer  and marketer of a broad range of
products for the dental  market.  The  Company's  worldwide  headquarters  and
executive offices are located in York, Pennsylvania.

   The  Company  operates  in  a  single  reporting  segment  as  a  designer,
manufacturer  and distributor of dental products in two principal  categories:
1). Dental  consumables and small equipment,  and 2). Large  equipment.  Sales
of  the  Company's  dental  products   accounted  for   approximately  98%  of
DENTSPLY's  consolidated  sales for the year  ended  December  31,  2002.  The
remaining 2% of consolidated  sales is primarily  related to materials sold to
the investment casting industry.


   The  Company   conducts  its  business  in  over  120  foreign   countries,
principally    through   its   foreign    subsidiaries.    DENTSPLY    has   a
long-established  presence in Canada and in the European market,  particularly
in Germany,  Switzerland,  France,  Italy and the United Kingdom.  Through its
recent  acquisitions,  the Company has also established a stronger presence in
other European  markets in the Netherlands  and Austria.  The Company also has
a significant  market presence in Central and South America  including Brazil,
Mexico,  Argentina,  Colombia,  and Chile; in South Africa; and in the Pacific
Rim including Australia,  New Zealand,  China (including Hong Kong), Thailand,
India,  Philippines,  Taiwan,  Korea,  Vietnam,  Indonesia and Japan. DENTSPLY
has also  established  marketing  activities  in  Moscow,  Russia to serve the
countries of the former Soviet Union.

   For 2002,  2001 and 2000,  the  Company's  sales to  customers  outside the
United States,  including export sales,  accounted for approximately  55%, 49%
and 42%,  respectively,  of consolidated net sales. The information  about the
Company's  United  States and foreign  sales and assets set forth in Note 4 of
the Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements in the Company's 2002 Annual
Report to Shareholders is incorporated herein by reference.

   As  a  result  of  the  Company's  significant   international  operations,
DENTSPLY  is subject to  fluctuations  in  exchange  rates of various  foreign
currencies  and other  risks  associated  with  foreign  trade.  The impact of
currency  fluctuations  in any given period can be  favorable or  unfavorable.
The  impact  of  foreign  currency  fluctuations  of  European  currencies  on
operating  income  is  partially  offset  by sales  in the  United  States  of
products  sourced  from plants and third  party  suppliers  located  overseas,
principally  in Germany  and  Switzerland.  The Company  enters  into  forward
foreign  exchange  contracts to  selectively  hedge  assets,  liabilities  and
purchases  denominated  in  foreign  currencies.   The  information  regarding
foreign  exchange risk  management  activities set forth in  Quantitative  and
Qualitative  Disclosure  About  Market  Risk  under Item 7A and Note 15 of the
Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in the  Company's  2002  Annual
Report to Shareholders is incorporated herein by reference.

   DENTSPLY believes that the dental products industry is experiencing
substantial consolidation with respect to both product manufacturing and
distribution, although it continues to be fragmented creating numerous
acquisition opportunities. As a result, during the past three years, the
Company has made numerous acquisitions including three significant
acquisitions made during 2001. In January 2001, the Company acquired the
outstanding shares of Friadent GmbH ("Friadent"), a global dental implant
manufacturer and marketer previously headquartered in Mannheim, Germany. In
March 2001, the Company acquired the dental injectible anaesthetic assets of
AstraZeneca ("AZ Assets"). In October 2001, the Company acquired the Degussa
Dental Group ("Degussa Dental"), a manufacturer and seller of dental
products, including precious metal alloys, ceramics, dental laboratory
equipment and chairside products previously headquartered in Hanau, Germany.
Information about these acquisitions and the other acquisition and
divestiture activities is set forth in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in the Company's 2002 Annual Report to Shareholders and
is incorporated herein by reference.  These acquisitions are intended to
supplement DENTSPLY's core growth and assure ongoing expansion of its
business. In addition, acquisitions continue to provide DENTSPLY with new
technologies and additional product breadth.

   Certain provisions of DENTSPLY's Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws
and of Delaware law could have the effect of making it difficult for a third
party to acquire control of DENTSPLY. Such provisions include the division
of the Board of Directors of DENTSPLY into three classes, with the
three-year term of a class expiring each year, a provision allowing the
Board of Directors to issue preferred stock having rights senior to those of
the common stock and certain procedural requirements which make it difficult
for stockholders to amend DENTSPLY's By-laws and which preclude stockholders
from calling special meetings of stockholders. In addition, members of
DENTSPLY's management and participants in its Employee Stock Ownership Plan
collectively own approximately 10% of the outstanding common stock of
DENTSPLY, which may discourage a third party from attempting to acquire
control of DENTSPLY in a transaction that is opposed by DENTSPLY's
management and employees.

Principal Products

   The worldwide  professional  dental  industry  encompasses  the  diagnosis,
treatment  and  prevention  of  disease  and  ailments  of the  teeth,  gums and
supporting  bone.  DENTSPLY's two principal dental product lines are consumables
and small  equipment  and large  equipment.  These  products are produced by the
Company in the United States and internationally and are distributed  throughout
the world under some of the most well-established  brand names and trademarks in
the  industry,   including   ACUCAM(R),   ANKYLOS(R),   AQUASIL(TM),   CAULK(R),
CAVITRON(R),   CERAMCO(R),  CERCON(R),  DELTON(R),  DENOPTIX(TM),   DENTSPLY(R),
DETREY(R), ELEPHANT(R), ESTHET.X(R), FRIALIT(R), GAC ORTHOWORKS(TM),  GENDEX(R),
IN-OVATION(TM), MAILLEFER(R), MIDWEST(R), NUPRO(R), PEPGEN P-15(TM), PROFILE(R),
RINN(R), R&R(R), SANI-TIP(R), THERMAFIL(R) and TRUBYTE(R).

   Consumables  and Small  Equipment.  Consumable  products  consist of dental
sundries  used in dental  offices in the  treatment  of patients and in dental
laboratories  in the  preparation of dental  appliances.  DENTSPLY's  products
in this category  include  dental  prosthetics,  including  artificial  teeth,
endodontic  (root  canal)   instruments  and  materials,   dental   injectable
anesthetics,   prophylaxis  paste,  dental  sealants,   implants,   impression
materials,   restorative  materials,  precious  metal  dental  alloys,  dental
ceramics,  crown and bridge  materials,  tooth  whiteners,  topical  fluoride,
cutting   instruments,   dental  needles,   and  orthodontic   appliances  and
accessories.  The Company  manufactures  thousands of different consumable and
laboratory  products  marketed  under more than a hundred  brand names.  Small
equipment  products  consist of various  durable goods used in dental  offices
for  treatment  of  patients  as well as in  dental  laboratories.  DENTSPLY's
small  equipment  products  include  high and low speed  handpieces,  computer
aided  machining  (CAM)  ceramics   systems,   intraoral   lighting   systems,
ultrasonic   scalers  and  polishers,   air  abrasion  systems  and  porcelain
furnaces.   Sales  of   consumable   and   small   equipment   accounted   for
approximately  92% of the  Company's  consolidated  sales  for the year  ended
December 31, 2002.

   Large  Equipment.  Large  equipment  products  consist of  various  durable
goods  used in dental  offices  primarily  for the  diagnosis  of  patients  .
DENTSPLY's  large  equipment  product lines include  conventional  and digital
dental  x-ray  systems  and  related   support   equipment  and   accessories,
intraoral  cameras,  computer imaging systems and related  software.  Sales of
large equipment  accounted for approximately 6% of the Company's  consolidated
sales for the year ended December 31, 2002.

Markets, Sales and Distribution

   DENTSPLY  distributes  approximately  60% of its  dental  products  through
domestic and foreign  distributors,  dealers and importers.  However,  certain
highly  technical  products  such as  precious  metal  dental  alloys,  dental
ceramics,  crown and bridge  porcelain  products,  endodontic  instruments and
materials,  orthodontic appliances,  implants and bone substitute and grafting
materials  are sold  directly  to the  dental  laboratory  or  dentist in some
markets.  No  customers  accounted  for more than ten percent of  consolidated
net sales in 2002.

   The  information  about the Company's  foreign and domestic  operations and
export  sales  set  forth  in Note 4 of the  Notes to  Consolidated  Financial
Statements  in  the  Company's   2002  Annual   Report  to   Shareholders   is
incorporated herein by reference.

   Although  much  of  its  sales  are  made  to  distributors,  dealers,  and
importers,  DENTSPLY  focuses its marketing  efforts on the  dentists,  dental
hygienists,  dental  assistants,  dental  laboratories  and dental schools who
are the end users of its  products.  As part of this end-user  "pull  through"
marketing  approach,  DENTSPLY  employs  approximately  1,700 highly  trained,
product-specific   sales  and   technical   staff  to  provide   comprehensive
marketing and service tailored to the particular  sales and technical  support
requirements  of  the  dealers  and  the  end  users.   The  Company  conducts
extensive  distributor and end-user  marketing  programs and trains laboratory
technicians and dentists in the proper use of its products,  introducing  them
to the latest  technological  developments at its Educational  Centers located
in key dental  markets.  The  Company  also  maintains  ongoing  relationships
with various dental  associations and recognized  worldwide opinion leaders in
the dental field.

   DENTSPLY  believes  that  demand in a given  geographic  market  for dental
procedures  and products  varies  according  to the stage of social,  economic
and technical  development  that the market has attained.  Geographic  markets
for DENTSPLY's  dental  products can be categorized  into the following  three
stages of development:

   The United States, Canada,  Western Europe, the United Kingdom,  Japan, and
Australia are highly  developed  markets that demand the most advanced  dental
procedures and products and have the highest level of  expenditures  on dental
care.  In  these  markets,  the  focus of  dental  care is  increasingly  upon
preventive care and  specialized  dentistry.  In addition to basic  procedures
such as the  excavation  and  filling of  cavities  and tooth  extraction  and
denture  replacement,  dental  professionals  perform an increasing  volume of
preventive  and  cosmetic   procedures.   These  markets  require  varied  and
complex  dental  products,   utilize  sophisticated   diagnostic  and  imaging
equipment,   and  demand  high  levels  of  attention  to  protection  against
infection and patient cross-contamination.

   In certain  countries  in Central  America,  South  America and the Pacific
Rim,  dental care is often limited to the  excavation  and filling of cavities
and  other   restorative   techniques,   reflecting  more  modest  per  capita
expenditures  for dental care.  These markets demand diverse  products such as
high and low speed handpieces,  restorative  compounds,  finishing devices and
custom restorative devices.

   In the People's  Republic of China,  India,  Eastern Europe,  the countries
of the former Soviet Union,  and other developing  countries,  dental ailments
are treated  primarily  through  tooth  extraction  and  denture  replacement.
These  procedures  require basic surgical  instruments,  artificial  teeth for
dentures and bridgework, and anchoring devices such as posts.

   The Company  offers  products and  equipment  for use in markets at each of
these  stages  of  development.  The  Company  believes  that as each of these
markets  develop,   demand  for  more  technically   advanced   products  will
increase.  The Company also believes  that its  recognized  brand names,  high
quality  and  innovative  products,  technical  support  services  and  strong
international  distribution  capabilities  position it well to take  advantage
of any opportunities for growth in all of the markets that it serves.

   The Company  believes  that the  following  trends  support  the  Company's
confidence in its industry growth outlook:

o     Increasing   worldwide   population   -  Population   growth   continues
   throughout the world.

o     Growth of the  population  65 or older - The  percentage  of the  United
   States,  European  and  Japanese  population  over  age 65 is  expected  to
   nearly  double by the year 2030.  In addition to having  significant  needs
   for dental care,  the elderly are well  positioned  to pay for the required
   procedures since they control sizable amounts of discretionary income.

o     Natural  teeth are being  retained  longer -  Individuals  with  natural
   teeth are much more  likely to visit a dentist  in a given  year than those
   without any natural teeth remaining.

o     The Changing  Dental  Practice in the U.S. - Dentistry in North  America
   has  been  transformed  from a  profession  primarily  dealing  with  pain,
   infections  and tooth decay to one with  increased  emphasis on  preventive
   care and cosmetic dentistry.

o     Per capita and discretionary  incomes are increasing in emerging nations
   - As  personal  incomes  continue  to rise in the  emerging  nations of the
   Pacific Rim and Latin America,  healthcare,  including dental services, are
   a growing priority.

o     The  Company's  business is less  susceptible  than other  industries to
   general  downturns  in the  economies  in  which it  operates.  Many of the
   products  the  Company  offers  relate  to  dental   procedures   that  are
   considered necessary by patients regardless of the economic environment.

Product Development

   Technological  innovation and successful  product  development are critical
to  strengthening  the  Company's   prominent  position  in  worldwide  dental
markets,  maintaining its leadership  positions in product categories where it
has a high market share,  and  increasing  market share in product  categories
where  gains are  possible.  While many of  DENTSPLY's  innovations  represent
sequential  improvements of existing  products,  the Company also continues to
successfully  launch products that represent  fundamental change. Its research
centers  throughout the world employ  approximately  350 scientists,  Ph.D.'s,
engineers  and  technicians  dedicated  to research  and product  development.
Approximately $41.6 million,  $28.3 million, and $20.4 million,  respectively,
was internally  invested by the Company in connection  with the development of
new products and in the  improvement  of existing  products in the years ended
2002,  2001 and 2000,  respectively.  There can be no assurance  that DENTSPLY
will be able to continue to develop  innovative  products and that  regulatory
approval of any new products will be obtained,  or that if such  approvals are
obtained, such products will be accepted in the marketplace.


Operating and Technical Expertise

   DENTSPLY  believes  that its  manufacturing  capabilities  are important to
its  success.  The  Company  continues  to automate  its global  manufacturing
operations in order to remain a low cost producer.

   The manufacture of the Company's  products requires  substantial and varied
technical   expertise.   Complex   materials   technology  and  processes  are
necessary to manufacture the Company's products.

    DENTSPLY  has  completed  or has in  progress a number of key  initiatives
around  the  world  that are  focused  on  helping  the  Company  improve  its
operating margins.


o     The Company is constructing a plant site outside Chicago,  where it will
   establish a major dental  anesthetic  filling plant.  The Company  believes
   that the plant will become  operational  during  2004,  which  includes the
   FDA  validation  of  the  manufacturing  practices  and  the  provision  of
   products  to  certain  international   markets.  This  initiative  is  very
   important  to  the  Company  since   AstraZeneca,   the  Company's  current
   supplier,  will  cease to supply  product to  certain  markets by  year-end
   2004.  As a result,  this plant must be  operational  prior to that time to
   avoid any disruption in supply.


o     A Corporate  Purchasing  office has been  established  to  leverage  the
   buying  power of  Dentsply  around the world and reduce our  product  costs
   through lower prices and reduced related overhead.

o     The Company has centralized  its  warehousing and  distribution in North
   America and Europe.  While the initial  gains from this  strategy have been
   realized,   ongoing   efforts   are  in   place  to   maximize   additional
   opportunities   that  can  be  gained  through   improving  our  functional
   expertise in supply chain management.

o     A Corporate  Quality  group is focused on  improving  manufacturing  and
   distribution  processes  throughout  the Company  with a goal to  eliminate
   non-value  added  activities,   improving  product  quality  and  expanding
   product margins.

o     DENTSPLY  has  seen  significant  gains  from the  formation  of a North
   American Shared  Services  group.  The Company has established a task force
   to assess possible efficiency  opportunities  related to the accounting and
   finance processes within Europe.

o     Information   technology   initiatives   are  underway  to   standardize
   worldwide   telecommunications,   implement   improved   manufacturing  and
   financial  accounting  systems  and an  ongoing  training  of IT  users  to
   maximize the capabilities of global systems.

o     DENTSPLY  continues  to pursue  opportunities  to leverage its assets by
   consolidating   business  units  where  appropriate  and  to  optimize  its
   diversity of worldwide manufacturing capabilities.

Financing

   DENTSPLY's  long-term  debt at December 31, 2002 was $769.8 million and the
ratio of  long-term  debt to total  capitalization  was  47.9%.  DENTSPLY  may
incur  additional  debt in the future,  including  the  funding of  additional
acquisitions  and capital  expenditures.  DENTSPLY's  ability to make payments
on  its  indebtedness,  and to  fund  its  operations  depends  on its  future
performance and financial  results,  which,  to a certain extent,  are subject
to general  economic,  financial,  competitive,  regulatory  and other factors
that are  beyond  its  control.  Although  the  Management  believes  that the
Company has and will continue to have  sufficient  liquidity,  there can be no
assurance that  DENTSPLY's  business will generate  sufficient  cash flow from
operations in the future to service its debt and operate its business.

   DENTSPLY's   existing   borrowing   documentation   contains  a  number  of
covenants  and  financial  ratios which it is required to satisfy.  Any breach
of any such  covenants or  restrictions  would  result in a default  under the
existing  borrowing  documentation  that would  permit the  lenders to declare
all borrowings  under such  documentation  to be  immediately  due and payable
and,  through  cross  default  provisions,   would  entitle  DENTSPLY's  other
lenders  to  accelerate  their  loans.  DENTSPLY  may not be able to meet  its
obligations  under its  outstanding  indebtedness  in the event that any cross
default provision is triggered.

   Additional  information  about DENTSPLY's  working  capital,  liquidity and
capital  resources is  incorporated  herein by reference to the material under
the caption  "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations" in the Company's 2002 Annual Report to Shareholders.

Competition

   The Company  conducts its  operations,  both  domestic  and foreign,  under
highly  competitive  market  conditions.  Competition  in the dental  products
industry is based  primarily  upon product  performance,  quality,  safety and
ease of use, as well as price,  customer  service,  innovation  and acceptance
by  professionals  and  technicians.  DENTSPLY  believes  that  its  principal
strengths  include  its  well-established  brand  names,  its  reputation  for
high-quality and innovative  products,  its leadership in product  development
and  manufacturing,  and its  commitment  to customer  service  and  technical
support.

   The size and number of the Company's  competitors  vary by product line and
from region to region.  There are many  companies  that produce some,  but not
all,  of the  same  types  of  products  as  those  produced  by the  Company.
Certain of DENTSPLY's  competitors  may have greater  resources  than does the
Company in certain of its product offerings.

   The  worldwide   market  for  dental   supplies  and  equipment  is  highly
competitive.  There can be no  assurance  that the Company  will  successfully
identify  new  product  opportunities  and  develop  and market  new  products
successfully,   or  that  new  products   and   technologies   introduced   by
competitors   will   not   render   the   Company's   products   obsolete   or
noncompetitive.

Regulation

   The  Company's   products  are  subject  to  regulation   by,  among  other
governmental  entities,  the United States Food and Drug  Administration  (the
"FDA").  In  general,  if a dental  "device"  is  subject  to FDA  regulation,
compliance   with  the  FDA's   requirements   constitutes   compliance   with
corresponding  state  regulations.  In order to ensure  that  dental  products
distributed  for human use in the United  States are safe and  effective,  the
FDA   regulates  the   introduction,   manufacture,   advertising,   labeling,
packaging,  marketing  and  distribution  of,  and  record-keeping  for,  such
products.  The  anesthetic  products  sold by the Company are  regulated  as a
drug  by the FDA and by all  other  similar  regulatory  agencies  around  the
world.

   Dental  devices of the types sold by DENTSPLY are  generally  classified by
the FDA into a category  that renders  them  subject only to general  controls
that  apply  to  all  medical   devices,   including   regulations   regarding
alteration, misbranding,  notification,  record-keeping and good manufacturing
practices.  DENTSPLY's  facilities  are subject to periodic  inspection by the
FDA to monitor DENTSPLY's  compliance with these regulations.  There can be no
assurance  that  the FDA  will  not  raise  compliance  concerns.  Failure  to
satisfy FDA  requirements  can result in FDA  enforcement  actions,  including
product  seizure,  injunction  and/or  criminal or civil  proceedings.  In the
European  Union,  DENTSPLY's  products are subject to the medical devices laws
of the various  member  states  which are based on a Directive of the European
Commission.  Such laws  generally  regulate  the safety of the  products  in a
similar way to the FDA  regulations.  DENTSPLY  products in Europe bear the CE
sign showing that such products adhere to the European regulations.

   All dental amalgam  filling  materials,  including those  manufactured  and
sold by DENTSPLY,  contain  mercury.  Various  groups have alleged that dental
amalgam  containing  mercury  is harmful  to human  health  and have  actively
lobbied  state and  federal  lawmakers  and  regulators  to pass laws or adopt
regulatory  changes  restricting  the use,  or  requiring  a  warning  against
alleged  potential  risks,  of  dental  amalgams.  The  FDA's  Dental  Devices
Classification  Panel,  the  National  Institutes  of  Health  and the  United
States  Public  Health  Service have each  indicated  that no direct hazard to
humans from  exposure to dental  amalgams  has been  demonstrated.  If the FDA
were to reclassify  dental  mercury and amalgam  filling  materials as classes
of products  requiring  FDA  pre-market  approval,  there can be no  assurance
that the  required  approval  would be obtained  or that the FDA would  permit
the continued sale of amalgam  filling  materials  pending its  determination.
In Europe,  in particular in Scandinavia and Germany,  the contents of mercury
in amalgam filling materials has been the subject of public  discussion.  As a
consequence,  in 1994 the German  health  authorities  required  suppliers  of
dental  amalgam  to  amend  the  instructions  for  use  for  amalgam  filling
materials,  to include a  precaution  against the use of amalgam for  children
under eighteen years of age and to women of  childbearing  age.  DENTSPLY also
manufactures  and  sells  non-amalgam  dental  filling  materials  that do not
contain mercury.

   The  introduction  and sale of dental products of the types produced by the
Company are also  subject to  government  regulation  in the  various  foreign
countries  in  which  they are  produced  or  sold.  Some of these  regulatory
requirements  are more stringent  than those  applicable in the United States.
DENTSPLY  believes  that it is in  substantial  compliance  with  the  foreign
regulatory   requirements   that   are   applicable   to  its   products   and
manufacturing operations.

Sources and Supply of Raw Materials

  All of the raw  materials  used by the  Company  in the  manufacture  of its
products  are  purchased  from  various   suppliers  and  are  available  from
numerous  sources.  No single  supplier,  except for the  supplier of precious
metal raw materials,  accounts for a significant  percentage of DENTSPLY's raw
material  requirements.  There are alternative suppliers of precious metal raw
materials readily available.

Intellectual Property

   Products  manufactured  by  DENTSPLY  are  sold  primarily  under  its  own
trademarks  and trade names.  DENTSPLY also owns and maintains more than 1,000
patents  throughout  the world and is licensed under a small number of patents
owned by others.

   DENTSPLY's  policy  is to  protect  its  products  and  technology  through
patents and trademark  registrations  in the United States and in  significant
international  markets  for  its  products.  The  Company  carefully  monitors
trademark  use  worldwide,   and  promotes  enforcement  of  its  patents  and
trademarks  in a  manner  that  is  designed  to  balance  the  cost  of  such
protection  against  obtaining  the greatest  value for the Company.  DENTSPLY
believes its patents and trademark  properties  are  important and  contribute
to the  Company's  marketing  position  but it does not  consider  its overall
business to be materially dependent upon any individual patent or trademark.

Employees

   As of  December  31,  2002,  the  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  employed
approximately   7,800   employees.   A  small   percentage  of  the  Company's
employees are  represented  by labor unions.  Hourly  workers at the Company's
Ransom & Randolph  facility in Maumee,  Ohio are  represented  by Local No. 12
of the  International  Union,  United  Automobile,  Aerospace and  Agriculture
Implement  Workers of America  under a collective  bargaining  agreement  that
expires on January 31, 2004.  Hourly  workers at the Company's  Midwest Dental
Products  facility in Des Plaines,  Illinois  are  represented  by  Automobile
Mechanics'  Local No. 701 in Chicago under a collective  bargaining  agreement
that  expires  on May 31,  2003.  In  addition,  approximately  20% of Degussa
Dental  Germany's  workforce  is  represented  by labor  unions.  The  Company
believes that its relationship with its employees is good.

   The  Company's  success is dependent  upon its  management  and  employees.
The loss of senior  management  employees  or any failure to recruit and train
needed  managerial,  sales  and  technical  personnel  could  have a  material
adverse effect on the Company.

Environmental Matters

   DENTSPLY  believes  that its  operations  comply in all  material  respects
with applicable  environmental  laws and  regulations.  Maintaining this level
of compliance  has not had, and is not expected to have, a material  effect on
the Company's capital expenditures or on its business.

Website Materials

   DENTSPLY   makes   available   free  of  charge   through  its  website  at
www.dentsply.com  its annual  report on Form 10-K,  quarterly  reports on Form
10-Q,  current  reports on Form 8-K and  amendments  to these reports filed or
furnished  pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the  Securities  Exchange Act
of 1934 as soon as  reasonably  practicable  after  such  materials  are filed
with or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.

    In  addition,  the Company  maintains  sales and  distribution  offices at
certain of its foreign and domestic  manufacturing  facilities,  as well as at
various  other  United  States  and  international  locations.   Most  of  the
various  sites  around  the  world  that are used  exclusively  for  sales and
distribution are leased.

   DENTSPLY  believes that its properties  and facilities are well  maintained
and are  generally  suitable  and adequate for the purposes for which they are
used.


Item 3.  Legal Proceedings

   DENTSPLY and its subsidiaries are from time to time parties to lawsuits
arising out of their respective operations.  The Company believes it is
remote that pending litigation to which DENTSPLY is a party will have a
material adverse effect upon its consolidated financial position or results
of operations.

   In June 1995, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of
Justice initiated an antitrust investigation regarding the policies and
conduct undertaken by the Company's Trubyte Division with respect to the
distribution of artificial teeth and related products.  On January 5, 1999,
the Department of Justice filed a complaint against the Company in the U.S.
District Court in Wilmington, Delaware alleging that the Company's tooth
distribution practices violate the antitrust laws and seeking an order for
the Company to discontinue its practices.  Three follow on private class
action suits on behalf of dentists, laboratories and denture patients in
seventeen states, respectively, who purchased Trubyte teeth or products
containing Trubyte teeth, were filed and transferred to the U.S. District
Court in Wilmington, Delaware.  The class action filed on behalf of the
dentists has been dismissed by the plaintiffs.  The private party suits seek
damages in an unspecified amount.  The Court has granted the Company's
motion on the lack of standing of the laboratory and patient class actions
to pursue damage claims.  Four private party class actions on behalf of
indirect purchasers were filed in California state court.  These cases are
based on allegations similar to those in the Department of Justice case.  In
response to the Company's motion, these cases have been consolidated in one
Judicial District in Los Angeles.  A similar private party action has been
filed in Florida.  The trial in the government's case was held in April and
May 2002, the post-trial briefing  occurred during the summer and the final
arguments were made in September of 2002.  The case is pending a decision by
the Federal District Court Judge who heard the case.  It is the Company's
position that the conduct and activities of the Trubyte division do not
violate the antitrust laws.

serving as the Company's  Chairman of its Board of  Directors.  The option was
granted  to  provide  an  additional  incentive  to Mr.  Borgelt to devote his
efforts to the future success of the Company.





D1




Directors Deferred Compensation Plan

      Effective  January  1,  1997,  the  Company   established  a  Directors'
Deferred  Compensation Plan (the "Deferred  Plan").  The Deferred Plan permits
non-employee  directors to elect to defer  receipt of directors  fees or other
compensation  for their  services as  directors.  Non-employee  directors  can
elect to have their  deferred  payments  administered  as a cash with interest
account  or a stock  unit  account.  Distributions  to a  director  under  the
Deferred  Plan  will  not be  made  to any  non-employee  director  until  the
non-employee  director  ceases to be a member of the Board of Directors.  Upon
ceasing to be a member of the Board of  Directors,  the deferred  non-employee
director  fees are paid based on an earlier  election  to have their  accounts
distributed immediately or in annual installments for up to ten (10) years.

Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan

      Effective  January  1,  1999,  the  Board of  Directors  of the  Company
adopted a Supplemental  Executive  Retirement  Plan (the "Plan").  The purpose
of the Plan is to provide additional  retirement  benefits for a limited group
of  management   employees  whom  the  Board   concluded  were  not  receiving
competitive  retirement  benefits.  No  actual  benefits  are  put  aside  for
participants  and the  participants  are general  creditors of the Company for
payment of the  benefits  upon  retirement  or  termination  from the Company.
Participants  can elect to have these  benefits  administered  as an  interest
bearing  cash  or  stock  unit  account.  Upon   retirement/termination,   the
participant  is paid  the  benefits  in  their  account  based  on an  earlier
election  to  have  their  accounts  distributed   immediately  or  in  annual
installments for up to five (5) years.


Item 13.  Certain Relationships and Related Transactions

   No relationships or transactions are required to be reported.


Item 14.  Controls and Procedures


(a)   As of March 12, 2003, the Company carried out an evaluation under the
      supervision and with the participation of the Company's management,
      including the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial
      Officer ("CFO"), of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure
      controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO
      concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures have
      been designed and are functioning effectively to provide reasonable
      assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company
      in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded,
      processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
      Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. A controls system,
      no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute
      assurance that the objectives of the controls systems are met, and no
      evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
      issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been
      detected.

(b)   Subsequent  to the date of the most recent  evaluation  of the Company's
      internal  controls,  there were no significant  changes in the Company's
      internal  controls,  including  any  corrective  actions  with regard to
      significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
