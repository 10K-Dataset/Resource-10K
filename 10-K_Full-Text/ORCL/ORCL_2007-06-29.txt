PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

We are the world’s largest enterprise software company. We
    develop, manufacture, market, distribute and service database
    and middleware software as well as applications software
    designed to help our customers manage and grow their business
    operations. We also provide support for the Linux open source
    operating system through our Oracle Unbreakable Linux Support
    program, which provides our customers with our industry-leading
    global support programs for Linux.

Our goal is to offer customers scalable, reliable, secure and
    integrated software systems that provide transactional
    efficiencies, adapt to an organization’s unique needs and
    allow better ways to access and manage information at a lower
    total cost of ownership. We seek to be an industry leader in
    each of the specific product categories in which we compete and
    to expand into new and emerging markets. In fiscal 2007, we
    focused on strengthening our competitive position and enhancing
    our existing portfolio of products and services as well as
    acquiring and integrating businesses.

An active acquisition program is an important element of our
    corporate strategy. In the last three fiscal years, we have
    invested over $25 billion, in the aggregate, to acquire a
    number of companies, products, services and technologies,
    including the acquisition of PeopleSoft, Inc., Siebel Systems,
    Inc. and Hyperion Solutions Corporation. Typically, the
    significant majority of our integration activities related to an
    acquisition are substantially complete in the United States
    within three to six months after the closing of the acquisition.
    We believe our acquisition program supports our long-term
    strategic direction, strengthens our competitive position,
    expands our customer base and provides greater scale to
    accelerate innovation, grow our earnings and increase
    stockholder value. We expect to continue to acquire companies,
    products, services and technologies.

Oracle Corporation was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware
    corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun
    in June 1977.

Software
    and Services

We are organized into two businesses, software and services,
    which are further divided into five operating segments. Our
    software business is comprised of two operating segments:
    (1) new software licenses and (2) software license
    updates and product support. Our services business is comprised
    of three operating segments: (1) consulting, (2) On
    Demand and (3) education. Our software and services
    businesses represented 79% and 21% of our total revenues,
    respectively, in fiscal 2007 and 80% and 20% of our total
    revenues, respectively, in both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005. See
    Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
    additional information related to our operating segments.



Software
    Business

New
    Software Licenses

New software licenses include the licensing of database and
    middleware software, which consists of Oracle Database and
    Oracle Fusion Middleware, as well as applications software. Our
    technology and business solutions are based on an internet model
    comprised of interconnected database servers, application
    servers, web servers and computers as well as mobile devices
    running web browsers. This architecture enables users to access
    business data and applications through a universally adopted web
    browser interface, while providing enterprises the most
    efficient and cost effective method of managing business
    information and applications.

In an internet model, database servers manage and protect the
    underlying business information, while application servers run
    the business applications that automate a myriad of business
    functions. We have focused on concepts such as global single
    instance application deployment that involve fewer, high quality
    databases of important business information, rather than dozens
    or hundreds of disparate databases that are difficult to
    synchronize and coordinate. Our integrated architecture provides
    high quality business information and can be adapted to the
    specific needs of any industry or application. Oracle technology
    operates on single server or clustered server configurations,
    and supports a choice of operating systems including Linux, UNIX
    and Windows. In fiscal 2007, we introduced a program to support
    the Linux open source operating system for our customers’
    information technology (IT) platforms.

New software license revenues include fees earned from granting
    customers licenses to use our software products and exclude
    revenues derived from software license updates and product
    support. The standard end user software license agreement for
    our products provides for an initial fee to use the product in
    perpetuity based on a maximum number of processors, named users
    or other metrics. We also have other types of software license
    agreements restricted by the number of employees or the license
    term. New software license revenues represented 33%, 34% and 35%
    of total revenues in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Database
    and Middleware Software

Our grid software provides a cost-effective, high-performance
    platform for running and managing business applications for
    small and mid-size businesses and large global enterprises. With
    an increasing focus by enterprises on reducing their total cost
    of IT infrastructure, Oracle’s grid software is designed to
    accommodate demanding, non-stop business environments, using
    clusters of low cost servers and storage that can incrementally
    scale as required. The unique ability to assign computing
    resources as required simplifies our customers’ computing
    capacity, planning and procurement in order to support all of
    their business applications. With an Oracle grid infrastructure,
    our customers can lower their investment in IT hardware, reduce
    their risk of IT infrastructure downtime and easily cope with
    sudden increases in demand on their IT environments during high
    traffic periods. New software license revenues from database and
    middleware products represented 71%, 73% and 81% of new software
    license revenues in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Database

As the world’s most popular database, Oracle’s
    relational database enables the secure storage, manipulation and
    retrieval of all forms of data including structured data that
    resides in business applications, XML data, analytics data,
    spatial data and other unstructured data such as documents,
    spreadsheets and images. Designed for enterprise grid computing,
    the Oracle Database is available in four editions: Express
    Edition, Standard Edition One, Standard Edition and Enterprise
    Edition. All editions are built using the same underlying code,
    which means that database applications can easily scale from
    small, single processor servers to clusters of multi-processor
    servers.

Options to Oracle Database Enterprise Edition are available to
    meet specific requirements in the areas of performance and
    scalability, high availability, security and compliance, data
    warehousing, unstructured data integration and systems
    management. Examples of these options include: Oracle Real
    Application Clusters, which consolidates a single, scalable and
    fault tolerant database that is shared across an interconnected
    cluster of servers (also available on our other database
    editions); Oracle Partitioning, which supports large transaction
    processing and business intelligence database systems and cost
    effectively manages data throughout its lifecycle; and Oracle



Warehouse Builder connectors, which design, build and populate
    data warehouses from a variety of legacy repositories.

Enterprise
    Manager

Oracle Enterprise Manager is designed to deliver top-down
    applications management. Our customers use Oracle Enterprise
    Manager to monitor and manage their applications and underlying
    software infrastructure, including both Oracle and non-Oracle
    infrastructure products. Oracle Enterprise Manager can be used
    to manage packaged applications, such as Siebel, PeopleSoft,
    Oracle

E-Business

Suite or custom applications including service-oriented
    applications. In addition to managing Oracle software
    infrastructure products including the Oracle Database and Oracle
    Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager also supports
    third-party infrastructure products.

Oracle Enterprise Manager is designed to monitor service levels
    and performance, automate tasks, manage configuration
    information, and provide change management in a unified way
    across groups of computers or grids. Oracle Enterprise
    Manager’s provisioning automates the discovery, tracking
    and scheduling of software patches and allows IT administrators
    to apply patches without taking their system down. Additionally,
    IT administrators can manage systems from anywhere through an
    HTML browser or through wireless PDAs.

Secure
    Enterprise Search

Oracle Secure Enterprise Search provides an internet-like search
    experience to users searching secure content inside the
    enterprise. Oracle Secure Enterprise Search indexes and searches
    public, private and shared content across internal and external
    web sites, databases, file servers, document repositories,
    enterprise content management systems, applications and portals.
    Oracle Secure Enterprise Search has built-in functionality that
    permits users to see only search results leading to information
    for which they have authorized access. The product features a
    simple web interface allowing for efficient administration and
    management. Additionally, users can access the search engine
    through web-based user interfaces and perform traditional
    keyword searches that provide results in a format similar to
    conventional web searches.

Middleware

Oracle Fusion Middleware is a broad product family that forms a
    reliable and scalable foundation on which customers can build,
    deploy and integrate business applications and automate their
    business processes. Oracle Fusion Middleware includes Oracle
    Application Server, Oracle Identity and Access Management Suite,
    Oracle Webcenter Suite, Oracle Business Intelligence Suite,
    Oracle Developer Suite, Oracle Service Oriented Architecture
    Suite, Oracle Enterprise Content Management Suite and Oracle
    Business Process Analysis Suite, among others. Oracle Fusion
    Middleware is designed to protect our customers’ IT
    investments and work with both Oracle and non-Oracle Database,
    Applications and Middleware products through its hot-pluggable
    architecture and adherence to industry standards such as J2EE
    and Business Process Execution Language (BPEL).

By using Oracle Fusion Middleware, our customers increase their
    capacity to adapt to business changes rapidly, reduce their
    risks related to security and compliance, increase user
    productivity, and drive better business decisions. Specifically,
    Oracle Fusion Middleware enables customers to easily integrate
    heterogeneous business applications, automate business
    processes, simplify security and compliance, manage lifecycle of
    documents and get actionable, targeted business intelligence,
    while continuing to utilize their existing IT systems. In
    addition, Oracle Fusion Middleware supports multiple development
    languages and tools, which allows developers to build and deploy
    web services, web sites, portals and web-based applications.
    Oracle’s Fusion Middleware is used to support Oracle
    applications, as well as other enterprise applications and
    independent software vendors that build their own custom
    applications.

Application
    Server

The foundation of Oracle Fusion Middleware is Oracle Application
    Server. Designed for grid computing, Oracle Application Server
    incorporates clustering and caching technology, which increases
    application reliability, performance, security and scalability.
    Oracle Application Server also provides a complete integration
    platform that is designed to simplify and accelerate business,
    application and data integration projects.



Identity and
    Access Management Suite

The Oracle Identity and Access Management suite makes it easier
    for our customers to manage multiple user identities, provision
    users in multiple enterprise applications and systems and manage
    access privileges for customers, employees and partners. Our
    customers use Oracle Identity and Access Management Suite to
    secure their information from potential threats. In addition,
    our customers also use Oracle Identity and Access Management
    Suite to increase compliance levels, while lowering the total
    cost of their compliance efforts.

Webcenter
    Suite

Oracle Webcenter Suite enables personalized, task oriented web
    applications and portal sites to be rapidly developed and
    deployed, all with single sign-on access and security. Our
    customers can assemble portal sites using page regions or
    portlets, which are reusable interface components that provide
    access to web-based resources such as applications, business
    intelligence reports, syndicated content feeds and outsourced
    software services. With the Oracle Communications and Mobility
    Server option, such web and portal applications support mobile
    and Voice-over-IP (VoIP) clients.

Business
    Intelligence Suite

Oracle Business Intelligence Suite is a family of enterprise
    business intelligence products that unites Oracle’s
    business intelligence and middleware technology with Siebel
    Business Analytics to offer our customers enterprise-wide
    business intelligence infrastructure and tools. Based on
    Oracle’s hot-pluggable business intelligence
    infrastructure, these products deliver to our customers a full
    spectrum of business intelligence requirements, including
    interactive dashboards, ad hoc query and analysis, proactive
    intelligence and alerts, enterprise reporting, real-time
    predictive intelligence and mobile analytics. In April 2007, we
    acquired Hyperion, a market leader in enterprise performance
    management and business intelligence products. As a result of
    the Hyperion acquisition, we now offer our customers the most
    comprehensive, integrated, end-to-end enterprise performance
    management system available, spanning consolidation, planning,
    operational analytic applications, business intelligence tools,
    reporting, and data integration, all on a unified business
    intelligence platform.

Current editions of the Oracle Business Intelligence Suite
    include the Oracle Business Intelligence Suite Enterprise
    Edition and Oracle Business Intelligence Suite Standard
    Edition. Oracle Business Intelligence Suite Enterprise
    Edition is open to any enterprise data source and optimized for
    Oracle or non-Oracle databases, allowing customers to integrate
    data from all their enterprise applications, including third
    party and customer applications. Oracle Business Intelligence

    set of service infrastructure components for creating,
    deploying, and managing SOAs, including Oracle Developer, Oracle
    BPEL Process Manager, Oracle Web



Services Manager, Oracle Business Rules Engine, Oracle
    Business Activity Monitoring, and Oracle Enterprise Service Bus.
    Oracle SOA Suite enables services to be created, managed and
    orchestrated into composite applications and reconfigurable
    business processes, reducing development time and costs and
    increasing flexibility and response time. Oracle SOA Suite is
    hot-pluggable, enabling customers to easily extend and evolve
    their architectures instead of replacing existing investments.

Enterprise
    Content Management Suite

Oracle Enterprise Content Management suite provides a
    comprehensive set of capabilities to create, publish, share,
    archive and retain documents, manage business process flows
    involving these documents as well as manage information access
    rights to these documents. It supports an extensive set of
    document and image formats.

Applications
    Software

Our applications strategy is designed to provide customers with
    a complete industry business process automation footprint,
    supported by a robust, standards-based technology platform.
    Central to that strategy is our commitment to offer our
    customers that purchase software license updates and support
    contracts a choice as to when they wish to upgrade to any of our
    existing or future technology offerings. Until our customers
    upgrade, we protect their investments in their applications by
    providing them lifetime support, product enhancements and
    upgrades. New technologies such as Oracle Fusion Middleware,
    Oracle Business Intelligence Suite, and Oracle WebCenter Suite
    are designed to help our customers extend the benefits of their
    investment in Oracle Applications, to reduce their investment
    risk, and to support their evolution to the next generation of
    enterprise software that best fits their needs.

Our applications combine business functionality with innovative
    technologies such as role-based analytics, secure search,
    identity management, self-service, and workflow to deliver
    business intelligence and insights, adaptive industry processes,
    and a superior ownership experience. Our applications enable
    efficient management of all core business functions, including
    customer relationship management (CRM), enterprise performance
    management (EPM), enterprise resource planning (ERP) and
    industry-specific applications. Oracle applications are offered
    as integrated suites or available on a component basis, and all
    are built on open architectures and are designed for flexible
    configuration and open, multi-vendor integration. Our
    applications are available in multiple languages, and support a
    broad range of location specific requirements, enabling
    companies to support both global and local business practices
    and legal requirements.

Customer
    Relationship Management (CRM)

We offer a complete set of CRM applications that manage all of
    the business processes and associated systems that touch a
    customer, including: billing and delivery; sales solutions that
    provide a single repository for customer and supply chain
    information; and service solutions that increase customer
    satisfaction by providing visibility into customer billing and
    order information.

Enterprise
    Performance Management (EPM)

We offer a full spectrum of open, industry-specific analytic
    applications with capabilities such as enterprise performance
    management, interactive dashboarding, and embedded analytic
    functionality for delivering insight across the enterprise. Our
    Siebel business analytics solution is tailored to 20 industries,
    giving customers the ability to monitor, analyze, and act upon
    intelligence while providing end-to-end visibility into company
    operations and financial performance. With our acquisition of
    Hyperion in April 2007, we added complementary products to
    Oracle’s business intelligence offerings, including a
    leading open enterprise planning system, financial consolidation
    products, and a multi-source OLAP server. Our acquisition of
    Hyperion enables us to offer our customers an integrated,
    end-to-end EPM system that spans planning, consolidation,
    operational analytic applications, business intelligence tools,
    reporting, and data integration, all on a unified business
    intelligence platform.

Enterprise
    Resource Planning (ERP)

Companies use our ERP applications to automate and integrate a
    variety of their key global business processes including
    manufacturing, order entry, accounts receivable and payable,
    general ledger, purchasing, warehousing,



transportation and human resources. Our ERP applications combine
    business functionality with innovative technologies, such as
    workflow and self-service applications, to enable companies to
    lower the cost of their business operations by providing their
    customers, suppliers and employees with self-service internet
    access to both transaction processing and critical business
    information. Our ERP applications are available in multiple
    languages and currencies, enabling companies to support both
    global and local business practices and legal requirements.

Industry
    Applications

Our applications can be tailored to offer customers a variety of
    industry-specific solutions. As part of our strategy, we strive
    to ensure that our applications portfolio addresses the major
    industry-influenced technology challenges of customers in key
    industries. With our acquisition of Siebel, we gained expertise
    in the vertical markets in which Siebel offered industry
    solutions. We have also expanded our offerings in a number of
    other key industries we view as strategic to our future growth,
    most notably in retail with our acquisitions of Retek, Inc. and
    several other companies; in banking and financial institutions
    with our acquisition of i-flex solutions limited; and in
    telecommunications with our acquisitions of Portal Software,
    Inc. and MetaSolv, Inc. These acquired industry applications are
    in addition to industry applications we developed for
    healthcare, life sciences, manufacturing, education,
    professional services, public sector and utilities.

New software license revenues from applications software
    represented 29%, 27% and 19% of new software license revenues in
    fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Applications
    Unlimited

In fiscal 2006, we announced we would continue to invest in
    enhancements to our current Oracle

E-Business

Suite, PeopleSoft Enterprise, JD Edwards EnterpriseOne, JD
    Edwards World and Siebel applications products beyond the
    delivery of Oracle Fusion Applications (described below). In
    January 2007, we delivered five new releases of these existing
    product lines, incorporating new products and customer-driven
    enhancements in areas such as global support, localization,
    middleware, and analytics. With the Applications Unlimited
    program, customers will not be required to migrate to Oracle
    Fusion Applications and may choose to stay with their current
    product lines with dedicated development and support teams.

Fusion
    Applications

Oracle Fusion Applications, currently in development, represent
    the next generation of Oracle Applications, based on a
    service-oriented platform, built on open industry standards,
    extendable by customers and partners and interoperable with
    third party and existing installations. Fusion applications are
    being designed to leverage the best functionality and combine
    the best features, flows and usability traits of our legacy and
    acquired application products into one product line. We believe
    the resulting suite of applications will deliver a superior
    ownership experience through improved usability, adaptive
    business process automation, built-in business intelligence and
    industry-specific capabilities.

Software
    License Updates and Product Support

We seek to protect and enhance our customers’ current
    investments in Oracle technology and applications by offering
    lifetime support, product enhancements and upgrades. Software
    license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified
    software product upgrades and maintenance releases and patches
    released during the term of the support period. Product support
    includes internet and telephone access to technical support
    personnel located in our global support centers, as well as
    internet access to technical content. Software license updates
    and product support are generally priced as a percentage of the
    new software license fees. Substantially all of our customers
    purchase software license updates and product support when they
    acquire new software licenses. In addition, substantially all of
    our customers renew their software license updates and product
    support contracts annually.

    consulting services include business strategy and analysis;
    business process optimization; product implementation,
    enhancement, and upgrades; and ongoing managed services. These
    services help our customers to achieve measurable business
    results, manage their total cost of ownership, and reduce their
    deployment risk.

Oracle Consulting deploys professionals globally utilizing our
    blended delivery capabilities, including use of onsite
    consultants and personnel from our offshore delivery centers and
    applications solutions centers to leverage economies of scale
    for our customers. Consulting revenues represented 16% of total
    revenues in fiscal 2007 and 15% of total revenues in both fiscal
    2006 and fiscal 2005.

On
    Demand

On Demand includes Oracle On Demand, CRM On Demand and Advanced
    Customer Services. Oracle On Demand provides multi-featured
    software and hardware management, and maintenance services for
    customers that deploy our database, middleware and applications
    software at our data center facilities or at a site of our
    customer’s choosing. We recently expanded our Oracle On
    Demand offerings to include our PeopleSoft, Siebel Business
    Intelligence and retail applications. CRM On Demand is a service
    offering that provides our customers with our Siebel CRM
    Software functionality delivered via a hosted solution that we
    manage. Advanced Customer Services consists of solution support
    centers, business critical assistance, technical account
    management, expert services, configuration and performance
    analysis, personalized support and annual

on-site

technical services. On Demand revenues represented 3% of total
    revenues in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005.

Education

We provide training to customers, partners and employees as part
    of our mission of accelerating the adoption of our technology
    around the world. We currently offer thousands of courses
    covering all of Oracle’s product offerings. Our training is
    provided primarily through public and private instructor-led
    classroom events, but is also made available through a variety
    of online courses and self paced media training on CD-ROMs. In
    addition, we also offer a certification program certifying
    database administrators, developers and implementers. Oracle
    University also offers User Adoption Services designed to
    provide comprehensive training services to help customers get
    the most out of their investment in Oracle. Education revenues
    represented 2% of total revenues in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005.

Marketing
    and Sales

Sales
    Distribution Channels

We directly market and sell our products and services primarily
    through our subsidiary sales and service organizations. In the
    United States our sales and service employees are based in our
    headquarters and in field offices throughout the United States.
    Outside the United States, our international subsidiaries
    license and support our products in their local countries as
    well as within other foreign countries where we do not operate
    through a direct sales subsidiary.



We also market our products worldwide through indirect channels.
    The companies that comprise our indirect channel network are
    members of the Oracle PartnerNetwork. The Oracle PartnerNetwork
    is a global program that manages our business relationships with
    a large, broad- based network of companies, including
    independent software vendors, system integrators and resellers
    who deliver innovative solutions and services based upon our
    products. By offering our partners’ access to our premier
    products, educational information, technical services, marketing
    and sales support, the OPN program extends our market reach by
    providing our partners with the resources they need to be
    successful in delivering solutions to customers globally.

International
    Markets

We sell our products and provide services worldwide. Our
    geographic coverage allows us to draw on business and technical
    expertise from a worldwide workforce, provides stability to our
    operations and revenue streams to offset geography-specific
    economic trends and offers us an opportunity to take advantage
    of new markets for products. A summary of our domestic and
    international revenues and long-lived assets is set forth in
    Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Cyclicality
    and Seasonality

General economic conditions have an impact on our business and
    financial results. The markets in which we sell our products and
    services have, at times, experienced weak economic conditions
    that have negatively affected revenues. Our quarterly results
    reflect distinct seasonality in the sale of our products and
    services, as our revenues are typically highest in our fourth
    fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter. See
    “Quarterly Results of Operations” in Item 7 for a
    more complete description of the cyclicality and seasonality of
    our revenues and expenses.

Customers

Our customer base consists of a significant number of businesses
    of many sizes and industries, government agencies, educational
    institutions and resellers. No single customer accounted for 10%
    or more of revenues in fiscal 2007, 2006 or 2005.

Competition

The enterprise software industry is intensely competitive and
    evolving rapidly. We compete in various segments of this
    industry including database software, middleware (business
    intelligence, application integration, portal server, J2EE
    application server, development tools and identity management),
    collaboration, development tools, enterprise applications,
    consulting/systems integration and operating systems, among
    others. Total cost of ownership, performance, functionality,
    ease of use, standards-compliance, product reliability, security
    and quality of technical support are key competitive factors
    that face us in each of the areas in which we compete. Our
    customers are also demanding less complexity and lower cost in
    the implementation, sourcing, integration and ongoing
    maintenance of their enterprise software, which has led
    increasingly to our product offerings (database, middleware and
    applications) being viewed as a “stack” of software
    designed to work together. Our product sales (and the relative
    strength of our products versus our competitors) are also
    affected by the broader “platform” competition between
    industry standard Java (J2EE) and Microsoft Corporation’s
    .NET programming environments and by operating system
    competition between Windows Server, Unix (Sun Solaris, HP-UX and
    IBM AIX) and Linux. Open source alternatives to commercial
    software, such as MySQL AB in database, Red Hat, Inc. (JBoss) in
    middleware, and SugarCRM Inc. in applications, are also
    impacting the competitive environment. These products are
    typically offered free of charge and are readily available over
    the internet. Finally, “on demand” offerings, such as
    those from salesforce.com, continue to alter the competitive
    landscape.

In the sale of database software and related tools, scalability,
    reliability, availability and security are key competitive
    differentiators for us. Our competitors include International
    Business Machines Corporation (IBM), Microsoft, Sybase, Inc.,
    NCR Corporation’s Teradata division, SAS Institute, Inc.,
    Informatica Corporation, and the open source databases, MySQL
    and PostgreSQL, among others. Our ability to continually
    innovate and differentiate our database offering has enabled us
    to maintain our leading position in database software over our
    competitors.



In the sale of middleware products, our offerings include
    business intelligence, application integration, business process
    management (BPM), service oriented architecture, portal, J2EE
    application server, development tools and identity management
    software. Our ability to offer a full range of rich
    functionality in a standards-based, open architecture has been a
    key competitive differentiator. Our competitors include IBM,
    Microsoft, BEA Systems, Inc., SAP AG, Sun Microsystems Inc.,
    Sybase and open source vendors such as Red Hat (JBoss), Apache
    Geronimo and ObjectWeb, as well as other competitors in each
    element of our packaged functions. Business intelligence
    competitors include Actuate Corporation, Business Objects S.A.,
    Cognos Incorporated, MicroStrategy, Inc., SAS Institute, TIBCO
    Software, Inc. (Spotfire), open source vendors Netezza
    Corporation, and others. Application server competitors include
    Borland Software Corporation, Fujitsu Software Corporation,
    Hitachi Software Engineering Co., Ltd., Adobe Systems
    Incorporated and others. Enterprise Application Integration
    competitors include Software AG (webMethods), TIBCO, IONA
    Technologies PLC, Sonic Software Corporation, Sun Microsystems
    and others. BPM competitors include Lombardi Software, Inc.,
    Savvion, Inc., Pegasystems Inc. and others. Enterprise portal
    vendors include Vignette Corporation, Novell, Inc., Fujitsu, and
    others. Identity management vendors include IBM, CA, Inc., Sun
    Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard Company, among others. Open
    source vendors Red Hat and Novell are also increasingly bundling
    middleware functionality with their respective Linux
    distributions. Our middleware solutions have experienced rapid
    growth in recent years relative to our competitors. In the sale
    of collaboration products, we compete primarily with Microsoft
    (Exchange/Outlook), IBM (Domino/Notes), Novell (Groupwise) and
    Cisco Systems, Inc. (WebEx). In addition, we compete in the
    related content management markets with EMC Corporation
    (Documentum), IBM (FileNet), Percussion Software, Inc. and
    Vignette, among others.

In the sale of development tools, ease of use,
    standards-compliance and the level of abstraction (automated
    code generation) are key competitive differentiators. We compete
    against IBM (WebSphere Studio), Microsoft 8 (VisualStudio.NET),
    Sun Microsystems (Sun Studio), Sybase (PowerBuilder) and others,
    including Eclipse Foundation, Inc. (Eclipse), an open source
    vendor. The success of our development tools is closely related
    to the relative popularity of our platform (database and
    middleware) compared to our competitors, as well as the larger
    competition between Java and Microsoft’s .NET.

The sale of applications software, in particular, is changing
    rapidly due to the development and deployment of service
    oriented architectures and web services, application integration
    middleware as well as “software as a service”
    offerings, such as those from salesforce.com and RightNow
    Technologies Inc. in CRM applications. As a result of our
    acquisitions of PeopleSoft and Siebel, we presently offer
    several product lines, which are suited for different needs of
    customers in different industries. We compete against SAP,
    Lawson Software, Inc., Infor Global Solutions GmbH (SSA Global
    Technologies, Extensity), Microsoft Dynamics (Great Plains,
    Solomon, Axapta, Navision), Sage, Inc. and many other
    application providers. These include numerous point solution
    providers such as Epicor Software Corporation (accounting),
    SunGard Data Systems Inc. (treasury), Kronos Incorporated (time
    and attendance), Taleo Corporation (recruitment), Callidus
    Software Inc. (compensation), Automatic Data Processing, Inc.
    (HR, payroll and business process outsourcing), Ariba, Inc.
    (procurement), i2 Technologies, Inc. (supply chain
    management), IBM (MRO Software) (enterprise asset management),
    DSCI Corporation (logistics), Broadvision, Inc. (marketing),
    Kana Software, Inc. (analytics), salesforce.com (sales force
    automation) and Amdocs Limited (customer service). In addition,
    we compete with numerous specialized applications providers
    focused in specific vertical industries, such as financial
    services, retail and telecommunications. SAP is a major
    competitor in every industry vertical. Specialized industry
    vertical solutions such as retail and banking are also
    influenced heavily by the presence of customized solutions and
    in-house development.

With SOA, our packaged applications also compete with custom
    solutions either developed in-house or by large systems
    integrators such as Accenture Ltd. or IBM Global Services. Our
    pre-packaged applications also compete against business process
    outsourcers including ADP, Fidelity Investments, Ceridian
    Corporation, Hewitt-Cyborg Limited and others. Our application
    products are architected around a single database model, which
    we believe is a key differentiator between our most significant
    competitors and us.

In the sale of operating systems, we introduced a support and
    service offering for Red Hat’s open source Linux operating
    system in fiscal 2007. This puts us in direct competition with
    Red Hat, Novell, Canonical Ltd. (Ubuntu) and others in the sale
    of support for the Linux operating system; with IBM, Sun, H-P
    and others in the sale of Unix operating systems; and with
    Microsoft in the sale of Windows server operating systems.



In the sale of consulting and systems integration services, we
    both partner with and compete against Accenture, Electronic Data
    Systems Corporation, IBM Global Services, Bearing Point, Inc.,
    CapGemini Group and many others.

Research
    and Development

We develop the majority of our products internally. In addition,
    we have acquired technology through business acquisitions. We
    also purchase or license intellectual property rights in certain
    circumstances. Internal development allows us to maintain
    technical control over the design and development of our
    products. We have a number of United States and foreign patents
    and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our
    products and technology. While we believe that our patents have
    value, no single patent is essential to us or to any of our
    principal business segments.

Research and development expenditures were $2.2 billion,
    $1.9 billion and $1.5 billion, or 12%, 13% and 13% of
    total revenues, in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. As
    a percentage of new software license revenues, research and
    development expenditures were 37%, 38% and 37% in fiscal 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. Rapid technological advances in
    hardware and software development, evolving standards in
    computer hardware and software technology, changing customer
    needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements
    characterize the software markets in which we compete. We plan
    on continuing to dedicate a significant amount of resources to
    research and development efforts to maintain and improve our
    current product offerings including our database, middleware and
    applications software.

Employees

As of May 31, 2007, we employed 74,674 full-time
    employees, including 16,902 in sales and marketing, 6,775 in
    license updates and product support, 25,068 in services, 18,130
    in research and development and 7,799 in general and
    administrative positions. Of these employees, 25,990 were
    located in the United States and 48,684 were employed
    internationally. None of our employees in the United States is
    represented by a labor union; however, in certain international
    subsidiaries workers councils represent our employees.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

We operate in a rapidly changing economic and technological
    environment that presents numerous risks, many of which are
    driven by factors that we cannot control or predict. The
    following discussion, as well as our “Critical Accounting
    Policies and Estimates” discussion in Item 7,
    highlights some of these risks.

Economic, political and market conditions can adversely
    affect our revenue growth and
    profitability.

Our business is influenced by
    a range of factors that are beyond our control and that we have
    no comparative advantage in forecasting. These include:

•

general economic and business conditions;

•

the overall demand for enterprise software and services;

•

governmental budgetary constraints or shifts in government
    spending priorities; and

•

general political developments.

A general weakening of the global economy, or a curtailment in
    government or corporate spending, could delay and decrease
    customer purchases. In addition, the war on terrorism, the war
    in Iraq and the potential for other hostilities in various parts
    of the world, potential public health crises, as well as natural
    disasters, continue to contribute to a climate of economic and
    political uncertainty that could adversely affect our revenue
    growth and results of operations. These factors generally have
    the strongest effect on our sales of software licenses, and to a
    lesser extent, also affect our renewal rates for software
    license updates and product support.

We may fail to achieve our financial forecasts due to
    inaccurate sales forecasts or other
    factors.

Our revenues, and particularly our
    new software license revenues, are difficult to forecast, and as
    a result our quarterly operating results can fluctuate
    substantially. We use a “pipeline” system, a common
    industry practice, to forecast sales and trends in our business.
    Our sales personnel monitor the status of all proposals and
    estimate when a customer will make a purchase decision and the
    dollar amount of the sale. These estimates are aggregated
    periodically to generate a sales pipeline. Our pipeline
    estimates can prove to be unreliable both in a particular
    quarter and over a longer period of time, in part because the
    “conversion rate” of the pipeline into contracts can
    be very difficult to estimate. A contraction in the conversion
    rate, or in the pipeline itself, could cause us to plan or
    budget incorrectly and adversely affect our business or results
    of operations. In particular, a slowdown in information
    technology spending or economic conditions generally can reduce
    the conversion rate in particular periods as purchasing
    decisions are delayed, reduced in amount or cancelled. The
    conversion rate can also be affected by the tendency of some of
    our customers to wait until the end of a fiscal period in the
    hope of obtaining more favorable terms, which can also impede
    our ability to negotiate and execute these contracts in a timely
    manner. In addition, for newly acquired companies, we have
    limited ability to predict how their pipelines will convert into
    sales or revenues for one or two quarters following the
    acquisition and their conversion rate post-acquisition may be
    quite different from their historical conversion rate. Because a
    substantial portion of our new software license revenue
    contracts is completed in the latter part of a quarter, and our
    cost structure is largely fixed in the short term, revenue
    shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on
    our profitability. A delay in even a small number of large new
    software license transactions could cause our quarterly new
    software licenses revenues to fall significantly short of our
    predictions.

Our success depends upon our ability to develop new
    products and services, integrate acquired products and services
    and enhance our existing products and
    services.

Rapid technological advances and
    evolving standards in computer hardware, software development
    and communications infrastructure, changing and increasingly
    sophisticated customer needs and frequent new product
    introductions and enhancements characterize the enterprise
    software market in which we compete. If we are unable to develop
    new products and services, or to enhance and improve our
    products and support services in a timely manner or to position

and/or

price
    our products and services to meet market demand, customers may
    not buy new software licenses or renew software license updates
    and product support. In addition, information technology
    standards from both consortia and formal standards-setting
    forums as well as de facto marketplace standards are rapidly
    evolving. We cannot provide any assurance that the standards on
    which we choose to develop new products will allow us to compete
    effectively for business opportunities in emerging areas.



We are developing a next generation applications platform that
    is planned to combine the best features, flows and usability
    traits of our legacy and acquired applications. We have also
    announced that we intend to extend the life of many of our
    acquired applications and will continue to provide long-term
    support for our acquired products, both of which require us to
    dedicate resources. If we do not develop and release these new
    or enhanced products and services within the anticipated time
    frames, if there is a delay in market acceptance of a new,
    enhanced or acquired product line or service, if we do not
    timely optimize complementary product lines and services or if
    we fail to adequately integrate, support or enhance acquired
    application lines or services, our business may be adversely
    affected.

Acquisitions present many risks, and we may not realize
    the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the
    time of any transaction.

In the past three
    fiscal years, we have invested over $25 billion, in the
    aggregate, to acquire a number of companies, products, services
    and technologies. An active acquisition program is an important
    element of our overall corporate strategy and we expect to
    continue to make similar acquisitions in the future. Risks we
    may face in connection with our acquisition program include:

•

our ongoing business may be disrupted and our management’s
    attention may be diverted by acquisition, transition or
    integration activities;

•

an acquisition may not further our business strategy as we
    expected, or we may pay more than the acquired company or assets
    are worth;

•

our due diligence process may fail to identify all of the
    problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an
    acquired company or technology, including issues with the
    company’s intellectual property, product quality or product
    architecture, revenue recognition or other accounting practices
    or employee, customer or partner issues;

•

we may not realize the anticipated increase in our revenues if a
    larger than predicted number of customers decline to renew
    software license updates and product support, if we are unable
    to sell the acquired products to our customer base or if
    contract models of an acquired company do not allow us to
    recognize revenues on a timely basis;

•

we may assume pre-existing contractual relationships of acquired
    companies that we would not have otherwise entered into, and
    exiting or modifying such relationships may be costly to us or
    disruptive to customers;

•

we may face litigation or other claims in connection with, or
    may inherit claims or litigation risk as a result of, an
    acquisition, including claims from terminated employees,
    customers or other third parties;

•

our relationship with current and new employees, customers,
    partners and distributors could be impaired;

•

we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies or
    products with our existing product lines and maintaining uniform
    standards, controls, procedures and policies;

•

we may have multiple and overlapping product lines as a result
    of our acquisitions that are offered, priced and supported
    differently, which could cause customer confusion and delays;

•

we may have higher than anticipated costs in continuing support
    and development of acquired products;

•

we may assume pre-existing liabilities, whether known or
    unknown, of acquired companies which could be material;

•

we may be unable to obtain required approvals from governmental
    authorities under competition and antitrust laws on a timely
    basis, if it all, which could, among other things, prevent us
    from completing a transaction;

•

we may have to delay or not proceed with a substantial
    acquisition if we cannot obtain the necessary funding to
    complete the acquisition in a timely manner;

•

our use of cash to pay for acquisitions may limit other
    potential uses of our cash, including stock repurchases and
    retirement of outstanding indebtedness;



•

we may significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and
    debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for
    an acquisition; result of unforeseen difficulties in our
    integration activities;

•

we may have legal and tax exposures or lose anticipated tax
    benefits as a result of unforeseen difficulties in our
    integration activities;

•

we may be unable to obtain timely approvals from, or may
    otherwise have certain limitations, restrictions, penalties or
    other sanctions imposed on us by, worker councils or similar
    bodies under applicable employment laws as a result of an
    acquisition, which could adversely affect our integration plans
    in certain jurisdictions; and

•

to the extent that we issue a significant amount of equity
    securities in connection with future acquisitions, existing
    stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease.

The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material
    adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial
    condition or cash flows, particularly in the case of a larger
    acquisition or several concurrent acquisitions.

We may not be able to protect our intellectual property
    rights.

We rely on copyright, trademark,
    patent and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures,
    controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual
    property rights. Despite our efforts, these protections may be
    limited. Unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse
    engineer portions of our products or otherwise obtain and use
    our intellectual property. Any patents owned by us may be
    invalidated, circumvented or challenged. Any of our pending or
    future patent applications, whether or not being currently
    challenged, may not be issued with the scope of the claims we
    seek, if at all. In addition, the laws of some countries do not
    provide the same level of protection of our intellectual
    property rights as do the laws and courts of the United States.
    If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against
    unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropriation, we may
    not remain competitive.

Third parties may claim infringement or misuse of
    intellectual property rights and/ or breach of license agreement
    provisions.

We periodically receive notices
    from others claiming infringement, or other misuse of their
    intellectual property rights

and/or

breach of our agreements with them. We expect the number of such
    claims will increase as the number of products and competitors
    in our industry segments grows, the functionality of products
    overlap, the use and support of third-party code (including open
    source code) becomes more prevalent in the software industry,
    and the volume of issued software patents continues to increase.
    Responding to any such claim, regardless of its validity, could:

•

be time-consuming, costly

and/or

result in litigation;

•

divert management’s time and attention from developing our
    business;

•

require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and
    licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable;

•

require us to stop selling or to redesign certain of our
    products;

•

require us to release source code to third parties, possibly
    under open source license terms;

•

require us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our
    customers; or

•

otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations,
    financial condition or cash flows.

A patent infringement case is discussed under Note 21 in
    our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

We may need to change our pricing models to compete
    successfully.

The intensely competitive
    markets in which we compete can put pressure on us to reduce our
    prices. If our competitors offer deep discounts on certain
    products or services, we may need to lower prices or offer other
    favorable terms in order to compete successfully. Any such
    changes would likely reduce margins and could adversely affect
    operating results. Our software license updates and product
    support fees are generally priced as a percentage of our new
    license fees. Our competitors may offer a lower percentage
    pricing on product updates and support, which could put pressure
    on us to further discount our new license prices. Any
    broad-based change to our prices and pricing policies could
    cause new software license and services revenues to decline or
    be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers
    adjust to the new pricing



policies. Some of our competitors may bundle software products
    for promotional purposes or as a long-term pricing strategy or
    provide guarantees of prices and product implementations. These
    practices could, over time, significantly constrain the prices
    that we can charge for our products. If we do not adapt our
    pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our
    products, our new software license revenues could decrease.
    Additionally, increased distribution of applications through
    application service providers may reduce the average price for
    our products or adversely affect other sales of our products,
    reducing new software license revenues unless we can offset
    price reductions with volume increases or lower spending. The
    increase in open source software distribution may also cause us
    to change our pricing models.

We may be unable to compete effectively in a range of
    markets within the highly competitive software industry.

Many vendors develop and market databases, internet
    application server products, application development tools,
    business applications, collaboration products and business
    intelligence products that compete with our offerings. In
    addition, several companies offer business process outsourcing
    (BPO) as a competitive alternative to buying software and
    customer interest in BPO solutions is increasing. Some of these
    competitors have greater financial or technical resources than
    we do. Our competitors that offer business applications and
    application server products may influence a customer’s
    purchasing decision for the underlying database in an effort to
    persuade potential customers not to acquire our products. We
    could lose market share if our competitors introduce new
    competitive products, add new functionality, acquire competitive
    products, reduce prices or form strategic alliances with other
    companies. Vendors that offer BPO solutions may persuade our
    customers not to purchase our products. We may also face
    increasing competition from open source software initiatives, in
    which competitors may provide software and intellectual property
    free. Existing or new competitors could gain market share in any
    of our markets at our expense.

Our periodic sales force restructurings can be
    disruptive.

We continue to rely heavily on
    our direct sales force. We have in the past restructured or made
    other adjustments to our sales force in response to management
    changes, product changes, performance issues, acquisitions and
    other internal and external considerations. In the past, sales
    force restructurings have generally resulted in a temporary lack
    of focus and reduced productivity; these effects could recur in
    connection with future acquisitions and other restructurings and
    our revenues could be negatively affected.

Disruptions of our indirect sales channel could affect our
    future operating results.

Our indirect
    channel network is comprised primarily of resellers, system
    integrators/implementers, consultants, education providers,
    internet service providers, network integrators and independent
    software vendors. Our relationships with these channel
    participants are important elements of our marketing and sales
    efforts. Our financial results could be adversely affected if
    our contracts with channel participants were terminated, if our
    relationships with channel participants were to deteriorate, if
    any of our competitors enter into strategic relationships with
    or acquire a significant channel participant or if the financial
    condition of our channel participants were to weaken. There can
    be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining,
    expanding or developing our relationships with channel
    participants. If we are not successful, we may lose sales
    opportunities, customers and market share.

Charges to earnings resulting from past acquisitions may
    adversely affect our operating results.

Under
    purchase accounting, we allocate the total purchase price to an
    acquired company’s net tangible assets, intangible assets
    and in-process research and development based on their fair
    values as of the date of the acquisition and record the excess
    of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill.
    Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon
    assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently
    uncertain. Going forward, the following factors could result in
    material charges that would adversely affect our results:

•

impairment of goodwill or intangible assets;

•

identification of assumed contingent liabilities subsequent to
    the finalization of the purchase price allocation; and

•

charges to income to eliminate certain Oracle pre-merger
    activities that duplicate those of the acquired company or to
    reduce our cost structure.

Charges to earnings associated with acquisitions include
    amortization of intangible assets, in-process research and
    development as well as other acquisition related charges,
    restructuring and stock-based compensation associated



with assumed stock awards. Charges to earnings in any given
    period could differ substantially from other periods based on
    the timing and size of our future acquisitions and the extent of
    integration activities. See Item 7, “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations—Supplemental Disclosure Related to Acquisition
    Accounting and Stock-Based Compensation” for additional
    information about charges to earnings associated with our recent
    acquisitions.

We expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with
    combining the operations of our previously acquired companies,
    which may be substantial. Additional costs may include costs of
    employee redeployment, relocation and retention, including
    salary increases or bonuses, accelerated amortization of
    deferred equity compensation and severance payments,
    reorganization or closure of facilities, taxes and termination
    of contracts that provide redundant or conflicting services.
    Some of these costs may have to be accounted for as expenses
    that would decrease our net income and earnings per share for
    the periods in which those adjustments are made.

Our international sales and operations subject us to
    additional risks that can adversely affect our operating
    results.

We derive a substantial portion of
    our revenues, and have significant operations, outside of the
    United States. Our international operations include software
    development, sales, customer support and shared administrative
    service centers. We are subject to a variety of risks, including
    those related to general economic conditions in each country or
    region, regulatory changes, political unrest, terrorism and the
    potential for other hostilities and public health risks,
    particularly in areas in which we have significant operations.
    We face challenges in managing an organization operating in
    various countries, which can entail longer payment cycles and
    difficulties in collecting accounts receivable, overlapping tax
    regimes, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, difficulties
    in transferring funds from certain countries and reduced
    protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.
    We must comply with a variety of international laws and
    regulations, including trade restrictions, local labor
    ordinances, changes in tariff rates and import and export
    licensing requirements. Our success depends, in part, on our
    ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties.

We are a majority shareholder of i-flex solutions limited, a
    publicly traded Indian software company focused on the banking
    industry. As the majority shareholder of an international
    entity, we are faced with several additional risks, including
    being subject to local securities regulations and being unable
    to exert full control or obtain financial and other information
    on a timely basis.

We may experience foreign currency gains and
    losses.

We conduct a portion of our business
    in currencies other than the United States dollar. Our revenues
    and operating results are adversely affected when the dollar
    strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively
    affected when the dollar weakens. Changes in the value of major
    foreign currencies, particularly the Euro, Japanese Yen and
    British Pound relative to the United States dollar can
    significantly affect revenues and our operating results.

Our foreign currency transaction gains and losses, primarily
    related to sublicense fees and other agreements among us and our
    subsidiaries and distributors, are charged against earnings in
    the period incurred. We enter into foreign exchange forward
    contracts to hedge certain transaction and translation exposures
    in major currencies, but we will continue to experience foreign
    currency gains and losses in certain instances where it is not
    possible or cost effective to hedge foreign currencies.

Oracle On Demand and CRM On Demand may not be
    successful.

We offer Oracle On Demand
    outsourcing services for our applications and database
    technology, delivered either at our data center facilities or at
    a site of our customer’s choosing. We also offer CRM On
    Demand, which is a service offering that provides our customers
    with our Siebel CRM software functionality delivered via a
    hosted solution that we manage. These business models continue
    to evolve and we may not be able to compete effectively,
    generate significant revenues or develop them into profitable
    businesses. We incur expenses associated with the
    infrastructures and marketing of our Oracle On Demand and CRM On
    Demand businesses in advance of our ability to recognize the
    revenues associated with our subscription-based contracts. These
    businesses are subject to a variety of risks including:

•

demand for these services may not meet our expectations;

•

we may not be able to operate these businesses at an acceptable
    profit level;



•

we manage critical customer applications, data and other
    confidential information through Oracle On Demand and CRM On
    Demand; accordingly, we face increased exposure to significant
    damage claims and risk to future business prospects in the event
    of system failures or inadequate disaster recovery or
    misappropriation of customer confidential information;

•

we may face regulatory exposure in certain areas such as data
    privacy, data security and export compliance, as well as
    workforce reduction claims as a result of customers transferring
    their information technology functions to us;

•

the laws and regulations applicable to hosted service providers
    are unsettled, particularly in the areas of privacy and security
    and use of offshore resources; changes in these laws could
    affect our ability to provide services from or to some locations
    and could increase both the costs and risks associated with
    providing the services;

•

demand for these services may be affected by customer and media
    concerns about security risks

and/or

use
    of outsourced services providers more generally; and

•

our offerings may require large fixed costs such as for data
    centers, computers, network infrastructure and security and we
    may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to offset these
    costs and generate acceptable operating margins from these
    offerings.

We may be unable to hire enough qualified employees or we
    may lose key employees.

We rely on the
    continued service of our senior management, including our Chief
    Executive Officer, members of our executive team and other key
    employees and the hiring of new qualified employees. In the
    software industry, there is substantial and continuous
    competition for highly skilled business, product development,
    technical and other personnel. In addition, acquisitions could
    cause us to lose key personnel of the acquired companies or at
    Oracle. We may experience increased compensation costs that are
    not offset by either improved productivity or higher prices. We
    may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in
    retaining and motivating existing personnel. With rare
    exceptions, we do not have long-term employment or
    non-competition agreements with our employees. Members of our
    senior management team have left Oracle over the years for a
    variety of reasons, and we cannot assure you that there will not
    be additional departures, which may be disruptive to our
    operations.

We continually focus on improving our cost structure by hiring
    personnel in countries where advanced technical expertise is
    available at lower costs. When we make adjustments to our
    workforce, we may incur expenses associated with workforce
    reductions that delay the benefit of a more efficient workforce
    structure. We may also experience increased competition for
    employees in these countries as the trend toward globalization
    continues which may affect our employee retention efforts

and/or

increase our expenses in an effort to offer a competitive
    compensation program.

Part of our total compensation program includes stock options.
    Stock options are an important tool in attracting and retaining
    employees in our industry. If our stock price performs poorly it
    may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract employees.
    In addition, because we now expense all stock-based
    compensation, we may in the future change our stock-based and
    other compensation practices. Some of the changes we are
    considering include the reduction in the number of employees
    granted options, a reduction in the number of options granted
    and a change to alternative forms of stock-based compensation.
    Any changes in our compensation practices or changes made by
    competitors could affect our ability to retain and motivate
    existing personnel and recruit new personnel.

We might experience significant errors or security flaws
    in our products and services.

Despite testing
    prior to their release, software products frequently contain
    errors or security flaws, especially when first introduced or
    when new versions are released. The detection and correction of
    any security flaws can be time consuming and costly. Errors in
    our software products could affect the ability of our products
    to work with other hardware or software products, could delay
    the development or release of new products or new versions of
    products and could adversely affect market acceptance of our
    products. If we experience errors or delays in releasing new
    products or new versions of products, we could lose revenues. In
    addition, we run our own business operations, Oracle On Demand,
    and other outsourcing, support and consulting services, on our
    products and networks and any security flaws, if exploited,
    could affect our ability to conduct business operations. End
    users, who rely on our products and services for applications
    that are critical to their businesses, may have a greater
    sensitivity to product errors and security



vulnerabilities than customers for software products generally.
    Software product errors and security flaws in our products or
    services could expose us to product liability, performance

and/or

warranty claims as well as harm our reputation, which could
    impact our future sales of products and services. In addition,
    we may be legally required to publicly report security breaches
    of our services, which could adversely impact future business
    prospects for those services.

We may not receive significant revenues from our current
    research and development efforts for several years, if at
    all.

Developing and localizing software is
    expensive and the investment in product development often
    involves a long payback cycle. We have made and expect to
    continue to make significant investments in software research
    and development and related product opportunities. Accelerated
    product introductions and short product life cycles require high
    levels of expenditures for research and development that could
    adversely affect our operating results if not offset by revenue
    increases. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a
    significant amount of resources to our research and development
    efforts to maintain our competitive position. However, we do not
    expect to receive significant revenues from these investments
    for several years if at all.

Our sales to government clients subject us to risks
    including early termination, audits, investigations, sanctions
    and penalties.

We derive revenues from
    contracts with the United States government, state and local
    governments and their respective agencies, which may terminate
    most of these contracts at any time, without cause.

There is increased pressure for governments and their agencies,
    both domestically and internationally, to reduce spending. Our
    federal government contracts are subject to the approval of
    appropriations being made by the United States Congress to fund
    the expenditures under these contracts. Similarly, our contracts
    at the state and local levels are subject to government funding
    authorizations.

Additionally, government contracts are generally subject to
    audits and investigations which could result in various civil
    and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including
    termination of contracts, refund of a portion of fees received,
    forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and
    suspensions or debarment from future government business.

Business disruptions could affect our operating
    results.

A significant portion of our
    research and development activities and certain other critical
    business operations is concentrated in a few geographic areas.
    We are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure
    of our systems could cause delays in completing sales and
    providing services, including some of our On Demand offerings. A
    major earthquake, fire or other catastrophic event that results
    in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business
    or information technology systems could severely affect our
    ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result
    our future operating results could be materially and adversely
    affected.

Adverse litigation results could affect our
    business.

We are subject to various legal
    proceedings. Litigation can be lengthy, expensive, and
    disruptive to our operations and results cannot be predicted
    with certainty. An adverse decision could result in monetary
    damages or injunctive relief that could affect our business,
    operating results or financial condition. Additional information
    regarding certain of the lawsuits we are involved in is
    discussed under Note 21 in our Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

PeopleSoft’s Customer Assurance Program may expose us
    to substantial liabilities if triggered.

In
    June 2003, in response to our tender offer, PeopleSoft
    implemented what it referred to as the “customer assurance
    program” or “CAP”. The CAP incorporated a
    provision in PeopleSoft’s standard licensing arrangement
    that purports to contractually burden Oracle, as a result of its
    acquisition of PeopleSoft, with a contingent obligation to make
    payments to PeopleSoft customers should Oracle fail to take
    certain business actions for a fixed period of time subsequent
    to the acquisition. The payment obligation, which typically
    expires four years from the date of the contract, is fixed at an
    amount generally between two and five times the license and
    first year support fees paid to PeopleSoft in the applicable
    license transaction. This purported obligation was not reflected
    as a liability on PeopleSoft’s balance sheet as PeopleSoft
    concluded that it could be triggered only following the
    consummation of an acquisition. PeopleSoft used six different
    standard versions of the CAP over the

18-month

period commencing June 2003. PeopleSoft ceased using the CAP on
    December 29, 2004, the date on which we acquired a
    controlling interest in PeopleSoft. We have concluded that, as
    of the date of the PeopleSoft acquisition, the penalty
    provisions under the CAP represented a contingent liability of
    Oracle. The aggregate potential CAP obligation as of
    May 31,



2007 was $3.2 billion. Unless the CAP provisions are
    removed from these licensing arrangements, we do not expect the
    aggregate potential CAP obligation to decline substantially
    until fiscal year 2008 when a significant number of these
    provisions begin to expire. The last CAP obligation will expire
    on December 31, 2008. We have not recorded a liability
    related to the CAP, as we do not believe it is probable that our
    post-acquisition activities related to the PeopleSoft product
    line will trigger an obligation to make any payment pursuant to
    the CAP.

In addition, while no assurance can be given as to the ultimate
    outcome of litigation, we believe we would also have substantial
    defenses with respect to the legality and enforceability of the
    CAP contract provisions in response to any claims seeking
    payment from Oracle under the CAP terms. While we have taken
    extensive steps to assure customers that we intend to continue
    developing and supporting the PeopleSoft and JD Edwards product
    lines and as of May 31, 2007 we have not received any
    claims for CAP payments, PeopleSoft customers may assert claims
    for CAP payments.

We may have exposure to additional tax
    liabilities.

As a multinational corporation,
    we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based
    taxes, in both the United States and various foreign
    jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining
    our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax
    liabilities.

In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many
    intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate
    tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by
    tax authorities. Our intercompany transfer pricing is currently
    being reviewed by the IRS and by foreign tax jurisdictions and
    will likely be subject to additional audits in the future. We
    previously negotiated three unilateral Advance Pricing
    Agreements with the IRS that cover many of our intercompany
    transfer pricing issues and preclude the IRS from making a
    transfer pricing adjustment within the scope of these
    agreements. However, these agreements, which are effective for
    fiscal years through May 31, 2006, do not cover all
    elements of our transfer pricing and do not bind tax authorities
    outside the United States. We have finalized one bilateral
    Advance Pricing Agreement and currently are negotiating an
    additional bilateral agreement to cover the period from
    June 1, 2001 through May 31, 2008. There can be no
    guarantee that such negotiations will result in an agreement.

Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, we
    cannot assure you that the final determination of tax audits or
    tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our
    historical income tax provisions and accruals.

We are also subject to non-income taxes, such as payroll, sales,
    use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services
    taxes, in both the United States and various foreign
    jurisdictions. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities
    with respect to these non-income taxes and may have exposure to
    additional non-income tax liabilities. Our acquisition
    activities have increased our non-income tax exposures.

There are risks associated with our outstanding
    indebtedness.

As of May 31, 2007, we had
    an aggregate of $6.3 billion of outstanding indebtedness
    that will mature between 2009 and 2016 and we may incur
    additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to pay
    interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is
    dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations and
    the other factors discussed in this section. There can be no
    assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks
    successfully. In addition, changes by any rating agency to our
    outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value and
    liquidity of both our debt and equity securities.

Our stock price could become more volatile and your
    investment could lose value.

All of the
    factors discussed in this section could affect our stock price.
    The timing of announcements in the public market regarding new
    products, product enhancements or technological advances by our
    competitors or us, and any announcements by us of acquisitions,
    major transactions, or management changes could also affect our
    stock price. Our stock price is subject to speculation in the
    press and the analyst community, changes in recommendations or
    earnings estimates by financial analysts, changes in
    investors’ or analysts’ valuation measures for our
    stock, our credit ratings and market trends unrelated to our
    performance. A significant drop in our stock price could also
    expose us to the risk of securities class actions lawsuits,
    which could result in substantial costs and divert
    management’s attention and resources, which could adversely
    affect our business.

Properties

Our properties consist of owned and leased office facilities for
    sales, support, research and development, consulting and
    administrative personnel. Our headquarters facility consists of
    approximately 3.8 million square feet in Redwood City,
    California. We also own or lease office facilities for current
    use consisting of approximately 13.5 million square feet in
    various other locations in the United States and abroad. Due to
    our restructuring and merger integration activities over the
    past three fiscal years, we have vacated approximately
    3.4 million square feet or 19.7% of total owned and leased
    space. This additional space is sublet or being actively
    marketed for sublease or disposition.

Market
    for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters
    and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market
    under the symbol “ORCL” and has been traded on NASDAQ
    since our initial public offering in 1986. According to the
    records of our transfer agent, we had 21,443 stockholders of
    record as of May 31, 2007. The majority of our shares are
    held in approximately 1.2 million customer accounts held by
    brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders.
    However, we believe that the number of total stockholders is
    less than 1.2 million due to stockholders with accounts at
    more than one brokerage. The following table sets forth the low
    and high sale price of our common stock, based on the last daily
    sale, in each of our last eight fiscal quarters.

Our policy has been to reinvest earnings to fund future growth,
    acquisitions and to repurchase our common stock pursuant to a
    program approved by our Board of Directors. Accordingly, we have
    not paid cash dividends and do not anticipate declaring cash
    dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future,
    although our Board of Directors regularly reviews this matter.

For equity compensation plan information, please refer to
    Item 12 in Part III of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Stock
    Repurchase Programs

In 1992, our Board of Directors approved a program to repurchase
    shares of our common stock to reduce the dilutive effect of our
    stock option and stock purchase plans. The Board has expanded
    the repurchase program several times by either increasing the
    authorized number of shares to be repurchased or by authorizing
    a fixed dollar amount expansion. From the inception of the stock
    repurchase program to May 31, 2007, a total of
    2.0 billion shares have been repurchased for approximately
    $24.7 billion. In April 2007, our Board expanded our
    repurchase program by $4.0 billion and, as of May 31,
    2007, approximately $4.2 billion was available to
    repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to the stock
    repurchase program.

Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration
    date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on
    factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements
    for acquisitions, our debt repayment obligations, our stock
    price, and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases
    may be effected from time to time through open market purchases
    or pursuant to a

Rule 10b5-1

plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated,
    suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.



The following table summarizes the stock repurchase activity for
    the three months ending May 31, 2007 and the approximate
    dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased pursuant to our
    share repurchase programs:

Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

We are the world’s largest enterprise software company. We
    are organized into two businesses, software and services, which
    are further divided into five operating segments. Each of these
    operating segments has unique characteristics and faces
    different opportunities and challenges. Although we report our
    actual results in United States dollars, we conduct a
    significant number of transactions in currencies other than
    United States dollars. Therefore, we present constant currency
    information to provide a framework for assessing how our
    underlying business performed excluding the effect of foreign
    currency rate fluctuations. An overview of our five operating
    segments follows.

Software
    Business

Our software business is comprised of two operating segments:
    (1) new software license revenues and (2) software
    license updates and product support revenues. We expect that our
    software business revenues will continue to increase, which
    should allow us to improve margins and profits and continue to
    make investments in research and development.

New Software Licenses:

We license our
    database and middleware as well as our applications software to
    businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational
    institutions and resellers. The growth in new software license
    revenues is affected by the strength of general economic and
    business conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, the
    competitive position of our software products and acquisitions.
    The new software license business is also characterized by long
    sales cycles. The timing of a few large software license
    transactions can substantially affect our quarterly new software
    license revenues. Since our new software license revenues in a
    particular quarter can be difficult to predict as a result of
    the timing of a few large software license transactions, we
    believe that analysis of new software revenues on a trailing

4-quarter

period provides more visibility into the underlying fundamental
    performance of our software revenues than analysis of quarterly
    revenues. New software license revenues represented 33% of our
    total revenues in fiscal 2007. Our new software license margins
    have been affected by the amortization of intangible assets
    associated with companies we have acquired.

Competition in the software business is intense. Our goal is to
    maintain a first or second position in each of our software
    product categories and certain industry segments as well as to
    grow our software revenues faster than our competitors. We
    believe that the features and functionality of our software
    products are as strong as they have ever been. We have focused
    on lowering the total cost of ownership of our software products
    by improving integration, decreasing installation times,
    lowering administration costs and improving the ease of use.
    Reducing the total cost of ownership of our products provides
    our customers with a higher return on their investment, which we
    believe will create more demand for our products and services
    and provide us with a competitive advantage. We have also
    continued to focus on improving the overall quality of our
    software products and service levels. We believe this will lead
    to higher customer satisfaction and loyalty and help us achieve
    our goal of becoming our customers’ leading technology
    advisor.

Software License Updates and Product
    Support:

Customers that purchase software
    license updates and product support are granted rights to
    unspecified product upgrades and maintenance releases issued
    during the support period, as well as technical support
    assistance. In fiscal 2007, we also introduced Oracle
    Unbreakable Linux Support, which provides enterprise level
    support for the Linux operating system. Substantially all of our
    customers renew their software license updates and product
    support contracts annually. The growth of software license
    updates and product support revenues is influenced by three
    factors: (1) the support contract base of companies
    acquired, (2) the renewal rate of the support contract base
    and (3) the amount of new support contracts sold in
    connection with the sale of new software licenses.

Software license updates and product support revenues, which
    represent approximately 46% of our total revenues in fiscal
    2007, are our highest margin business unit. Support margins
    during fiscal 2007 were 90%, and accounted for 76% of our total
    margins over the same respective period. We believe that
    software license updates and product support revenues and
    margins will continue to grow for the following reasons:

•

Acquisitions over the past three years have significantly
    increased our support contract base, as well as the portfolio of
    products available to be licensed.



•

Substantially all customers purchase license updates and product
    support when they buy new software licenses, resulting in a
    further increase in our support contract base. Even if new
    license revenue growth was flat, software license updates and
    product support revenues would continue to grow assuming renewal
    and cancellation rates remained relatively constant since
    substantially all new software license transactions add to the
    support contract base.

•

Substantially all of our customers, including customers from
    acquired companies, renew their support contracts when eligible
    for renewal.

We record adjustments to reduce support obligations assumed in
    business acquisitions to their estimated fair value at the
    acquisition dates. As a result, as required by business
    combination accounting rules, we did not recognize software
    license updates and product support revenues related to support
    contracts that would have been otherwise recorded by acquired
    businesses as independent entities in the amount of
    $212 million, $391 million and $320 million in
    fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. To the extent
    underlying support contracts are renewed with us following an
    acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full value
    of the support contracts over the support periods, the majority
    of which are one year.

Services
    Business

Our services business consists of consulting, On Demand and
    education revenues. Our services business, which represents 21%
    of our total revenues in fiscal 2007, has significantly lower
    margins than our software business.

Consulting:

Consulting revenues have
    increased primarily due to consulting services provided by
    i-flex as well as an increase in application implementations
    created by higher sales of new software applications over the
    past year. We expect consulting revenues to continue to grow as
    consulting revenues tend to lag software revenues by several
    quarters since consulting services, if purchased, are typically
    performed after the purchase of new software licenses and our
    new license growth rates have generally increased over the
    corresponding period in the prior year over the past several
    quarters.

On Demand:

On Demand includes Oracle On
    Demand, CRM on Demand and Advanced Customer Services. We believe
    that our On Demand offerings provide an additional opportunity
    for customers to lower their total cost of ownership and can
    therefore provide us with a competitive advantage. We have made
    and plan to continue to make investments in Oracle On Demand and
    CRM On Demand to support current and future revenue growth,
    which has negatively impacted On Demand margins and we expect
    may continue to do so in the future.

Education:

The purpose of our education
    services is to further enhance the usability of our software
    products by our customers and to create opportunities to grow
    our software revenues. Education revenues have been impacted by
    personnel reductions in our customers’ information
    technology departments, tighter controls over discretionary
    spending and greater use of outsourcing solutions. Despite these
    trends, we expect education revenues to increase in fiscal year
    2008, primarily due to an increase in customer training on the
    use of our acquired application products and increases in
    license revenues from our database and middleware products.

Acquisitions

An active acquisition program is an important element of our
    corporate strategy. In the last three fiscal years, we have
    invested over $25 billion, in the aggregate, to acquire
    companies, products, services and technologies, including the
    acquisitions of PeopleSoft, Inc., a provider of enterprise
    applications software products; Siebel Systems, Inc., a provider
    of customer relationship management software; Hyperion Solutions
    Corporation, a provider of enterprise performance management and
    business intelligence software; and others. Typically, the
    significant majority of our integration activities related to an
    acquisition are substantially complete in the United States
    within three to six months after the closing of the acquisition.

We believe our acquisition program supports our long-term
    strategic direction, strengthens our competitive position,
    particularly in the applications marketplace, expands our
    customer base and provides greater scale to increase our
    investment in research and development to accelerate innovation,
    grow our earnings and increase stockholder value. We expect to
    continue to acquire companies, products, services and
    technologies. See Note 2 of



our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for
    additional information related to our recent and pending
    acquisitions.

We believe we can fund additional acquisitions with our
    internally available cash and marketable securities, cash
    generated from operations, amounts available under our
    commercial paper program, additional borrowings or from the
    issuance of additional securities. We estimate the financial
    impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings,
    operating margin, cash flow and return on invested capital
    targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
    These accounting principles require us to make certain
    estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the
    estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are
    reasonable based upon information available to us at the time
    that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These
    estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported
    amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the
    financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues
    and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent there
    are material differences between these estimates, judgments or
    assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be
    affected. The accounting policies that reflect our more
    significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we
    believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and
    evaluating our reported financial results include the following:

•

Revenue Recognition

•

Business Combinations

•

Goodwill

•

Accounting for Income Taxes

•

Legal and Other Contingencies

•

Stock-Based Compensation

•

Allowances for Doubtful Accounts and Returns

In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular
    transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not
    require management’s judgment in its application. There are
    also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting
    among available alternatives would not produce a materially
    different result. Our senior management has reviewed these
    critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the
    Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

Revenue
    Recognition

We derive revenues from the following sources:
    (1) software, which includes new software license and
    software license updates and product support revenues, and
    (2) services, which include consulting, On Demand and
    education revenues.

New software license revenues represent fees earned from
    granting customers licenses to use our database, middleware and
    applications software, and exclude revenues derived from
    software license updates, which are included in software license
    updates and product support. While the basis for software
    license revenue recognition is substantially governed by the
    provisions of Statement of Position

No. 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition

, issued by the American
    Institute of Certified Public Accountants, we exercise judgment
    and use estimates in connection with the determination of the
    amount of software and services revenues to be recognized in
    each accounting period.

For software license arrangements that do not require
    significant modification or customization of the underlying
    software, we recognize new software license revenue when:
    (1) we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a
    customer for the license of software; (2) we deliver the
    products; (3) customer payment is deemed fixed or



determinable and free of contingencies or significant
    uncertainties; and (4) collection is probable.
    Substantially all of our new software license revenues are
    recognized in this manner.

The vast majority of our software license arrangements include
    software license updates and product support, which are
    recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement, typically
    one year. Software license updates provide customers with rights
    to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases
    and patches released during the term of the support period.
    Product support includes internet access to technical content,
    as well as internet and telephone access to technical support
    personnel located in our global support centers. Software
    license updates and product support are generally priced as a
    percentage of the net new software license fees. Substantially
    all of our customers purchase both software license updates and
    product support when they acquire new software licenses. In
    addition, substantially all of our customers renew their
    software license updates and product support contracts annually.

Many of our software arrangements include consulting
    implementation services sold separately under consulting
    engagement contracts. Consulting revenues from these
    arrangements are generally accounted for separately from new
    software license revenues because the arrangements qualify as
    service transactions as defined in

SOP 97-2.

The more significant factors considered in determining whether
    the revenue should be accounted for separately include the
    nature of services (i.e., consideration of whether the services
    are essential to the functionality of the licensed product),
    degree of risk, availability of services from other vendors,
    timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance
    criteria on the realizability of the software license fee.
    Revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the
    services are performed. If there is a significant uncertainty
    about the project completion or receipt of payment for the
    consulting services, revenue is deferred until the uncertainty
    is sufficiently resolved. We estimate the proportional
    performance on contracts with fixed or “not to exceed”
    fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a
    percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project. We
    recognize no more than 90% of the milestone or total contract
    amount until project acceptance is obtained. If we do not have a
    sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion, revenue
    is recognized when we receive final acceptance from the
    customer. When total cost estimates exceed revenues, we accrue
    for the estimated losses immediately using cost estimates that
    are based upon an average fully burdened daily rate applicable
    to the consulting organization delivering the services. The
    complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the
    assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the
    application of the proportional performance method of accounting
    affects the amounts of revenue and related expenses reported in
    our consolidated financial statements. A number of internal and
    external factors can affect our estimates, including labor
    rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification
    and testing requirement changes.

If an arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting of
    the software license and consulting transactions, then new
    software license revenue is generally recognized together with
    the consulting services based on contract accounting using
    either the percentage-of-completion or completed-contract
    method. Contract accounting is applied to any arrangements:
    (1) that include milestones or customer specific acceptance
    criteria that may affect collection of the software license
    fees; (2) where services include significant modification
    or customization of the software; (3) where significant
    consulting services are provided for in the software license
    contract without additional charge or are substantially
    discounted; or (4) where the software license payment is
    tied to the performance of consulting services.

On Demand is comprised of Oracle On Demand, CRM On Demand and
    Advanced Customer Services. Oracle On Demand provides
    multi-featured software and hardware management and maintenance
    services for our database, middleware and applications software
    at Oracle’s data center facilities or at a site of our
    customer’s choosing. CRM On Demand is a service offering
    that provides our customers with our Siebel CRM software
    functionality delivered via a hosted solution that we manage.
    Advanced Customer Services are earned by providing customers
    configuration and performance analysis, personalized support and
    annual

on-site

technical services. Revenue from On Demand services is
    recognized over the term of the service period, which is
    generally one year.

Education revenues include instructor-led, media-based and
    internet-based training in the use of our products. Education
    revenues are recognized as the classes or other education
    offerings are delivered.

For arrangements with multiple elements, we allocate revenue to
    each element of a transaction based upon its fair value as
    determined by “vendor specific objective evidence.”
    Vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for all



elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and
    discounting practices for those products and services when sold
    separately and for software license updates and product support
    services, is additionally measured by the renewal rate offered
    to the customer. We may modify our pricing practices in the
    future, which could result in changes in our vendor specific
    objective evidence of fair value for these undelivered elements.
    As a result, our future revenue recognition for multiple element
    arrangements could differ significantly from our historical
    results.

We defer revenue for any undelivered elements, and recognize
    revenue when the product is delivered or over the period in
    which the service is performed, in accordance with our revenue
    recognition policy for such element. If we cannot objectively
    determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in
    bundled software and service arrangements, we defer revenue
    until all elements are delivered and services have been
    performed, or until fair value can objectively be determined for
    any remaining undelivered elements. When the fair value of a
    delivered element has not been established, we use the residual
    method to record revenue if the fair value of all undelivered
    elements is determinable. Under the residual method, the fair
    value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining
    portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered
    elements and is recognized as revenue.

Substantially all of our software license arrangements do not
    include acceptance provisions. However, if acceptance provisions
    exist as part of public policy, for example in agreements with
    government entities when acceptance periods are required by law,
    or within previously executed terms and conditions that are
    referenced in the current agreement and are short-term in
    nature, we provide for a sales return allowance in accordance
    with FASB Statement No. 48,

Revenue Recognition when
    Right of Return Exists

. If acceptance provisions are
    long-term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an
    arrangement or if we cannot reasonably estimate the incidence of
    returns, revenue is recognized upon the earlier of receipt of
    written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance
    period.

We also evaluate arrangements with governmental entities
    containing “fiscal funding” or “termination for
    convenience” provisions, when such provisions are required
    by law, to determine the probability of possible cancellation.
    We consider multiple factors, including the history with the
    customer in similar transactions, the “essential use”
    of the software licenses and the planning, budgeting and
    approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity. If we
    determine upon execution of these arrangements that the
    likelihood of cancellation is remote, we then recognize revenue
    once all of the criteria described above have been met. If such
    a determination cannot be made, revenue is recognized upon the
    earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding
    provision by the governmental entity.

We assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of
    sale and recognize revenue if all other revenue recognition
    requirements are met. Our standard payment terms are
    net 30; however, terms may vary based on the country in
    which the agreement is executed. Payments that are due within
    six months are generally deemed to be fixed or determinable
    based on our successful collection history on such arrangements,
    and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue
    recognition.

While most of our arrangements include short-term payment terms,
    we have a standard practice of providing long-term financing to
    credit worthy customers through our financing division. Since
    fiscal 1989, when our financing division was formed, we have
    established a history of collection, without concessions, on
    these receivables with payment terms that generally extend up to
    five years from the contract date. Provided all other
    revenue recognition criteria have been met, we recognize new
    software license revenues for these arrangements upon delivery,
    net of any payment discounts from financing transactions. We
    have generally sold receivables financed through our financing
    division on a non-recourse basis to third party financing
    institutions. We account for the sale of these receivables as
    “true sales” as defined in FASB Statement
    No. 140,

Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of
    Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities

.

Our customers include several of our suppliers and on rare
    occasion, we have purchased goods or services for our operations
    from these vendors at or about the same time that we have
    licensed our software to these same companies (a
    “Concurrent Transaction”). Software license agreements
    that occur within a three-month time period from the date we
    have purchased goods or services from that same customer are
    reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure.
    When we acquire goods or services from a customer, we negotiate
    the purchase separately from any software license transaction,
    at terms we consider to be at arm’s length, and settle the
    purchase in cash. We



recognize new software license revenue from Concurrent
    Transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are met
    and the goods and services acquired are necessary for our
    current operations.

Business
    Combinations

In accordance with business combination accounting, we allocate
    the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and
    intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as to
    in-process research and development based on their estimated
    fair values. We engage third-party appraisal firms to assist
    management in determining the fair values of certain assets
    acquired and liabilities assumed. Such valuations require
    management to make significant estimates and assumptions,
    especially with respect to intangible assets.

Management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions
    believed to be reasonable. These estimates are based on
    historical experience and information obtained from the
    management of the acquired companies and are inherently
    uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the
    intangible assets include but are not limited to: future
    expected cash flows from license sales, maintenance agreements,
    consulting contracts, customer contracts and acquired developed
    technologies and patents; expected costs to develop the
    in-process research and development into commercially viable
    products and estimated cash flows from the projects when
    completed; the acquired company’s brand and market
    position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the
    acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined
    company’s product portfolio; and discount rates.
    Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may
    affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates
    or actual results.

In connection with purchase price allocations, we estimate the
    fair value of the support obligations assumed in connection with
    acquisitions. The estimated fair value of the support
    obligations is determined utilizing a cost

build-up

approach. The cost

build-up

approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related
    to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The
    estimated costs to fulfill the support obligations are based on
    the historical direct costs related to providing the support
    services and to correct any errors in the software products
    acquired. We do not include any costs associated with selling
    efforts or research and development or the related fulfillment
    margins on these costs. Profit associated with selling effort is
    excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded the
    selling effort on the support contracts prior to the acquisition
    date. The estimated research and development costs are not
    included in the fair value determination, as these costs are not
    deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of
    acquisition. The sum of the costs and operating profit
    approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to
    pay a third party to assume the support obligation.

As a result, we did not recognize software license updates and
    product support revenues related to support contracts in the
    amount of $212 million, $391 million and
    $320 million that would have been otherwise recorded by
    acquired businesses as independent entities in fiscal 2007, 2006
    and 2005, respectively. Historically, substantially all of our
    customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew
    their contracts when the contract is eligible for renewal. To
    the extent these underlying support contracts are renewed, we
    will recognize the revenues for the full value of the support
    contracts over the support periods, the majority of which are
    one year. Had we included our estimated selling and research and
    development activities, and the associated margin for
    unspecified product upgrades and enhancements to be provided
    under our assumed support arrangements, the fair value of the
    support obligations would have been significantly higher than
    what we have recorded and we would have recorded a higher amount
    of software license updates and product support revenue
    historically and in future periods related to these assumed
    contracts.

Other significant estimates associated with the accounting for
    acquisitions include restructuring costs. Restructuring costs
    are primarily comprised of severance costs, costs of
    consolidating duplicate facilities and contract termination
    costs. Restructuring expenses are based upon plans that have
    been committed to by management but which are subject to
    refinement. To estimate restructuring expenses, management
    utilizes assumptions of the number of employees that would be
    involuntarily terminated and of future costs to operate and
    eventually vacate duplicate facilities. Estimated restructuring
    expenses may change as management executes the approved plan.
    Decreases to the cost estimates of executing the currently
    approved plans associated with pre-merger activities of the
    companies we acquire are recorded as an adjustment to goodwill
    indefinitely, whereas increases to the estimates are recorded as
    an adjustment to goodwill during the purchase price allocation
    period (generally within one year of the acquisition date) and
    as operating expenses thereafter.



For a given acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition
    contingencies. If, during the purchase price allocation period,
    we are able to determine the fair value of a pre-acquisition
    contingency, we will include that amount in the purchase price
    allocation. If, as of the end of the purchase price allocation
    period, we are unable to determine the fair value of a
    pre-acquisition contingency, we will evaluate whether to include
    an amount in the purchase price allocation based on whether it
    is probable a liability had been incurred and whether an amount
    can be reasonably estimated. With the exception of unresolved
    tax matters, after the end of the purchase price allocation
    period, any adjustment to amounts recorded for a pre-acquisition
    contingency will be included in our operating results in the
    period in which the adjustment is determined.

Goodwill

We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events
    or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not
    be recoverable in accordance with FASB Statement No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. The provisions of
    Statement 142 require that a two-step impairment test be
    performed on goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair
    value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. Our
    reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments
    identified in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements. If the fair value of the reporting unit
    exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that
    unit, goodwill is considered not impaired and we are not
    required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of
    the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair
    value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second
    step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied
    fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If the
    carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its
    implied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss
    equal to the difference.

Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use
    of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and
    assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins
    used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted
    discount rates, future economic and market conditions and
    determination of appropriate market comparables. We base our
    fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable
    but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual
    future results may differ from those estimates. In addition, we
    make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared
    assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each
    of our reporting units. Our most recent annual goodwill
    impairment analysis, which was performed during the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2007, did not result in an impairment charge.

Accounting
    for Income Taxes

Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide
    income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global
    business, there are many transactions and calculations where the
    ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties
    arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement
    arrangements among related entities, the process of identifying
    items of revenue and expense that qualify for preferential tax
    treatment, and segregation of foreign and domestic income and
    expense to avoid double taxation. Although we believe that our
    estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these matters
    could be different from that which is reflected in our
    historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences
    could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net
    income in the period in which such determination is made.

Our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain
    undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have
    been provided because such earnings are planned to be
    indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Remittances
    of foreign earnings to the U.S. are planned based on
    projected cash flow, working capital and investment needs of
    foreign and domestic operations. Based on these assumptions, we
    estimate the amount that will be distributed to the
    U.S. and provide U.S. federal taxes on these amounts.
    Material changes in our estimates could impact our effective tax
    rate.

We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax
    assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be
    realized. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we
    must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those
    jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We
    consider future market growth, forecasted earnings, future
    taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in
    which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning
    strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In
    the event we were to determine that we would not be able to
    realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the
    future, an adjustment to the deferred tax



assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we
    make such determination. Likewise, if we later determine that it
    is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would
    be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the
    previously provided valuation allowance.

We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on
    estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual
    results reflected in income tax returns filed during the
    subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are
    generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed
    and the global tax implications are known.

The amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by
    federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result
    in proposed assessments. Our estimate of the potential outcome
    for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. We believe we
    have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome
    related to these matters. However, our future results may
    include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated
    tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or
    resolved, audits are closed or when statutes of limitation on
    potential assessments expire. Additionally, the jurisdictions in
    which our earnings or deductions are realized may differ from
    our current estimates. As a result, our effective tax rate may
    fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis.

As part of our accounting for business combinations, some of the
    purchase price is allocated to goodwill and intangible assets.
    Impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not
    tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income
    tax rate in the quarter the impairment is recorded. Amortization
    expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are
    generally not tax deductible pursuant to our existing tax
    structure; however, deferred taxes have been recorded for
    non-deductible amortization expense as part of the purchase
    price allocation. We have taken into account the allocation of
    these identified intangibles among different taxing
    jurisdictions, including those with nominal or zero percent tax
    rates, in establishing the related deferred tax liabilities.
    Income tax contingencies existing as of the acquisition dates of
    the acquired companies are evaluated quarterly and any
    adjustments are recorded as an adjustment to goodwill.

In fiscal 2008, we will adopt FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation
    of FASB Statement No. 109

. Please refer to Note 1
    of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for further discussion.

Legal
    and Other Contingencies

We are currently involved in various claims and legal
    proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant
    matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the
    potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered
    probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a
    liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is
    required in both the determination of probability and the
    determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable.
    Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are
    based only on the best information available at the time. As
    additional information becomes available, we reassess the
    potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation
    and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of
    the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our
    results of operations and financial position.

As a result of our acquisition of PeopleSoft in fiscal 2005, we
    inherited contingent liabilities resulting from a program
    PeopleSoft had implemented prior to the consummation of our
    acquisition of PeopleSoft (referred to as the “customer
    assurance program” or “CAP”). See Note 16 of
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
    information.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

On June 1, 2006, we adopted Statement No. 123 (revised
    2004),

Share-Based Payment

, under the modified
    prospective method. Statement 123R generally requires
    share-based payments to employees to be recognized in our
    consolidated statements of operations based on their fair
    values. Prior to June 1, 2006, we accounted for our
    stock-based compensation plans under the intrinsic value method
    of accounting as defined by Accounting Principles Board Opinion
    No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

and
    applied the disclosure provisions of Statement No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

, as amended.
    Under Opinion 25, we generally did not recognize any
    compensation expense for stock options as the exercise price of
    our options was equivalent to the market price of our common
    stock on the date of grant. Substantially all of our stock-based
    compensation expense



recognized under Opinion 25 related to options assumed from
    acquisitions. For pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair
    values for options granted and options assumed were amortized
    using the accelerated expense attribution method. In addition,
    we reduced pro forma stock compensation expense for actual
    forfeitures in the periods they occurred. In March 2005, the
    Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting
    Bulletin (SAB) No. 107, which provides supplemental
    implementation guidance for Statement 123R. We have applied
    the provisions of SAB 107 in our adoption of
    Statement 123R. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements for information on the impact of our
    adoption of Statement 123R and the assumptions we use to
    calculate the fair value of share-based employee compensation.

Upon our adoption of Statement 123R, we were required to
    estimate the awards that we ultimately expect to vest and to
    reduce stock-based compensation expense for the effects of
    estimated forfeitures of awards over the expense recognition
    period. Although we estimated forfeitures based on historical
    experience, forfeitures in the future may differ. Under
    Statement 123R, the forfeiture rate must be revised if
    actual forfeitures differ from our original estimates. Also in
    connection with our adoption of Statement 123R, we elected
    to recognize awards granted after our adoption date under the
    straight-line amortization method.

We estimate the fair value of employee stock options using a
    Black-Scholes valuation model. The fair value of an award is
    affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as
    other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our
    stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period
    of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options.
    The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon United
    States treasury interest rates appropriate for the expected life
    of the awards. We use the implied volatility of our publicly
    traded stock options in order to estimate future stock price
    trends as we believe that implied volatility is more
    representative of future stock price trends than historical
    volatility. In order to determine the estimated period of time
    that we expect employees to hold their stock options, we have
    used historical rates of employee groups by job classification.
    Our expected dividend rate is zero since we do not currently pay
    cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing
    so in the foreseeable future.

We record deferred tax assets for stock-based awards that result
    in deductions on our income tax returns, based on the amount of
    stock-based compensation recognized and the statutory tax rate
    in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a tax deduction.
    Differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for
    financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction
    reported on our income tax returns are recorded in additional
    paid-in capital. If the tax deduction is less than the deferred
    tax asset, such shortfalls reduce our pool of excess tax
    benefits. If the pool of excess tax benefits is reduced to zero,
    then subsequent shortfalls would increase our income tax
    expense. Our pool of excess tax benefits is computed in
    accordance with the alternative transition method as prescribed
    under FASB Staff Position

FAS 123R-3,

Transition Election to Accounting for the Tax Effects of
    Share-Based Payment Awards

.

The accounting guidance under Statement 123R is relatively
    new and several interpretations have been released since the
    pronouncement has been issued. Additional interpretations may be
    released and the application of these principles may be subject
    to further refinement over time. In addition, to the extent we
    change the terms of our employee stock-based compensation
    programs, refine different assumptions in future periods such as
    forfeiture rates that differ from our estimates and implement
    the change in our expense attribution method from accelerated to
    straight-line, which we elected when adopting
    Statement 123R, the stock-based compensation expense that
    we record in future periods may differ significantly from what
    we have recorded during our fiscal 2007 reporting periods.

Allowances
    for Doubtful Accounts and Returns

We make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding
    receivables and provide allowances for the portion of
    receivables when collection becomes doubtful. Provisions are
    made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding
    invoices. For those invoices not specifically reviewed,
    provisions are provided at differing rates, based upon the age
    of the receivable, the collection history associated with the
    geographic region that the receivable was recorded and current
    economic trends. If the historical data we use to calculate the
    allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future
    ability to collect outstanding receivables, additional
    provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future
    results of operations could be materially affected.



We also record a provision for estimated sales returns and
    allowances on product and service related sales. These estimates
    are based on historical sales returns, the volume and size of
    our larger transactions and other known factors. If the
    historical data we use to calculate these estimates do not
    properly reflect future returns, then a change in the allowances
    would be made in the period in which such a determination is
    made and revenues in that period could be materially affected.

Results
    of Operations

The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2007
    compared to fiscal 2006 is impacted by our acquisition of Siebel
    in the third quarter of fiscal 2006, the consolidation of i-flex
    beginning June 1, 2006 (beginning of fiscal 2007) and,
    to a lesser extent, the acquisition of Hyperion in our fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2007. The comparability of our operating
    results in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 is also impacted
    by acquisitions, principally our acquisition of PeopleSoft in
    the third quarter of fiscal 2005, and, to a lesser extent, the
    acquisitions of Siebel in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 and
    Retek, Inc. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005.

In our discussion of changes in our results of operations from
    fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006, and fiscal 2006 compared to
    fiscal 2005, we quantify the contribution of our acquired
    products to growth in new software license revenues, the amount
    of revenues associated with software license updates and product
    support as well as On Demand services, and present supplemental
    disclosure related to acquisition accounting and stock-based
    compensation where applicable. Although certain revenue
    contributions from our acquisitions are quantifiable, we are
    unable to identify the following:

•

The contribution of consulting and education services revenues
    from acquired companies in fiscal 2007 and 2006 (with the
    exception of i-flex and Hyperion consulting revenues and
    Hyperion education revenues for which we disclose the impact in
    fiscal 2007 in comparison to fiscal 2006) as the
    significant majority of these services have been fully
    integrated into our existing operations.

•

The contribution of expenses associated with acquired products
    and services in fiscal 2007 and 2006 (with the exception of
    certain i-flex and Hyperion operating expenses for which we
    disclose the impact in fiscal 2007 in comparison to fiscal
    2006) as the significant majority of these services have
    been fully integrated into our existing operations.

We caution readers that, while pre- and post-acquisition
    comparisons as well as the quantified amounts themselves may
    provide indications of general trends, the information has
    inherent limitations for the following reasons:

•

The quantifications cannot address the substantial effects
    attributable to our sales force integration efforts, in
    particular the effect of having a single sales force offer
    similar products. The commissions earned by our integrated sales
    force generally do not vary based on the application product
    sold. We believe that if our sales forces had not been
    integrated, the relative mix of products sold would have been
    different.

•

The significant majority of our acquisitions in the periods
    presented did not result in our entry into a new line of
    business or product category. Therefore, we provided multiple
    products with substantially similar features and functionality.

•

Although substantially all of our customers, including customers
    from acquired companies, renew their software license updates
    and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible
    for renewal, amounts shown as support deferred revenue in our
    supplemental disclosure related to acquisition accounting and
    stock-based compensation are not necessarily indicative of
    revenue improvements we will achieve upon contract renewal to
    the extent customers do not renew.

Constant
    Currency Presentation

We compare the percent change in the results from one period to
    another period in this annual report using constant currency
    disclosure. We present constant currency information to provide
    a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses
    performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate
    fluctuations. To present this information, current and
    comparative prior period results for entities reporting in
    currencies other than United States dollars are converted into
    United States dollars at the exchange rate in effect on
    May 31, 2006, which was the



last day of our prior fiscal year, rather than the actual
    exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. For
    example, if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of
    1.0 million Euros from products sold on May 31, 2007
    and May 31, 2006, our financial statements would reflect
    revenues of $1.35 million in fiscal 2007 (using 1.35 as the
    exchange rate) and $1.27 million in fiscal 2006 (using 1.27
    as the exchange rate). The constant currency presentation would
    translate the fiscal 2007 results using the fiscal 2006 exchange
    rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during
    the periods. In each of the tables below, we present the percent
    change based on actual results as reported and based on constant
    currency.

Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006:

Total
    revenues increased in fiscal 2007 due to increased demand for
    our products and services offerings, strong sales execution, and
    incremental revenues from our acquisitions. Total revenues were
    positively affected by foreign currency rate fluctuations of
    3 percentage points in fiscal 2007 due to the weakening of
    the United States dollar relative to other major international
    currencies. Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations,
    new software license revenues contributed 27% to the growth in
    total revenues, software license updates and product support
    revenues contributed 47% and services contributed 26%. Excluding
    the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas
    contributed 56% to the increase in total revenues, EMEA
    contributed 30% and Asia Pacific contributed 14%.

Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the increase
    in operating expenses is primarily due to higher salary and
    employee benefits associated with increased headcount levels
    (primarily resulting from our acquisitions in fiscal 2007 and
    fiscal 2006), as well as higher commissions and travel and
    entertainment expenses associated with both increased revenues
    and headcount levels. In addition, operating expenses also
    increased in fiscal 2007 due to higher amortization costs of
    intangible assets and stock-based compensation expenses related
    to our adoption of Statement 123R. Operating expenses were
    negatively affected by foreign currency rate fluctuations of
    3 percentage



points. The aforementioned increases in operating expenses were
    partially offset by lower restructuring expenses and the
    settlement of a pre-acquisition PeopleSoft related contingency
    that benefited our operating expenses (see Acquisition Related
    Charges discussion below).

Operating margins as a percentage of total revenues were flat in
    fiscal 2007 and were favorably affected by foreign currency rate
    fluctuations of 5 percentage points. Our revenues grew at a
    faster rate than our operating expenses, excluding amortization
    costs of intangible assets and stock-based compensation
    expenses. The increases in those cost categories offset the
    slower growth in other operating expenses.

International operations will continue to provide a significant
    portion of our total revenues. As a result, total revenues and
    expenses will be affected by changes in the relative strength of
    the United States dollar against certain major international
    currencies.

Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005:

Total
    revenues increased in fiscal 2006 due to strong sales execution,
    incremental revenues from acquisitions and a strengthening in
    our competitive position. Excluding the effect of currency rate
    fluctuations, software license updates and product support
    revenues contributed 50% to the growth in total revenues, new
    software licenses contributed 32% and services revenues
    contributed 18%. Excluding the effects of currency rate
    fluctuations, the Americas contributed 65% to the increase in
    total revenues, EMEA contributed 22% and Asia Pacific
    contributed 13%. Total revenues in the Americas, specifically in
    the United States, increased at a faster rate than in other
    regions primarily due to the relative geographical mix of
    revenues from our acquired companies.

Operating expenses were favorably affected by 1 percentage
    point as a result of the strengthening of the United States
    dollar relative to other major international currencies.
    Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, the increase
    in operating expenses is primarily due to higher headcount
    levels and associated personnel related costs in sales and
    marketing, consulting and research and development, higher
    commissions due to the increase in revenues and greater
    amortization of intangible assets, offset partially by lower
    restructuring and acquisition related expenses. Operating
    margins as a percentage of total revenues decreased slightly in
    fiscal 2006 due to higher costs associated with acquisitions,
    principally amortization of intangible assets.

Supplemental
    Disclosure Related to Acquisition Accounting and Stock-Based
    Compensation

To supplement our consolidated financial information we believe
    the following information is helpful to an overall understanding
    of our past financial performance and prospects for the future.
    You should review the introduction under “Results of
    Operations” (above) for a discussion of the inherent
    limitations in comparing pre- and post-acquisition information.



Our results of operations include the following business
    combination accounting entries and expenses related to
    acquisitions as well as other expenses including stock-based
    compensation:

In connection with purchase price allocations related to our
    acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the support
    obligations assumed. Due to our application of business
    combination accounting rules, we did not recognize software
    license updates and product support revenues related to support
    contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the
    acquired businesses as independent entities, in the amounts of
    $212 million, $391 million and $320 million in
    fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively.
    Approximately $120 million of estimated software license
    updates and product support revenues related to support
    contracts assumed will not be recognized in fiscal 2008 that
    would have otherwise been recognized by the acquired businesses
    as independent entitles, due to the application of business
    combination accounting rules. To the extent customers renew
    these support contracts, we expect to recognize revenues for the
    full contract value over the support renewal period.

Acquisition related charges primarily consist of in-process
    research and development expenses, integration-related
    professional services, stock-based compensation expenses and
    personnel related costs for transitional employees. For fiscal
    2007, acquisition related charges also included a
    $52 million benefit related to the settlement of a
    pre-acquisition lawsuit filed against PeopleSoft on behalf of
    the U.S. government.

Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006:

Excluding
    the effect of currency rate fluctuations, new software license
    revenues grew in all major product lines and across all
    geographies. Database and middleware revenues contributed 57% to
    the increase in new software license revenues, while
    applications revenues contributed 43%. The Americas contributed
    50%, EMEA contributed 33% and Asia Pacific contributed 17% to
    the increase in new software license revenues.



Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, database and
    middleware revenues grew 12% as a result of a gain in market
    share, increased demand for our database and middleware products
    as well as incremental revenues from acquired companies. Siebel
    products contributed incremental revenues of $48 million,
    Stellent products $26 million, Hyperion products
    $16 million and other recently acquired products
    $19 million to the total database and middleware revenue
    growth in fiscal 2007.

On a constant currency basis, applications revenues increased
    29% as a result of a gain in market share resulting from a
    strengthening of our competitive position in the applications
    market due to improved product features and functionality and
    incremental revenues from acquired companies. Siebel products
    contributed incremental revenues of $130 million, i-flex
    products $50 million, Hyperion products $27 million,
    Portal products $22 million, Demantra products
    $21 million and other recently acquired products
    $22 million to total applications revenue growth.

New software license revenues earned from transactions over
    $0.5 million grew by 24% in fiscal 2007 and increased from
    45% of new software license revenues in fiscal 2006 to 46% in
    fiscal 2007.

Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, sales and
    marketing expenses increased in fiscal 2007 primarily due to
    higher personnel related expenses associated with increased
    headcount, as well as higher commissions expenses associated
    with both increased revenues and headcount levels. Total new
    software license margin as a percentage of revenues declined as
    expenses, including amortization costs of intangible assets,
    grew at a faster rate than revenues.

Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005:

Excluding
    the effect of currency rate fluctuations, new software license
    revenues increased due to strong sales execution in all product
    lines. Applications revenues contributed 60% to the increase in
    new software license revenues, while database and middleware
    revenues contributed 40%. Additionally, new software license
    revenues increased in all geographic regions. Excluding the
    effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed
    57%, EMEA contributed 23% and Asia Pacific contributed 20% to
    the increase in new software license revenues. New software
    license revenues in the Americas, specifically in the United
    States, increased at a faster rate than in other regions
    primarily due to the relative geographical mix of revenues and
    location of sales personnel from our acquired companies.

Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, database and
    middleware revenues grew 11% driven by increased demand for
    database option products, and gain in market share in the
    application server market as a result of better sales execution
    and more competitive features and functionality. Siebel products
    contributed $34 million to the growth in database and
    middleware revenues.

Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, applications
    revenues increased 67% as a result of increased demand for our
    applications products, including products from acquired
    companies, better sales execution as a result of segmenting our
    sales force by product and a strengthening of our competitive
    position in the applications market, particularly in the United
    States and EMEA. PeopleSoft products contributed
    $220 million to the growth in applications revenue in
    fiscal 2006, Siebel products contributed $103 million and
    Retek products contributed $41 million.

New software license revenues earned from transactions over
    $0.5 million increased from 40% of new software license
    revenues in fiscal 2005 to 45% in fiscal 2006.

Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, sales and
    marketing expenses increased due to higher commission expenses
    resulting from the growth in new software license revenues,
    higher personnel related expenditures primarily associated with
    our expanded sales force from acquired companies and higher
    advertising expenses. The total new software license margin as a
    percentage of revenues decreased primarily due to incremental
    amortization of intangible assets and higher compensation
    expenses.

Software License Updates and Product
    Support:

Software license updates grant
    customers rights to unspecified software product upgrades and
    maintenance releases issued during the support period. Product
    support includes internet access to technical content as well as
    internet and telephone access to technical support personnel in
    our global support centers. Expenses associated with our
    software license updates and product support line of business



include the cost of providing the support services, largely
    personnel related expenses, and the amortization of our
    intangible assets associated with software support and customer
    relationships obtained from our acquisitions.

Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006:

Excluding
    the effect of currency rate fluctuations, software license
    updates and product support revenues increased as a result of
    the addition of software license updates and product support
    revenues associated with new software license revenues
    recognized during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and over the
    course of fiscal 2007, the renewal of substantially all of the
    customer base eligible for renewal in the current fiscal year
    and incremental revenues from the expansion of our customer base
    from acquisitions. Excluding the effect of currency rate
    fluctuations, the Americas contributed 59%, EMEA contributed 29%
    and Asia Pacific contributed 12% to the increase in software
    license updates and product support revenues.

Software license updates and product support revenues in fiscal
    2007 include incremental revenues of $310 million from
    Siebel, $37 million from i-flex, $19 million from
    Hyperion, and $55 million from other recently acquired
    companies. As a result of our acquisitions, we recorded
    adjustments to reduce support obligations assumed to their
    estimated fair value at the acquisition dates. Due to our
    application of business combination accounting rules, software
    license updates and product support revenues related to support
    contracts in the amounts of $212 million, $391 million
    and $320 million that would have been otherwise recorded by
    our acquired businesses as independent entities, were not
    recognized in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
    Historically, substantially all of our customers, including
    customers from acquired companies, renew their support contracts
    when such contracts are eligible for renewal. To the extent
    these underlying support contracts are renewed, we will
    recognize the revenues for the full value of these contracts
    over the support periods, the majority of which are one year.

Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, software
    license updates and product support expenses increased due to
    higher salary and benefits associated with increased headcount
    to support the expansion of our customer base, higher
    amortization expenses resulting from additional intangible
    assets acquired during fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 and higher
    stock-based compensation expenses. Software license updates and
    product support expenses



include $16 million in incremental expenses from i-flex and
    Hyperion. Total software license updates and product support
    margin as a percentage of revenues was flat as intangible asset
    amortization expense and stock-based compensation grew much
    faster than revenues and offset the lower growth in other
    operating expenses.

Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005:

Excluding
    the effect of currency rate fluctuations, software license
    updates and product support revenues increased for similar
    reasons as noted above. Software license updates and product
    support revenues in fiscal 2006 include incremental revenues of
    $797 million from PeopleSoft contracts and $90 million
    from Siebel contracts. Excluding the effect of currency rate
    fluctuations, the Americas contributed 72% to the growth in
    software license updates and product support revenues, EMEA
    contributed 20% and Asia Pacific contributed 8%. Software
    license updates and product support revenues in the Americas,
    specifically in the United States, increased at a faster rate
    than in other regions primarily due to the relative geographical
    mix of revenues and existing support contract bases of our
    acquired companies.

Software license updates and product support expenses increased
    primarily due to higher salary and benefits associated with
    increased headcount to support the expansion of our customer
    base and higher bonuses as a result of increased revenue levels.
    The software license updates and product support margin as a
    percentage of revenues decreased primarily due to incremental
    amortization of intangible assets.

Services

Consulting:

Consulting revenues are
    earned by providing services to customers in the design,
    implementation, deployment and upgrade of our database and

Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006:

Excluding
    the effect of currency rate fluctuations, consulting revenues
    increased primarily due to an increase in application product
    implementations resulting from higher new application software
    license revenues over the last year, $359 million of
    incremental revenues from i-flex, which we



acquired at the beginning of fiscal 2007, and $16 million
    of incremental revenues from Hyperion. Excluding the effect of
    currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 55%, EMEA
    contributed 29% and Asia Pacific contributed 16% to the increase
    in consulting revenues.

Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, consulting
    expenses increased as a result of higher personnel related
    expenses attributed to higher headcount levels and third-party
    contractor expenses. Consulting expenses include
    $281 million of incremental expenses from i-flex and
    $17 million from Hyperion. Total consulting margin as a
    percentage of revenues increased primarily due to higher margins
    contributed by i-flex.

Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005:

The
    increase in consulting revenues is primarily due to an increase
    in application product implementations and billable hours
    primarily provided by consultants who were formerly employed by
    our acquired companies. Excluding the effect of currency rate
    fluctuations, the Americas contributed 56% to the growth in
    consulting revenues, EMEA contributed 26% and Asia Pacific
    contributed 18%.

Consulting expenses increased as a result of higher salary and
    benefit expenses due to additional resources we acquired as part
    of our acquisitions and increased external contractor costs due
    to employee attrition. The total consulting margin as a
    percentage of revenues declined in fiscal 2006 in comparison to
    fiscal 2005 as a result of additional consulting expenses
    attributed to headcount levels and external contractor related
    expenditures.

On Demand:

On Demand includes Oracle On
    Demand, CRM On Demand and Advanced Customer Services. Oracle On
    Demand provides multi-featured software and hardware management,
    and maintenance services for our database and middleware as well
    as our applications software at our data center facilities or at

Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006:

Excluding
    the effect of currency rate fluctuations, On Demand revenues
    increased due to higher Advanced Customer Services revenues, and
    the expansion of our subscription base in both Oracle On Demand
    and CRM On Demand services. Advanced Customer Services revenues
    contributed 46% of the growth, while Oracle On Demand and CRM On
    Demand contributed 33% and 21%, respectively. Excluding the
    effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed
    55%, EMEA contributed 32% and Asia Pacific contributed 13% to
    the increase in On Demand revenues. Advanced Customer Services
    revenues included $50 million of incremental revenues from
    Siebel in fiscal 2007 while CRM On Demand revenues included
    $31 million.

Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, On Demand
    expenses increased due to higher personnel related expenditures,
    higher amortization expenses resulting from intangible assets,
    as well as higher technology infrastructure related costs to
    support the expansion of our customer base. CRM On Demand
    expense growth reflects a full year of expenses related to our
    Siebel CRM On Demand employees (in comparison to only four
    months in fiscal 2006). Total On Demand margin as a percentage
    of revenues decreased, primarily driven by more rapid growth in
    personnel related expenses in comparison to revenues, and to a
    lesser extent, growth in technology infrastructure related
    expenditures in Oracle On Demand and CRM On Demand as well as
    amortization of intangible assets. Advanced Customer Services
    operating margins remained flat compared with the prior year
    while operating losses in both Oracle On Demand and CRM On
    Demand increased.

Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005:

On Demand
    revenues increased in fiscal 2006 due to the expansion of our
    subscription base in Oracle On Demand services, including
    incremental revenues from Siebel of $9 million, as well as
    higher revenues from Advanced Customer Services, including
    incremental revenues from Siebel of $17 million and
    PeopleSoft of $9 million. Excluding the effect of currency
    rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed 65% to the increase
    in On Demand revenues, EMEA contributed 30% and Asia Pacific
    contributed 5%.

On Demand expenses increased due to higher personnel related
    expenditures in both our Oracle On Demand and Advanced Customer
    Services businesses as a result of additional resources acquired
    from Siebel as well as higher computer and technology related
    charges and external contractor costs in our Oracle On Demand
    business. The total On Demand margin as a percentage of revenues
    declined due to lower margins associated with the CRM On Demand
    offering as well as additional expenditures incurred to support
    planned future growth.



Education:

Education revenues are
    earned by providing instructor led, media based and internet
    based training in the use of our database and middleware as well
    as applications software. Education expenses primarily consist
    of personnel related expenditures, facilities and external
    contractor costs.

Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006:

Excluding
    the effect of currency rate fluctuations, education revenues
    grew primarily due to an increase in customer training on the
    use of our application products, as well as $5 million of
    incremental revenues from our acquisition of Hyperion. The
    Americas contributed 46%, EMEA contributed 26% and Asia Pacific
    contributed 28% to the increase in education revenues.

Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, education
    expenses increased due to incremental headcount and associated
    personnel related expenditures, as well as higher third party
    contractor and royalty fees associated with increased revenues.
    Education expenses also include $3 million of incremental
    expenses from Hyperion. Total education margin as a percentage
    of revenues decreased as expenses grew at a higher rate than
    revenues.

Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005:

Education
    revenues increased due to an increase in customer training on
    the use of our acquired applications products. Excluding the
    effect of currency rate fluctuations, the Americas contributed
    64%, EMEA contributed 24% and Asia Pacific contributed 12% to
    the overall increase in education revenues.

Education expenses increased due to incremental headcount and
    associated personnel related expenditures related to Siebel
    education employees and higher external contractor costs.

Research and Development
    Expenses:

Research and development expenses
    consist primarily of personnel related expenditures. We intend
    to continue to invest significantly in our research and
    development efforts because, in our judgment, they are essential
    to maintaining our competitive position.

Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006:

Excluding
    the effect of currency rate fluctuations, research and
    development expenses increased due to higher salary and benefits
    expenses associated with higher headcount levels, increased
    stock-based compensation expenses due to the adoption of
    Statement 123R and increased external contractor expenses.
    Research and development expenses include incremental expenses
    of $25 million from i-flex and $19 million from
    Hyperion. Research and development headcount increased by
    approximately 3,600 employees, consisting of a 33% increase
    in personnel in our applications products divisions and a 14%
    increase in personnel in our database and middleware products
    division. The increase in applications headcount includes
    approximately 1,200 employees acquired from i-flex and 200
    from Hyperion, while the increase in database and middleware
    headcount includes approximately 400 employees acquired
    from Hyperion.

Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005:

Research
    and development headcount increased by approximately 1,300,
    which represented a 13% increase in personnel in our database
    and middleware products division and a 5% increase in personnel
    in our applications products division. The increase in database
    and middleware headcount was primarily due to hiring of
    resources outside the United States, while the increase in
    applications headcount was primarily due to Siebel resources
    acquired. Research and development expenses increased due to
    incremental salary and benefits for the additional headcount,
    higher discretionary bonus expenditures and higher facility and
    technology costs, partially offset by lower external contractor
    costs.

General and Administrative
    Expenses:

General and administrative expenses
    primarily consist of personnel related expenditures for
    information technology, finance, legal and human resources
    support functions.

Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006:

Excluding
    the effect of currency rate fluctuations, general and
    administrative expenses increased during fiscal 2007 as a result
    of higher personnel related costs associated with increased
    headcount to support our expanding operations, the recognition
    of stock-based compensation expenses due to the adoption of
    Statement 123R and increased professional services fees,
    primarily litigation related expenses. General and
    administrative expenses include incremental expenses of
    $25 million from i-flex and $10 million from Hyperion.



Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005:

Excluding
    the effect of currency rate fluctuations, general and
    administrative expenses increased slightly due to higher
    litigation expenses and increased salary costs, partially offset
    by lower bonus expenditures.

Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal

Amortization of intangible assets increased
    due to the amortization of purchased intangibles from Hyperion,
    Siebel (a full year of amortization in fiscal 2007 in comparison
    to four months in fiscal 2006), i-flex and other acquisitions
    that we consummated in the past two fiscal years. See
    Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
    additional information regarding our intangible assets
    (including weighted average useful lives) and related
    amortization expenses.

Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal
    2005:

Amortization of intangible assets increased
    due to amortization of purchased intangibles from Siebel and
    other acquisitions in fiscal 2006 as well as a full year of
    amortization in fiscal 2006 related to PeopleSoft intangibles
    acquired compared with only five months of amortization in
    fiscal 2005.

Acquisition Related
    Charges:

Acquisition related charges
    primarily consist of in-process research and development
    expenses, integration-related professional services,
    stock-compensation expenses and personnel related expenses for
    transitional employees. Stock-based compensation included in
    acquisition related charges relates to unvested options assumed
    from acquisitions whose vesting was fully accelerated upon
    termination of the employees pursuant to the terms of these
    options.

Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal
    2006:

Acquisition related charges increased
    primarily due to in-process research and development charges
    resulting from our acquisitions of Hyperion, i-flex and others
    in fiscal 2007. This increase was offset by a $52 million
    benefit related to the settlement of a lawsuit filed in October
    2003 against PeopleSoft on behalf of the U.S. government,
    prior to our acquisition of PeopleSoft. The lawsuit alleged
    PeopleSoft made defective pricing disclosures to the General
    Services Administration. This lawsuit represented a
    pre-acquisition contingency that we identified and assumed in
    connection with our acquisition of PeopleSoft. On
    October 10, 2006, we agreed to pay the U.S. government
    approximately $98 million to settle this lawsuit. Business
    combination accounting standards require that after the end of
    the purchase price allocation period, any adjustment to amounts
    recorded for a pre-acquisition contingency is to be included as
    an element of net income in the period of settlement, versus an
    adjustment to the original purchase price allocation. Since the
    purchase price allocation period for PeopleSoft ended in our
    third quarter of fiscal 2006, the favorable difference of
    $52 million between the estimated



exposure recorded for this lawsuit during the purchase price
    allocation period and the actual settlement amount has been
    included in our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal
    2007.

Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal
    2005:

Acquisition related charges decreased due
    to lower professional fees, stock-based compensation charges and
    lower transitional employee costs, partially offset by higher
    in-process research and development charges primarily related to
    the Siebel acquisition.

Restructuring:

Restructuring expenses
    consist of Oracle employee severance costs and Oracle duplicate
    facilities closures which were initiated to improve our cost
    structure as a result of acquisitions. For additional
    information regarding the Oracle restructuring plans, as well as
    restructuring activities of our acquired companies, please see

    notes issued in May 2007.

Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005:

Interest

Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal
    2006:

Non-operating income, net increased in
    fiscal 2007 primarily due to higher interest income attributable
    to an increase in average interest rates (the weighted average
    interest rate earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable
    securities increased from 3.04% in fiscal 2006 to 3.97% in
    fiscal 2007), partially offset by higher minority
    interests’ share in the net profits of i-flex and Oracle
    Japan.

Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal
    2005:

Non-operating income, net increased in
    fiscal 2006 as a result of higher foreign currency gains on our
    Japanese net investment hedge and the Chinese currency
    revaluation, $14 million of equity in earnings associated
    with our interest in i-flex and higher gains on sales of equity
    securities. Interest income decreased slightly due to lower
    average cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities
    balances, partially offset by higher interest rates. The
    weighted average interest rate earned on cash, cash equivalents
    and marketable securities increased from 1.93% in fiscal 2005 to
    3.04% in fiscal 2006.

Provision for Income Taxes:

The
    effective tax rate in all periods is the result of the mix of
    income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad
    range of income tax rates. The provision for income taxes
    differs from the tax computed at the federal statutory income
    tax rate due primarily to state taxes and earnings considered as
    indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Future effective
    tax rates could be adversely affected if earnings are lower than
    anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates, by
    unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations, or by adverse
    rulings in tax related litigation.

Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006:

Provision
    for income taxes increased in fiscal 2007 primarily due to
    higher earnings before tax, partially offset by a lower
    effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 was
    slightly lower than in fiscal 2006 primarily due to additional
    research and development tax credits as well as agreements
    reached with foreign tax authorities on certain tax positions.

Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005:

Provision
    for income taxes increased in fiscal 2006 due to higher earnings
    before tax and a higher effective tax rate. The increase in the
    effective tax rate in fiscal 2006 is primarily attributable to a
    higher percentage of earnings in high tax jurisdictions as
    compared with other lower tax rate jurisdictions. In addition,
    we did not benefit from certain non-recurring tax events in
    fiscal 2006 that occurred in fiscal 2005, including the
    settlement of audits and expiration of statutes of limitations
    on certain tax assessments and the

true-up

of
    estimated tax accruals upon the filing of our prior year tax
    returns. We also incurred higher non-deductible in-process
    research and development charges in fiscal 2006.

Working capital:

The decrease in
    working capital in fiscal 2007 was primarily a result of cash
    used to pay for our acquisitions and stock repurchases,
    partially offset by increases in operating cash flows from
    higher sales volumes, proceeds received from employee stock
    option exercises and an increase in our long-term borrowings.
    The increase in working capital in fiscal 2006 is primarily due
    to our issuance of $5.75 billion long-term senior notes in
    January 2006 as well as greater cash flows from operations from
    higher sales volumes, partially offset by cash used to pay for
    acquisitions, stock repurchases, and the reduction of our other
    debt obligations.

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable
    securities:

Cash and cash equivalents consist
    of highly liquid investments in time deposits held at major
    banks, commercial paper, United States government agency
    discount notes, money market mutual funds and other money market
    securities with original maturities of 90 days or less.
    Marketable securities primarily consist of commercial paper,
    corporate notes and United States government agency notes. Cash,
    cash equivalents and marketable securities include
    $5.0 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries as of
    May 31, 2007. The decrease in cash, cash equivalents and
    marketable securities is a result of cash used to pay for
    acquisitions and stock repurchases, partially offset by an
    increase in our operating cash flows from higher sales volumes,
    increases in our short-term and long-term borrowings and
    proceeds from stock option exercises.

Days sales outstanding, which is calculated by dividing period
    end accounts receivable by average daily sales for the quarter,
    was 62 days at May 31, 2007 compared with 55 days
    at May 31, 2006. The days sales outstanding calculation
    excludes the adjustment to reduce software license updates and
    product support revenues related to adjusting the carrying value
    for deferred support revenues acquired to fair value. Our
    increase in days sales outstanding is primarily due to higher
    days sales outstanding from acquired companies, as well as
    differences in the timing of completion of certain sales
    transactions between years.

Cash flows from operating
    activities:

Our largest source of operating
    cash flows is cash collections from our customers following the
    purchase and renewal of their software license updates and
    product support agreements. Payments from customers for software
    license updates and product support agreements are generally
    received by the beginning of the contract term, which is
    generally one year in length. We also generate significant cash
    from new software license sales and, to a lesser extent,
    services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are
    for personnel related expenditures as well as payments related
    to taxes and facilities.

Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006:

Cash
    flows provided by operating activities increased in fiscal 2007
    primarily due to higher net income before non-cash charges,
    partially offset by increased accounts receivables due to fourth
    quarter fiscal 2007 revenue growth, cash payments to terminate
    leases associated with excess facilities assumed in the Siebel
    acquisition, an increase in cash interest payments resulting
    from higher average borrowings and the settlement of a
    pre-acquisition lawsuit filed against PeopleSoft.

Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005:

Cash
    flows provided by operating activities increased in fiscal 2006
    primarily due to higher sales volumes and higher net income,
    excluding non-cash charges, partially offset by increased
    accounts receivables due to fourth quarter fiscal 2006 revenue
    growth.

Cash flows from investing
    activities:

The changes in cash flows from
    investing activities primarily relate to acquisitions and the
    timing of purchases, maturities and sales of marketable
    securities. We also use cash to invest in capital and other
    assets to support our growth.

Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006:

Cash used
    for investing activities increased in fiscal 2007 due to an
    increase in cash used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired. We
    paid cash to purchase a number of companies in fiscal 2007
    including Hyperion, Stellent, MetaSolv, and Portal Software, and
    to purchase additional equity securities in i-flex. Cash
    outflows in fiscal 2006 primarily relate to our acquisition of
    Siebel and our equity investment purchases in i-flex.



Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005:

Cash used
    for investing activities decreased in fiscal 2006 primarily due
    to lower cash payments for acquisitions, net of cash acquired,
    as well as proceeds from property sales. Investing cash outflows
    in fiscal 2005 include cash paid for our acquisition of
    PeopleSoft, whereas investing cash outflows in fiscal 2006
    primarily relate to our acquisition of Siebel and our equity
    investment purchases in i-flex.

Cash flows from financing
    activities:

The changes in cash flows from
    financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and payments
    under debt obligations as well as stock repurchase and stock
    option exercise activity.

Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006:

Net cash
    used for financing activities in fiscal 2007 primarily relates
    to an increase in stock repurchases and lower borrowings net of
    repayments when compared with the prior year. At May 31,
    2007 we had approximately $4.2 billion available for share
    repurchases pursuant to a program authorized by our Board of
    Directors and we intend to continue to repurchase shares
    pursuant to this program.

Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005:

Cash
    provided by financing activities decreased in fiscal 2006
    primarily due to higher stock repurchases, partially offset by
    higher net borrowings. We increased our share repurchases in
    fiscal 2006 due to the issuance of approximately
    141 million shares of common stock in connection with our
    Siebel acquisition.

Free cash flow:

To supplement our
    statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use
    non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing

4-quarter

basis to analyze cash flow generated from operations. We believe
    free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing
    our performance with our competitors. The presentation of
    non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in
    isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of
    our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from
    operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate
    free cash flows as follows:

Long-Term
    Customer Financing

In fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, $891 million,
    $618 million and $456 million or approximately 15%,
    13% and 11%, respectively, of our new software license revenues
    were financed through our financing division. We generally sell
    contracts that we have financed on a non-recourse basis to
    financial institutions. We record the transfers of amounts due
    from customers to financial institutions as sales of financial
    assets because we are considered to have surrendered control of
    these financial assets.

Contractual
    Obligations

The contractual obligations presented in the table below
    represent our estimates of future payments under fixed
    contractual obligations and commitments. Changes in our business
    needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates and
    other factors may result in actual payments differing from these
    estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and
    amounts of payments. We have presented below a summary of the
    most



significant assumptions used in our information within the
    context of our consolidated financial position, results of
    operations and cash flows. The following is a summary of our
    contractual obligations as of May 31, 2007:

In May 2007, we entered into an agreement to acquire Agile
    Software Corporation, a leading provider of product lifecycle
    management software, for $8.10 per share in cash, or
    approximately $495 million. The merger is subject to
    stockholder and regulatory approval and other customary closing
    conditions and is expected to close in mid to late July 2007.
    This commitment is not reflected in the above table.



Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or
    are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our
    financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or
    expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures
    or capital resources that are material to investors.

Recent
    Financing Activities

Commercial
    Paper Program

In February 2006, we entered into dealer agreements with various
    financial institutions and an Issuing and Paying Agency
    Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association,
    relating to a $3.0 billion commercial paper program
    (CP Program). Under the CP Program, we may issue and
    sell unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a private
    placement exemption from the registration requirements under
    federal and state securities laws. In fiscal 2007, we issued
    approximately $2.1 billion of short-term promissory notes
    (Commercial Paper Notes) pursuant to our CP Program, of
    which $1.4 billion remained outstanding and
    $1.6 billion remained as additional capacity under our
    CP Program as of May 31, 2007. The maturities of the
    Commercial Paper Notes ranged between two weeks and three months
    and the weighted average yield, including issuance costs, was
    5.33% at May 31, 2007. We did not have any outstanding
    borrowings under our CP Program at May 31, 2006.

Senior
    Notes Payable

In May 2007, we issued $2.0 billion of floating rate senior
    notes, of which $1.0 billion is due May 2009 (New 2009
    Notes) and $1.0 billion is due May 2010 (2010 Notes). We
    issued the New 2009 Notes and 2010 Notes to fund the redemption
    of the $1.5 billion of senior floating rate notes that we
    issued in fiscal 2006 (see below) and for general corporate
    purposes. The New 2009 Notes and 2010 Notes bear interest at a
    rate of three-month USD LIBOR plus 0.02% and 0.06%,
    respectively, and interest is payable quarterly. The New 2009
    Notes and 2010 Notes may not be redeemed prior to their maturity.

In January 2006, we issued $5.75 billion of senior notes
    consisting of $1.5 billion of floating rate senior notes
    due 2009 (Original 2009 Notes), $2.25 billion of
    5.00% senior notes due 2011 (2011 Notes) and
    $2.0 billion of 5.25% senior notes due 2016 (2016
    Notes and together with the Original 2009 Notes and the 2011
    Notes, Original Senior Notes) to finance the Siebel acquisition
    and for general corporate purposes. On June 16, 2006, we
    completed a registered exchange offer of the Original Senior
    Notes for registered senior notes with substantially identical
    terms to the Original Senior Notes.

In May 2007 we redeemed the Original 2009 Notes for their
    principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our 2011
    Notes and 2016 Notes may also be redeemed at any time, subject
    to payment of a make-whole premium. The 2011 Notes and 2016
    Notes bear interest at the rate of 5.00% and 5.25% per year,
    respectively. Interest is payable semi-annually for the 2011
    notes and 2016 notes.

The effective interest yields of the New 2009 Notes, 2010 Notes,
    2011 Notes and 2016 Notes (collectively, the Senior Notes) at
    May 31, 2007 were 5.38%, 5.42%, 5.09% and 5.33%,
    respectively.

The Senior Notes rank pari passu with the Commercial Paper Notes
    and all existing and future senior indebtedness of Oracle
    Corporation. All existing and future liabilities of the
    subsidiaries of Oracle Corporation will be effectively senior to
    the Senior Notes and the Commercial Paper Notes.

We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents,
    marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be
    sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and
    contractual obligations. In addition, we believe we could fund
    acquisitions, including the Agile acquisition, and repurchase
    common stock with our internally available cash and investments,
    cash generated from operations, amounts available under our
    credit facilities, additional borrowings or from the issuance of
    additional securities.

Quarterly
    Results of Operations

Quarterly revenues and expenses have historically been affected
    by a variety of seasonal factors, including sales compensation
    plans. These seasonal factors are common in the software
    industry. These factors have caused a



decrease in our first quarter revenues as compared to revenues
    in the immediately preceding fourth quarter, which historically
    has been the highest revenue quarter. We expect this trend to
    continue in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. In addition, our
    European operations generally provide lower revenues in our
    first fiscal quarter because of the reduced economic activity in
    Europe during the summer.

The following table sets forth selected unaudited quarterly
    information for our last eight fiscal quarters. We believe that
    all necessary adjustments, which consisted only of normal
    recurring adjustments, have been included in the amounts stated
    below to present fairly the results of such periods when read in
    conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and
    related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

The sum of the quarterly financial information may vary from the
    annual data due to rounding.

Stock
    Options

Our stock option program is a key component of the compensation
    package we provide to attract and retain talented employees and
    align their interests with the interests of existing
    stockholders. We recognize that options dilute existing
    stockholders and have sought to control the number of options
    granted while providing competitive compensation packages.
    Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential
    dilution for each of the last three full fiscal years has been
    less than 2.0% and has averaged 1.7% per year. The potential
    dilution percentage is calculated as the new option grants for
    the year (including options assumed in acquisitions), net of
    options forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by
    the total outstanding shares at the beginning of the year. This
    maximum potential dilution will only result if all options are
    exercised. Some of these options, which have

10-year

exercise periods, have exercise prices substantially higher than
    the current market price. At May 31, 2007, 12% of our
    outstanding stock options had exercise prices in excess of the
    current market price. Consistent with our historical practices,
    we do not expect that dilution from future grants before the
    effect of our stock repurchase program will exceed 2.0% per year
    for our ongoing business. Over the last 10 years, our stock
    repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of
    our stock option program; however, we may reduce the level of
    our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available
    cash for acquisitions, to repay indebtedness or for other
    purposes. At May 31, 2007, the maximum potential dilution
    from all outstanding and unexercised option awards, regardless
    of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and
    including options where the strike price is higher than the
    current market price, was 8.5%.

The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviews and
    approves the organization-wide stock option grants to selected
    employees, all stock option grants to executive officers and any
    individual stock option grants in excess of 100,000 shares.
    A separate Plan Committee, which is an executive officer
    committee, approves individual stock option grants of up to
    100,000 shares to non-executive officers and employees.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest Income Rate Risk.

In the first
    quarter of fiscal 2007, we began designating newly acquired
    fixed income investments as available-for-sale. As a result of
    the available-for-sale designation, all securities purchased
    after May 31, 2006 are recorded on the balance sheet at
    fair market value. As of May 31, 2007, substantially all
    investments held are classified as available-for-sale.

We generally purchase investments with relatively short
    maturities. Therefore, interest rate movements generally do not
    materially affect the valuation of our investments. Auction rate
    securities are reported on the balance sheet at par value, which
    equals market value, as the rate on such securities re-sets
    generally every 7 to 28 days. Changes in the overall level
    of interest rates affect our interest income that is generated
    from our investments. For fiscal 2007, total interest income was
    $295 million with investments yielding an average 3.97% on
    a worldwide basis. This interest rate level was up approximately
    93 basis points from 3.04% for fiscal 2006. If overall
    interest rates fell by a similar amount (93 basis points)
    in fiscal 2008, our interest income would decline by
    approximately $70 million, assuming consistent investment
    levels. The table below presents the cash, cash equivalent and
    marketable securities balances



and the related weighted average interest rates for our
    investment portfolio at May 31, 2007. The cash, cash
    equivalent and marketable securities balances approximate fair

Interest Expense Rate Risk.

Borrowings
    as of May 31, 2007 were $7.6 billion, consisting of
    $5.6 billion of fixed rate borrowings and $2.0 billion
    of variable rate borrowings. Our variable rate borrowings were
    as follows at May 31, 2007:

The 2009 and 2010 Notes bear interest at a floating rate equal
    to three-month LIBOR plus 0.02% per year and 0.06% per year,
    respectively.

Interest expense for fiscal 2007 was $343 million. Based on
    effective interest rates at May 31, 2007, a 50 basis
    point increase in interest rates on our borrowings subject to
    variable interest rate fluctuations would increase our interest
    expense by approximately $17 million annually.

Foreign Currency Transaction Risk.

We
    transact business in various foreign currencies and have
    established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency
    forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the
    effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this
    program, increases or decreases in our foreign currency
    exposures are offset by gains or losses on the forward
    contracts, to mitigate the possibility of foreign currency
    transaction gains or losses. These foreign currency exposures
    typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees and other
    intercompany transactions. Our forward contracts generally have
    terms of 90 days or less. We do not use forward contracts
    for trading purposes. All outstanding foreign currency forward
    contracts (excluding our Yen equity hedge described below) are
    marked to market at the end of the period with unrealized gains
    and losses included in non-operating income, net. Our ultimate
    realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will
    depend on the currency exchange rates and other factors in
    effect as the contracts mature. Net foreign exchange transaction
    gains



(losses) included in non-operating income, net in the
    accompanying consolidated statements of operations were
    $17 million, $15 million and $(28) million in
    fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The unrealized gains
    (losses) of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts
    were $5 million and $(0.3) million at May 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively.

The tables below present the notional amounts (at contract
    exchange rates) and the weighted average contractual foreign
    currency exchange rates for the outstanding forward contracts as
    of May 31, 2007. Notional weighted average exchange rates
    listed in the tables below are quoted using market conventions.
    All of our forward contracts mature within one year with the
    substantial majority maturing within 90 days or less as of
    May 31, 2007.

Net Investment Risk.

Periodically, we
    hedge the net assets of certain international subsidiaries (net
    investment hedges) using foreign currency forward contracts to
    offset the translation and economic exposures related to our
    investments in these subsidiaries. We measure the effectiveness
    of net investment hedges by using the changes in spot exchange
    rates because this method reflects our risk management
    strategies, the economics of those strategies in our financial
    statements and better manages interest rate differentials
    between different countries. Under this method, the change in
    fair value of the forward contract attributable to the changes
    in spot exchange rates (the effective portion) is reported in
    stockholders’ equity to offset the translation results on
    the net investments. The remaining change in fair value of the
    forward contract (the ineffective portion) is recognized in
    non-operating income, net.

Net gains (losses) on investment hedges reported in
    stockholders’ equity prior to tax effects were
    $45 million, $23 million and $(23) million in
    fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The net gain on
    investment hedges reported in non-operating income, net were
    $28 million, $24 million and $14 million in
    fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

At May 31, 2007, we had one net investment hedge in
    Japanese Yen. The Yen investment hedge minimizes currency risk
    arising from net assets held in Yen as a result of equity
    capital raised during the initial public offering and secondary
    offering of Oracle Japan. The fair value of our Yen investment
    hedge was $0.2 million at May 31, 2007 and 2006. As of
    May 31, 2007, the Yen investment hedge has a notional
    amount of $548 million and an exchange rate of 120.22 Yen
    for each United States dollar.

Controls
    and Procedures

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the
    participation of our Disclosure Committee and our management,
    including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial
    Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
    disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e).

Disclosure controls are procedures that are designed to ensure
    that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed
    under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act,
    such as this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
    periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
    Disclosure controls are also designed to ensure that such
    information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
    including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
    required disclosure. Our quarterly evaluation of disclosure
    controls includes an evaluation of some components of our
    internal control over financial reporting. We also perform a
    separate annual evaluation of internal control over financial
    reporting for the purpose of providing the management report
    below.

The evaluation of our disclosure controls included a review of
    their objectives and design, our implementation of the controls
    and the effect of the controls on the information generated for
    use in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

In the course of the controls evaluation, we reviewed data
    errors or control problems identified and sought to confirm that
    appropriate corrective actions, including process improvements,
    were being undertaken. This type of evaluation is performed on a
    quarterly basis so that the conclusions of management, including
    our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
    concerning the effectiveness of the disclosure controls can be
    reported in our periodic reports on

Form 10-Q

and

Form 10-K.

Many of the components of our disclosure controls are also
    evaluated on an ongoing basis by both our internal audit and
    finance organizations. The overall goals of these various
    evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and
    to modify them as necessary. We intend to maintain the
    disclosure controls as dynamic systems that we adjust as
    circumstances merit.

Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and
    Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls
    and procedures were effective as of the end of the period
    covered by this report.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f).

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    as of May 31, 2007 based on the guidelines established in
    Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO). Our internal control over financial reporting includes
    policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance
    regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
    preparation of financial statements for external reporting
    purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles.

Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded
    that our internal control over financial reporting was effective
    as of May 31, 2007. We reviewed the results of
    management’s assessment with our Finance and Audit
    Committee.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting as of May 31,
    2007 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an
    independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
    their report which is included in Part IV, Item 15 of
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial
    reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required
    by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15

or

15d-15

that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have
    materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, our internal control over financial reporting.



Inherent
    Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and
    procedures and internal control over financial reporting are
    effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our
    management does not expect that our disclosure controls and
    procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will
    prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter
    how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable,
    not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control
    system are met. Further, the design of a control system must
    reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the
    benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
    Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
    evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all
    control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been
    detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that
    judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns
    can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally,
    controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some
    persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management
    override of the controls. The design of any system of controls
    also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the
    likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that
    any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all
    potential future conditions; over time, controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of
    compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because
    of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,
    misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be
    detected.

REPORT OF
    ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
    ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Oracle Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Oracle Corporation as of May 31, 2007 and 2006, and the
    related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended May 31, 2007. Our audits also
    included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
    Item 15(a) 2. These financial statements and schedule are
    the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and
    schedule are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
    assessing the accounting principles used and significant
    estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
    financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Oracle Corporation at May 31, 2007
    and 2006, and the consolidated results of its operations and its
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    May 31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the
    related financial statement schedule, when considered in
    relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
    presents fairly in all material respects the information set
    forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of Oracle Corporation’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of May 31, 2007, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated June 28, 2007 expressed an
    unqualified opinion thereon.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, under the heading Stock-Based Compensation, the
    Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment,”
    effective June 1, 2006. As discussed in Note 19 to the
    consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Statement
    of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements
    No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R),” in fiscal 2007.

REPORT OF
    ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
    ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Oracle Corporation

We have audited management’s assessment, which is contained
    in Part I, Item 9A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

under the heading “Management’s Report on Internal
    Control Over Financial Reporting,” that Oracle Corporation
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of May 31, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (the COSO criteria). Oracle Corporation’s management is
    responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
    is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
    opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal
    control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Oracle
    Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of May 31, 2007, is fairly stated, in all
    material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our
    opinion, Oracle Corporation maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of May 31, 2007, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    2007 consolidated financial statements of Oracle Corporation and
    our report dated June 28, 2007 expressed an unqualified
    opinion thereon.

ORGANIZATION
    AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Oracle Corporation develops, manufactures, markets, distributes
    and services database, middleware and applications software that
    helps organizations manage and grow their businesses. Database
    and middleware software is used for developing and deploying
    applications on the internet and on corporate intranets.
    Applications software can be used to automate business processes
    and to provide business intelligence. We also offer software
    license updates and product support (including support for the
    Linux Operating System), and other services including
    consulting, On Demand, and education.

Oracle Corporation is a holding corporation with ownership of
    its direct and indirect subsidiaries, which include Oracle
    Systems Corporation (Old Oracle), Siebel Systems, Inc. (Siebel)
    and each of their domestic and foreign subsidiaries around the
    world. Oracle Corporation, or Oracle, was initially formed as a
    direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Old Oracle. Prior to
    January 31, 2006, Oracle’s name was Ozark Holding Inc.
    and Old Oracle’s name was Oracle Corporation. On
    January 31, 2006, in connection with the acquisition of
    Siebel, which is described in Note 2, a wholly-owned
    subsidiary of Oracle was merged with and into Old Oracle, with
    Old Oracle surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oracle (the
    Reorganization). In addition, another wholly-owned subsidiary of
    Oracle was merged with and into Siebel, with Siebel surviving as
    a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oracle. As a result, Oracle became
    the parent company of Old Oracle and Siebel, and the changes to
    the names of Oracle and Old Oracle were effected.

Basis of
    Financial Statements

The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and
    the accounts of our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. We
    consolidate all of our majority-owned subsidiaries and reflect
    as minority interest the portion of these entities that we do
    not own in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated
    balance sheets. At May 31, 2007 and 2006, the balance of
    minority interests was $316 million and $209 million,
    respectively. Intercompany transactions and balances have been
    eliminated. Certain prior year balances have been reclassified
    to conform to the current year presentation. Such
    reclassifications did not affect total revenues, operating
    income or net income.

Use of
    Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
    These accounting principles require us to make certain
    estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the
    estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are
    reasonable based upon information available to us at the time
    that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These
    estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported
    amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the
    financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues
    and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent there
    are material differences between these estimates, judgments or
    assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be
    affected. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a
    particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does
    not require management’s judgment in its application. There
    are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting
    among available alternatives would not produce a materially
    different result.

Revenue
    Recognition

We derive revenues from the following sources:
    (1) software, which includes new software license and
    software license updates and product support revenues, and
    (2) services, which include consulting, On Demand and
    education revenues.

New software license revenues represent fees earned from
    granting customers licenses to use our database, middleware and
    applications software, and exclude revenues derived from
    software license updates, which are included in software license
    updates and product support. While the basis for software
    license revenue recognition is substantially governed by the
    provisions of Statement of Position

No. 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition

, issued



ORACLE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS—(Continued)

May 31, 2007

by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, we
    exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the
    determination of the amount of software and services revenues to
    be recognized in each accounting period.

For software license arrangements that do not require
    significant modification or customization of the underlying
    software, we recognize new software license revenues when:
    (1) we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a
    customer for the license of software; (2) we deliver the
    products; (3) customer payment is deemed fixed or
    determinable and free of contingencies or significant
    uncertainties; and (4) collection is probable.
    Substantially all of our new software license revenues are
    recognized in this manner.

The vast majority of our software license arrangements include
    software license updates and product support, which are
    recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement, typically
    one year. Software license updates provide customers with rights
    to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases
    and patches released during the term of the support period.
    Product support includes internet access to technical content,
    as well as internet and telephone access to technical support
    personnel. Software license updates and product support are
    generally priced as a percentage of the net new software license
    fees. Substantially all of our customers purchase both software
    license updates and product support when they acquire new
    software licenses. In addition, substantially all of our
    customers renew their software license updates and product
    support contracts annually.

Many of our software arrangements include consulting
    implementation services sold separately under consulting
    engagement contracts. Consulting revenues from these
    arrangements are generally accounted for separately from new
    software license revenues because the arrangements qualify as
    service transactions as defined in

SOP 97-2.

The more significant factors considered in determining whether
    the revenues should be accounted for separately include the
    nature of services (i.e., consideration of whether the services
    are essential to the functionality of the licensed product),
    degree of risk, availability of services from other vendors,
    timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance
    criteria on the realizability of the software license fee.
    Revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the
    services are performed. If there is a significant uncertainty
    about the project completion or receipt of payment for the
    consulting services, revenues are deferred until the uncertainty
    is sufficiently resolved. We estimate the proportional
    performance on contracts with fixed or “not to exceed”
    fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a
    percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project. We
    recognize no more than 90% of the milestone or total contract
    amount until project acceptance is obtained. If we do not have a
    sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion,
    revenues are recognized when we receive final acceptance from
    the customer. When total cost estimates exceed revenues, we
    accrue for the estimated losses immediately using cost estimates
    that are based upon an average fully burdened daily rate
    applicable to the consulting organization delivering the
    services. The complexity of the estimation process and factors
    relating to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent
    with the application of the proportional performance method of
    accounting affects the amounts of revenues and related expenses
    reported in our consolidated financial statements. A number of
    internal and external factors can affect our estimates,
    including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and
    specification and testing requirement changes.

If an arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting of
    the software license and consulting transactions, then new
    software license revenue is generally recognized together with
    the consulting services based on contract accounting using
    either the percentage-of-completion or completed-contract
    method. Contract accounting is applied to any arrangements:
    (1) that include milestones or customer specific acceptance
    criteria that may affect collection of the software license
    fees; (2) where services include significant modification
    or customization of the software; (3) where significant
    consulting services are provided for in the software license
    contract without additional charge or are substantially
    discounted; or (4) where the software license payment is
    tied to the performance of consulting services.

On Demand is comprised of Oracle On Demand, CRM On Demand and
    Advanced Customer Services. Oracle On Demand provides
    multi-featured software and hardware management and maintenance
    services for our database, middleware and applications software.
    CRM On Demand is a service offering that provides our customers
    with our



ORACLE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS—(Continued)

May 31, 2007

Siebel CRM Software functionality delivered via a hosted
    solution that we manage. Advanced Customer Services provide
    customers configuration and performance analysis, personalized
    support and annual

on-site

technical services. Revenues from On Demand services are
    recognized over the term of the service period, which is
    generally one year or less.

Education revenues include instructor-led, media-based and
    internet-based training in the use of our products. Education
    revenues are recognized as the classes or other education
    offerings are delivered.

For arrangements with multiple elements, we allocate revenues to
    each element of a transaction based upon its fair value as
    determined by “vendor specific objective evidence.”
    Vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for all
    elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and
    discounting practices for those products and services when sold
    separately and for software license updates and product support
    services, is additionally measured by the renewal rate offered
    to the customer. We may modify our pricing practices in the
    future, which could result in changes in our vendor specific
    objective evidence of fair value for these undelivered elements.
    As a result, our future revenue recognition for multiple element
    arrangements could differ significantly from our historical
    results.

We defer revenues for any undelivered elements, and recognize
    revenues when the product is delivered or over the period in
    which the service is performed, in accordance with our revenue
    recognition policy for such element. If we cannot objectively
    determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in
    bundled software and service arrangements, we defer revenue
    until all elements are delivered and services have been
    performed, or until fair value can objectively be determined for
    any remaining undelivered elements. When the fair value of a
    delivered element has not been established, we use the residual
    method to record revenue if the fair value of all undelivered
    elements is determinable. Under the residual method, the fair
    value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining
    portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered
    elements and is recognized as revenues.

Substantially all of our software license arrangements do not
    include acceptance provisions. However, if acceptance provisions
    exist as part of public policy, for example in agreements with
    government entities when acceptance periods are required by law,
    or within previously executed terms and conditions that are
    referenced in the current agreement and are short-term in
    nature, we provide for a sales return allowance in accordance
    with FASB Statement No. 48,

Revenue Recognition when
    Right of Return Exists

. If acceptance provisions are
    long-term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an
    arrangement or if we cannot reasonably estimate the incidence of
    returns, revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of
    written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance
    period.

We also evaluate arrangements with governmental entities
    containing “fiscal funding” or “termination for
    convenience” provisions, when such provisions are required
    by law, to determine the probability of possible cancellation.
    We consider multiple factors, including the history with the
    customer in similar transactions, the “essential use”
    of the software licenses and the planning, budgeting and
    approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity. If we
    determine upon execution of these arrangements that the
    likelihood of cancellation is remote, we then recognize revenues
    once all of the criteria described above have been met. If such
    a determination cannot be made, revenues are recognized upon the
    earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding
    provision by the governmental entity.

We assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of
    sale and recognize revenue if all other revenue recognition
    requirements are met. Our standard payment terms are
    net 30; however, terms may vary based on the country in
    which the agreement is executed. Payments that are due within
    six months are generally deemed to be fixed or determinable
    based on our successful collection history on such arrangements,
    and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue
    recognition.

While most of our arrangements include short-term payment terms,
    we have a standard practice of providing long-term financing to
    credit worthy customers through our financing division. Since
    fiscal 1989, when our financing



ORACLE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS—(Continued)

May 31, 2007

division was formed, we have established a history of
    collection, without concessions, on these receivables with
    payment terms that generally extend up to five years from the
    contract date. Provided all other revenue recognition criteria
    have been met, we recognize new software license revenues for
    these arrangements upon delivery, net of any payment discounts
    from financing transactions. We have generally sold receivables
    financed through our financing division on a non-recourse basis
    to third party financing institutions and we classify the
    proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating
    activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. In
    fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, $891 million, $618 million
    and $456 million or approximately 15%, 13% and 11% of our
    new software license revenues were financed through our
    financing division. We account for the sale of these receivables
    as “true sales” as defined in FASB Statement
    No. 140,

Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of
    Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities.

Our customers include several of our suppliers and on rare
    occasion, we have purchased goods or services for our operations
    from these vendors at or about the same time that we have
    licensed our software to these same companies (Concurrent
    Transaction). Software license agreements that occur within a
    three-month time period from the date we have purchased goods or
    services from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate
    accounting treatment and disclosure. When we acquire goods or
    services from a customer, we negotiate the purchase separately
    from any software license transaction, at terms we consider to
    be at arm’s length, and settle the purchase in cash. We
    recognize new software license revenues from Concurrent
    Transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are met
    and the goods and services acquired are necessary for our
    current operations.

Allowances
    for Doubtful Accounts and Returns

We record allowances for doubtful accounts based upon a specific
    review of all significant outstanding invoices. For those
    invoices not specifically reviewed, provisions are provided at
    differing rates, based upon the age of the receivable, the
    collection history associated with the geographic region that
    the receivable was recorded in and current economic trends. We
    also record a provision for estimated sales returns and
    allowances on product and service related sales in the same
    period the related revenues are recorded in accordance with FASB
    Statement No. 48,

Revenue Recognition When Right of

. These estimates are based on historical sales
    returns, the volume and size of our larger transactions and
    other known factors.

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that are potentially subject to
    concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash
    equivalents, marketable securities and trade receivables.
    Investment policies have been implemented that limit investments
    to investment grade securities. We do not require collateral to
    secure accounts receivable. The risk with respect to trade
    receivables is mitigated by credit evaluations we perform on our
    customers, the short duration of our payment terms and by the
    diversification of our customer base. No single customer
    accounted for 10% or more of revenues in fiscal 2007, 2006 or
    2005.

Other
    Receivables

Other receivables represent value-added tax and sales tax
    receivables associated with the sale of software and services to
    third parties.

Marketable
    Securities

In accordance with FASB Statement No. 115,

Accounting
    for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,

and
    based on our intentions regarding these instruments, we classify
    our marketable debt and equity securities as available-for-sale.
    Prior to fiscal 2007, marketable debt securities were classified
    as held to maturity. Marketable debt and equity securities are
    reported at fair value, with all unrealized gains (losses)
    reflected net of tax in stockholders’ equity. If we
    determine that an investment has an other than temporary decline
    in fair value, generally



ORACLE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS—(Continued)

May 31, 2007

defined as when our cost basis exceeds the fair value for
    approximately six months, we recognize the investment loss in
    non-operating income, net in the accompanying consolidated
    statements of operations. We periodically evaluate our
    investments to determine if impairment charges are required.

The net carrying value of our marketable equity securities and
    other investments, which approximated fair value, as of
    May 31, 2007 and 2006 was $67 million and
    $81 million, respectively. Marketable equity securities are
    included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated
    balance sheets. Unrealized gains (losses) in stockholders’
    equity, net of tax associated with marketable equity securities
    were $(4) million, $(3) million and $6 million
    for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We had nominal
    impairment losses related to marketable equity securities and
    other investments in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005.

Property

Property is stated at the lower of cost or realizable value, net
    of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the
    straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of the
    assets, which range from one to fifty years. Leasehold
    improvements are amortized over the lesser of estimated useful
    lives or lease terms, as appropriate. Property is periodically
    reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
    not be recoverable. We did not recognize any property impairment
    charges in fiscal 2007, 2006 or 2005.

Goodwill
    and Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a
    business combination over the fair value of net tangible and
    intangible assets acquired. Goodwill amounts are not amortized,
    but rather are tested for impairment at least annually.
    Intangible assets that are not considered to have an indefinite
    useful life are amortized over their useful lives, which range
    from one to ten years. The carrying amount of these assets is
    reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
    Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of the
    carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash
    flows the asset is expected to generate. If the asset is
    considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is
    measured as the difference between the carrying value and the
    fair value of the impaired asset. We did not recognize any
    goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2007,
    2006 or 2005.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying value of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term
    borrowings approximates fair value due to the short period of
    time to maturity. We record changes in fair value for our
    marketable securities, publicly-traded equity securities,
    foreign currency forward contracts and investment hedge based on
    quoted market prices. Based on the trading prices of our
    $6.25 billion and $5.75 billion senior notes
    outstanding as of May 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and
    the interest rates we could obtain for other borrowings with
    similar terms at those dates, the estimated fair value of our
    borrowings at May 31, 2007 and 2006 was $6.16 billion
    and $5.73 billion, respectively.

Legal
    Contingencies

We are currently involved in various claims and legal
    proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant
    matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the
    potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered
    probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a
    liability for the estimated loss.

Foreign
    Currency

We transact business in various foreign currencies. In general,
    the functional currency of a foreign operation is the local
    country’s currency. Consequently, revenues and expenses of
    operations outside the United States are translated



ORACLE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS—(Continued)

May 31, 2007

into United States dollars using weighted-average exchange rates
    while assets and liabilities of operations outside the United
    States are translated into United States dollars using year-end
    exchange rates. The effects of foreign currency translation
    adjustments are included in stockholders’ equity as a
    component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Foreign currency
    transaction gains (losses) are included in non-operating income,
    net in our consolidated statements of operations and were
    $45 million, $39 million and $(14) million in
    fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

On June 1, 2006, we adopted FASB Statement No. 123R,

Share-Based Payment

, under the modified prospective
    method. Statement 123R generally requires share-based payments
    to employees, including grants of employee stock options and
    purchases under employee stock purchase plans, to be recognized
    in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair
    values. Under the modified prospective method, prior period
    financial statements are not restated.

Prior to June 1, 2006, we accounted for our stock-based
    compensation plans under the intrinsic value method of
    accounting as defined by Accounting Principles Board Opinion
    No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

and
    applied the disclosure provisions of FASB Statement
    No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

, as
    amended. Under Opinion 25, we generally did not recognize any
    compensation expense for stock options granted to employees or
    outside directors as the exercise price of our options was
    equivalent to the market price of our common stock on the date
    of grant. However, we recorded stock-based compensation for the
    intrinsic value associated with unvested options assumed in
    connection with acquisitions. For pro forma disclosures of
    stock-based compensation prior to June 1, 2006, the
    estimated fair values for options granted and options assumed
    were amortized using the accelerated expense attribution method.
    In addition, we reduced pro forma stock-based compensation
    expense for actual forfeitures in the periods they occurred. In
    March 2005, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
    issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107, which
    provides supplemental implementation guidance for Statement
    123R. We have applied the provisions of SAB 107 in our
    adoption of Statement 123R. See Note 7 for information on
    the impact of our adoption of Statement 123R and the assumptions
    we use to calculate the fair value of share-based employee
    compensation.

Advertising

All advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising
    expenses, which are included within sales and marketing
    expenses, were $91 million, $106 million and
    $67 million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Research
    and Development

All research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
    Costs eligible for capitalization under FASB Statement
    No. 86,

Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to
    Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed

, were not material to
    our consolidated financial statements.

Non-Operating
    Income, net

Non-operating income, net consists primarily of interest income,
    net foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net investment
    gains related to marketable equity securities and other
    investments and the minority interest share in the net profits
    of Oracle Japan and i-flex solutions limited (see Note 2).

Accounting for Income Taxes

. Deferred
    income taxes are recorded for the expected tax consequences of
    temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and
    liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts
    recognized for income tax purposes. We record a valuation
    allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of
    future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes:

In
    June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation
    of FASB Statement No. 109.

Interpretation 48 clarifies
    the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an
    entity’s financial statements in accordance with Statement
    109 and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement
    attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of
    a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
    Additionally, Interpretation 48 provides guidance on
    derecognition, classification, interest and penalties,
    accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.
    Interpretation 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2006, with early adoption permitted. We will
    adopt Interpretation 48 for our fiscal year ending May 31,
    2008 and are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of
    Interpretation 48 on our consolidated financial statements.

How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to
    Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income
    Statement:

In June 2006, the FASB reached a
    consensus on Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue

No. 06-3,

How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to
    Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income
    Statement (That Is, Gross versus Net Presentation)

(EITF 06-3).

EITF 06-3

indicates that the income statement presentation on either a
    gross basis or a net basis of the taxes within the scope of the
    issue is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed.

EITF 06-3

is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after
    December 15, 2006. The adoption of

EITF 06-3

did not change our policy of presenting our taxes within the
    scope of

EITF 06-3

on a net basis and, therefore, had no impact on our consolidated
    financial statements.

Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when
    Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
    Statements:

In September 2006, the SEC issued
    Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,

Considering the
    Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying
    Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements

(SAB 108). SAB 108 addresses the diversity in
    practice in quantifying financial statement misstatements and
    establishes an approach that requires quantification of
    financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the
    misstatements on a company’s financial statements and
    related disclosures. SAB 108 is effective for fiscal years
    ending after November 15, 2006. The application of
    SAB 108 did not have a material impact on our consolidated
    financial statements.

Fair Value Measurements:

measurement disclosures. Statement 157 is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently
    evaluating the impact of the adoption of Statement 157 on our
    consolidated financial statements.

Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities:

In February 2007, the FASB issued
    Statement No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for Financial
    Assets and Financial Liabilities, including an amendment of FASB
    Statement No. 115,

which allows an entity the
    irrevocable option to elect fair value for the initial and
    subsequent measurement for certain financial assets and
    liabilities on an

instrument-by-instrument

basis. Subsequent measurements for the financial assets and
    liabilities an entity elects to record at fair value will be
    recognized in earnings. Statement 159 also establishes
    additional disclosure requirements. Statement 159 is effective
    for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, with
    early adoption permitted provided that the entity also adopts
    Statement 157. We are currently evaluating the impact of the
    adoption of Statement 159 on our consolidated financial
    statements.

ACQUISITIONS

Fiscal
    2007 Acquisitions

Hyperion
    Solutions Corporation

On April 13, 2007, we obtained majority ownership of the
    outstanding common stock of Hyperion Solutions Corporation via a
    cash tender offer as agreed to between us and Hyperion pursuant
    to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated February 28, 2007
    (Merger Agreement). We acquired Hyperion to extend our reach of
    product offerings into the enterprise performance management
    marketplace, as well as to expand our presence in the business
    intelligence software marketplace.

On April 19, 2007, we completed the merger of our
    wholly-owned subsidiary with and into Hyperion and converted
    each remaining outstanding share of Hyperion common stock not
    tendered, into a right to receive $52.00 per share in cash,
    without interest. We have included the financial results of
    Hyperion in our consolidated financial statements as of
    April 13, 2007. The minority interest in the earnings of
    Hyperion for the period from April 13, 2007 to
    April 19, 2007 was nominal.

The total purchase price for Hyperion was approximately
    $3.3 billion and is comprised of:

Fair value of estimated options assumed and restricted stock
    awards/units exchanged:

As of April 19, 2007, Hyperion
    had approximately 6 million stock options, restricted stock
    awards and restricted stock units outstanding. In accordance
    with the Merger Agreement, the conversion value of each option
    assumed was based on the exercise price of each Hyperion option
    multiplied by the conversion ratio of 0.3598, which was
    calculated as the average Oracle stock price for 10 days
    prior to the closing date of April 19, 2007 divided by the
    consideration price of $52.00 paid by Oracle for each Hyperion
    common share outstanding.

The fair value of options assumed and awards exchanged was
    determined using a Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model with the
    following assumptions: expected life of 1.5 to 4.4 years,
    risk-free interest rate of 4.50% to 4.57%, expected volatility
    of 26% and no dividend yield. The fair value of unvested
    Hyperion options and restricted stock awards related to future
    service is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the
    remaining service period, while the value of vested options is
    included in total purchase price.

Preliminary
    Purchase Price Allocation

Under business combination accounting, the total purchase price
    was allocated to Hyperion’s net tangible and identifiable
    intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of
    April 13, 2007 as set forth below. The excess of the
    purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible
    assets was recorded as goodwill. The preliminary allocation of
    the purchase price was based upon a preliminary valuation and
    our estimates and assumptions are subject to change. The primary
    areas of the purchase price allocation that are not yet
    finalized relate to restructuring costs, the valuation of
    consulting contract obligations assumed, the valuation of
    intangible assets acquired, certain legal matters, income and
    non-income based taxes and residual goodwill.

Intangible
    Assets

In performing our preliminary purchase price allocation, we
    considered, among other factors, our intention for future use of
    acquired assets, analyses of historical financial performance
    and estimates of future performance of Hyperion’s products.
    The fair value of intangible assets was based, in part, on a
    valuation completed by a third party valuation firm using an
    income approach and estimates and assumptions provided by
    management. The rates utilized to discount net cash flows to
    their present values were based on our weighted average cost of
    capital and ranged from 10% to 22%. These discount rates were
    determined after consideration of our rate of return on debt
    capital and equity and the weighted average return on invested
    capital. The following table sets forth the components of
    intangible assets associated with the Hyperion acquisition:

products that have reached technological feasibility, includes
    products in most of Hyperion’s product lines. Core
    technology represents a combination of Hyperion processes,
    patents and trade secrets related to the design and development
    of its software products. This proprietary know-how can be
    leveraged to develop new technology and improve Oracle’s
    software products.

In-Process
    Research and Development

We expense in-process research and development (IPR&D) upon
    acquisition as it represents incomplete Hyperion research and
    development projects that had not reached technological
    feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the date of
    our acquisition. Technological feasibility is established when
    an enterprise has completed all planning, designing, coding, and
    testing activities that are necessary to establish that a
    product can be produced to meet its design specifications
    including functions, features, and technical performance
    requirements. The value assigned to IPR&D of
    $56 million was determined by considering the importance of
    each project to our overall development plan, estimating costs
    to develop the purchased IPR&D into commercially viable
    products, estimating the resulting net cash flows from the
    projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows to
    their present value based on the percentage of completion of the
    IPR&D projects.

Deferred
    Revenues

In connection with the preliminary purchase price allocation, we
    have estimated the fair value of the support obligations assumed
    from Hyperion in connection with the acquisition. We based our
    determination of the fair value of the support obligation, in
    part, on a valuation completed by a third party valuation firm
    using estimates and assumptions provided by management. The
    estimated fair value of the support obligations was determined
    utilizing a cost

build-up

approach. The cost

build-up

approach determines fair value by estimating the costs relating
    to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The
    sum of the costs and operating profit approximates, in theory,
    the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to
    assume the support obligations. The estimated costs to fulfill
    the support obligations were based on the historical direct
    costs related to providing the support services and to correct
    any errors in Hyperion software products. We did not include any
    costs associated with selling efforts or research and
    development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs.
    Profit associated with selling effort is excluded because
    Hyperion had concluded the selling effort on the support
    contracts prior to the date of our acquisition. The estimated
    research and development costs have not been included in the
    fair value determination, as these costs were not deemed to
    represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition. As a
    result, in allocating the purchase price, we recorded an
    adjustment to reduce the carrying value of Hyperion’s
    April 13, 2007 deferred support revenue by
    $137 million to $69 million, which represents our
    estimate of the fair value of the support obligation assumed.
    The total estimated fair value of deferred revenues assumed in
    the acquisition of Hyperion is $74 million.

Pre-Acquisition
    Contingencies

As a part of our preliminary review and purchase price
    allocation, as of May 31, 2007 we had not identified any
    material pre-acquisition contingencies relating to Hyperion that
    were both probable of occurrence and estimable. If
    pre-acquisition contingencies become probable in nature and
    estimable during the remainder of the purchase price allocation
    period, amounts recorded for such matters will be made in the
    purchase price allocation.

i-flex
    solutions limited

In November 2005, we obtained a 42.8% interest in i-flex
    solutions limited, a provider of software solutions and services
    to the financial services industry (Bombay Stock Exchange:
    IFLX.BO and National Stock Exchange of India: IFLX.NS) pursuant
    to a Share Purchase Agreement with OrbiTech Limited, a
    subsidiary of Citigroup Inc., for $593 million and through
    an initial open offer in October 2005. We made additional
    purchases of i-flex common stock through ordinary brokerage
    transactions from March 2006 to June 2006. During this period,
    we obtained a



ORACLE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS—(Continued)

majority interest in i-flex and began consolidating the
    financial results of i-flex’s operations on a two months in
    arrears basis (our reporting periods differ from those of
    i-flex) with our financial results in our first quarter of
    fiscal 2007. Prior to obtaining our majority interest in i-flex
    we accounted for our investment in i-flex pursuant to the equity
    method of accounting. We acquired i-flex to expand our reach
    into the marketplace for financial services applications.

On August 14, 2006, the

i-flex

board
    of directors approved, and on September 14, 2006, i-flex
    issued approximately 4.45 million shares of common stock at
    a purchase price of 1,307.5 Indian rupees per share
    (Preferential Allotment). We purchased the Preferential
    Allotment for approximately $126 million and increased our
    ownership to approximately 55%. i-flex used the proceeds from
    the Preferential Allotment to fund the acquisition of Mantas,
    Inc., a financial services application software company, in
    October 2006.

As required by Indian law, we published an announcement on
    September 12, 2006 notifying the public shareholders of
    i-flex of our intention to make an open offer to purchase up to
    20% of the outstanding equity of i-flex for 1,475 Indian rupees
    per share. On December 7, 2006, we increased the price of
    our open offer by 42% to 2,100 Indian rupees per share including
    interest, and increased the number of incremental shares that we
    were willing to purchase to 35%. We also publicly announced at
    that time that the offer was the last opportunity for i-flex
    shareholders to tender their shares to us for the foreseeable
    future as we had no intention of soliciting any additional open
    offers or delisting i-flex shares for at least the next five
    years unless i-flex shares were selling at a price lower than
    our offer price of 2,100 Indian rupees per share. On
    January 6, 2007 we accepted the 23 million shares
    tendered in the offer for approximately $1.1 billion and we
    increased our ownership in i-flex to approximately 83%.

Our cumulative investment in i-flex as of May 31, 2007 was
    approximately $2.1 billion, which consisted of
    $2,039 million of cash paid for common stock and
    $30 million in transaction costs and other expenses.

Our cumulative investment in i-flex has been allocated to
    i-flex’s net tangible and identifiable intangible assets
    based on their estimated fair values as of the respective dates
    of acquisition of the interests. The minority interest in the
    net assets of i-flex has been recorded at historical book
    values. The excess of the cumulative purchase price over our
    interest in the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets
    was recorded as goodwill. Our preliminary allocation of the
    cumulative purchase price including the minority interest in the
    net assets of i-flex is as follows:

Our acquisitions of Portal Software in July 2006 and MetaSolv in
    December 2006 were to expand our application offerings to the
    telecommunications industry. Our acquisition of Stellent in
    December 2006 was to further extend our enterprise content
    management product offerings. We have included the financial
    results of the related acquired companies in our consolidated
    financial statements as of each acquisition date. The
    preliminary purchase price for each of these acquisitions was
    based upon a preliminary valuation and our estimates and
    assumptions are subject to change. The primary areas of the
    purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate to
    identifiable intangible assets, certain legal matters, income
    and non-income based taxes and residual goodwill.

In May 2007, we entered into an agreement to acquire Agile
    Software Corporation, a leading provider of product lifecycle
    management software, for $8.10 per share in cash, or
    approximately $495 million. The merger is subject to
    stockholder and regulatory approval and other customary closing
    conditions and is expected to close in mid to late July 2007.

Fiscal
    2006 Acquisitions

Siebel
    Systems, Inc.

On January 31, 2006, we completed our acquisition of Siebel
    pursuant to our Merger Agreement dated September 12, 2005.
    We acquired Siebel to expand our presence in the customer
    relationship management (CRM) applications software market.

The total purchase price for Siebel was $6.1 billion which
    consisted of $4,073 million in cash paid to acquire the
    outstanding common stock of Siebel, $1,763 million for the
    value of our common stock issued in exchange for Siebel
    outstanding common stock, $245 million for the fair value
    of Siebel options assumed and restricted stock awards exchanged
    and $50 million for transaction costs. In allocating the
    purchase price based on estimated fair values, we recorded
    approximately $2,451 million in goodwill,
    $1,564 million of identifiable intangible assets,
    $2,052 million of net tangible assets and $64 million
    of IPR&D expense.

Other
    Fiscal 2006 Acquisitions

During fiscal 2006, we acquired several software companies and
    purchased certain technology and development organizations for
    approximately $682 million, including transaction costs,
    which included cash paid of $648 million and the fair value
    of options assumed of $34 million. We recorded
    approximately $469 million of goodwill, $173 million
    of identifiable intangible assets, $14 million of
    IPR&D expense and $26 million of net tangible assets
    in connection with these acquisitions during fiscal 2006. We
    have included the effects of these transactions in our results
    of operations prospectively from the respective dates of the
    acquisitions.

    stock of PeopleSoft, Inc. for $26.50 per share in cash as of
    December 29, 2004 and January 6, 2005, respectively.
    On January 7, 2005, we completed the merger of our
    wholly-owned subsidiary with and into PeopleSoft and converted
    each remaining outstanding share of PeopleSoft common stock not
    tendered, into a right to receive $26.50 per share in cash,
    without interest.

    of $10,576 million in cash paid to acquire the outstanding
    common stock of PeopleSoft, $492 million for the fair value
    of options assumed and $12 million in cash for transaction
    costs. In allocating the purchase price based on estimated fair
    values, we recorded approximately $6,253 million of
    goodwill, $3,384 million of identifiable intangible assets,
    $1,410 million of net tangible assets and $33 million
    of IPR&D expense.

Retek
    Inc.

We purchased 5.5 million shares of common stock of Retek
    Inc. on March 7 and 8, 2005, through ordinary brokerage
    transactions at prevailing market prices for a weighted-average
    price of $8.82 per share. In April and May 2005, we acquired the
    remaining outstanding common stock of Retek for $11.25 per
    share, or $584 million.

The total purchase price was $701 million, comprised of
    $633 million of cash paid to acquire the outstanding common
    stock of Retek, $32 million of cash paid for outstanding
    stock options and $36 million of acquisition related
    transaction costs. In allocating the purchase price based on
    estimated fair values, we recorded approximately
    $434 million of goodwill, $133 million of identifiable
    intangible assets, $127 million of net tangible assets and
    $7 million of IPR&D expense.

Unaudited
    Pro Forma Financial Information

The unaudited financial information in the table below
    summarizes the combined results of operations of Oracle,
    Hyperion, Siebel and other collectively significant companies
    acquired, on a pro forma basis, as though the companies had been
    combined as of the beginning of each of the periods presented.
    The pro forma financial information is presented for
    informational purposes only and is not indicative of the results
    of operations that would have been achieved if the acquisitions
    and our short-term and long-term borrowings (see
    Note 5) had taken place at the beginning of each of
    the periods presented. The pro forma financial information for
    all periods presented also includes the business combination
    accounting effect on historical Hyperion, Siebel and other
    collectively significant companies’ support revenues,
    amortization charges from acquired intangible assets,
    stock-based compensation charges for unvested options assumed
    (pursuant to Statement 123R and APB 25 for fiscal 2007 and
    fiscal 2006, respectively), Oracle restructuring costs,
    adjustments to interest expense and related tax effects.

The unaudited pro forma financial information for the year ended
    May 31, 2007 combines the historical results of Oracle for
    the year ended May 31, 2007 and, due to differences in our
    reporting periods, the historical results of Hyperion for the
    10.5 months ended March 31, 2007 and the historical
    results of other collectively significant companies acquired
    based upon their respective previous reporting periods and dates
    acquired by Oracle. The unaudited pro forma financial
    information for the year ended May 31, 2006 combines the
    historical results for Oracle, with the historical results of
    Hyperion for the year ended June 30, 2006, the historical
    results of other collectively significant companies acquired
    based upon their respective previous reporting periods and dates
    acquired by Oracle, and due to differences in our reporting
    periods, the historical results of Siebel for the eight months
    ended December 31, 2005.

RESTRUCTURING
    ACTIVITIES

Fiscal
    2007 Restructuring Plan

During the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2007, management
    approved and initiated plans to restructure certain operations
    of pre-merger Hyperion to eliminate redundant costs resulting
    from the acquisition of Hyperion and improve efficiencies in
    operations. The cash restructuring charges recorded are based on
    restructuring plans that have been committed to by management.

The total estimated restructuring costs associated with exiting
    activities of Hyperion are $108 million, consisting
    primarily of excess facilities obligations through fiscal 2019
    as well as severance and other restructuring costs. These costs
    were recognized as a liability assumed in the purchase business
    combination and included in the allocation of the cost to
    acquire Hyperion and, accordingly, have resulted in an increase
    to goodwill. Our restructuring expenses may change as management
    executes the approved plan. Future decreases to the estimates of
    executing the Hyperion restructuring plan will be recorded as an
    adjustment to goodwill indefinitely, whereas increases to the
    estimates will be recorded as an adjustment to goodwill during
    the purchase accounting allocation period, and as an adjustment
    to operating expenses thereafter.

Fiscal
    2006 Restructuring Plans

During the third quarter of our fiscal year 2006, management
    approved and initiated plans to restructure certain operations
    of Oracle and pre-merger Siebel to eliminate redundant costs
    resulting from the acquisition of Siebel and improve
    efficiencies in operations. The cash restructuring charges
    recorded are based on restructuring plans that have been
    committed to by management.

The total estimated severance costs associated with the Fiscal
    2006 Oracle Restructuring Plan are $92 million, all of
    which have been incurred to date and were recorded to the
    restructuring expense line within our consolidated statements of
    operations. Any changes to the estimates of executing the Fiscal
    2006 Oracle Restructuring Plan will be reflected in our future
    results of operations.

The total estimated restructuring costs associated with exiting
    activities of Siebel are $574 million, consisting primarily
    of excess facilities obligations through fiscal 2022 as well as
    severance and other restructuring costs. These costs were
    recognized as a liability assumed in the purchase business
    combination and included in the allocation of the cost to
    acquire Siebel and, accordingly, have resulted in an increase to
    goodwill. Our restructuring expenses may change as management
    executes the approved plan. Future decreases to the estimates of
    executing the Siebel restructuring plan will be recorded as an
    adjustment to goodwill indefinitely, whereas increases to the
    estimates will be recorded as operating expenses.

Fiscal
    2005 Restructuring Plans

During the third quarter of fiscal 2005, management approved and
    initiated plans to restructure the operations of Oracle,
    PeopleSoft, and Retek Inc. Total estimated restructuring costs
    associated with the Fiscal 2005 Oracle Restructuring Plan were
    $158 million and were recorded to the restructuring expense
    line within our consolidated statements of operations. Total
    estimated restructuring costs associated with exiting activities
    of PeopleSoft and

ACQUISITION
    RELATED CHARGES

Acquisition related charges primarily consist of in-process
    research and development expenses, integration-related
    professional services, stock-compensation expenses and personnel
    related costs for transitional employees. Stock-based
    compensation included in acquisition related charges resulted
    from unvested options assumed from acquisitions whose vesting
    was fully accelerated upon termination of the employees pursuant
    to the terms of these options.

For the year ended May 31, 2007, acquisition related
    charges included a benefit related to the settlement of a
    lawsuit filed against PeopleSoft, Inc. on behalf of the
    U.S. government. This lawsuit was filed in October 2003,
    prior to our acquisition of PeopleSoft. The lawsuit alleged
    PeopleSoft made defective pricing disclosures to the General
    Services Administration. This lawsuit represented a
    pre-acquisition contingency that we identified and assumed in
    connection with the PeopleSoft acquisition. On October 10,
    2006, we agreed to pay the U.S. government $98 million
    to settle this lawsuit. Business combination accounting
    standards require that after the end of the purchase price
    allocation period, any adjustment to amounts recorded that
    relate to a pre-acquisition contingency should be included as an
    element of net income in the period of settlement, versus an
    adjustment to the original purchase price allocation. Since the
    purchase price allocation period for PeopleSoft ended in the
    third quarter of our fiscal year 2006, the favorable difference
    of $52 million between the estimated exposure recorded for
    this lawsuit during the purchase price allocation period and the
    actual settlement amount has been included in our consolidated
    statement of operations for the year ended May 31, 2007.

Commercial
    Paper Program

In February 2006, we entered into dealer agreements with various
    financial institutions and an Issuing and Paying Agency
    Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association,
    relating to a $3.0 billion commercial paper program (CP
    Program). Under the CP Program, we may issue and sell unsecured
    short-term promissory notes pursuant to a private placement
    exemption from the registration requirements under federal and
    state securities laws. In fiscal 2007, we issued approximately
    $2.1 billion of short-term promissory notes (Commercial
    Paper Notes) pursuant to our CP Program. As of May 31,
    2007, the maturities of the Commercial Paper Notes ranged
    between two weeks and three months. The weighted average yield
    of the Commercial Paper Notes, including issuance costs was
    5.33% and we had $1.6 billion of capacity remaining under
    our CP Program at May 31, 2007. We did not have any
    outstanding borrowings under our CP Program at May 31, 2006.

Long-Term
    Borrowings

Senior
    Notes Payable

In May 2007, we issued $2.0 billion of floating rate senior
    notes, of which $1.0 billion is due May 2009 (New 2009
    Notes) and $1.0 billion is due May 2010 (2010 Notes). We
    issued the New 2009 Notes and 2010 Notes to fund the redemption
    of the $1.5 billion of senior floating rate notes that we
    issued in fiscal 2006 (see below) and for general corporate
    purposes. The New 2009 Notes and 2010 Notes bear interest at a
    rate of three-month USD LIBOR plus 0.02% and 0.06%,
    respectively, and interest is payable quarterly. The New 2009
    Notes and 2010 Notes may not be redeemed prior to their maturity.

In January 2006, we issued $5.75 billion of senior notes
    consisting of $1.5 billion of floating rate senior notes
    due 2009 (Original 2009 Notes), $2.25 billion of
    5.00% senior notes due 2011 (2011 Notes) and
    $2.0 billion of 5.25% senior notes due 2016 (2016

    Notes, Original

Senior Notes) to finance the Siebel acquisition and for general
    corporate purposes. On June 16, 2006, we completed a
    registered exchange offer of the Original Senior Notes for
    registered senior notes with substantially identical terms to
    the Original Senior Notes.

In May 2007 we redeemed the Original 2009 Notes for their
    principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our 2011
    Notes and 2016 Notes may also be redeemed at any time, subject
    to payment of a make-whole premium. The 2011 Notes and 2016
    Notes bear interest at the rate of 5.00% and 5.25% per year,
    respectively. Interest is payable semi-annually for the 2011
    notes and 2016 notes.

The effective interest yields of the New 2009 Notes, 2010 Notes,
    2011 Notes and 2016 Notes (collectively, the Senior Notes) at
    May 31, 2007 were 5.38%, 5.42%, 5.09% and 5.33%,
    respectively.

The Senior Notes rank pari passu with the Commercial Paper Notes
    and all existing and future senior indebtedness of Oracle
    Corporation.

We were in compliance with all debt-related covenants at
    May 31, 2007. Future principal payments of our borrowings
    at May 31, 2007 are as follows: $1.4 billion in fiscal
    2008, $1.0 billion in fiscal 2009, $1.0 billion in
    fiscal 2010, $2.25 billion in fiscal 2011 and
    $2.0 billion in fiscal 2016.

5-Year

Revolving Credit Agreement

In March 2006, we entered into a $3.0 billion,

5-Year

Revolving Credit Agreement with Wachovia Bank, National
    Association, Bank of America, N.A. and certain other lenders
    (Credit Agreement). The Credit Agreement provides for an
    unsecured revolving credit facility which can be used to
    backstop any commercial paper that we may issue (see above) and
    for working capital and other general corporate purposes.
    Subject to certain conditions stated in the Credit Agreement, we
    may borrow, prepay and re-borrow amounts under the facility at
    any time during the term of the Credit Agreement. Any amounts
    drawn pursuant to the Credit Agreement are due on March 14,
    2011 (none outstanding at May 31, 2007 and 2006). Interest
    is based on either (a) a LIBOR-based formula or (b) a
    formula based on Wachovia’s prime rate or on the federal
    funds effective rate.

The Credit Agreement also provides that (i) standby letters
    of credit may be issued on behalf of Oracle up to
    $500 million; and (ii) any amounts borrowed and
    letters of credit issued may be in Japanese Yen, Pounds Sterling
    and Euros up to $1.5 billion. We may also, upon the consent
    of either then existing lenders or of additional banks not
    currently party to the agreement, increase the commitments under
    this facility up to $5.0 billion. The agreement contains
    certain customary representations and warranties, covenants and
    events of default, including the requirement that the total net
    debt to total capitalization ratio of Oracle not exceed 45%. We
    have not borrowed any funds under the Credit Agreement.

$150
    Million Senior Notes

We had $150 million in 6.91% senior notes that were
    due in February 2007 and also had an interest-rate swap
    agreement that had the economic effect of modifying the interest
    obligations associated with these senior notes so that the
    interest payable on the senior notes effectively became variable
    based on the three-month LIBOR set quarterly until maturity.
    Both the senior notes and interest-rate swap agreement were
    settled and neither is outstanding as of May 31, 2007.

Deferred software license updates and product support revenues
    represent customer payments made in advance for annual support
    contracts. Software license updates and product support are
    typically billed on a per annum basis in advance and revenue is
    recognized ratably over the support period. The deferred
    software license updates and product support revenues are
    typically highest at the end of our first fiscal quarter due to
    the collection of cash from the large volume of service
    contracts that are sold or renewed in the fiscal quarter ending
    in May of each year due to the peak in sales surrounding our
    fiscal year-end. Deferred service revenues include prepayments
    for consulting, On Demand and education services. Revenue for
    these services is recognized as the services are performed.
    Deferred new software license revenues typically result from
    undelivered products or specified enhancements, customer
    specific acceptance provisions or software license transactions
    that cannot be segmented from consulting services. Deferred
    revenues, non-current are comprised primarily of deferred
    software license updates and product support revenues to be
    delivered beyond the next 12 months.

In connection with purchase price allocations related to our
    acquisitions in fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, we
    have estimated the fair values of the support obligations
    assumed. The estimated fair values of the support obligations
    assumed were determined using a cost-build up approach. The
    cost-build up approach determines fair value by estimating the
    costs relating to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal
    profit margin. The sum of the costs and operating profit
    approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to
    pay a third party to assume the support obligations. Over the
    past three fiscal years, we recorded adjustments that have, or
    will result in reduction in deferred software license updates
    and product support revenues recorded on the books of the
    entities we acquired of $1.0 billion. This amount
    represents fair value adjustments relating to future support
    obligations. These fair value adjustments reduce the revenues
    recognized over the support contract term of our acquired
    contracts and, as a result, we did not recognize software
    license updates and product support revenues related to support

STOCK-BASED
    COMPENSATION PLANS

Adoption
    of Statement 123R

On June 1, 2006, we adopted FASB Statement No. 123R,

Share-Based Payment

, under the modified prospective
    method. Statement 123R generally requires share-based payments
    to employees, including grants of employee stock options and
    purchases under employee stock purchase plans, to be recognized
    in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair
    values. Under the modified prospective method, prior period
    financial statements are not restated.

Prior to June 1, 2006, we accounted for our stock-based
    compensation plans under the intrinsic value method of
    accounting as defined by Accounting Principles Board Opinion
    No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

and
    applied the disclosure provisions of FASB Statement
    No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

, as



ORACLE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS—(Continued)

May 31, 2007

amended. Under Opinion 25, we generally did not recognize any
    compensation expense for stock options granted to employees or
    outside directors as the exercise price of our options was
    equivalent to the market price of our common stock on the date
    of grant. However, we recorded stock-based compensation for the
    intrinsic value associated with unvested options assumed in
    connection with acquisitions. For pro forma disclosures of
    stock-based compensation prior to June 1, 2006, the
    estimated fair values for options granted and options assumed
    were amortized using the accelerated expense attribution method.
    In addition, we reduced pro forma stock-based compensation
    expense for actual forfeitures in the periods they occurred.

In accordance with Statement 123R, we recognize stock-based
    compensation for grants issued or assumed after June 1,
    2006 for awards that we expect to vest on a straight-line basis
    over the service period of the award, which is generally four
    years. In determining whether an award is expected to vest, we
    use an estimated, forward-looking forfeiture rate based upon our
    historical forfeiture rates. Stock-based compensation expense
    recorded using an estimated forfeiture rate is updated for
    actual forfeitures quarterly. We also consider whether there
    have been any significant changes in facts and circumstances
    that would affect our forfeiture rate quarterly. The effect of
    forfeiture adjustments based on actual results was nominal for
    fiscal 2007. The fair value of the unvested portion of awards
    granted prior to June 1, 2006 will continue to be
    recognized over the remaining service period using the
    accelerated expense attribution method, net of estimated
    forfeitures.

Stock-based compensation recognized in our consolidated
    statements of operations is as follows:

If we had continued to account for stock-based compensation in
    accordance with Opinion 25 for fiscal 2007, income before
    provision for income taxes would have been $161 million
    higher and net income would have been $109 million higher,
    respectively, than the amounts we recognized in accordance with
    Statement 123R. Basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal
    2007 would have been $0.02 higher if we had continued to account
    for stock-based compensation under Opinion 25.

Stock
    Option Plans

In fiscal 2001, we adopted the 2000 Long-Term Equity Incentive
    Plan (the 2000 Plan), which replaced the 1991 Long-Term Equity
    Incentive Plan (the 1991 Plan) and provides for the issuance of
    non-qualified stock options and incentive stock options, as well
    as stock purchase rights, stock appreciation rights and
    long-term performance awards to our eligible employees,
    officers, directors who are also employees or consultants,
    independent consultants and advisers. In fiscal 2005, the 2000
    Plan was amended and restated to, among other things, eliminate
    the ability to reprice options without stockholder approval, to
    provide the Board of Directors (Board) with the ability to grant
    restricted stock awards, to permit us to grant performance-based
    equity awards for eligible tax deductibility, to provide the
    Board with the ability to issue transferable equity awards and
    to eliminate the ability to buyout employees’ options with
    cash or common stock. Under the terms of the 2000 Plan, options
    to purchase common stock generally are granted at not less than
    fair market value, become exercisable as established by the
    Board (generally over four years under our current practice),
    and generally expire no more than ten years from the date of
    grant. Options granted under the 1991 Plan were granted on
    similar terms. If options outstanding under the 1991 Plan are
    forfeited, repurchased, or otherwise terminate without the
    issuance of stock, the shares underlying such options will also
    become available for future awards under the 2000 Plan. As of
    May 31, 2007, options to purchase 353 million shares
    of common stock were outstanding under both plans, of which
    229 million were vested. Approximately 346 million
    shares of common stock are available for future awards under the
    2000 Plan. To date, we have not issued any stock purchase
    rights, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards or
    long-term performance awards under this plan.

In fiscal 1993, the Board adopted the 1993 Directors’
    Stock Option Plan (the Original Directors’ Plan), which
    provided for the issuance of non-qualified stock options to
    non-employee directors. In fiscal 2004, the Original
    Directors’ Plan was amended and restated to eliminate a
    term limit on the plan, eliminate the ability to reprice options
    without stockholder approval, decrease the number of shares of
    common stock reserved for issuance under the Original
    Directors’ Plan, provide the Board with the ability to make
    grants of restricted stock, restricted stock units or other
    stock-based awards instead of the automatic option grants and
    rename the Original Directors’ Plan, the
    1993 Directors’ Stock Plan. In fiscal 2007, the
    Original Directors’ Plan was further amended to, among
    other things, increase the amounts of the annual stock option
    grants to directors, permit pro rata option grants to chairs of
    Board of Directors’ committees and to provide that the
    Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee may, in the
    future, change the option grant policy for non-employee
    directors (the Directors’ Plan) Under the terms of the
    Directors’ Plan, options to purchase 8 million shares
    of common stock were reserved for issuance, options are



ORACLE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS—(Continued)

May 31, 2007

granted at not less than fair market value, become exercisable
    over four years, and expire no more than ten years from the date
    of grant. The Directors’ Plan provides for automatic grants
    of options to each non-employee director upon first becoming a
    director and thereafter on an annual basis, as well as automatic
    nondiscretionary grants for chairing certain Board committees.
    The Board has the discretion to replace any automatic option
    grant under the Directors’ Plan with awards of restricted
    stock, restricted stock units or other stock-based awards. The
    number of shares subject to any such stock award will be no more
    than the equivalent value of the options, as determined on any
    reasonable basis by the Board, which would otherwise have been
    granted under the applicable automatic option grant. The Board
    will determine the particular terms of any such stock awards at
    the time of grant, but the terms will be consistent with those
    of options, as described below, granted under the
    Directors’ Plan with respect to vesting or forfeiture
    schedules and treatment on termination of status as a director.
    At May 31, 2007, options to purchase approximately
    3 million shares of common stock were outstanding under the
    1993 Directors’ Plan, of which less than
    3 million were vested. Approximately 3 million shares
    are available for future option awards under this plan; however,
    no more than 2 million shares may be used for grants other
    than options.

In connection with certain of our acquisitions, principally
    PeopleSoft, Siebel and Hyperion, we assumed all of the
    outstanding stock options and restricted stock of the
    acquiree’s respective stock plans. These stock options and
    restricted stock generally retain all of the rights, terms and
    conditions of the respective plans under which options were
    originally granted. As of May 31, 2007, options to purchase
    78 million shares of common stock and 2 million shares
    of restricted stock were outstanding under these plans.

The range of exercise prices for options outstanding at

    prices for options is due to the fluctuating price of our stock
    over the period of the grants and from the conversion of options
    assumed from acquisitions.

    of $19.38 and the exercise prices for all in-the-money options

The unrecognized compensation expense calculated under the fair
    value method for shares expected to vest (unvested shares net of
    expected forfeitures) as of May 31, 2007 was approximately
    $356 million and is expected to be recognized over a
    weighted average period of 1.3 years. Approximately
    22 million shares outstanding as of May 31, 2007 are
    not expected to vest.

Valuation
    of Options Granted

We estimate the fair value of our options using the
    Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, which was developed
    for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have
    no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. Option
    valuation models require the input of assumptions, including
    stock price volatility. Changes in the input assumptions can
    materially affect the fair value estimates. The fair value of
    employee and director stock options granted, including options
    assumed from acquisitions, were estimated at the date of grant
    (or date of acquisition for acquired options assumed). The
    weighted average assumptions used were as follows:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

May 31, 2007

Excluding assumed options from the acquisitions, the weighted
    average fair value of grants was $4.92, $4.03 and $3.46 for
    fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The expected life is
    based on historical exercise patterns and post-vesting
    termination behavior, the risk-free interest rate is based on
    United States Treasury instruments and volatility is calculated
    based on the implied volatility of our longest-term, traded
    options. We do not currently pay cash dividends on our common
    stock and do not anticipate doing so for the foreseeable future.
    Accordingly, our expected dividend yield is zero.

Tax
    Benefits from Option Exercises

We settle employee stock option exercises primarily with newly
    issued common shares and may, on occasion, settle employee stock
    option exercises with our treasury shares. Total cash received
    as a result of option exercises was approximately
    $873 million, $573 million and $468 million for
    fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively. The
    aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised was
    $986 million, $594 million and $511 million, for
    fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively. In
    connection with these exercises, the tax benefits realized by us
    were $338 million, $169 million and $170 million
    for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The adoption of
    Statement 123R required us to change our cash flow
    classification of certain tax benefits received from stock
    option exercises beginning June 1, 2006. Of the total tax
    benefits received, we classified excess tax benefits from
    stock-based compensation of $259 million as cash flows from
    financing activities rather than cash flows from operating
    activities for fiscal 2007. To calculate the excess tax benefits
    available for use in offsetting future tax shortfalls as of our
    Statement 123R adoption date, which also affects the excess tax
    benefits from stock-based compensation that we reclassify as
    cash flows from financing activities, we adopted the alternative
    transition method as prescribed under FASB Staff Position

FAS 123R-3,

.

Stock
    Purchase Plan

We have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (Purchase Plan). To
    date, 409 million shares of common stock have been reserved
    for issuance under the Purchase Plan. Prior to the April 1,
    2005 semi-annual option period, under the Purchase Plan
    employees could purchase shares of common stock at a price per
    share that is 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of
    Oracle stock as of the beginning or the end of the semi-annual
    option period. Starting with the April 1, 2005 semi-annual
    option period, we amended the Purchase Plan such that employees
    can purchase shares of common stock at a price per share that is
    95% of the fair value of Oracle stock as of the end of the
    semi-annual option period. Through May 31, 2007,
    325 million shares had been issued and 84 million
    shares were reserved for future issuances under the Purchase
    Plan. During fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, we issued
    3 million, 6 million and 17 million shares,
    respectively, under the Purchase Plan.

STOCKHOLDERS’
    EQUITY

Stock
    Repurchases

Our Board of Directors has approved a program to repurchase
    shares of our common stock to reduce the dilutive effect of our
    stock option and stock purchase plans. From the inception of the
    stock repurchase program in 1992 to May 31, 2007, a total
    of 2.0 billion shares have been repurchased for
    approximately $24.7 billion. We repurchased
    234 million shares for $4.0 billion, 147 million
    shares for $2.0 billion and 115 million shares for
    $1.3 billion in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
    In April 2007, our Board expanded our repurchase program by
    $4.0 billion and, as of May 31, 2007, approximately
    $4.2 billion was available to repurchase shares of our
    common stock pursuant to the stock repurchase program.

Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration
    date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on
    factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements
    for acquisitions, our debt repayment obligations (as described
    above), our stock price, and economic and market conditions. Our
    stock repurchases may



ORACLE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS—(Continued)

be effected from time to time through open market purchases or
    pursuant to a

Rule 10b5-1

plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated,
    suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.

Rights
    Agreement

In connection with the Reorganization, on January 31, 2006
    our Board of Directors distributed preferred stock purchase
    rights as a dividend at the rate of one right for each share of
    our common stock held by stockholders of record as of
    January 31, 2006 pursuant to a preferred shares rights
    agreement dated January 31, 2006 (Rights Agreement), which
    was based on the preferred shares rights agreement of Old Oracle
    prior to the Reorganization. The Board of Directors also
    authorized the issuance of a right for each share of common
    stock issued after the record date, until the occurrence of
    certain specified events. The Rights Agreement was adopted to
    provide protection to stockholders in the event of an
    unsolicited attempt to acquire us.

Each right is initially exercisable for one-six thousand seven
    hundred fiftieth of a share of our Series A Junior
    Participating Preferred Stock at a price of $125 per one-six
    thousand seven hundred fiftieth of a share, subject to
    adjustment. The rights are not exercisable until the earlier of:
    (1) ten days (or such later date as may be determined by
    the Board of Directors) following an announcement that a person
    or group has acquired beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our
    common stock or (2) ten days (or such later date as may be
    determined by the Board of Directors) following the commencement
    of a tender offer which, if successfully consummated, would
    result in a person or group obtaining beneficial ownership of
    15% or more of our outstanding common stock, subject in each
    case to certain exceptions (the earlier of such dates being
    called the distribution date). After the distribution date,
    holders of rights (other than the 15% or greater holder) will be
    entitled to receive upon exercise of the right and payment of
    exercise price, shares of our common stock (or, in certain types
    of transactions, common stock of the acquirer) having a market
    value of two times the exercise price of the right.
    Alternatively, we may require the exchange of rights, at a rate
    of one share of common stock for each right, without payment of
    exercise price, under certain circumstances.

We are entitled to redeem the rights, for $0.00148 per right, at
    the discretion of the Board of Directors, until certain
    specified times. The Board of Directors also has the ability to
    amend the Rights Agreement without approval of the holders of
    the rights, subject to certain limitations. Unless earlier
    redeemed or exchanged, the rights will expire at the close of
    business on March 31, 2008.

We provide for United States income taxes on the earnings of
    foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered indefinitely
    reinvested outside the United States. At May 31, 2007, the
    amount of temporary differences related to investments in
    foreign subsidiaries upon which United States income taxes have
    not been provided was approximately $5.7 billion. If these
    amounts were repatriated in the United States, they would
    generate foreign tax credits that would reduce the federal tax
    liability associated with the foreign dividend. Assuming a full
    utilization of the foreign tax credits, the potential deferred
    tax liability associated with these temporary differences would
    be approximately $1.4 billion. In fiscal 2005, we
    repatriated $3.1 billion of the earnings of foreign
    subsidiaries in accordance with the American Jobs Creation Act
    of 2004 and recorded a federal tax expense of $118 million
    and a state tax expense (net of federal tax benefit) of
    $3 million. We repatriated the maximum amount available for
    repatriation under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.

The Internal Revenue Service has examined our federal income tax
    returns for all years through 1999 without any material
    adjustment of taxes due. The IRS is currently examining our
    federal income tax returns for 2000 through 2003. In addition,
    the Internal Revenue Service is examining taxable years after
    2000 for various acquired entities. We do not believe that the
    outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on
    our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We
    are also under examination by numerous state and non-US tax
    authorities. We believe that we have adequately provided for any
    reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these audits. However,
    there can be no assurances as to possible outcomes.

The valuation allowance was $166 million at May 31,
    2007 and $189 million at May 31, 2006. The net
    decrease is primarily attributable to the release of valuation
    allowance of acquired deferred tax assets, principally federal
    net operating loss carryforwards. Substantially all of the
    valuation allowance relates to tax assets established in
    purchase accounting. Any subsequent reduction of that portion of
    the valuation allowance and the recognition of the associated
    tax benefits will be applied to reduce goodwill and then to
    intangible assets established pursuant to the related
    acquisition.

At May 31, 2007, we had federal net operating loss
    carryforwards of approximately $1.7 billion. These losses
    expire in various years between fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2027, and
    are subject to limitations on their utilization. We have state
    net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
    $1.9 billion, which expire between fiscal 2008 and fiscal
    2027, and are subject to limitations on their utilization. We
    have tax credit carryforwards of approximately
    $209 million, which are subject to limitations on their
    utilization. Approximately $72 million of these tax credit
    carryforwards are not currently subject to expiration dates. The
    remainder, approximately $137 million, expire in various
    years between fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2026.

Our intercompany transfer pricing is currently being reviewed by
    the IRS and by foreign tax jurisdictions and will likely be
    subject to additional audits in the future. We previously
    negotiated three unilateral Advance Pricing Agreements with the
    IRS that cover many of our intercompany transfer pricing issues
    and preclude the IRS from making a transfer pricing adjustment
    within the scope of these agreements. However, these agreements,
    which are effective for fiscal years through May 31, 2006,
    do not cover all elements of our intercompany transfer pricing
    issues and do not bind tax authorities outside the United
    States. We are currently determining whether to structure
    additional agreements that cover periods beyond May 2006. There
    can be no guarantee in any event that any negotiations will
    result in an agreement.

EARNINGS
    PER SHARE

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income for
    the period by the weighted-average number of common shares
    outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is
    computed by dividing net income for the period by the
    weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the
    period, plus the dilutive effect of outstanding stock awards and
    shares issuable under the employee stock purchase plan using the
    treasury stock method. The following table sets forth the
    computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:

CASH,
    CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES

Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid
    investments in time deposits held at major banks, commercial
    paper, United States government agency discount notes, money
    market mutual funds and other money market securities with
    original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable
    securities primarily consist of commercial paper, corporate
    notes and Unites States government agency notes.

In accordance with Statement 115 and based on our intentions
    regarding these instruments, we had historically classified
    certain of our debt securities as held-to-maturity (accounting
    for these marketable securities at amortized cost) and certain
    of our other investments in debt securities as
    available-for-sale (accounting for these marketable securities
    at market value). In fiscal 2007, we classified substantially
    all newly purchased investments as available-for-sale.

The amortized principal amount of cash and cash equivalents at
    May 31, 2007 and 2006 was $6.2 billion and
    $6.7 billion, respectively, which approximated fair value,
    and the weighted-average interest rates were 4.08% for both
    fiscal 2007 and 2006. We use the specific identification method
    to determine any realized gains or losses from the sale of our
    marketable securities classified as available-for-sale. Such
    realized gains and losses were insignificant for fiscal 2007,
    fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005. The following table summarizes the
    components of our marketable securities:

The amortized cost of our marketable securities approximated

Our investment portfolio is subject to market risk due to
    changes in interest rates. We place our investments with high
    credit quality issuers and, by policy, limit the amount of
    credit exposure to any one issuer. As stated in our investment
    policy, we are averse to principal loss and seek to preserve our
    invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk and
    reinvestment risk.

DERIVATIVE
    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

FASB Statement No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended

, establishes
    accounting and reporting standards requiring that every
    derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either
    an asset or liability measured at its fair value. Statement 133
    also requires that changes in the derivative’s fair value
    be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge
    accounting criteria are met and that a company must formally
    document, designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions
    that receive hedge accounting. We use derivatives to manage
    foreign currency and interest rate risk.

Net
    Investment Hedges

Periodically, we hedge the net assets of certain international
    subsidiaries (net investment hedges) using foreign currency
    forward contracts to offset the translation and economic
    exposures related to our investments in these subsidiaries. We
    measure the effectiveness of net investment hedges by using the
    changes in spot exchange rates



ORACLE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS—(Continued)

May 31, 2007

because this method reflects our risk management strategies, the
    economics of those strategies in our financial statements and
    better manages interest rate differentials between different
    countries. Under this method, the change in fair value of the
    forward contract attributable to the changes in spot exchange
    rates (the effective portion) is reported in stockholders’
    equity to offset the translation results on the net investments.
    The remaining change in fair value of the forward contract (the
    ineffective portion) is recognized in non-operating income, net.

Net gains (losses) on investment hedges reported in
    stockholders’ equity prior to tax effects were
    $45 million, $23 million and $(23) million in
    fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The net gain on
    investment hedges reported in non-operating income, net were
    $28 million, $24 million and $14 million in
    fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

At May 31, 2007, we had one net investment hedge in
    Japanese Yen. The Yen investment hedge minimizes currency risk
    arising from net assets held in Yen as a result of equity
    capital raised during the initial public offering and secondary
    offering of Oracle Japan. The fair value of our Yen investment
    hedge was $0.2 million as of both May 31, 2007 and
    2006. As of May 31, 2007, the Yen investment hedge has a
    notional amount of $548 million and an exchange rate of
    120.22 Yen for each United States dollar.

Foreign
    Currency Forward Contracts

We transact business in various foreign currencies and have
    established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency
    forward contracts to offset the risk associated with the effects
    of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program,
    increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are
    offset by gains or losses on the forward contracts, to mitigate
    the possibility of foreign currency transaction gains or losses.
    These foreign currency exposures typically arise from
    intercompany sublicense fees and other intercompany
    transactions. Our forward contracts generally have terms of
    90 days or less. We do not use forward contracts for
    trading purposes. All outstanding foreign currency forward
    contracts used in this program are marked to market at the end
    of the period with unrealized gains and losses included in
    non-operating income, net. Our ultimate realized gain or loss
    with respect to currency fluctuations depends upon the currency
    exchange rates and other factors in effect as the contracts
    mature. Net foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) included
    in non-operating income, net in the accompanying consolidated
    statements of operations were $17 million, $15 million
    and $(28) million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. The unrealized gains (losses) of our outstanding
    foreign currency forward contracts were $5 million and
    $(0.3) million at May 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

SEGMENT
    INFORMATION

FASB Statement No. 131,

Disclosures about Segments of an
    Enterprise and Related Information

, establishes standards
    for reporting information about operating segments. Operating
    segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which
    separate financial information is available that is evaluated
    regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision
    making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in
    assessing performance. Our chief operating decision maker is our
    Chief Executive Officer. We are organized geographically and by
    line of business. While our Chief Executive Officer evaluates
    results in a number of different ways, the line of business
    management structure is the primary basis for which the
    allocation of resources and financial results are assessed. We
    have two businesses, software and services, which are further
    divided into five operating segments. Our software business is
    comprised of two operating segments: (1) new software
    licenses and (2) software license updates and product
    support. Our services business is comprised of three operating
    segments: (1) consulting, (2) On Demand and
    (3) education.

The new software license line of business is engaged in the
    licensing of database and middleware software as well as
    applications software. Database and middleware software includes
    database management software, application server software,
    identification management and access, analytics, development
    tools and collaboration software. Applications software provides
    enterprise information that enables companies to manage their
    business cycles and provide intelligence in functional areas
    such as financials, human resources, maintenance management,
    manufacturing, marketing, order fulfillment, product lifecycle
    management, procurement, projects, sales, services, enterprise
    resource planning and supply chain planning. The software
    license updates and product support line of business provides
    customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades
    and maintenance releases, internet access to technical content,
    as well as internet and telephone access to technical support
    personnel during the support period. The software license
    updates and product support line of business also offers
    customers Oracle Unbreakable Linux Support, which provides
    enterprise level support for the Linux operating system.

The consulting line of business provides services to customers
    in business strategy and analysis, business process
    optimization, and the implementation, deployment and upgrade of
    our database, middleware and applications software. On Demand
    includes Oracle On Demand, CRM On Demand and Advanced Customer
    Services. Oracle On Demand provides multi-featured software and
    hardware management and maintenance services for customers that
    deploy our database, middleware and applications software at
    Oracle’s data center facilities or at a site of our
    customer’s choosing. CRM On Demand is a service offering
    that provides our customers with our Siebel CRM Software
    functionality delivered via a hosted solution that we manage.
    Advanced Customer Services consists of solution support centers,
    business critical assistance, technical account management,
    expert services, configuration and performance analysis,
    personalized support and annual

on-site

technical services. The education line of business provides
    instructor led, media based and internet based training in the
    use of our database, middleware and applications software.

We do not track our assets by operating
    segments. Consequently, it is not practical to show assets
    by operating segments.

Operating segment revenues differ from the external reporting
    classifications due to certain software license products that
    are classified as service revenues for management reporting
    purposes. Additionally, software license updates and product
    support revenues for management reporting include
    $212 million, $391 million and $320 million of
    revenues that we did not recognize in the accompanying
    consolidated statements of operations for the years ended
    May 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. See Note 6
    for an explanation of these adjustments and the following table
    for a reconciliation of operating segment revenues to total
    revenues.

The margins reported reflect only the direct controllable costs
    and expenses of each line of business and do not represent the
    actual margins for each operating segment because they do not
    contain an allocation of product development, information
    technology, marketing and partner programs, and corporate and
    general and administrative expenses incurred in support of the
    lines of business. Additionally, the margins do not reflect the
    amortization of intangible assets, restructuring costs,
    acquisition related costs or stock-based compensation.

PEOPLESOFT
    CUSTOMER ASSURANCE PROGRAM

In June 2003, in response to our tender offer, PeopleSoft
    implemented what it referred to as the “customer assurance
    program” or “CAP.” The CAP incorporated a
    provision in PeopleSoft’s standard licensing arrangement
    that purports to contractually burden Oracle, as a result of our
    acquisition of PeopleSoft, with a contingent obligation to make
    payments to PeopleSoft customers should we fail to take certain
    business actions for a fixed period. The payment obligation,
    which typically expires four years from the date of the
    contract, is fixed at an amount generally between two and five
    times the license and first year support fees paid to PeopleSoft
    in the applicable license transaction. PeopleSoft customers
    retain rights to the licensed products whether or not the CAP
    payments are triggered.

The maximum potential penalty under the CAP, by version, as of
    May 31, 2007 was as follows:

Some contracts originally submitted to customers prior to these
    end dates were executed following such dates. The majority of
    the CAP provisions will expire no later than four years after
    the contract date.

This purported obligation was not reflected as a liability on
    PeopleSoft’s balance sheet as PeopleSoft concluded that it
    could be triggered only following the consummation of an
    acquisition. We have concluded that, as of the date of the
    acquisition, the penalty provisions under the CAP represented a
    contingent liability of Oracle. The aggregate potential CAP
    obligation as of May 31, 2007 was $3.2 billion. Unless
    the CAP provisions are removed from these licensing
    arrangements, we do not expect the aggregate potential CAP
    obligation to decline substantially until fiscal year 2008 when
    these provisions begin to expire. We have not recorded a
    liability related to the CAP, as we do not believe it is
    probable that our post-acquisition activities related to the
    PeopleSoft and JD Edwards product lines will trigger an
    obligation to make any payment pursuant to the CAP. While no
    assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome of litigation,
    we believe we would also have substantial defenses with respect
    to the legality and enforceability of the CAP contract
    provisions in response to any claims seeking payment from us
    under the CAP terms.

GUARANTEES

Our software license agreements generally include certain
    provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if our
    software products infringe a third party’s intellectual
    property rights. To date, we have not incurred any material
    costs as a result of such indemnifications and have not accrued
    any liabilities related to such obligations in our consolidated
    financial statements. Certain of our software license agreements
    also include provisions indemnifying customers against
    liabilities in the event we breach confidentiality or service
    level requirements. It is not possible to determine the maximum
    potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to
    our limited



ORACLE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS—(Continued)

May 31, 2007

and infrequent history of prior indemnification claims and the
    unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular
    agreement. Historically, payments made by us under these
    agreements have not had a material effect on our results of
    operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Our software license agreements also generally include a
    warranty that our software products will substantially operate
    as described in the applicable program documentation for a
    period of one year after delivery. We also warrant that services
    we perform will be provided in a manner consistent with industry
    standards for a period of 90 days from performance of the
    service. Warranty expense was not significant in fiscal 2007,
    fiscal 2006 or fiscal 2005.

We occasionally are required, for various reasons, to enter into
    agreements with financial institutions that provide letters of
    credit on our behalf to parties we conduct business with in
    ordinary course. Such agreements have not had a material effect
    on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

COMMITMENTS

Lease
    Commitments

We lease certain facilities and furniture and equipment under
    operating leases. As of May 31, 2007, future minimum annual
    operating lease payments and future minimum payments to be
    received from non-cancelable subleases were as follows:

Lease commitments include future minimum rent payments for
    facilities that we have vacated pursuant to our restructuring
    and merger integration activities, as discussed in Note 3.
    We have approximately $364 million in facility obligations,
    net of estimated sublease income and other costs, in accrued
    restructuring for these locations in our consolidated balance
    sheet at May 31, 2007.

Rent expense was $224 million, $175 million and
    $174 million for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively, net of sublease income of approximately
    $32 million, $23 million and $10 million,
    respectively. Certain lease agreements contain renewal options
    providing for an extension of the lease term.

Unconditional
    Purchase Obligations

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into certain
    unconditional purchase obligations with our suppliers, which are
    agreements that are enforceable, legally binding and specify
    certain minimum quantity and pricing terms. As of May 31,
    2007, our unconditional purchase obligations total
    $73 million for fiscal 2008, $196 million for fiscal
    2009, $3 million for fiscal 2010, $3 million for
    fiscal 2011, $3 million for fiscal 2012 and
    $14 million thereafter.



ORACLE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS—(Continued)

May 31, 2007

The aforementioned unconditional purchase obligations amounts
    include a property commitment entered into by one of our
    subsidiaries to purchase land and buildings for approximately
    $342 million, of which approximately $64 million was
    paid in fiscal 2007 and $66 million was paid in fiscal
    2006. The remaining commitments for the property will be paid in
    fiscal 2009.

19.

BENEFIT
    PLANS

We offer various defined contribution plans for our
    U.S. and

non-U.S. employees.

Total defined contribution plan expense was $198 million,
    $170 million and $147 million for fiscal years 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. In fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006 and
    2005, we increased the number of plan participants in our
    defined contribution plans primarily as a result of additional
    employees from our acquisitions.

In the United States, regular employees can participate in the
    Oracle Corporation 401(k) Savings and Investment Plan (Oracle
    401(k) Plan). Participants can generally contribute up to 40% of
    their eligible compensation on a per-pay-period basis as defined
    by the plan document or by the section 402(g) limit as
    defined by the Internal Revenue Service. We match a portion of
    employee contributions, currently 50% up to 6% of compensation
    each pay period, subject to maximum aggregate matching amounts.
    Our contributions to the plan, net of forfeitures, were
    $67 million, $58 million and $46 million in
    fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

We also offer non-qualified deferred compensation plans to
    certain key employees whereby they may defer a portion of their
    annual base

and/or

variable compensation until retirement or a date specified by
    the employee in accordance with the plans. Deferred compensation
    plan assets and liabilities were approximately $195 million
    and $165 million as of May 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively, and are presented in other assets and other
    long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance
    sheets.

In September 2006, FASB Statement No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements
    No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)

was issued. Statement 158
    requires plan sponsors of defined benefit pension and other
    postretirement benefit plans (Plans) to recognize the funded
    status of their Plans in the balance sheet, measure the fair
    value of plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of
    the balance sheet and provide additional disclosures.

We are the sponsor of a defined benefit pension plan covering
    certain employees in the United Kingdom and, on May 31,
    2007 we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of
    Statement 158. Statement 158 required us to recognize the funded
    status (i.e., the difference between the fair value of plan
    assets and the projected benefit obligations) of our pension
    plan in the May 31, 2007 balance sheet, with a
    corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive
    income, net of tax. The net of tax impact on accumulated other
    comprehensive income of adopting Statement 158 was
    $29 million at May 31, 2007.

20.

RELATED
    PARTIES

We have entered into transactions with 11 companies over
    the last three fiscal years in which our Chief Executive
    Officer, directly or indirectly, has a controlling interest.
    These companies purchased software and services for
    $2.3 million, $4.7 million and $4.1 million
    during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In addition, we
    purchased goods and services from five of these companies for
    $1.8 million, $1.0 million and $0.8 million in
    fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

In connection with our acquisition of PeopleSoft, we assumed a
    sublease with a company in which our Chief Executive Officer
    holds a controlling interest and we received payments of
    $0.1 million and $0.2 million during fiscal 2006 and
    2005, respectively. The sublease was terminated in the first
    quarter of fiscal 2006 when this company entered into a direct
    lease with the landlord.

In fiscal 2006 and 2005, we received $0.1 million and
    $0.6 million, respectively, for purchases of software and
    services from two companies affiliated with two other members of
    our Board of Directors who are, or were,



ORACLE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS—(Continued)

May 31, 2007

executive officers of such companies. A member of our Board of
    Directors was previously an executive officer of one such
    company until July 2005. Transactions with this company from
    June 2005 to the date of this Board member’s departure in
    July 2005 have been included in the preceding disclosure. Our
    fiscal 2007 transactions were not significant.

21.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

Securities
    Class Action

Stockholder class actions were filed in the United States
    District Court for the Northern District of California against
    us and our Chief Executive Officer on and after March 9,
    2001. Between March 2002 and March 2003, the court dismissed
    plaintiffs’ consolidated complaint, first amended complaint
    and a revised second amended complaint. The last dismissal was
    with prejudice. On September 1, 2004, the United States
    Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the dismissal
    order and remanded the case for further proceedings. The revised
    second amended complaint named our Chief Executive Officer, our
    then Chief Financial Officer (who currently is Chairman of our
    Board of Directors) and a former Executive Vice President as
    defendants. This complaint was brought on behalf of purchasers
    of our stock during the period from December 14, 2000
    through March 1, 2001. Plaintiffs alleged that the
    defendants made false and misleading statements about our actual
    and expected financial performance and the performance of
    certain of our applications products, while certain individual
    defendants were selling Oracle stock in violation of federal
    securities laws. Plaintiffs further alleged that certain
    individual defendants sold Oracle stock while in possession of
    material non-public information. Plaintiffs also allege that the
    defendants engaged in accounting violations. Currently, the
    parties are conducting discovery. The court has set a trial date
    of November 26, 2007. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages plus
    interest, attorneys’ fees and costs, and equitable and
    injunctive relief. We believe that we have meritorious defenses
    against this action, and we will continue to vigorously
    defend it.

Siebel
    Securities Class Action

On March 10, 2004, William Wollrab, on behalf of himself
    and purportedly on behalf of a class of stockholders of Siebel,
    filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the
    Northern District of California against Siebel and certain of
    its officers relating to predicted adoption rates of Siebel v7.0
    and certain customer satisfaction surveys. This complaint was
    consolidated and amended on August 27, 2004, with the
    Policemen’s Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago being
    appointed to serve as lead plaintiff. The consolidated complaint
    also raised claims regarding Siebel’s business performance
    in 2002. In October 2004, Siebel filed a motion to dismiss,
    which was granted on January 28, 2005 with leave to amend.
    Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on March 1, 2005.
    Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages plus interest,
    attorneys’ fees and costs, and equitable and injunctive
    relief. Siebel filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint
    on April 27, 2005, and on December 28, 2005, the Court
    dismissed the case with prejudice. On January 17, 2006,
    plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal, and on September 18,
    2006, plaintiffs filed their opening appellate brief.
    Defendants’ responsive brief was filed on December 15,
    2006. Plaintiffs filed their reply brief on January 16,
    2007. The court has not yet set a date for oral argument on this
    appeal. We believe that we have meritorious defenses against
    this action, and we will continue to vigorously defend it.

Intellectual
    Property Litigation

Mangosoft, Inc. and Mangosoft Corporation filed a patent
    infringement action against us in the United States District
    Court for the District of New Hampshire on November 22,
    2002. Plaintiffs alleged that we are willfully infringing
    U.S. Patent Nos. 6,148,377 (the ‘377 patent) and
    5,918,229 (the ‘229 patent), which they claim to own.
    Plaintiffs seek damages based on our license sales of the Real
    Application Clusters database option, the 9i and 10g databases,
    and the Application Server, and seek injunctive relief. We
    denied infringement and asserted affirmative defenses and
    counterclaimed against plaintiffs for declaratory judgment that
    the ‘377 and ‘229 patents are invalid, unenforceable
    and not infringed by us. On May 19, 2004, the court held a
    claims construction (Markman) hearing,



ORACLE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS—(Continued)

May 31, 2007

and on September 21, 2004, it issued a Markman order. On
    June 21, 2005, plaintiffs withdrew their allegations of
    infringement of the ‘229 patent. Discovery closed on
    July 1, 2005. Summary judgment motions were filed on
    August 25, 2005, and the court held a hearing on these
    motions on October 17, 2005. On March 14, 2006 the
    court ruled that Oracle’s Real Application Clusters
    database option did not infringe the ‘377 patent.

Oracle’s counterclaims against Mangosoft, alleging that the
    ‘377 patent is invalid and unenforceable, were the only
    claims that the Court left open for trial. On April 21,
    2006 Mangosoft filed a motion asking that Mangosoft be allowed
    to appeal the noninfringement ruling immediately to the Federal
    Circuit Court of Appeals and that trial on Oracle’s
    counterclaims be stayed until that appeal has been resolved.
    Oracle filed a brief opposing that motion on May 8, 2006.
    On March 28, 2007, the Court issued an order largely
    granting the relief sought by MangoSoft. The Court dismissed
    Oracle’s counterclaims of invalidity and inequitable
    conduct without prejudice and ordered the entry of judgment of
    noninfringement consistent with its March 14, 2006 order on
    summary judgment. On March 29, 2007, the Court entered
    Judgment in Oracle’s favor on the issue of noninfringement
    and, on the same day, MangoSoft filed its notice of appeal to
    the Federal Circuit stating that it was appealing (1) the
    Court’s March 14, 2006 order on summary judgment,
    (2) the Court’s order of March 28, 2007,
    (3) the Court’s claim construction order of
    September 21, 2004, and (4) the entry of judgment on
    March 29, 2007. Oracle has filed its statement of costs in
    the amount of approximately $0.2 million in connection with
    the entry of judgment. MangoSoft’s opening brief on appeal
    is due on August 6, 2007. Oracle’s responsive brief is
    due September 17, 2007, and MangoSoft’s reply is due
    on October 1, 2007. On May 21, 2007, the parties were
    notified that the matter was selected for inclusion in the
    Federal Circuit’s mandatory Appellate Mediation Program. A
    mediation was held on for June 20, 2007, but the matter was
    not resolved. Accordingly, the appeal will proceed on the
    schedule outlined above.

SAP
    Intellectual Property Litigation

On March 22, 2007, Oracle Corporation, Oracle USA, Inc. and
    Oracle International Corporation (collectively,
    “Oracle”) filed a complaint in the United States
    District Court for the Northern District of California against
    SAP AG, its wholly owned subsidiary, SAP America, Inc., and its
    wholly owned subsidiary, TomorrowNow, Inc., (collectively, the
    “SAP Defendants”) alleging violations of the Federal
    Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and the California Computer Data
    Access and Fraud Act, civil conspiracy, trespass, conversion,
    violation of the California Unfair Business Practices Act, and
    intentional and negligent interference with prospective economic
    advantage. Oracle alleged that SAP unlawfully accessed
    Oracle’s Customer Connection support website and improperly
    took and used Oracle’s intellectual property, including
    software code and knowledge management solutions. The complaint
    seeks unspecified damages and preliminary and permanent
    injunctive relief. On April 10, 2007, Oracle filed a
    stipulation extending the time for the SAP Defendants to respond
    to the complaint. On June 1, 2007, Oracle filed their First
    Amended Complaint, adding claims for infringement of the federal
    Copyright Act and breach of contract, and dropping the
    conversion and separately pled conspiracy claims. The SAP
    Defendants’ response is due July 2, 2007.

Other
    Litigation

We are party to various legal proceedings and claims, either
    asserted or unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course of
    business, including proceedings and claims that relate to
    acquisitions we have completed or to companies we have acquired
    or are attempting to acquire. While the outcome of these matters
    cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the
    outcome of any of these claims or any of the above mentioned
    legal matters will have a material adverse effect on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.
