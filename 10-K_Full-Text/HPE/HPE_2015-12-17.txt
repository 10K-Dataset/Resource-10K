PART I

ITEM 1. Business.

We are a leading global provider of the cutting-edge technology solutions customers need to optimize their traditional Information
Technology ("IT") while helping them build the secure, cloud-enabled, mobile-ready future that is uniquely suited to their needs. Our legacy dates
back to a partnership founded in 1939 by William R. Hewlett and David Packard, and we strive every day to uphold and enhance that legacy through our dedication to providing innovative technological
solutions to our customers.

On
November 1, 2015, HP Inc. (formerly known as "Hewlett-Packard Company" or "HP Co.") spun-off Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company ("we", "us", "our", "Hewlett
Packard Enterprise", "HPE", or "the Company"), pursuant to a separation agreement (the "Separation and Distribution Agreement"). To effect the spin-off, HP Inc. distributed all of the shares of
Hewlett Packard Enterprise common stock owned by HP Inc. to its shareholders on November 1, 2015. Holders of HP Inc. common stock received one share of Hewlett Packard Enterprise
stock for every share of HP Inc. stock held as of the record date. As a result of the spin-off, we now operate as an independent, publicly traded company.

We
believe that we offer the most comprehensive portfolio of enterprise solutions in the IT industry. With an industry-leading position in servers, storage, networking, converged
systems, software and services, combined with our customized financing solutions, we believe we are best equipped to deliver the right IT solutions to help drive optimal business outcomes for our
customers.

Our Business Segments, Products and Services

We organize our business into the following five segments:

•

Enterprise Group.

Our Enterprise Group ("EG") provides
our customers with the cutting-edge technology infrastructure they need to optimize traditional IT while building a secure, cloud-enabled and mobile-ready future.

•

Software.

Our Software allows our customers to automate
IT operations to simplify, accelerate and secure business processes and drives the analytics that turn raw data into actionable knowledge.

•

Enterprise Services.

Our Enterprise Services ("ES")
brings all of our solutions together through our consulting and support professionals to deliver superior, comprehensive results for our customers.

•

Financial Services.

Financial Services ("FS") enables
flexible IT consumption models, financial architectures and customized investment solutions for our customers.

•

Corporate Investments.

Corporate Investments includes
Hewlett Packard Labs and certain business incubation projects, among others.

A
summary of our net revenue, earnings from operations and assets for our segments can be found in Note 2, "Segment Information", to our Combined and Consolidated Financial
Statements. A discussion of certain factors potentially affecting our operations is set forth in "Risk Factors."

Enterprise Group

EG provides a broad portfolio of enterprise technology solutions to address customer needs in building the foundation for the next
generation of applications, web services and user experiences—which are only as rich, impactful and world-changing as the infrastructure platforms that they sit on. EG technology addresses

Our Strengths

We believe that we possess a number of competitive advantages that distinguish us from our competitors, including:

Broad and deep end-to-end solutions portfolio.

We combine our infrastructure, software and services capabilities to provide what we
believe is the
broadest and deepest portfolio of end-to-end enterprise solutions in the IT industry. Our ability to deliver a wide range of high-quality products and high-value consulting and support services in a
single package is one of our principal differentiators.

Multiyear innovation roadmap.

We have been in the technology and innovation business for over 75 years. Our vast intellectual
property
portfolio and global research and development capabilities are part of a broader innovation roadmap designed to help organizations of all sizes journey from traditional technology platforms to the IT
systems of the future—what we call the new style of IT—which we believe will be characterized by the increasing and interrelated prominence of cloud computing, big data,
enterprise security, applications and mobility.



Global distribution and partner ecosystem.

We are experts in delivering innovative technological solutions
to our customers in complex multi-country, multi-vendor and/or multi-language environments. We have one of the largest go-to-market capabilities in our industry, including a large ecosystem of channel
partners, which enables us to market and deliver our product offerings to customers located virtually anywhere in the world.

Custom financial solutions.

We have developed innovative financing solutions to facilitate the delivery of our products and services to
our
customers. We deliver flexible investment solutions and expertise that help customers and other partners create unique technology deployments based on specific business needs.

Experienced leadership team with track record of successful performance.

Our management team has an extensive track record of
performance and
execution. We are led by our Chief Executive Officer Margaret C. Whitman, who has proven experience in developing transformative business models, building global brands and driving sustained growth
and expansion in the technology industry, including from her leadership of HP Co. for four years prior to the separation and her previous ten years as Chief Executive Officer of
eBay Inc. Our senior management team has over 100 collective years of experience in our industry and possesses extensive knowledge of and experience in the enterprise IT business and the
markets in which we compete. Moreover, we have a deep bench of management and technology talent that we believe provides us with an unparalleled pipeline of future leaders and innovators.

Our Strategies

Disruptive change is all around us, and we are living in an idea economy where the ability to turn an idea into a new product or a new
industry is more accessible than ever. This environment requires a new style of business, underpinned by a new style of IT. Cloud, mobile, big data and analytics provide the tools enterprises need to
significantly reduce the time to market for any good idea. Hewlett Packard Enterprise's strategy is to enable customers to win in the idea economy by slashing the time it takes to turn an idea into
value.

We
make IT environments more efficient, more productive and more secure, enabling fast, flexible responses to a rapidly changing competitive landscape. We enable organizations to act
quickly on ideas by creating, consuming and reconfiguring new solutions, experiences and business models, and deliver infrastructure that is built from components that can be composed and recomposed
easily and quickly to meet the shifting demands of business applications.

Every
IT journey is unique, but every customer is looking to minimize the time between initial idea and realized value. While some customers are looking for solutions that let them take
the next step on this journey, the majority of customers are at the beginning of this journey and are looking for solutions that can help them take their first steps. Hewlett Packard Enterprise will
leverage our leadership position in our traditional markets to lead the transition to this new style of business.

Specifically,
we are focused on delivering solutions to help customers transform four critical areas that matter most to their business.

Transform to a hybrid infrastructure.

Infrastructure matters more than ever today, but customers need a new kind of infrastructure. We
help customers
build an on-demand infrastructure and operational foundation for all of the applications that power the enterprise. With our cloud expertise, combined with our portfolio of traditional IT
infrastructure and services, we are able to provide customized and seamless IT solutions for customers of all sizes and at all levels of technological sophistication. We are able to optimize our
customers' applications regardless of form—traditional, mobile, in the cloud or in the data center.



Protect the digital enterprise.

The threat landscape is wider and more diverse today than ever before. We offer complete risk
management solutions,
ranging from protection against security threats to data back-up and recovery, that help our customers protect themselves and their data in an increasingly volatile cybersecurity landscape. Our
products and services are informed by our decades of IT security experience and enable customers to predict and disrupt threats, manage risk and compliance, and extend their internal security team.

Empower the data-driven organization.

We provide open-source solutions that allow customers to use 100% of their data, including
business data, human
data and machine data, to generate real-time, actionable insights. The result is better and faster decision making.

Enable workplace productivity.

We help customers deliver rich digital and mobile experiences to their
customers, employees and partners. We offer an end-to-end mobility portfolio, from cloud infrastructure to customer-facing applications. Our infrastructure offerings leverage our cloud and security
expertise to provide the backbone for secure mobile networks. Our integrated software offerings leverage our application expertise to provide intuitive interfaces for end-users. We also leverage our
big data expertise to enable our customers to gain insight into the mobile user experience by monitoring and analyzing customer experience analytics.

Sales, Marketing and Distribution

We manage our business and report our financial results based on the segments described above. Our customers are organized by
commercial and large enterprise groups, including business and public sector enterprises, and purchases of our products, solutions and services may be fulfilled directly by us or indirectly through a
variety of partners, including:

•

resellers that sell our products and services, frequently with their own value-added products or services, to targeted customer
groups;

•

distribution partners that supply our solutions to resellers;

•

OEMs that integrate our products and services with their own products and services, and sell the integrated solution;

•

independent software vendors that provide their clients with specialized software products and often assist us in selling our products
and services to clients purchasing their products;

•

systems integrators that provide expertise in designing and implementing custom IT solutions and often partner with us to extend their
expertise or influence the sale of our products and services; and

•

advisory firms that provide various levels of management and IT consulting, including some systems integration work, and typically
partner with us on client solutions that require our unique products and services.

The
mix of our business conducted by direct sales or channel differs substantially by business and region. We believe that customer buying patterns and different regional market
conditions require us to tailor our sales, marketing and distribution efforts accordingly. We are focused on driving the depth and breadth of our coverage, in addition to identifying efficiencies and
productivity gains, in both our direct and indirect businesses. While each of our business segments manages the execution of its own go-to-market and distribution strategy, our business segments also
collaborate to ensure strategic and process alignment where appropriate. For example, we typically assign an account manager, generally from EG or ES, to manage relationships across our business with
large enterprise customers. The account manager is supported by a team of specialists with product and services expertise. For other customers and for consumers, our business segments collaborate to
manage relationships with commercial resellers targeting SMBs where appropriate.



Manufacturing and Materials

We utilize a significant number of outsourced manufacturers around the world to manufacture products that we design. The use of
outsourced manufacturers is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for our products as well as maintain flexibility in our supply chain and manufacturing processes. In some
circumstances, third-party OEMs produce products that we purchase and resell under our brand. In addition to our use of outsourced manufacturers, we currently manufacture a limited number of
finished products from components and subassemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors.

We
utilize two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products: building products to order and configuring products to order. We build products to order to maximize manufacturing and
logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations. Alternatively, configuring products to order enables units to match a customer's particular hardware and software
customization requirements. Our inventory management and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory holding periods by
taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing shortly before the sale or distribution of products to our customers.

We
purchase materials, supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors. For most of our products, we have existing alternate sources of supply or such alternate
sources of supply are readily available. However, we do rely on sole sources for certain customized parts (although some of these sources have operations in multiple locations in the event of a
disruption). We are dependent upon Intel and AMD as suppliers of x86 processors; however, we believe that disruptions with these suppliers would result in industry-wide dislocations and therefore
would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors.

Like
other participants in the IT industry, we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our demand
requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days. From time to time, we may experience significant price volatility or supply constraints for certain components that are not available from
multiple sources or where our suppliers are geographically concentrated. When necessary, we are often able to obtain scarce components for somewhat higher prices on the open market, which may have an
impact on our gross margin but does not generally disrupt production. We also may acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longer-term pricing commitments with
vendors to improve the priority, price and availability of supply. See "Risk Factors—We depend on third-party suppliers, and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our
suppliers properly."

International

Our products and services are available worldwide. We believe this geographic diversity allows us to meet demand on a worldwide basis
for our customers, draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce, provides stability to our operations, provides revenue streams that may offset geographic economic trends and
offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products. In addition, we believe that our future growth is dependent in part on our ability to develop products and sales models that
target developing countries. In this regard, we believe that our broad geographic presence gives us a solid base on which to build such future growth.

A
summary of our domestic and international results is set forth in Note 2, "Segment Information", to the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements. Approximately 61% of our
overall net revenue in fiscal 2015 came from outside the United States.

For
a discussion of certain risks attendant to our international operations, see "Risk Factors—Due to the international nature of our business, political or economic changes
or other factors could harm our business and financial performance," "—Recent global, regional and local economic weakness and



uncertainty
could adversely affect our business and financial performance," "—We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates" in Item 1A, "Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk" in Item 7A and Note 12, "Financial Instruments", to our Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements, which are incorporated herein by
reference.

Research and Development

Innovation is a key element of our culture and critical to our success. Our research and development efforts are focused on designing
and developing products, services and solutions that anticipate customers' changing needs and desires and emerging technological trends. Our efforts also are focused on identifying the areas where we
believe we can make a unique contribution and where partnering with other leading technology companies will leverage our cost structure and maximize our customers' experiences.

Hewlett
Packard Labs, together with the various research and development groups within our business segments, is responsible for our research and development efforts. Hewlett Packard
Labs is part of our Corporate Investments segment.

Expenditures
for research and development were $2.3 billion in fiscal 2015, $2.2 billion in fiscal 2014 and $2.0 billion in fiscal 2013. We anticipate that we will
continue to have significant research and development expenditures in the future to support the design and development of innovative, high-quality products, services and solutions to maintain and
enhance our competitive position. For a discussion of risks attendant to our research and development activities, see "Risk Factors—If we cannot successfully execute our go-to-market
strategy and continue to develop, manufacture and market innovative products, services and solutions, our business and financial performance may suffer."

Patents

Our general policy is to seek patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where
obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position. At present, our worldwide patent portfolio includes approximately 15,000 patents (including approximately 2,500 patents
attributable to H3C).

Patents
generally have a term of twenty years from the date they are filed. As our patent portfolio has been built over time, the remaining terms of the individual patents across our
patent portfolio vary. We believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and services, enhancing our freedom of action
to sell our products and services in markets in which we choose to participate, and maximizing our return on research and development investments. No single patent is in itself essential to our
company as a whole or to any of our business segments.

In
addition to developing our patent portfolio, we license intellectual property from third parties as we deem appropriate. We have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses,
and other rights, under our patents when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest. These license arrangements include a number of cross-licenses with third parties.

For
a discussion of risks attendant to intellectual property rights, see "Risk Factors—Our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop, license or
enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend" and "—Our products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third
parties."

Backlog

We believe that our backlog is not a meaningful indicator of our future business prospects due to our diverse product and service
portfolio, including the large volume of products delivered from finished goods or channel partner inventories and the shortening of product life cycles. Therefore, we believe that backlog information
is not material to an understanding of our overall business.



Seasonality

General economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results. From time to time, the markets in which we sell our
products, services and solutions experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales. We experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services. For example,
European sales are often weaker in the summer months. See "Risk Factors—Our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less
predictable."

Competition

We have a broad technology portfolio of enterprise IT infrastructure products and solutions, multi-vendor customer services and IT
management software and solutions. We believe we are the leader or among the leaders in each of our business segments. Nevertheless, we encounter strong competition in all areas of our business. We
compete primarily on the basis of technology, innovation, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, reputation, distribution, range of products and services, ease of use of our products,
account relationships, customer training, service and support, security and the availability of our application software and IT infrastructure offerings.

The
markets for each of our business segments are characterized by strong competition among major corporations with long-established positions and a large number of new and rapidly
growing firms. Most product life cycles are relatively short, and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services, periodically enhance our existing products and services and compete
effectively on the basis of the factors listed above, among others. In addition, we compete with many of our current and potential partners, including OEMs that design, manufacture and market
their products under their own brand names. Our successful management of these competitive partner relationships is critical to our future success. Moreover, we anticipate that we will have to
continue to adjust prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive.

The
competitive environments in which each segment operates are described below:

Enterprise Group.

EG operates in the highly competitive enterprise technology infrastructure market, which is characterized by rapid
and ongoing
technological innovation and price competition. Our primary competitors include technology vendors such as International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM"), Dell Inc. ("Dell"), EMC
Corporation ("EMC"), Cisco Systems, Inc. ("Cisco"), Lenovo Group Ltd., Oracle Corporation ("Oracle"), Fujitsu Limited ("Fujitsu"), Inspur Co., Ltd., Huawei
Technologies Co. Ltd., NetApp, Inc., Hitachi Ltd., Juniper Networks, Inc., Arista Networks, Inc., Extreme Networks, Inc., Brocade Communications
Systems, Inc., VMware, Microsoft, Google Inc., Rackspace Inc. and Amazon.com, Inc. ("Amazon"). In certain regions, we also experience competition from local companies and
from generically branded or "white-box" manufacturers. Our strategy is to deliver superior products, high-value technology support services and differentiated integrated solutions that combine our
infrastructure, software and services capabilities. Our competitive advantages include our broad end-to-end solutions portfolio, supported by our strong intellectual property portfolio and research
and development capabilities, coupled with our global reach and partner ecosystem.

Enterprise Services.

ES competes in the IT services, consulting and integration, infrastructure technology outsourcing, business
process outsourcing
and application services markets. Our primary competitors
include IBM Global Services, Computer Sciences Corporation, systems integration firms such as Accenture plc and offshore companies such as Fujitsu and India-based competitors Wipro Limited,
Infosys Limited and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. We also compete with other traditional hardware providers, such as Dell, which are increasingly offering services to support their products,
new players in emerging areas like cloud such as Amazon, and smaller local players. Many of our competitors offer a wide range of global services, and some of our competitors enjoy significant brand



recognition.
ES teams with many companies to offer services, and those arrangements allow us to extend our reach and augment our capabilities. Our competitive advantages include our deep technology
expertise, especially in complex multi-country, multi-vendor and/or multi-language environments, our differentiated intellectual property, our strong track record of collaboration with clients and
partners, and the combination of our expertise in infrastructure management with skilled global resources on platforms from SAP AG ("SAP"), Oracle and Microsoft, among others.

Software.

The markets in which our Software segment operates are characterized by rapidly changing customer requirements and
technologies. We design
and develop enterprise IT management software in competition with IBM, CA Technologies, Inc., VMware, BMC Software, Inc. and others. Our big data solutions, which include data analytics
and information governance offerings incorporating both structured and unstructured data, compete with products from companies like Adobe Systems Inc., IBM, EMC, Open Text Corporation, Oracle
and Symantec Corporation. We also deliver enterprise security/risk intelligence solutions that compete with products from EMC, IBM, Cisco and Intel. As customers are becoming increasingly comfortable
with newer delivery mechanisms such as SaaS, we are facing competition from smaller, less traditional competitors, particularly for customers with smaller IT organizations. Our differentiation lies in
the breadth and depth of our software and services portfolio, our collaboration with EG and ES to provide comprehensive IT solutions and the scope of our market coverage.

Hewlett Packard Financial Services.

In our financing business, our competitors are captive financing companies, mainly IBM Global
Financing, as well
as banks and other financial institutions. We believe our competitive advantage over banks and other financial institutions in our financing business is our ability to deliver flexible investment
solutions and expertise that help customers and other partners create unique technology deployments based on specific business needs.

For
a discussion of certain risks attendant to these competitive environments, see "Risk Factors—We operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures
could harm our business and financial performance."

Environment

Our operations are subject to regulation under various federal, state, local and foreign laws concerning the environment, including
laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the clean-up of contaminated sites. We could incur substantial
costs, including clean-up costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, and third-party damage or personal injury claims, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws.

Many
of our products are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws governing chemical substances in products and their safe use, including laws restricting the presence
of certain substances in electronics products and in some cases laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of chemical substances. Some of our products and services also are, or may in the
future be, subject to requirements applicable to their energy consumption. In addition, we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future
requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products, their safe use, and their energy efficiency, including requirements relating to climate change. We are also subject to
legislation in an increasing number of jurisdictions that makes producers of electrical goods, including servers and networking equipment, financially responsible for specified collection, recycling,
treatment and disposal of past and future covered products (sometimes referred to as "product take-back legislation"). In the event our products become non-compliant with these laws, our products
could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions and we could face other sanctions, including fines.



Our
operations, services and ultimately our products are expected to become increasingly subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and international treaties
relating to climate change. As these laws, regulations, treaties and similar initiatives and programs are adopted and implemented throughout the world, we will be required to comply or potentially
face market access limitations or other sanctions, including fines. However, we believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to achieve compliance with and manage those
requirements, and we are collaborating with industry and business groups and governments to find and promote ways that our technology can be used to address climate change and to facilitate compliance
with related laws, regulations and treaties.

We
are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations, products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of
our business. We
meet this commitment with a comprehensive environmental, health and safety policy, strict environmental management of our operations and worldwide environmental programs and services.

Environmental
costs and accruals are presently not material to our operations, cash flows or financial position. Although there is no assurance that existing or future environmental laws
applicable to our operations or products will not have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows or financial condition, we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for
environmental control facilities.

Employees

We had approximately 240,000 employees as of October 31, 2015.

ITEM 1A. Risk Factors.

You should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Form 10-K in evaluating
Hewlett Packard Enterprise and its common stock. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. The following risk factors should be
read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation" and the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements and related
notes in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplemental Data" of this Form 10-K.

Risks Related to Our Business

If we are unsuccessful at addressing our business challenges, our business and results of operations
may be adversely affected and our ability to invest in and grow our business could be limited.

We are in the process of addressing many challenges facing our business. One set of challenges relates to dynamic and accelerating
market trends, such as the market shift to cloud-related IT infrastructure, software and services, and the growth in software-as-a-service ("SaaS") business models. Certain of our legacy hardware
businesses face challenges as customers migrate to cloud-based offerings and reduce their purchases of hardware products. Additionally, our legacy software business derives a large portion of its
revenues from upfront license sales, some of which over time can be expected to shift to SaaS. A second set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape. Our major competitors are
expanding their product and service offerings with integrated products and solutions; our business-specific competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering
new markets; our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models; and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others. A third
set of challenges relates to business model changes and our go-to-market execution. For example, we may fail to develop innovative products and services, maintain the manufacturing quality of our
products, manage our distribution network or successfully market new products and services, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.

In
addition, we are facing a series of significant macroeconomic challenges, including weakness across many geographic regions, particularly in the United States, Central and Eastern
Europe and Russia, and certain countries in Asia. We may experience delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to our efforts to address these challenges and higher than expected or
unanticipated execution costs. In addition, we are vulnerable to increased risks associated with our efforts to address these challenges given our large and diverse portfolio of businesses, the broad
range of geographic regions in which we and our customers and partners operate, and the ongoing integration of acquired businesses. If we do not succeed in these efforts, or if these efforts are more
costly or time-consuming than expected, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected, which could limit our ability to invest in and grow our business.

We operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures could harm our business
and financial performance.

We encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business, and our competitors have
targeted and are expected to continue targeting our key market segments. We compete primarily on the basis of our technology, innovation, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, reputation,
distribution, range of products and services, ease of use of our products, account relationships, customer training, service and support, security, and the availability of our application software and
IT infrastructure offerings. If our products, services, support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of those criteria, our results of operations and business
prospects could be harmed.



We
have a large portfolio of products and services and must allocate our financial, personnel and other resources across all of our products and services while competing with companies
that have smaller portfolios or specialize in one or more of our product or service lines. As a result, we may invest less in certain areas of our business than our competitors do, and our competitors
may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources available to them compared to the resources allocated to our products and services that compete against their products and services.
Industry consolidation may also affect competition by creating larger, more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we operate. Additionally, our competitors may
affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with our existing or potential customers or suppliers.

Companies
with whom we have alliances in certain areas may be or become our competitors in other areas. In addition, companies with whom we have alliances also may acquire or form
alliances with our competitors, which could reduce their business with us. If we are unable to effectively manage these complicated relationships with alliance partners, our business and results of
operations could be adversely affected.

We
face aggressive price competition and may have to continue lowering the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive, while simultaneously seeking to maintain or
improve our revenue and gross margin. In addition, competitors who have a greater presence in some of the lower-cost markets in which we compete, or who can obtain better pricing, more favorable
contractual terms and conditions or more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer. Our cash flows,
results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing pressures.

Because
our business model is based on providing innovative and high-quality products, we may spend a proportionately greater amount of our revenues on research and development than some
of our competitors. If we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure (apart from research and development expenses) on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures, our gross
margin and, therefore, our profitability could be adversely affected. In addition, if our pricing and other facets of our offerings are not sufficiently competitive, or if there is an adverse reaction
to our product decisions, we may lose market share in certain areas, which could adversely affect our financial performance and business prospects.

Even
if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product, its financial performance could decline because the product is in a maturing industry or market segment
or contains technology that is becoming obsolete. For example, our Storage business unit is experiencing the effects of a market transition towards converged products and solutions, which has led to a
decline in demand for our traditional storage products. In addition, the performance of our Business Critical Systems business unit has been affected by the decline in demand for UNIX servers and
concerns about the development of new versions of software to support our Itanium-based products. Financial performance could decline due to increased competition from other types of products. For
example, the development of cloud-based solutions has reduced demand for some of our existing hardware products.

If we cannot successfully execute our go-to-market strategy and continue to develop, manufacture and
market innovative products, services and solutions, our business and financial performance may suffer.

Our long-term strategy is focused on leveraging our existing portfolio of hardware, software and services as we adapt to a new hybrid
model of IT delivery and consumption driven by the growing adoption of cloud computing and increased demand for integrated IT solutions. To successfully execute this strategy, we must continue to
pivot toward the delivery of integrated IT solutions and continue to invest and expand in cloud computing, enterprise security, big data, applications and mobility. Any



failure
to successfully execute this strategy, including any failure to invest sufficiently in strategic growth areas, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

The
process of developing new high-technology products, software, services and solutions and enhancing existing hardware and software products, services and solutions is complex, costly
and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers' changing needs and emerging technological
trends accurately could significantly harm our market share, results of operations and financial condition. For example, as the transition to an environment characterized by cloud-based computing and
software being delivered as a service progresses, we must continue to successfully develop and deploy cloud-based solutions for our customers. We must make long-term investments, develop or obtain and
protect appropriate intellectual property, and commit significant research and development and other resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our
products, services and solutions. Any failure to accurately predict technological and business trends, control research and development costs or execute our innovation strategy could harm our business
and financial performance. Our research and development initiatives may not be successful in whole or in part, including research and development projects which we have prioritized with respect to
funding and/or personnel.

After
we develop a product, we must be able to manufacture appropriate volumes quickly while also managing costs and preserving margins. To accomplish this, we must accurately forecast
volumes, mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements, and we may not succeed at doing so within a given product's life cycle or at all. Any delay in the development,
production or marketing of a new product, service or solution could result in us not being among the first to market, which could further harm our competitive position.

For
example, our success in our software segment is dependent on our ability to address the market shift to SaaS and other go-to-market execution challenges. To be successful in
addressing these challenges, we must improve our go-to-market execution with multiple product delivery models, which better address customer needs and achieve broader integration across our overall
product portfolio as we work to capitalize on important market opportunities in cloud computing, big data, enterprise security, applications and mobility. Improvements in SaaS delivery, however, do
not guarantee that we will achieve increased revenue or profitability. SaaS solutions often have lower margins than other software solutions throughout the subscription period and customers may elect
to not renew their subscriptions upon expiration of their agreements with us.

If we cannot continue to produce quality products and services, our reputation, business and
financial performance may suffer

.

In
the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products, services and solutions, including defects in
our engineering, design and manufacturing processes and unsatisfactory performance under service contracts, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products and unsatisfactory
performance or even malicious acts by third-party contractors or subcontractors or their employees. In order to address quality issues, we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage
in product testing to determine the causes of problems and to develop and implement appropriate solutions. However, the products, services and solutions that we offer are complex, and our regular
testing and quality control efforts may not be effective in controlling or detecting all quality issues or errors, particularly with respect to faulty components manufactured by third parties. If we
are unable to determine the cause, find an appropriate solution or offer a temporary fix (or "patch") to address quality issues with our products, we may delay shipment to customers, which could delay
revenue recognition and receipt of
customer payments and could adversely affect our revenue, cash flows and profitability. In addition, after products are delivered, quality issues may require us to repair or replace such products.
Addressing quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty, repair, replacement and other



costs,
adversely affecting our financial performance. If new or existing customers have difficulty operating our products or are dissatisfied with our services or solutions, our results of operations
could be adversely affected, and we could face possible claims if we fail to meet our customers' expectations. In addition, quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers
and adversely affect our brand and reputation, which could, in turn, adversely affect our results of operations.

If we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly, our business and
financial performance could suffer.

We use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services around the world, including third-party resellers and
distributors and both direct and indirect sales to enterprise accounts and consumers. Successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential
customer segments for our products and services is a complex process. Moreover, since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins, our failure to implement the most advantageous
balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability.

Our
financial results could be materially adversely affected due to distribution channel conflicts or if the financial conditions of our channel partners were to weaken. Our results of
operations may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various distribution channels or the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement. Moreover,
some of our wholesale distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions, including economic weakness, industry consolidation and
market trends. Many of our significant distributors operate on narrow margins and have been negatively affected by business pressures in the past. Considerable trade receivables that are not covered
by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution channel partners. Revenue from indirect sales could suffer, and we could experience disruptions in distribution, if our
distributors' financial conditions, abilities to borrow funds in the credit markets or operations weaken.

Our
inventory management is complex, as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors. We must manage both owned and channel inventory effectively, particularly
with respect to
sales to distributors, which involves forecasting demand and pricing challenges. Distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory is too high or
delay orders in anticipation of new products. Distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in
end-user demand. Our reliance upon indirect distribution methods may reduce our visibility into demand and pricing trends and issues, and therefore make forecasting more difficult. If we have excess
or obsolete inventory, we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory. Moreover, our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and
otherwise to respond to pricing changes by competitors. We also may have limited ability to estimate future product rebate redemptions in order to price our products effectively.

Recent global, regional and local economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our
business and financial performance.

Our business and financial performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for technology hardware,
software and services in the markets in which we compete. Recent economic weakness and uncertainty in various markets throughout the world have resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased
revenue, gross margin, earnings or growth rates and in increased expenses and difficulty in managing inventory levels. For example, we are continuing to experience macroeconomic weakness across many
geographic regions, particularly in the Europe, the Middle East and Africa region, China and certain other high-growth markets. Ongoing U.S. federal government spending limits may continue to reduce
demand for our products, services and solutions from



organizations
that receive funding from the U.S. government, and could negatively affect macroeconomic conditions in the United States, which could further reduce demand for our products, services and
solutions. Economic weakness and uncertainty may adversely affect demand for our products, services and solutions, may result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and
potential goodwill and asset impairment charges, and may make it more difficult for us to make accurate forecasts of revenue, gross margin, cash flows and expenses.

Economic
weakness and uncertainty could cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations. Any financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets or any
significant financial services institution failures could negatively impact our treasury operations, as the financial condition of such parties may deteriorate rapidly and without notice in times of
market volatility and disruption. Poor financial performance of asset markets combined with lower interest rates and the adverse effects of fluctuating currency exchange rates could lead to higher
pension and post-retirement benefit expenses. Interest and other expenses could vary materially from expectations depending on changes in
interest rates, borrowing costs, currency exchange rates, costs of hedging activities and the fair value of derivative instruments. Economic downturns also may lead to restructuring actions and
associated expenses.

Due to the international nature of our business, political or economic changes or other factors
could harm our business and financial performance.

Sales outside the United States constituted approximately 61% of our net revenue in fiscal 2015. Our future business and financial
performance could suffer due to a variety of international factors, including:

•

ongoing instability or changes in a country's or region's economic or political conditions, including inflation, recession, interest
rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts;

•

longer collection cycles and financial instability among customers;

•

trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting production, pricing and marketing of products, including policies adopted by
countries that may champion or otherwise favor domestic companies and technologies over foreign competitors;

•

local labor conditions and regulations, including local labor issues faced by specific suppliers and original equipment manufacturers
("OEMs");

•

managing our geographically dispersed workforce;

•

changes in the international, national or local regulatory and legal environments;

•

differing technology standards or customer requirements;

•

import, export or other business licensing requirements or requirements relating to making foreign direct investments, which could
increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions, prevent us from shipping products to particular countries or markets, affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for components,
increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions;

•

difficulties associated with repatriating earnings generated or held abroad in a tax-efficient manner, and changes in tax laws; and

•

fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation and
shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products and shipments.



The
factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the United States. For example, we rely on suppliers in Asia
for product assembly and manufacture.

In
many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, there are companies that engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us,
such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the "FCPA"). Although we implement policies, procedures and training designed to facilitate compliance with these laws, our employees,
contractors and agents, as well as those of the companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, may take actions in violation of our policies. Any such violation, even if
prohibited by our policies, could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.

We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

Currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the euro, the British pound, Chinese yuan (renminbi) and the Japanese yen, can have an
impact on our results as expressed in U.S. dollars. In particular, the economic uncertainties relating to European sovereign and other debt obligations and the related European financial restructuring
efforts may cause the value of the euro to fluctuate. Currency volatility also contributes to variations in our sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions. For example, in the event that
one or more European countries were to replace the euro with another currency, our sales into such countries, or into Europe generally, would likely be adversely affected until stable exchange rates
are established. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, most notably the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, could adversely affect our revenue growth in future
periods. In addition, currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the United States and margins on sales of products that include components
obtained from suppliers located outside of the United States.

From
time to time, we may use forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks. The effectiveness of our hedges
depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows, which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates. We
may incur significant losses from our hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility and currency variations. In addition, certain or all of our hedging activities may be ineffective, may
expire and not be renewed or may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations. Losses associated with hedging activities also may impact our
revenue and to a lesser extent our cost of sales and financial condition.

The revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied, which makes our future
financial results less predictable.

Our revenue, gross margin and profit vary among our diverse products and services, customer groups and geographic markets and therefore
will likely be different in future periods than our historical results as a consolidated subsidiary of HP Co. Our revenue depends on the overall demand for our products and services. Delays or
reductions in IT spending by our customers or potential customers could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services, which could result in a significant decline in revenue.
In addition, revenue declines in some of our businesses, particularly our services businesses, may affect revenue in our other businesses as we may lose cross-selling opportunities. Overall gross
margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the product, service, customer and geographic mix reflected in that period's net revenue. Competition, lawsuits,
investigations, increases in component and manufacturing costs that we are unable to pass on to our customers, component supply disruptions and other risks affecting those businesses therefore may
have a significant impact on our overall gross margin and profitability. Certain segments have a higher fixed cost structure and more variation in gross margins across their business



units
and product portfolios than others and may therefore experience significant operating profit volatility on a quarterly or annual basis. In addition, newer geographic markets may be relatively
less profitable due to our investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures, and we may have difficulty establishing and maintaining the operating infrastructure
necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets. Market trends, industry shifts, competitive pressures, commoditization of products, increased component or shipping
costs, regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins of certain segments in a given period, which may lead to adjustments to our operations.
Moreover, our efforts to address the challenges facing our business could increase the level of variability in our financial results because the rate at which we are able to realize the benefits from
those efforts may vary from period to period. See also the risk factor below entitled "We have no history of operating as an independent company and we expect to incur increased administrative and
other costs following the separation by virtue of our status as an independent public company. Our historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that we would have
achieved as a separate, publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results."

We depend on third-party suppliers, and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our
suppliers properly.

Our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components, products and services, as well as our suppliers' ability
to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components, products and services at reasonable prices and in time for us to meet critical schedules for the delivery of our own products and services.
Given the wide variety of systems, products and services that we offer, the large number of our suppliers and contract manufacturers that are located around the world, and the long lead times required
to manufacture, assemble and deliver certain components and products, problems could arise in production, planning and inventory management that could seriously harm our business. In addition, our
ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive, time-consuming and resource-intensive than expected. Furthermore, certain of our
suppliers may decide to discontinue conducting business with us. Other supplier problems that we could face include component shortages, excess supply, risks related to the terms of our contracts with
suppliers, risks associated with contingent workers, and risks related to our relationships with single-source suppliers, each of which is described below.

•

Component shortages.

We may experience a shortage of, or
a delay in receiving, certain components as a result of strong demand, capacity constraints, supplier financial weaknesses, the inability of suppliers to borrow funds in the credit markets, disputes
with suppliers (some of whom are also our customers), disruptions in the operations of component suppliers, other problems experienced by suppliers or problems faced during the transition to new
suppliers. If shortages or delays persist, the price of certain components may increase, we may be exposed to quality issues, or the components may not be available at all. We may not be able to
secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build products or provide services in a timely manner in the quantities needed or according to our specifications.
Accordingly, our business and financial performance could suffer if we lose time-sensitive sales, incur additional freight costs or are unable to pass on price increases to our customers. If we cannot
adequately address supply issues, we might have to reengineer some product or service offerings, which could result in further costs and delays.

•

Excess supply.

In order to secure components for our
products or services, at times we may make advance payments to suppliers or enter into non-cancelable commitments with vendors. In addition, we may purchase components strategically in advance of
demand to take advantage of favorable pricing or to address concerns about the availability of future components. If we fail to



anticipate
customer demand properly, a temporary oversupply could result in excess or obsolete components, which could adversely affect our business and financial performance.

•

Contractual terms.

As a result of binding long-term price
or purchase commitments with vendors, we may be obligated to purchase components or services at prices that are higher than those available in the current market and be limited in our ability to
respond to changing market conditions. If we commit to purchasing components or services for prices in excess of the then-current market price, we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who have
access to components or services at lower prices, our gross margin could suffer, and we could incur additional charges relating to inventory obsolescence. Any of these developments could adversely
affect our future results of operations and financial condition.

•

Contingent workers.

We also rely on third-party suppliers
for the provision of contingent workers, and our failure to manage our use of such workers effectively could adversely affect our results of operations. We have been exposed to various legal claims
relating to the status of contingent workers in the past and could face similar claims in the future. We may be subject to shortages, oversupply or fixed contractual terms relating to contingent
workers. Our ability to manage the size of, and costs associated with, the contingent workforce may be subject to additional constraints imposed by local laws.

•

Single-source suppliers.

We obtain a significant number
of components from single sources due to technology, availability, price, quality or other considerations. New products that we introduce may utilize custom components obtained from only one source
initially until we have evaluated whether there is a need for additional suppliers. Replacing a single-source supplier could delay production of some products as replacement suppliers may be subject
to capacity constraints or other output limitations. For some components, such as customized components, alternative sources either may not exist or may be unable to produce the quantities of those
components necessary to satisfy our production requirements. In addition, we sometimes purchase components from single-source suppliers under short-term agreements that contain favorable pricing and
other terms but that may be unilaterally modified or terminated by the supplier with limited notice and with little or no penalty. The performance of such single-source suppliers under those
agreements (and the renewal or extension of those agreements upon similar terms) may affect the quality, quantity and price of our components. The loss of a single-source supplier, the deterioration
of our relationship with a single-source supplier or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which we are supplied components by a single-source supplier could adversely affect our
business and financial performance.

Business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase
our costs and expenses.

Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes, telecommunications failures, power or water shortages, tsunamis, floods,
hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters or catastrophic events, for which we are predominantly self-insured. The
occurrence of any of these business disruptions could result in significant losses, seriously harm our revenue, profitability and financial condition, adversely affect our competitive position,
increase our costs and expenses, and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations. Our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development
activities are located in California, and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in California and Asia, near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity. In
addition, our principal worldwide IT data centers are located in the southern United States, making our operations more vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in that
geographical area. The manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including the Czech



Republic,
Mexico, China and Singapore. We also rely on major logistics hubs, primarily in Asia to manufacture and distribute our products, and primarily in the southwestern United States to import
products into the Americas region. Our operations could be adversely affected if manufacturing, logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason, including natural
disasters,
IT system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, regulatory or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our significant suppliers and our general
infrastructure of being located near locations more vulnerable to the occurrence of the aforementioned business disruptions, such as near major earthquake faults, and being consolidated in certain
geographical areas is unknown and remains uncertain.

Our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial
results less predictable.

In some of our segments, our quarterly sales often have reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarter's
total sales occurs towards the end of the quarter. This uneven sales pattern makes predicting revenue, earnings, cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult,
increases the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems. If predicted demand is
substantially greater than orders, there may be excess inventory. Alternatively, if orders substantially exceed predicted demand, we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in each
quarter and such orders may be cancelled. Depending on when they occur in a quarter, developments such as a systems failure, component pricing movements, component shortages or global logistics
disruptions, could adversely impact our inventory levels and results of operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected.

We
experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in our quarterly results and financial condition. For example, sales to governments
(particularly sales to the U.S. government) are often stronger in the third calendar quarter, and many customers whose fiscal year is the calendar year spend their remaining capital budget
authorizations in the fourth calendar quarter prior to new budget constraints in the first calendar quarter of the following year. European sales are often weaker during the summer months. Typically,
our third fiscal quarter is our weakest and our fourth fiscal quarter is our strongest. Many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control.

Any failure by us to identify, manage and complete acquisitions, divestitures and other significant
transactions successfully could harm our financial results, business and prospects.

As part of our business strategy, we may acquire companies or businesses, divest businesses or assets, enter into strategic alliances
and joint ventures and make investments to further our business (collectively, "business combination and investment transactions"). For example, in May 2015, we acquired Aruba Networks, Inc.,
which provides next-generation network access solutions for mobile enterprise. Also in May 2015, we announced a partnership with Tsinghua Holdings Co., Ltd. ("Tsinghua"), the asset
management arm of Tsinghua University in China, pursuant to which we will sell to Tsinghua a 51% interest in our wholly owned subsidiary that owns and operates H3C
Technologies and our China-based server, storage and technology services businesses for approximately $2.3 billion, subject to the terms and conditions of the share purchase agreement among
Tsinghua, Tsinghua's subsidiary Unispendour Corporation and our subsidiary H3C Holdings Limited. The transaction with Tsinghua is expected to close during the first quarter of fiscal 2016, subject to
regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.



Risks
associated with business combination and investment transactions include the following, any of which could adversely affect our revenue, gross margin, profitability and financial
results:

•

Managing business combination and investment transactions requires varying levels of management resources, which may divert our
attention from other business operations.

•

We may not fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of any particular business combination and investment transaction, and the
timeframe for realizing the benefits of a particular business combination and investment transaction may depend partially upon the actions of employees, advisors, suppliers, other third parties or
market trends.

•

Certain previous business combination and investment transactions have resulted, and in the future any such transactions by us may
result, in significant costs and expenses, including those related to severance pay, early retirement costs, employee benefit costs, charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and
contracts, inventory adjustments, assumed litigation and other liabilities, legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, and required payments to executive officers and key employees under retention
plans.

•

Any increased or unexpected costs, unanticipated delays or failure to meet contractual obligations could make business combination and
investment transactions less profitable or unprofitable.

•

Our ability to conduct due diligence with respect to business combination and investment transactions, and our ability to evaluate the
results of such due diligence, is dependent upon the veracity and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by third parties or their representatives.

•

Our due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with the acquired company's product quality, financial disclosures,
accounting practices or internal control deficiencies.

•

The pricing and other terms of our contracts for business combination and investment transactions require us to make estimates and
assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts, and, during the course of our due diligence, we may not identify all of the factors necessary to estimate accurately our costs, timing and other
matters or we may incur costs if a business combination is not consummated.

•

In order to complete a business combination and investment transaction, we may issue common stock, potentially creating dilution for
our existing stockholders.

•

We may borrow to finance business combination and investment transactions, and the amount and terms of any potential future
acquisition-related or other borrowings, as well as other factors, could affect our liquidity and financial condition.

•

Our effective tax rate on an ongoing basis is uncertain, and business combination and investment transactions could adversely impact
our effective tax rate.

•

An announced business combination and investment transaction may not close on the expected timeframe or at all, which may cause our
financial results to differ from expectations in a given quarter.

•

Business combination and investment transactions may lead to litigation, which could impact our financial condition and results of
operations.

•

If we fail to identify and successfully complete and integrate business combination and investment transactions that further our
strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products, services and technology internally, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage.



We have incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with business
combination and investment transactions and, to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination and investment transaction becomes
impaired, we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets. For example, for fiscal 2012, we recorded an $8.0 billion impairment charge
relating to the goodwill associated with our enterprise services reporting unit within our Enterprise Services segment. In addition, for fiscal 2012, we recorded an $8.8 billion impairment
charge relating to the goodwill and intangible assets associated with Autonomy. If there are future sustained decreases in our stock price or significant changes in the business climate or results of
operations of our reporting units, we may incur additional charges, which may include goodwill impairment or intangible asset charges.

As
part of our business strategy, we regularly evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help us meet our objectives. When we decide to sell assets
or a business, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives. We
may also dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than we had anticipated. In addition, we may
experience greater dis-synergies than expected, and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected. After reaching an agreement with a buyer or seller for the
acquisition or disposition of a business, we are subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions as well as to necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms, which, if not
satisfied or obtained, may prevent us from completing the transaction. Dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business, such as through continuing equity
ownership, guarantees, indemnities or other financial obligations. Under these arrangements, performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could affect our future
financial results.

Integrating acquisitions may be difficult and time-consuming. Any failure by us to integrate
acquired companies, products or services into our overall business in a timely manner could harm our financial results, business and prospects.

In order to pursue our strategy successfully, we must identify candidates for and successfully complete business combination and
investment transactions, some of which may be large or complex, and manage post-closing issues such as the integration of acquired businesses, products, services or employees. Integration issues are
often time-consuming and expensive and, without proper planning and implementation, could significantly disrupt our business and the acquired business. The challenges involved in integration
include:

•

successfully combining product and service offerings, including under the single new Hewlett Packard Enterprise brand, and entering or
expanding into markets in which we are not experienced or are developing expertise;

•

convincing customers and distributors that the transaction will not diminish customer service standards or business focus;

•

persuading customers and distributors to not defer purchasing decisions or switch to other suppliers (which could result in our
incurring additional obligations in order to address customer uncertainty), minimizing sales force attrition and expanding and coordinating sales, marketing and distribution efforts;

•

consolidating and rationalizing corporate IT infrastructure, which may include multiple legacy systems from various acquisitions and
integrating software code and business processes;

•

minimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns;



•

persuading employees that business cultures are compatible, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees, engaging with
employee works councils representing an acquired company's non-U.S. employees, integrating employees, correctly estimating employee benefit costs and implementing restructuring programs;

•

coordinating and combining administrative, manufacturing, research and development and other operations, subsidiaries, facilities and
relationships with third parties in accordance with local laws and other obligations while maintaining adequate standards, controls and procedures;

•

achieving savings from supply chain integration; and

•

managing integration issues shortly after or pending the completion of other independent transactions.

We may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plans and our
restructuring may adversely affect our business.

We have announced restructuring plans, including the 2012 Plan and the 2015 Plan (each as defined below), in order to realign our cost
structure due to the changing nature of our business and to achieve operating efficiencies that we expect to reduce costs. We may not be able to obtain the cost savings and benefits that were
initially anticipated in connection with our restructuring. Additionally, as a result of our restructuring, we may experience a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge and/or inefficiency
during transitional periods. Reorganization and restructuring can require a significant amount of management and other employees' time and focus, which may divert attention from operating and growing
our business. If we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of restructuring, it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results
of operations and cash flows. For more information about our restructuring plans, including details regarding the 2012 Plan and the 2015 Plan, see Note 3, "Restructuring", to the Combined and
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop, license or enforce the
intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend.

We rely upon patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws in the United States, similar laws in
other countries, and agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, to establish and maintain intellectual property rights in the products and services we sell, provide or
otherwise use in our operations. However, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, infringed or circumvented, or such intellectual property rights may not be
sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or to otherwise provide competitive advantages, either of which could result in costly product redesign efforts, discontinuance of
certain product offerings or other harm to our competitive position. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.
Therefore, in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third-party copying or use; this, too, could adversely affect our ability to
sell products or services and our competitive position.

Our products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third
parties.

Much of our business and many of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties. For example, many of our
software offerings are developed using software components or other intellectual property licensed from third parties, including through both proprietary and open source licenses. These third-party
software components may become
obsolete, defective or incompatible with future versions of our products, or our relationship with the third party may deteriorate, or our agreements with the third party may expire or be terminated.
We may face legal or business disputes



with
licensors that may threaten or lead to the disruption of inbound licensing relationships. In order to remain in compliance with the terms of our licenses, we must carefully monitor and manage our
use of third-party software components, including both proprietary and open source license terms that may require the licensing or public disclosure of our intellectual property without compensation
or on undesirable terms. Additionally, some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable or that allow our product offerings to remain competitive. Our
inability to obtain licenses or rights on favorable terms could have a material effect on our business, including our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, it is possible that as
a consequence of a merger or acquisition, third parties may obtain licenses to some of our intellectual property rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place
prior to such transaction. Because the availability and cost of licenses from third parties depends upon the willingness of third parties to deal with us on the terms we request, there is a risk that
third parties who license to our competitors will either refuse to license us at all, or refuse to license us on terms equally favorable to those granted to our competitors. Consequently, we may lose
a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual property rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights.

Third-party claims of intellectual property infringement, including patent infringement, are
commonplace in the IT industry and successful third-party claims may limit or disrupt our ability to sell our products and services.

Third parties also may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. For
example, patent assertion entities may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies such as Hewlett
Packard Enterprise and its customers. If we cannot or do not license allegedly infringed intellectual property at all or on reasonable terms, or if we are required to substitute similar technology
from another source, our operations could be adversely affected. Even if we believe that intellectual property claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend against and may
divert management's attention and resources away from our business. Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or
license agreements, pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing, marketing or selling certain of our products. Even if we have an agreement to
indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable or unwilling to uphold its contractual obligations to us.

The allocation of intellectual property rights that was made between Hewlett Packard Enterprise and
HP Inc. as part of the separation of the two entities, and the shared use of certain intellectual property rights following the separation, could in the future adversely impact our reputation,
our ability to enforce certain intellectual property rights that are important to us and our competitive position.

In connection with the separation, HP Co. allocated to each of Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. the intellectual
property assets relevant to their respective businesses. The terms of the separation include cross-licenses and other arrangements to provide for certain ongoing use of intellectual property in the
existing operations of both businesses. For example, through a joint brand holding structure, both Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. retain the ability to make ongoing use of certain
variations of the legacy Hewlett-Packard and HP branding, respectively. As a result of this continuing shared use of the legacy branding there is a risk that conduct or events adversely affecting the
reputation of HP Inc. could also adversely affect the reputation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. In addition, as a result of the allocation of intellectual property as part of the separation,
Hewlett Packard Enterprise no longer has ownership of intellectual property allocated to HP Inc. and our resulting intellectual property ownership position could adversely affect our position
and options relating to



patent
enforcement and patent licensing, our ability to sell our products or services and our competitive position in the industry.

Our business and financial performance could suffer if we do not manage the risks associated with
our Enterprise Services business properly.

The success of our ES segment is to a significant degree dependent on our ability to retain our significant services clients and
maintain or increase the level of revenues from these clients. We may lose clients due to their merger or acquisition, business failure, contract expiration or their selection of a competing service
provider or decision to in-source services. In addition, we may not be able to retain or renew relationships with our significant clients. As a result of business downturns or for other business
reasons, we are also vulnerable to reduced processing volumes from our clients, which can reduce the scope of services provided and the prices for those services. We may not be able to replace the
revenue and earnings from any such lost clients or reductions in services. In addition, our contracts may allow a client to terminate the contract for convenience, and we may not be able to fully
recover our investments in such circumstances.

The
pricing and other terms of some of our IT service agreements, particularly our long-term IT outsourcing services agreements, require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time
we enter into these contracts that could differ from actual results. Any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of these engagements, including delays
caused by factors outside our control, could make these agreements less profitable or unprofitable, which could have an adverse effect on the profit margin of our IT services business.

Some
of our IT service agreements require significant investment in the early stages that is expected to be recovered through billings over the life of the agreement. These agreements
often involve the construction of new IT systems and communications networks and the development and deployment of new technologies. Substantial performance risk exists in each agreement with these
characteristics, and some or all elements of service delivery under these agreements are dependent upon successful completion of the development, construction and deployment phases. Any failure to
perform satisfactorily under these agreements may expose us to legal liability, result in the loss of customers and harm our reputation, which could harm the financial performance of our IT services
business.

Some
of our IT outsourcing services agreements contain pricing provisions that permit a client to request a benchmark study by a mutually acceptable third party. The benchmarking process
typically compares the contractual price of our services against the price of similar services offered by other specified providers in a peer comparison group, subject to agreed-upon adjustment and
normalization factors. Generally, if the benchmarking study shows that our pricing differs from our peer group outside a specified range, and the difference is not due to the unique requirements of
the client, then the parties will negotiate in good faith appropriate adjustments to the pricing. This may result in the reduction of our rates for the benchmarked services performed after the
implementation of those pricing adjustments, which could harm the financial performance of our IT services business.

If
we do not hire, train, motivate and effectively utilize employees with the right mix of skills and experience in the right geographic regions to meet the needs of our services
clients, our financial performance could suffer. For example, if our employee utilization rate is too low, our profitability and the level of engagement of our employees could suffer. If that
utilization rate is too high, it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition and the quality of the work performed, as well as our ability to staff projects. If we are unable to
hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current demand, we might need to redeploy existing personnel, increase our reliance on subcontractors or
increase employee compensation levels, all of which could also negatively affect our profitability. In addition, if we have more employees than we need with



certain
skill sets or in certain geographies, we may incur increased costs as we work to rebalance our supply of skills and resources with client demand in those geographies.

Failure to comply with our customer contracts or government contracting regulations could adversely
affect our business and results of operations.

Our contracts with our customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements. In particular, our contracts with
federal, state, provincial and local governmental customers are subject to various procurement regulations, contract provisions and other requirements relating to their formation, administration and
performance. Any failure by us to comply with the specific provisions in our customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of various civil
and criminal penalties, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments and, in the case of our government contracts, fines and suspension from future
government contracting. Such failures could also cause reputational damage to our business. In addition, our former parent has in the past been, and we may in the future be, subject to qui tam
litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to our government contracts, which could include claims for treble damages. Further, any negative publicity related to
our customer contracts or any proceedings surrounding them, regardless of its accuracy, may damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts. If our customer contracts are
terminated, if we are suspended or disbarred from government work, or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, our financial performance could suffer.

We make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our Combined Financial
Statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our results of operations.

In connection with the preparation of our Combined Financial Statements, we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical
experience and other factors. Our most critical accounting estimates are described in the section entitled "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." In
addition, as discussed in Note 17, "Litigation and Contingencies", to our Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements, we make certain estimates, including decisions related to provisions
for legal proceedings and other contingencies. While we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances, they are subject to significant uncertainties, some of
which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could adversely affect our results of operations.

Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to
additional tax liabilities could affect our financial performance.

We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our tax liabilities are affected by
the amounts we charge in intercompany transactions for inventory, services, licenses, funding and other items. We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may
disagree with our intercompany charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters, and may assess additional taxes as a result. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in
order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the amounts ultimately paid upon
resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision, net income and cash
flows. In addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax
rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. In particular, if
circumstances



change
such that we are unable to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings outside the United States, future income tax expense and payments may differ significantly from historical amounts and
could materially adversely affect our results of operations. As of October 31, 2015, we had $27.6 billion of undistributed earnings from non-U.S. operations indefinitely reinvested
outside of the United States. See Note 6, "Taxes on Earnings", to our Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements. The carrying value of our deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in
the United States, is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the United States. In addition, there are proposals for tax legislation that have been introduced or that are being
considered that could have a significant adverse effect on our tax rate, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, or our deferred tax liabilities. Any of these changes could affect our financial
performance.

In order to be successful, we must attract, retain, train, motivate, develop and transition key
employees, and failure to do so could seriously harm us.

In order to be successful, we must attract, retain, train, motivate, develop and transition qualified executives and other key
employees, including those in managerial, technical, development, sales, marketing and IT support positions. Identifying, developing internally or hiring externally, training and retaining qualified
executives, engineers, skilled solutions providers in the IT
support business and qualified sales representatives are critical to our future, and competition for experienced employees in the IT industry can be intense. In order to attract and retain executives
and other key employees in a competitive marketplace, we must provide a competitive compensation package, including cash- and equity-based compensation. Our equity-based incentive awards may contain
conditions relating to our stock price performance and our long-term financial performance that make the future value of those awards uncertain. If the anticipated value of such equity-based incentive
awards does not materialize, if our equity-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive, or if we do not
obtain the stockholder approval needed to continue granting equity-based incentive awards in the amounts we believe are necessary, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate executives and key
employees could be weakened.

Our
failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations. Further, changes in our
management team may be disruptive to our business, and any failure to successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of
operations.

System security risks, data protection breaches, cyberattacks and systems integration issues could
disrupt our internal operations or IT services provided to customers, and any such disruption could reduce our revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock
price.

Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our
confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other
malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and
applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including "bugs" and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the
system. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, including bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and other security vulnerabilities, could be
significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede
our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions.

We
manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business. In addition, our outsourcing services business routinely processes,
stores and transmits



large
amounts of data for our clients, including sensitive and personally identifiable information. Breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved
dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us, our clients or our customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of
fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could expose us, our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability
for us, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business. We also could lose existing or potential customers of outsourcing services or other IT solutions or incur significant expenses
in connection with our customers' system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing
further data protection measures could be significant.

Portions
of our IT infrastructure also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes
place from time to time. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time-consuming, disruptive and
resource intensive. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and respond to customer requests and interrupt other processes. Delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers
resulting from these disruptions could reduce our revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price.

Terrorist acts, conflicts, wars and geopolitical uncertainties may seriously harm our business and
revenue, costs and expenses and financial condition and stock price.

Terrorist acts, conflicts or wars (wherever located around the world) may cause damage or disruption to our business, our employees,
facilities, partners, suppliers, distributors, resellers or customers or adversely affect our ability to manage logistics, operate our transportation and communication systems or conduct certain other
critical business operations. The potential for future attacks, the national and international responses to attacks or perceived threats to national security, and other actual or potential conflicts
or wars have created many economic and political uncertainties. In addition, as a major multinational company with headquarters and significant operations located in the United States, actions against
or by the United States may impact our business or employees. Although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events, if they occur, they could result in a decrease in
demand for our products, make it difficult or impossible to provide services or deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers, create delays and inefficiencies in our
supply chain and result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions. We are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts, conflicts and wars.

Our business is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that could
result in costs or other sanctions that adversely affect our business and results of operations.

We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. For example, we are subject to laws and regulations
concerning environmental protection, including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the clean-up of
contaminated sites, the content of our products and the recycling, treatment and disposal of our products. In particular, we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations
as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products, their safe use, the energy consumption associated with those products, climate change
laws and regulations and product take-back legislation. If we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become non-compliant with environmental laws, we could incur
substantial costs or face other sanctions, which may include



restrictions
on our products entering certain jurisdictions. Our potential exposure includes fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party property damage, personal injury claims and clean-up
costs. Further, liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively, on a joint and several basis, and without any finding of noncompliance or fault.
The amount and timing of costs to comply with environmental laws are difficult to predict.

In
addition, our business is subject to laws addressing privacy and information security. In particular, we face an increasingly complex regulatory environment in our big data offerings
as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the security of our offerings. If we were to violate or become liable under laws or regulations associated with security, we could incur
substantial costs or face other sanctions. Our potential exposure includes fines and civil or criminal sanctions, and third-party claims.

Our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate, which may make future prices of our
stock difficult to predict.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise's stock price, like that of other technology companies, can be volatile. Some of the factors that could
affect our stock price are:

•

speculation, coverage or sentiment in the media or the investment community about, or actual changes in, our business, strategic
position, market share, organizational structure, operations, financial condition, financial reporting and results, effectiveness of cost-cutting efforts, value or liquidity of our investments,
exposure to market volatility, prospects, business combination or investment transactions, future stock price performance, board of directors, executive team, our competitors or our industry in
general;

•

the announcement of new, planned or contemplated products, services, technological innovations, acquisitions, divestitures or other
significant transactions by Hewlett Packard Enterprise or its competitors;

•

quarterly increases or decreases in revenue, gross margin, earnings or cash flows, changes in estimates by the investment community or
financial outlook provided by Hewlett Packard Enterprise and variations between actual and estimated financial results;

•

announcements of actual and anticipated financial results by Hewlett Packard Enterprise's competitors and other companies in the IT
industry;

•

developments relating to pending investigations, claims and disputes; and

•

the timing and amount of share repurchases by Hewlett Packard Enterprise.

General
or industry specific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to Hewlett Packard Enterprise's
performance also may affect the price of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's stock. For these reasons, investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future stock prices, financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, as discussed in Note 17, "Litigation and Contingencies", to the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements, we are involved in
several securities class action litigation matters. Additional volatility in the price of our securities could result in the filing of additional securities class action litigation matters, which
could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources.

Failure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating could adversely affect our liquidity, capital
position, borrowing costs and access to capital markets.

We currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with Moody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and
Fitch Ratings Services. Despite these investment grade credit ratings, any



future
downgrades could increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may incur, reduce market capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under our
derivative contracts. Additionally, increased borrowing costs, including those arising from a credit rating downgrade, can potentially reduce the competitiveness of our financing business. There can
be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings, and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings
are under review for a downgrade, may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position and access to capital markets.

Our debt obligations may adversely affect our business and our ability to meet our obligations and
pay dividends.

In addition to our current total carrying debt, we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. This collective amount of debt
could have important adverse consequences to us and our investors, including:

•

requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make principal and interest payments;

•

making it more difficult to satisfy other obligations;

•

increasing the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of our debt, which could increase future debt costs and limit the future
availability of debt financing;

•

increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

•

reducing the cash flows available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our business;

•

limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry; and

•

limiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise, pay cash
dividends or repurchase our common stock.

To
the extent that we incur additional indebtedness, the risks described above could increase. In addition, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Our
cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to service our outstanding debt or to repay our outstanding debt as it
becomes due, and we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to service or refinance our debt.

Certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated
bylaws, and of Delaware law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.

We have provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, each of which could have the effect of rendering more difficult or
discouraging an acquisition of Hewlett Packard Enterprise deemed undesirable by our Board of Directors. These include provisions:

•

authorizing blank check preferred stock, which we could issue with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our
common stock;

•

limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;

•

specifying that our stockholders may take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and otherwise in
accordance with our bylaws and limiting the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings;



•

requiring advance notice of proposals by our stockholders for business to be conducted at stockholder meetings and for nominations of
candidates for election to our Board of Directors; and

•

controlling the procedures for conduct of our Board of Directors and stockholder meetings and election, appointment and removal of our
directors.

These
provisions, alone or together, could deter or delay hostile takeovers, proxy contests and changes in control or management of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. As a Delaware corporation,
we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prevents some stockholders from engaging in certain business combinations
without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock.

Any
provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control of Hewlett Packard Enterprise could limit the
opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise stock and also could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for Hewlett Packard
Enterprise stock.

Risks Related to the Separation

If the distribution, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction
that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and those who received Hewlett Packard Enterprise common stock in the distribution could be subject to
significant tax liabilities, and, in certain circumstances, Hewlett Packard Enterprise could be required to indemnify HP Inc. for material taxes and other related amounts pursuant to
indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement.

It was a condition to the distribution that our former parent receive (i) a private letter ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service (the "IRS") and/or one or more opinions from its external tax advisors, regarding certain U.S. federal income tax matters relating to the separation and related transactions, and (ii) opinions
of outside counsel regarding the qualification of the distribution, together with certain related transactions, as a transaction that is generally tax-free, for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. These opinions of outside counsel or other external tax advisors and the IRS private letter ruling were based,
among other things, on various facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings of HP Co. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (including those relating to the
past and future conduct of HP Co. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise). If, in the future, any of these facts, assumptions, representations, statements or undertakings is, or becomes, inaccurate or
incomplete, or if HP Inc., as successor to HP Co., or Hewlett Packard Enterprise breach any of their respective covenants contained in any of the separation-related agreements or in the
documents relating to the IRS private letter ruling and/or any tax opinion, the IRS private letter ruling and/or any tax opinion may be rendered invalid. Accordingly, notwithstanding HP Co.'s
receipt of the IRS private letter ruling and/or opinions of counsel or other external tax advisors, the IRS could determine that the distribution and certain related transactions should be treated as
taxable transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the facts, assumptions, representations, statements or undertakings that were included in the request for the IRS
private letter ruling or on which any opinion was based are false or have been violated. In addition, the IRS private letter ruling does not address all of the issues that are relevant to determining
whether the distribution, together with certain related transactions, qualifies as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and an opinion of outside counsel or
other external tax advisor represents the judgment of such counsel or advisor which is not binding on the IRS or any court. Accordingly, notwithstanding receipt by HP Co. of the IRS private
letter ruling and the tax opinions referred to above, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert that the distribution and/or certain related transactions do not qualify for tax-free
treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. In the event the



IRS
were to prevail with such challenge, HP Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Co. stockholders who received Hewlett Packard Enterprise common stock in the distribution could be subject to
significant U.S. federal income tax liability.

If
the distribution, together with certain related transactions, is found to no longer qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of
the Code, in general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, HP Inc. would recognize taxable gain as if it has sold the Hewlett Packard Enterprise common stock in a taxable sale for its fair
market value and HP Co. stockholders who received shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise common stock in the distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to
the fair market value of such shares.

Under
the tax matters agreement we entered into with HP Inc. in connection with the separation (the "Tax Matters Agreement"), we are generally required to indemnify HP Inc.
for any taxes resulting from the separation (and any related costs and other damages) to the extent such amounts resulted from (i) an acquisition of all or a portion of the equity securities or
assets of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, whether by merger or otherwise (and regardless of whether we participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition), (ii) other actions or failures to
act by Hewlett Packard Enterprise or (iii) any of the representations or undertakings of Hewlett Packard Enterprise contained in any of the
separation-related agreements or in the documents relating to the IRS private letter ruling and/or any tax opinion being incorrect or violated. Any such indemnity obligations could be material.

In
addition we incurred certain tax costs in connection with the separation, including non-U.S. tax costs resulting from separations in multiple non-U.S. jurisdictions that do not
legally provide for tax-free separations, which may be material.

We may not be able to engage in desirable strategic or capital-raising transactions following the
separation.

To preserve the tax-free treatment of the separation and the distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes, for the two-year period
following the separation, we are prohibited under the tax matters agreement, except in specific circumstances, from: (i) entering into any transaction pursuant to which all or a portion of the
shares of our common stock would be acquired, whether by merger or otherwise, (ii) issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds, (iii) repurchasing shares of our common stock
other than in certain open-market transactions, (iv) ceasing to actively conduct certain of our businesses or (v) taking or failing to take any other action that would prevent the
distribution and certain related transactions from qualifying as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code.
These restrictions may limit for a period of time our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions, equity issuances or repurchases or other transactions that we may believe to be in the best
interests of our stockholders or that might increase the value of our business.

We have no history of operating as an independent company and we expect to incur increased
administrative and other costs following the separation by virtue of our status as an independent public company. Our historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results
that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.

The historical information about Hewlett Packard Enterprise in this Form 10-K refers to our business as formerly operated by and
integrated with our former parent. Our fourth quarter and fiscal year financial information included in this Form 10-K does not necessarily reflect the financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company during the periods presented or those that we will achieve in the future primarily as a result of the
following factors, among others:

•

Prior to the separation, our business was operated by our former parent as part of its broader corporate organization, rather than as
an independent company. Our former parent or one of its



affiliates
performed various corporate functions for us such as legal, treasury, accounting, internal auditing, human resources and corporate affairs, and also provided our IT and other corporate
infrastructure. Our financial results reflect allocations of corporate expenses from our former parent for such functions and are likely to be less than the expenses we would have incurred had we
operated as a separate publicly traded company. Now that the separation is complete, our costs related to such functions previously performed by HP Co. may increase.

•

Historically, when we were integrated with the other businesses of our former parent, we shared economies of scope and scale in costs,
employees, vendor relationships and customer relationships. Although we have entered into certain agreements (including a transition services agreement) with HP Inc. in connection with the
separation, these arrangements may not fully capture the benefits that we enjoyed as a result of being integrated with our former parent and may result in us paying higher charges than in the past for
these services. This could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in future periods.

•

Generally, our working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and capital
expenditures, have historically been satisfied as part of the corporate-wide cash management policies of our former parent. In connection with the separation, we have entered into certain financing
arrangements described under the section entitled "Description of Material Indebtedness" as part of our transition to becoming a standalone company. We may in the future need to obtain additional
financing from banks, through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, strategic relationships or other arrangements.

•

The cost of capital for our business may be higher than our former parent's cost of capital prior to the separation.

Other
significant changes may occur in our cost structure, management, financing and business operations as a result of operating as a separate company. For additional information about
the past financial performance of our business and the basis of presentation of the historical combined and consolidated financial statements of our business, see "Combined and Consolidated Financial
Statements," "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and the historical Combined and Consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included
elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

The Separation and Distribution Agreement that we entered into with our former parent may limit our
ability to compete in certain markets and may impose limitations on our recruiting efforts for a period of time following the separation.

The Separation and Distribution Agreement includes non-compete provisions pursuant to which we generally agree to not compete with
HP Inc. in certain product and service categories that comprise the HP Inc. business, including personal computers and printers, worldwide for three years from the distribution date.
Such restrictions are subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Separation and Distribution Agreement.

In
addition, the Separation and Distribution Agreement contains (i) non-solicitation provisions preventing us from soliciting HP Inc. employees to work for us for twelve
months from the distribution date and (ii) no-hire provisions preventing us from hiring HP Inc. employees for six months from the distribution date, in each case subject to certain
exceptions.

The
foregoing restrictions may limit our ability to compete in certain markets and may impose limitations on our recruiting efforts. These factors could materially and adversely affect
our business, financial condition and results of operations.



Hewlett Packard Enterprise or HP Inc. may fail to perform under the transition services
agreement and other transaction agreements executed as part of the separation, and we may not have necessary systems and services in place when these transaction agreements expire.

In connection with the separation, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. entered into several agreements, including among others a
transition services agreement (the "Transition Services Agreement"), the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Tax Matters Agreement, an employee matters agreement (the "Employee Matters
Agreement"), a real estate matters agreement (the "Real Estate Matters Agreement"), a commercial agreement (the "Master Commercial Agreement") and an IT service agreement (the "Information Technology
Service Agreement" or the "IT Service Agreement"). The Transition Services Agreement provides for the performance of certain services by each company for the benefit of the other for a transition
period after the separation. The Separation and Distribution Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement and Real Estate Matters Agreement determine the allocation of assets and
liabilities between the companies following the separation for those respective areas and include any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations. The Master Commercial Agreement
establishes a bilateral relationship between HP Inc. and us for the purchase and sale of commercially available products and services for internal use, incorporation and bundling in OEM products and
services, resale to customers and use in the provision of managed services to customers, as well as joint customer pursuits and joint development activities. The IT Service Agreement provides for the
performance by one of our subsidiaries of certain application development and maintenance and IT infrastructure services for HP Inc. We rely on HP Inc. to satisfy its performance and payment
obligations under these agreements. If HP Inc. is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, including its obligations with respect to the provision of transition services, we
could incur operational difficulties or losses that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In
addition, if we do not have in place our own systems and services, or if we do not have agreements with other providers of these services in place once certain transition services
expire, we may not be able to operate our business effectively and our profitability may decline. We are in the process of creating our own, or engaging third parties to provide, systems and services
to replace many of the systems and services that HP Inc. provides to us under the Transition Services Agreement. However, we may not be successful in implementing these systems and services or
in transitioning from HP Inc.'s systems to our own systems, and may pay more for such systems and services that we pay under the Transition Services Agreement.

The separation may in the future result in disruptions to, and negatively impact our relationships
with, our customers and other business partners. In addition, certain contracts that that needed to be assigned from HP Inc. or its affiliates to Hewlett Packard Enterprise in connection with
the separation and required the consent of the counterparty to such an assignment have not, as yet, and failure to obtain these consents could increase our expenses or otherwise harm our business and
financial performance.

Uncertainty related to the Hewlett Packard Enterprise's position post-separation may lead customers and other parties with which we
currently do business or may do business in the future to terminate or attempt to negotiate changes in our existing business relationships, or cause them to consider entering into business
relationships with parties other than us. These disruptions could have a material and adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

In
addition, the Separation and Distribution Agreement provided for the assignment of a number of contracts from HP Inc. or its affiliates to us or our affiliates. A minority of
our customer contracts require the contractual counterparty's consent to assignment, a small number of which remain outstanding post-separation. If we are unable to obtain these consents, we may be
unable to obtain some of the benefits, assets and contractual commitments that are intended to be allocated to us as



part
of the separation. If we are unable to obtain these consents, the loss of these contracts could increase our expenses or otherwise reduce our profitability.

Indemnification liabilities to HP Inc. pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement
could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The Separation and Distribution Agreement provides for, among other things, indemnification obligations generally designed to make us
financially responsible for (i) liabilities primarily associated with our business; (ii) our failure to pay, perform or otherwise promptly discharge any such liabilities or contracts, in
accordance with their respective terms, whether prior to, at or after the distribution; (iii) any guarantee, indemnification obligation, surety bond or other credit support agreement,
arrangement, commitment or understanding by HP Inc. for our benefit, unless related to liabilities primarily associated with the HP Inc. business; (iv) any breach by us of the
separation agreement or any of the ancillary agreements or any action by us in contravention of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws; and (v) any
untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, with
respect to all information contained in our registration statement on Form 10 or any other disclosure document that describes the separation or the distribution or Hewlett Packard Enterprise
and its subsidiaries or primarily relates to the transactions contemplated by the Separation and Distribution Agreement, subject to certain exceptions. If we are required to indemnify HP Inc.
under the circumstances set forth in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, we may be subject to substantial liabilities.

In connection with the separation, HP Inc. has indemnified us for certain liabilities.
However, there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that HP Inc.'s ability to satisfy its indemnification
obligation will not be impaired in the future.

Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and certain other agreements we have entered into with HP Inc.,
HP Inc. has agreed to indemnify Hewlett Packard Enterprise for certain liabilities. However, third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that HP Inc.
has agreed to retain, and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from HP Inc. will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that HP Inc. will be
able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. In addition, HP Inc.'s insurers may attempt to deny us coverage for liabilities associated with certain occurrences of indemnified
liabilities prior to the separation. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from HP Inc. or such insurance providers any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be
temporarily required to bear these losses. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

We are subject to continuing contingent liabilities as a result of our separation from our former
parent.

As a result of the separation from our former parent, there are several significant areas where the liabilities of our former parent
have or may become our obligations. For example, under the Code and the related rules and regulations, each corporation that was a member of the consolidated U.S. federal income tax return group of
our former parent during a taxable period or portion of a taxable period ending on or before the effective date of the distribution is severally liable for the U.S. federal income tax liability of the
consolidated U.S. federal income tax return group of our former parent for that taxable period. Consequently, if HP Inc. is unable to pay the consolidated U.S. federal income tax liability for
a pre-separation period, we could be required to pay the amount of such tax, which could be substantial and in excess of the amount allocated to us under the tax matters agreement.



Potential liabilities may arise due to fraudulent transfer considerations, which would adversely
affect our financial condition and results of operations.

In connection with the separation and distribution, our former parent undertook several corporate reorganization transactions involving
its subsidiaries which, along with the separation and distribution, may be subject to federal and state fraudulent conveyance and transfer laws. If, under these laws, a court were to determine that,
at the time of the separation and distribution, any entity involved in these reorganization transactions or the separation and distribution:

•

was insolvent;

•

was rendered insolvent by reason of the separation and distribution;

•

had remaining assets constituting unreasonably small capital; or

•

intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay these debts as they matured,

then
the court could void the separation and distribution, in whole or in part, as a fraudulent conveyance or transfer. The court could then require our stockholders to return to HP Inc. some
or all
of the shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise common stock issued in the distribution, or require HP Inc. or Hewlett Packard Enterprise, as the case may be, to fund liabilities of the other
company for the benefit of creditors. The measure of insolvency will vary depending upon the jurisdiction whose law is being applied. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if the
fair value of its assets was less than the amount of its liabilities, or if it incurred debt beyond its ability to repay the debt as it matures.

November 11, 2015, the Board of Directors of Hewlett Packard Enterprise authorized a regular quarterly cash dividend for Hewlett Packard Enterprise's common stock. The Board of
Directors further authorized a regular quarterly cash dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2016, payable on January 6, 2016 to holders of record of its outstanding common stock on
December 9, 2015, in the amount of $0.055 per share. The payment of any dividends in the future, and the timing and amount thereof, is within the discretion of our board of directors. Our board
of directors' decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors, such as our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, restrictive covenants
in our debt, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. Our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ongoing ability
to generate cash from operations and on our access to the capital markets. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to pay a dividend in any future period.

Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities

On February 25, 2015, Hewlett Packard Enterprise issued 1,000 shares of its common stock for the price of $10 to HP Co.
pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. Hewlett Packard Enterprise did not register the issuance of the issued shares under the Securities Act because the issuance did not constitute
a public offering.

On
October 9, 2015 Hewlett Packard Enterprise completed its offering of senior unsecured notes of $14.6 billion through private placement to qualified institutional buyers
pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and to certain non-U.S. persons in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. The
senior unsecured notes issued by Hewlett Packard Enterprise have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

On October 13, 2015, the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Board of Directors announced the authorization of a $3.0 billion
share repurchase program. The Company may choose to repurchase shares when sufficient liquidity exists. This program, which does not have a specific expiration date, authorizes repurchases in the open
market or in private transactions.

ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations

This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") is organized as follows:

•

Overview.

A discussion of our business and overall
analysis of financial and other highlights affecting the Company to provide context for the remainder of MD&A. The overview analysis compares fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2014.

•

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.

A discussion
of accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results.

•

Results of Operations.

An analysis of our financial
results comparing fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 to the prior year period. A discussion of the results of operations at the combined and consolidated level is followed by a discussion of the results of
operations at the segment level.

•

Liquidity and Capital Resources.

An analysis of changes
in our cash flows and a discussion of our financial condition and liquidity.

•

Contractual and Other Obligations.

An overview of
contractual obligations, retirement and post-retirement benefit plan funding, restructuring plans, uncertain tax positions and off-balance sheet arrangements.

We
intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist the reader in understanding our Combined and
Consolidated Financial Statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain
accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our Combined and Consolidated Financial
Statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document.

On
November 1, 2015, HP Inc. (formerly known as "Hewlett-Packard Company" or "HP Co.") spun-off Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company. To effect the spin-off,
HP Inc. distributed all of the shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company common stock owned by HP Inc. to its shareholders on November 1, 2015. Holders of HP Inc. common
stock received one share of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company for every share of HP Inc. stock held as of the record date. As a result of the spin-off, we now operate as an independent,
publicly traded company.

The
following Overview, Results of Operations and Liquidity discussions and analysis compare fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2013, unless otherwise noted. The
Capital Resources and Contractual and Other Obligations discussions present information as of October 31, 2015, unless otherwise noted.

For purposes of this MD&A section, we use the terms "Hewlett Packard Enterprise," "HPE," "the Company," "we," "us" and "our" to refer to Hewlett Packard
Enterprise Company. References in this MD&A section to "Parent" refer to HP Inc., collectively with its consolidated subsidiaries.

OVERVIEW

Hewlett Packard Enterprise is a leading global provider of the cutting-edge technology solutions customers need to optimize their
traditional IT while helping them build the secure, cloud-enabled, mobile-ready future that is uniquely suited to their needs. Our legacy dates back to a partnership

founded
in 1939 by William R. Hewlett and David Packard, and we strive every day to uphold and enhance that legacy through our dedication to providing innovative technological solutions to our
customers. We are a global company with customers ranging from small- and medium-sized businesses ("SMBs") to large global enterprises.

We
organize our business into five segments for financial reporting purposes: the Enterprise Group ("EG"), Enterprise Services ("ES"), Software, Financial Services ("FS") and Corporate
Investments. The following provides an overview of our key financial metrics by segment for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014:

HPE's
combined and consolidated net revenue decreased 5.5% (flat on a constant currency basis) in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. The leading contributors to the net revenue
decrease were unfavorable currency impacts and key account runoff and soft demand in Infrastructure Technology Outsourcing ("ITO") in ES. Partially offsetting these decreases was net revenue growth
within the EG segment from sales of Industry Standard Servers ("ISS"). Gross margin was 28.7% ($14.9 billion) and 28.4% ($15.6 billion) for fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. The
0.3 percentage point increase in gross margin was due primarily to service delivery efficiencies and improvements in underperforming contracts in ES. Partially offsetting the gross margin
increase was a higher mix of ISS products in EG. We continue to experience gross margin pressures resulting from a competitive pricing environment across our hardware portfolio. Operating margin
decreased by 1.3 percentage points in fiscal 2015 due primarily to higher expenses resulting from separation activities, defined benefit plan settlement charges, higher research and development
expense and impairment of data center assets, partially offset by the gross margin increase, lower SG&A expenses and lower restructuring charges.

As
of October 31, 2015, cash and cash equivalents and short- and long-term investments were approximately $10.1 billion, representing an increase of approximately
$7.5 billion from the October 31, 2014 balance of approximately $2.6 billion. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was due to our capitalization plan which anticipated an
allocation of cash from Parent. For fiscal 2015, we generated $3.7 billion of cash flows from operations, we invested $3.0 billion in property, plant and equipment,

net
of proceeds from sales, and we utilized $2.6 billion to acquire 5 companies, the largest of which was Aruba Networks, Inc. ("Aruba"), and received proceeds of $140 million
from divestitures.

Trends and Uncertainties

We are in the process of addressing many challenges facing our business. One set of challenges relates to dynamic and accelerating
market trends, such as the market shift to cloud-related IT infrastructure, software and services, and the growth in software-as-a-service ("SaaS") business models. Certain of our legacy hardware
businesses face challenges as customers migrate to cloud-based offerings and reduce their purchases of hardware products. Additionally, our legacy software business derives a large portion of its
revenues from upfront license sales, some of which over time can be expected to shift to SaaS. Another set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape. Our major competitors are
expanding their product and service offerings with integrated products and solutions, our business-specific competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering
new markets, our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models, and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others. A third
set of challenges relates to business model changes and our go-to-market execution.

The
macroeconomic weakness we have experienced has moderated in some geographic regions but remains an overall challenge. A discussion of some of these challenges at the segment level is
set forth below.

•

In EG, we are experiencing challenges due to multiple market trends, including the increasing demand for hyperscale computing
infrastructure products, the transition to cloud computing and a highly competitive pricing environment. In addition, demand for our Business Critical Systems ("BCS") products continues to weaken as
has the overall market for UNIX products. The effect of lower BCS and traditional storage revenue along with a higher mix of ISS density optimized server products and midrange converged storage
solutions is impacting support attach opportunities in Technology Services ("TS"). To be successful in overcoming these challenges, we must address business model shifts and go-to-market execution
challenges, while continuing to pursue new product innovation that builds on our existing capabilities in areas such as cloud and data center computing, software-defined networking, storage, blade
servers and wireless networking.

•

In ES, we are facing challenges, including managing the revenue runoff from several large contracts, pressured public sector spending,
a competitive pricing environment and market pressures from a mixed economic recovery in Europe, the Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"). We are also experiencing commoditization in the IT infrastructure
services market that is placing pressure on traditional ITO pricing and cost structures. There is also an industry-wide shift to highly automated, asset-light delivery of IT infrastructure and
applications leading to headcount consolidation. To be successful in addressing these challenges, we must execute on the ES multi-year turnaround plan, which includes a cost reduction initiative to
align our costs to our revenue trajectory, a focus on new logo wins and Strategic Enterprise Services ("SES") and initiatives to improve execution in sales performance and accountability, contracting
practices and pricing.

•

In Software, we are facing challenges, including the market shift to SaaS and go-to-market execution challenges. To be successful in
addressing these challenges, we must improve our go-to-market execution with multiple product delivery models which better address customer



HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

needs
and achieve broader integration across our overall product portfolio as we work to capitalize on important market opportunities in cloud, big data and security.

To
address these challenges, we continue to pursue innovation with a view towards developing new products and services aligned with market demand, industry trends and the needs of our
customers and partners. In addition, we need to continue to improve our operations, with a particular focus on enhancing our end-to-end processes and efficiencies. We also need to continue to optimize
our sales coverage models, align our sales incentives with our strategic goals, improve channel execution, strengthen our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus, and develop and capitalize on
market opportunities.

For
a further discussion of trends, uncertainties and other factors that could impact our operating results, see the section entitled "Risk Factors" in Item 1A, which is
incorporated herein by reference.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

General

The Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP"), which requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of
contingent liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure
of these estimates with the Audit Committee of Parent's Board of Directors. Management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting amounts are reasonable; however, actual results
may differ from these estimates. Making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control.
Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

A
summary of significant accounting policies is included in Note 1, "Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies", to the Combined and Consolidated Financial
Statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is
made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. Management believes the
following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services are rendered, the sales price
or fee is fixed or determinable and
collectability is reasonably assured, as well as when other revenue recognition principles are met, including industry-specific revenue recognition guidance.

We
enter into contracts to sell our products and services, and while many of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions, there are agreements we enter into which contain
non-standard



HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

terms
and conditions. Further, many of our arrangements include multiple elements. As a result, significant contract interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting, including
the identification of deliverables considered to be separate units of accounting, the allocation of the transaction price among elements in the arrangement and the timing of revenue recognition for
each of those elements.

We
recognize revenue for delivered elements as separate units of accounting when the delivered elements have standalone value to the customer. For elements with no standalone value, we
recognize revenue consistent with the pattern of the undelivered elements. If the arrangement includes a customer-negotiated refund or return right or other contingency relative to the delivered items
and the delivery and performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within our control, the delivered element constitutes a separate unit of accounting. In arrangements
with combined units of accounting, changes in the allocation of the transaction price among elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition for the contract but will not change the total revenue
recognized for the contract.

We
establish the selling prices used for each deliverable based on vendor-specific objective evidence ("VSOE") of selling price, if available, third-party evidence ("TPE"), if VSOE of
selling price is not available, or estimated selling price ("ESP"), if neither VSOE of selling price nor TPE is available. We establish VSOE of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable
when sold separately and, in rare instances, using the price established by management having the relevant authority. TPE of selling price is established by evaluating largely similar and
interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. ESP is established based on management's judgment considering internal factors such as margin
objectives, pricing practices and controls, customer segment pricing strategies and the product life-cycle. Consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and
industry technology life-cycles. We may modify or develop new go-to-market practices in the future, which may result in changes in selling prices, impacting both VSOE of selling price and ESP. In most
arrangements with multiple elements, the transaction price is allocated to the individual units of accounting at inception of the arrangement based on their relative selling price. However, the
aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of the transaction price to deliverables in multiple element arrangements entered into in future periods. This may change the pattern and
timing of revenue recognition for identical arrangements executed in future periods, but will not change the total revenue recognized for any given arrangement.

We
reduce revenue for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings, including price protection, rebates, promotions, other volume-based incentives and expected returns.
Future market conditions and product transitions may require us to take actions to increase customer incentive offerings, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the
incentive is offered. For certain incentive programs, we estimate the number of customers expected to redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the
incentive.

For
hardware products, we recognize revenue generated from direct sales to end customers and indirect sales to channel partners (including resellers, distributors and value-added
solution providers) when the revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. For indirect sales to channel partners, we recognize revenue at the time of delivery when the channel partner has economic
substance apart from the Company and the Company has completed its obligations related to the sale.

For
the various software products we sell (e.g., big data analytics and applications, application delivery management, enterprise security and IT operations management), we assess
whether the



HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

software
products were sold on a standalone basis or with hardware products. If the software sold with a hardware product is not essential to the functionality of the hardware product and is more-than
incidental, we treat it as a software deliverable.

We
recognize revenue from the sale of perpetual software licenses at inception of the license term, assuming all revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. Term-based software
license revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the license. We use the residual method to allocate revenue to software licenses at inception of the arrangement when VSOE of fair
value for all undelivered elements, such as post-contract customer support, exists and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. Revenue from maintenance and unspecified upgrades or
updates provided on a when-and-if-available basis is recognized ratably over the period during which such items are delivered.

For
hosting or SaaS arrangements, we recognize revenue as the service is delivered, generally on a straight-line basis, over the contractual period of performance. In hosting
arrangements, we consider the rights provided to the customer (e.g. whether the customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period
without significant penalty and the feasibility of the customer to operate or contract with another vendor to operate the software) in determining whether the arrangement includes the sale of a
software license. In hosting arrangements where software licenses are sold, license revenue is generally recognized according to whether perpetual or term licenses are sold, when all other revenue
recognition criteria are satisfied.

We
recognize revenue from fixed-price support or maintenance contracts, including extended warranty contracts and software post-contract customer support agreements, ratably over the
contract period. For certain fixed-price contracts, such as consulting arrangements, we recognize revenue as work progresses using a proportional performance method. We estimate the total expected
labor costs in order to determine the amount of revenue earned to date. We apply a proportional performance method because reasonably dependable estimates of the labor costs applicable to various
stages of a contract can be made. On fixed-price contracts for design and build projects (to design, develop and construct software infrastructure and systems), we recognize revenue as work progresses
using the percentage-of-completion method. We use the cost-to-cost method to measure progress toward completion as determined by the percentage of costs incurred to date compared to the total
estimated costs of the project. Total project costs are subject to revision throughout the life of a fixed-price contract. Provisions for estimated losses on fixed-price contracts are recognized in
the period when such losses become known and are recorded as a component of cost of sales. In circumstances when reasonable and reliable cost estimates for a project cannot be made we recognize
revenue using the completed contract method.

Outsourcing
services revenue is generally recognized in the period when the service is provided and the amount earned is not contingent on the occurrence of any future event. We
recognize revenue using an objective measure of output for per unit-priced contracts. Revenue for fixed-price outsourcing contracts with periodic billings is recognized on a straight-line basis if the
service is provided evenly over the contract term. Provisions for estimated losses on outsourcing arrangements are recognized in the period when such losses become probable and estimable and are
recorded as a component of cost of sales.

Warranty

We accrue the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue. We evaluate our warranty obligations on a product
group basis. Our standard product warranty terms generally



HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

include
post-sales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of time. While we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes,
including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers, we base our estimated warranty obligation on contractual warranty terms, repair costs, product call rates, average
cost per call, current period product shipments and ongoing product failure rates, as well as specific product class failure outside of our baseline experience. Warranty terms generally range from one
to
five years for parts and labor, depending upon the product. Over the last three fiscal years, the annual warranty expense has averaged approximately 2.4% of annual net product revenue.

Restructuring

We have engaged in restructuring actions which require management to estimate the timing and amount of severance and other employee
separation costs for workforce reduction and enhanced early retirement programs, the fair value of assets made redundant or obsolete, and the fair value of lease cancellation and other exit costs. We
accrue for severance and other employee separation costs under these actions when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable. The rates used in determining
severance accruals are based on existing plans, historical experiences and negotiated settlements. For a full description of our restructuring actions, refer to our discussions of restructuring in
"Results of Operations" below and in Note 3, "Restructuring", to the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements.

Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefits

Our pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions. Our major assumptions relate
primarily to discount rates, mortality rates, expected increases in compensation levels and the expected long-term return on plan assets. The discount rate assumption is based on current investment
yields of high-quality fixed-income securities with maturities similar to the expected benefits payment period. Mortality rates help predict the expected life of plan participants and are based on a
historical demographic study of the plan. The expected increase in the compensation levels assumption reflects our long-term actual experience and future expectations. The expected long-term return on
plan assets is determined based on asset allocations, historical portfolio results, historical asset correlations and management's expected returns for each asset class. In any fiscal year,
significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected long-term return on plan assets. Historically, differences between the actual return and expected long-term return on plan
assets have resulted from changes in target or actual asset allocation, short-term performance relative to expected long-term performance, and to a lesser extent, differences between target and actual
investment allocations, the timing of benefit payments compared to expectations, and the use of derivatives intended to effect asset allocation changes or hedge certain investment or liability
exposures.

Our
major assumptions vary by plan, and the weighted-average rates used are set forth in Note 4, "Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans", to the Combined and Consolidated
Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. The following table provides the impact changes in the weighted-average assumptions of discount rates, the expected increase in
compensation levels

Taxes on Earnings

Our operations have historically been included in the tax returns filed by the respective Parent entities of which our businesses are a
part. Income tax expense and other income tax related information contained in our Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements are
presented on a separate return basis as if we filed our own tax returns. The separate return method applies the accounting guidance for income taxes to the standalone financial statements as if we
were a separate taxpayer and a standalone enterprise for the periods presented. The calculation of our income taxes on a separate return basis requires a considerable amount of judgment and use of
both estimates and allocations. For the tax years 2014 and prior, current income tax liabilities related to entities which file jointly with Parent are assumed to be immediately settled with Parent
and are relieved through the Parent company investment account and the Net transfers to Parent in the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of October 31, 2015, the current
income tax liabilities will be settled by Hewlett Packard Enterprise.

We
calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the final positions reflected in Parent's income tax returns. We adjust our
current and deferred tax provisions based on Parent's income tax returns which are generally filed in the third or fourth quarters of the subsequent fiscal year.

We
recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts
using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse.

We
record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, we consider
future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event we were to
determine that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, we would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a
corresponding charge to earnings or other comprehensive income in the period in which we make such a determination. Likewise, if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the
deferred tax assets, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate
sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located.

Our
effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided for U.S. federal taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings
indefinitely outside the U.S. We plan distributions of foreign earnings based on projected cash flow needs as well as the

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

working
capital and long-term investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations. Based on these assumptions, we estimate the amount we expect to indefinitely invest
outside the U.S. and the amounts we expect to distribute to the U.S. and provide for the U.S. federal
taxes due on amounts expected to be distributed to the U.S. Further, as a result of certain employment actions and capital investments we have undertaken, income from manufacturing activities in
certain jurisdictions is subject to reduced tax rates and, in some cases, is wholly exempt from taxes for fiscal years through 2024. Material changes in our estimates of cash, working capital and
long-term investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact how future earnings are repatriated to the U.S., and our related future effective tax rate.

We
are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and approximately 105 other countries, and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions. We believe
that positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported, but tax authorities may challenge these positions, which may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities.
Accordingly, our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges. Determining the income tax provision for these potential assessments and
recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates. The amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in
our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our income tax provision, net income and cash flows. Our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to
uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international operations, including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions, intercompany transactions and related interest. For a
further discussion on taxes on earnings, refer to Note 6, "Taxes on Earnings", to the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements.

Inventory

We state our inventory at the lower of cost or market on a first-in, first-out basis. We make adjustments to reduce the cost of
inventory to its net realizable value at the product group level for estimated excess or obsolescence. Factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand, technological changes, product
life-cycle and development plans, component cost trends, product pricing, physical deterioration and quality issues.

Business Combinations

We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired, including in-process research and development ("IPR&D"),
liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests in the acquiree generally based on their fair values at the acquisition date. IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset
with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When the IPR&D project is complete, it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated
useful life. If an IPR&D project is abandoned, we will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to our Combined and Consolidated Statement of Earnings in the period it is
abandoned. The excess of the fair value of
purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling interests in the acquiree is recorded as goodwill.

When
determining the fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests in the acquiree, management makes significant estimates and assumptions,
especially with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flows, which includes consideration of future growth
rates and margins, attrition rates, future changes in technology and brand awareness, loyalty and position, and discount



HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

rates.
Fair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. Amounts recorded in a business combination may change
during the measurement period, which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available.

Goodwill

We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may
not be recoverable. We are permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. For our annual goodwill
impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, we perform a quantitative test for each of our reporting units.

Goodwill
is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. As of October 31, 2015, our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in Note 2,
"Segment Information", to the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements, except for ES, which includes two reporting units: (1) MphasiS Limited and (2) the remainder of ES. In the
first step of the goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of fair values
derived most significantly from the income approach and, to a lesser extent, the market approach. Under the income approach, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value
of estimated future cash flows. Cash flow projections are based on management's estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market conditions. The
discount rate used is based on the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit's
ability to execute on the projected cash flows. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly traded
companies with operating and investment characteristics
similar to the reporting unit. We weight the fair value derived from the market approach depending on the level of comparability of these publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. When market
comparables are not meaningful or not available, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using only the income approach. For the MphasiS Limited reporting unit, we utilized the quoted market
price in an active market to estimate fair value. A significant and sustained decline in our stock price could provide evidence of a need to record a goodwill impairment charge.

Estimating
the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue
growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions and the determination of appropriate comparable
publicly traded companies. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units to determine the carrying amount of each
reporting unit.

If
the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required. If the
fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. In the second step,
the reporting unit's assets, including any unrecognized intangible assets, liabilities and non-controlling interests are measured at fair value in a hypothetical analysis to calculate the implied fair
value of goodwill for the reporting unit in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is less
than its carrying amount, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss.



HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

Our annual goodwill impairment analysis, which we performed as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, did not result in any impairment charges.
The excess of fair value over carrying amount for our reporting units ranged from 19% to approximately 120% of carrying amounts. The Software reporting unit has the lowest excess of fair value over
carrying amount at 19%.

In
order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair value of each
reporting unit. This hypothetical 10% decrease resulted in an excess of fair value over carrying amount for our reporting units ranging from 7% to approximately 100% of the carrying amounts with the
Software reporting unit having the lowest excess of fair value over carrying amount of 7%. The fair value of the Software reporting unit is estimated using a weighting of both the income and market
approaches. Our Software business is facing multiple challenges including the market shift to SaaS and go-to-market execution challenges. If we are not successful in addressing these challenges, our
projected revenue growth rates could decline resulting in a decrease in the fair value of the Software reporting unit. The fair value of the Software reporting unit could also be negatively impacted
by declines in market multiples of revenue for comparable publicly traded companies, a higher discount rate driven by higher interest rates, changes in management's business strategy or significant
and sustained declines in our stock price following the separation, any of which could result in an indicator of impairment.

Intangible Assets

We review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount
of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of our finite-lived intangible assets is assessed based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual
disposition of the asset. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount, the finite-lived intangible assets are considered to be impaired. The amount of the impairment loss,
if any, is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value. We estimate the fair value of finite-lived intangible assets by using an income approach or, when
available and appropriate, using a market approach.

Fair Value of Derivative Instruments

We use derivative instruments to manage a variety of risks, including risks related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest
rates. We use forwards, swaps and options to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. At October 31,
2015, the gross notional amount of our derivative portfolio was $29.5 billion. Assets and liabilities related to derivative instruments are measured at fair value, and were $819 million
and $192 million, respectively, as of October 31, 2015.

Fair
value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In the absence of
active markets for identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and, in the absence of such data, internal information that is
consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date. The determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about
assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums, identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions, weighting those
differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to the asset or liability being valued. We generally use industry
standard valuation models to measure the fair value of our



HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

derivative
positions. When prices in active markets are not available for an identical asset or liability, we use industry standard valuation models to measure fair value. Where applicable, these
models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to present value using market based observable inputs, including interest rate curves, Company and counterparty credit risk, foreign
currency exchange rates, and forward and spot prices.

For
a further discussion of fair value measurements and derivative instruments, refer to Note 11, "Fair Value" and Note 12, "Financial Instruments", respectively, to the
Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements.

Loss Contingencies

We are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings including those consisting of IP, commercial, securities,
employment, employee benefits and environmental matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been
incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability of having incurred a liability and the estimated amount of the
liability. We review these matters at least quarterly and adjust these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other updated information
and events, pertaining to a particular case. Based on our experience, we believe that any damage amounts claimed in the specific litigation and contingencies matters further discussed in
Note 17, "Litigation and Contingencies", to the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements are not a meaningful indicator of the Company's potential liability. Litigation is inherently
unpredictable. However, we believe we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us. Nevertheless, cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any
particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies. We believe we have recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and, as of October 31, 2015, it was not
reasonably possible that a material loss had been incurred in connection with such matters in excess of the amounts recognized in our financial statements.

ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

For a summary of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our Combined and Consolidated financial statements see Note 1,
"Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies", to the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Revenue from our international operations has historically represented, and we expect will continue to represent, a majority of our
overall net revenue. As a result, our revenue growth has been impacted, and we expect will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to provide a framework
for assessing performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we present the year-over-year percentage change in revenue on a constant currency basis, which assumes no change in
foreign currency exchange rates from the prior-year period and doesn't adjust for any repricing or demand impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This information is provided so that
revenue can be viewed without the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which is consistent with how management evaluates our revenue results and trends. This constant currency
disclosure is provided in addition to, and not as a substitute

Fiscal 2015 compared with Fiscal 2014

In fiscal 2015, total HPE net revenue decreased 5.5% (flat on a constant currency basis) as compared with fiscal 2014. U.S. net revenue
decreased 3.7% to $20.1 billion, while net revenue from outside of the U.S. decreased 6.6% to $32.0 billion.



HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

From
a segment perspective, the primary factors contributing to the change in total Company net revenue are summarized as follows:

•

ES net revenue decreased due primarily to unfavorable currency impacts, revenue runoff in key accounts and weak growth in new and
existing accounts;

•

Software net revenue decreased due primarily to unfavorable currency impacts and declines in license revenue;

•

FS net revenue decreased due to unfavorable currency impacts led primarily by weakness in the euro, and lower asset management
activity primarily in customer buyouts; and

•

EG net revenue increased due primarily to growth in ISS and revenue resulting from our acquisition of Aruba in May 2015.

Fiscal 2014 compared with Fiscal 2013

In fiscal 2014, total HPE net revenue decreased 3.9% (decreased 3.7% on a constant currency basis) as compared with fiscal 2013. U.S.
net revenue decreased 7.5% to $20.8 billion, while net revenue from outside of the U.S. decreased 1.6% to $34.3 billion.

From
a segment perspective, the primary factors contributing to the change in total Company net revenue are summarized as follows:

•

ES net revenue decreased due primarily to revenue runoff in key accounts, soft demand for Infrastructure Technology Outsourcing, weak
growth in new and existing accounts, particularly in EMEA, and contractual price declines;

•

EG net revenue decreased due to net revenue decreases in TS, BCS and Storage;

•

FS net revenue decreased due primarily to lower portfolio revenue from lower average portfolio assets and lower asset management
activity, primarily in customer buyouts; and

•

Software net revenue decreased due to lower net revenue from licenses, support and professional services.

A
more detailed discussion of segment revenue is included under "Segment Information" below.

Gross Margin

Fiscal 2015 compared with Fiscal 2014

HPE's gross margin increased by 0.3 percentage points for fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal 2014. From a segment
perspective, the primary factors impacting gross margin performance are summarized as follows:

•

ES gross margin increased due primarily to service delivery efficiencies and improving profit performance in under-performing
contracts;

•

EG gross margin decreased due primarily to a higher revenue mix of ISS products, unfavorable currency impacts and competitive pricing;

•

FS gross margin decreased due to unfavorable currency impacts, lower margin in customer buyouts, and lower portfolio margin due to
competitive pricing; and

•

Software gross margin decreased due to a lower mix of license revenue.



HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

Fiscal 2014 compared with Fiscal 2013

HPE's gross margin increased by 1.0 percentage point for fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal 2013. From a segment perspective, the
primary factors impacting gross margin performance are summarized as follows:

•

ES gross margin increased due primarily to our continued focus on service delivery efficiencies and improving profit performance in
underperforming contracts;

•

Software gross margin increased due to the shift to more profitable contracts and improved workforce utilization in professional
services;

•

FS gross margin increased due to a higher portfolio margin, primarily from lower bad debt expense, a lower cost of funds and improved
margins in remarketing sales; and

•

EG gross margin decreased due primarily to the impact of a higher mix of ISS products, a lower mix of BCS products and competitive
pricing pressure.

A
more detailed discussion of segment gross margins and operating margins is included under "Segment Information" below.

Operating Expenses

Research and Development

R&D
expense increased for both compare periods as we make investments in our strategic focus areas of cloud, security, big data and mobility.

R&D
expense increased by 6% in fiscal 2015 due primarily to increases in Networking (due in part to the acquisition of Aruba) and Technology Services in the EG segment and in Hewlett
Packard Labs, partially offset by favorable currency impacts.

R&D
expense increased 12% in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 with increases across each of our segments.

Selling, General and Administrative

SG&A
expense decreased 8% for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 due primarily to favorable currency impacts and declines in go-to-market costs as a result
of lower
commissions and productivity initiatives. The decrease was partially offset by higher administrative expenses due to expenses in the period from Aruba and indirect separation related activities.

SG&A
expense increased 1% in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 due primarily to higher compensation costs and higher selling costs from investments in the areas of cloud, networking
and storage, partially offset by a gain from the sale of real estate.

Amortization of Intangible Assets

Amortization
expense decreased in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 due primarily to certain intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions reaching
the end of their respective amortization periods partially offset by amortization expense from intangible assets resulting from the Aruba acquisition.

Amortization
expense decreased in fiscal 2014 due primarily to certain intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions reaching the end of their respective amortization periods.



HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

Restructuring Charges

Restructuring
charges decreased in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 due primarily to lower charges from the multi-year restructuring plan initially
announced in May 2012 (the "2012 Plan") partially offset by charges from the restructuring plan we announced in September 2015 (the "2015 Plan") which is in connection with our separation from Parent.

Restructuring
charges increased in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 due primarily to higher charges in connection with the multi-year restructuring plan initially announced in May
2012 (the "2012 Plan") and from increases to the 2012 Plan announced in fiscal 2014.

Acquisition and Other Related Charges

Acquisition and other related charges increased in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, due primarily to charges resulting from the
acquisition of Aruba, including a non-cash inventory fair value adjustment charge.

Separation Costs

Separation costs for fiscal 2015 were primarily related to third-party consulting, contractor fees and other incremental costs.

Defined Benefit Plan Settlement Charges

Defined benefit plan settlement charges in fiscal 2015 were related to U.S. defined benefit plan settlement expense and net periodic
benefit cost resulting from Parent's voluntary lump sum program announced in January 2015.

Impairment of Data Center Assets

Impairment of data center assets in fiscal 2015 resulted from our exit from several ES data centers.

Interest and Other, Net

Interest and other, net expense decreased by $38 million in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 due to lower interest expense
from lower average borrowings and a decrease in miscellaneous other expense.

Interest
and other, net expense increased by $10 million in fiscal 2014. The increase was due primarily to lower gains on sales of investments, partially offset by lower net
earnings attributable to non-controlling interests in fiscal 2014.

Provision for Taxes

Our effective tax rates were (67.4)%, 26.6% and 28.6% in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our effective tax rate generally
differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due to favorable tax rates associated with certain earnings from our operations in lower tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The jurisdictions
with favorable tax rates that had the most significant effective tax rate impact in the periods presented were Puerto Rico, Singapore and China. We plan to reinvest certain earnings of these
jurisdictions indefinitely outside the U.S. and therefore have not provided for U.S. taxes on those indefinitely reinvested earnings.



HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

In
fiscal 2015, we recorded $1.6 billion of net income tax benefits related to items unique to the year. These amounts primarily included $1.8 billion of income tax
benefits related to a release of valuation allowances pertaining to certain U.S. deferred tax assets, $447 million of income tax benefits related to restructuring and separation related costs
and $131 million of income tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions, the effects of which were partially offset by $486 million of tax charges to record valuation allowances on
certain foreign deferred tax assets and $217 million of income tax charges related to state tax impacts of the separation of deferred taxes under the Separate Return Method.

In
fiscal 2014, we recorded $113 million of net income tax benefits related to items unique to the year. These amounts included $66 million of income tax benefits related
to provision to return adjustments and $35 million of income tax benefits related to state rate changes.

In
fiscal 2013, we recorded $283 million of net income tax charges related to items unique to the year. These amounts included $231 million of income tax charges for
adjustments related to uncertain tax positions and $54 million related to the settlement of tax audit matters.

For
a reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and further explanation of our provision for taxes, see Note 6, "Taxes on Earnings", to
the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements.

Segment Information

A description of the products and services for each segment can be found in Note 2, "Segment Information", to the Combined and
Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. Future changes to this organizational structure may result in changes to the segments disclosed.

In
connection with a strategic review of its software business by Parent prior to our separation, the marketing optimization software product group, a business which was historically
managed by us and is included in our Software segment financial information prior to the effective date, was retained by HP Inc. following the separation. The strategic review determined that
these software assets no longer aligned with the software business' strategic charter as they were outside the go-to-market focus of selling to IT departments.

Fiscal 2015 compared with Fiscal 2014

EG net revenue increased 0.6% (increased 6.2% on a constant currency basis) in fiscal 2015. The increase in EG net revenue was due
primarily to growth in ISS and from our acquisition of Aruba in May 2015, partially offset primarily by unfavorable currency impacts led by the euro and a net revenue decline in TS. We continue to
experience challenges due to market trends, including the transition to cloud computing, as well as product and technology transitions, along with a highly competitive pricing environment.

ISS
net revenue increased 8% as a result of higher average unit prices ("AUPs) and unit volume growth. The increase in AUP's was across the server portfolio, primarily driven by higher
option attach rates for memory, processors and hard drives and a mix shift to high-end new generation HPE ProLiant servers. The unit volume growth was primarily due to shipment increases in rack and
density optimized server products. Networking net revenue increased 8% due primarily to revenue from Aruba, which resulted in higher revenue from wireless local area network ("WLAN") products, the
effect of which was partially offset by competitive pricing pressures particularly in the China market. Storage net revenue decreased 4% as a result of a decline in traditional storage products, the
effect of which was partially offset by growth in Converged Storage solutions from 3PAR StoreServ products, particularly All-flash arrays, and StoreOnce. BCS net revenue decreased 13% largely as a
result of contraction in the overall UNIX market. TS net revenue decreased 9% due primarily to a reduction in support for BCS and traditional storage products along with lower revenue from consulting
services, the effects of which were partially offset by growth in HPE Data Center Care and HPE Proactive Care support solutions.

In
fiscal 2015, EG earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 0.1 percentage point due to a decrease in gross margin partially offset by a decrease in
operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The decrease in gross margin was due primarily to a higher revenue mix of ISS products and unfavorable currency impacts and competitive pricing, the
effects of which were partially offset by improved cost management, improved pricing in Storage and a higher gross margin contribution in Networking from Aruba. The decrease in operating expenses as a

percentage
of net revenue was due primarily to favorable currency impacts partially offset by expenses in the period from Aruba.

Fiscal 2014 compared with Fiscal 2013

EG net revenue decreased 0.9% (decreased 0.5% on a constant currency basis) in fiscal 2014. In EG, we continued to experience revenue
challenges due to market trends, including the transition to cloud computing, as well as product and technology transitions, along with a highly competitive pricing environment. The decline in EG net
revenue was due to net revenue declines in TS, BCS and Storage partially offset by net revenue growth in ISS and Networking.

TS
net revenue decreased 4% due primarily to a continued reduction in support for BCS, traditional storage products and lower support in networking services, partially offset by growth
in support solutions for Converged Storage solutions and ISS. BCS net revenue decreased 22% as a result of ongoing pressures from the overall UNIX market contraction. Storage net revenue decreased by
5% as we continue to experience multiple challenges including product transitions from traditional storage products which include our tape, storage networking and legacy external disk products, to
converged solutions, which include our 3PAR StoreServ, StoreOnce, and StoreVirtual products, other challenges include market weakness in high end converged solutions and sales execution challenges,
the effects of which were partially offset by revenue growth in our Converged Storage solutions. Networking net revenue increased 4% due to higher switching product revenue as a result of growth in
our data center products, partially offset by lower revenue from WLAN products. ISS net revenue increased by 3% due primarily to higher volume and higher average unit prices in rack and blade server
products driven by higher option attach rates for memory, processors and hard drives.

EG
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 0.7 percentage points in fiscal 2014 due to a decrease in gross margin coupled with an increase in
operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The gross margin decline was due primarily to a higher mix of ISS products, a lower mix of BCS products and competitive pricing pressures, partially
offset by supply chain cost optimization and improved cost management. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was driven by higher R&D investments, partially offset by
continued cost savings associated with our ongoing restructuring efforts.

Fiscal 2015 compared with Fiscal 2014

ES net revenue decreased 11.6% (decreased 5.7% on a constant currency basis) in fiscal 2015. Performance in ES remained challenged by
the impact of several large contracts winding down. The net revenue decrease in ES was due primarily to unfavorable currency impacts, revenue runoff in key accounts and weak growth in new and existing
accounts, partially offset by growth in our SES portfolio which includes analytics and data management, security and cloud services. Net revenue in ITO decreased by 14% in fiscal 2015 due to
unfavorable currency impacts, revenue runoff in key accounts and weak growth in new and existing accounts, particularly in EMEA in the first half of fiscal 2015, partially offset by growth in SES
revenue in the second half of fiscal 2015. Net revenue in Application and Business Services ("ABS") declined by 8% in fiscal 2015, due to unfavorable currency impacts and weak growth in new and
existing accounts in the first half of fiscal 2015, partially offset by growth in SES revenue in the second half of fiscal 2015.

ES
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased 1.4 percentage points in fiscal 2015. The increase in operating margin was due to an increase in gross margin
and a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. Gross margin increased due primarily to service delivery efficiencies and improving profit performance in underperforming
contracts. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was primarily driven by lower field selling costs, which was due to favorable currency impacts and our sales transformation
initiatives.

Fiscal 2014 compared with Fiscal 2013

ES net revenue decreased 7.0% (decreased 6.9% on a constant currency basis) in fiscal 2014. Performance in ES remained challenged by
the impact of several large contracts winding down and lower public sector spending in EMEA, particularly in the United Kingdom. The net revenue decrease in ES was due primarily to revenue runoff in
key accounts, weak growth in new and existing accounts, particularly in EMEA, and contractual price declines. These effects were partially offset by net revenue growth in our SES portfolio, which
includes information management and analytics, security and cloud services. Net revenue in ITO decreased by 8% in fiscal 2014 due to revenue runoff in key accounts, weak growth in new and existing
accounts, particularly in EMEA, and contractual price declines in ongoing contracts partially offset by growth in cloud and security revenue and favorable currency impacts. Net revenue in ABS
decreased by 6% in fiscal 2014, due to revenue runoff in a key account,

weak
growth in new and existing accounts, particularly in EMEA, and unfavorable currency impacts, partially offset by growth in information management and analytics and cloud revenue.

ES
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased 0.4 percentage points in fiscal 2014. The increase in operating margin was due to an increase in gross margin,
partially offset by an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. Gross margin increased due primarily to our continued focus on service delivery efficiencies and improving profit
performance in underperforming contracts, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from revenue runoff in key accounts and weak growth in new and existing accounts. The increase in operating expenses
as a percentage of net revenue was primarily driven by the size of the revenue decline and higher administrative expenses and field selling costs. The increase in administrative expenses was due to
the prior year period containing higher bad debt recoveries and insurance recoveries. The increase in selling costs was the result of expanding the sales force coverage as we transition from a
reactive sales model to a more proactive approach.

Fiscal 2015 compared with Fiscal 2014

Software net revenue decreased 7.9% (decreased 4.1% on a constant currency basis) in fiscal 2015. Revenue growth in Software is being
challenged by the overall market shift to SaaS solutions and related go-to-market sales execution challenges. Additionally, these challenges are impacting growth in license and support revenue. In
fiscal 2015, net revenue growth was negatively impacted by foreign currency fluctuations across all regions, led primarily by weakness in the euro and the impact of the transfer of the marketing
optimization product group. In fiscal 2015, net revenue from licenses, support, professional services and SaaS decreased by 13%, 5%, 9% and 4%, respectively.

The
decrease in license revenue was due primarily to the market shift to SaaS solutions and sales execution challenges and, as a result, we experienced lower revenue in IT operations
management. The decrease in support revenue was due primarily to unfavorable currency impacts, past declines in license revenue and lower revenue due to the transfer of the marketing optimization
product group to Parent effective at the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, partially offset by growth in revenue for security products. Professional services net revenue decreased due
primarily to unfavorable currency impacts, our continued focus on higher-margin engagements and, as a result, we experienced a net revenue decrease in big data solutions, partially offset by net
revenue growth in security products. SaaS
net revenue decreased due primarily to sales execution challenges, which resulted in lower revenue from big data solutions, partially offset by net revenue growth in IT operations management.

In
fiscal 2015, Software earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 0.3 percentage points due to a decrease in gross margin and an increase in operating
expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The decrease in gross margin was due primarily to a lower mix of license revenue. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due to
the size of the

revenue
decline. During the period, operating expense declined due primarily to favorable currency impacts and lower SG&A expenses as a result of lower field selling costs driven by expense
management.

Fiscal 2014 compared with Fiscal 2013

Software net revenue decreased 2.5% (decreased 2.4% on a constant currency basis) in fiscal 2014. Revenue growth in Software was
challenged by the overall market and customer shift to SaaS solutions, which is impacting growth in license and support revenue. In fiscal 2014, net revenue from licenses, support and professional
services decreased by 4%, 2% and 5%, respectively, while SaaS net revenue increased by 5%.

The
decrease in license net revenue was due to the market and customer shift to SaaS solutions, which resulted in lower revenue, primarily from IT management products, partially offset
by strength in some of our key focus areas of big data analytics and security. The decrease in support net revenue was due to declines in prior period license revenue. Professional services net
revenue decreased as we continued our focus on higher margin engagements. These decreases were partially offset by higher SaaS revenue due to improving demand for our SaaS solutions in IT management
and security products.

In
fiscal 2014, Software earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 0.1 percentage point due to an increase in gross margin, partially offset by higher
operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The increase in gross margin was due to the shift to more profitable contracts and improved workforce utilization in professional services. The
increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to investments in R&D, partially offset by
lower SG&A expenses due to cost savings associated with our ongoing restructuring efforts and improved operational expense management.

FS
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 0.2 percentage points in fiscal 2015 due primarily to a decrease in gross margin while operating expense as

portfolio margin due to competitive pricing, the effects of which were partially offset by higher margins from asset recovery services. Operating expense as a percentage of net revenue was flat as a
result of lower SG&A

Fiscal 2014 compared with Fiscal 2013

FS net revenue decreased by 3.6% (decreased 3.3% on a constant currency basis) in fiscal 2014 due primarily to lower portfolio revenue

FS
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 0.2 percentage points in fiscal 2014. The increase was due primarily to an increase in gross margin,
partially offset by an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The increase in gross margin was the result of a higher portfolio margin, primarily from lower bad debt expense
and a lower cost of funds and improved margins in remarketing sales. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to higher go-to-market investments.

Portfolio Assets and Ratios

The FS business model is asset intensive and uses certain internal metrics to measure its performance against other financial services
companies, including a segment balance sheet that is derived from our internal management reporting system. The accounting policies used to derive FS amounts are substantially the same as those used
by the Company. However, intercompany loans and certain accounts that are reflected in the segment balances are eliminated in our Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements.

For both fiscal 2015 and 2014, as compared to the prior-year periods, the increase in the loss from operations was due primarily to higher expenses associated
with cloud-related incubation activities and Hewlett Packard Labs.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity. We believe that internally generated cash flows will be
generally sufficient to support our operating businesses, capital expenditures, restructuring activities, remaining separation costs, maturing debt, interest payments, income tax payments and the
payment of future stockholder dividends, in addition to any future investments and any future share repurchases. We expect to supplement this short-term liquidity, if necessary, by accessing the
capital markets and borrowing under credit facilities made available by various domestic and foreign financial institutions. However, our access to capital markets may be constrained and our cost of
borrowing may increase under certain business, market and economic conditions. For example, under the tax matters agreement entered into in connection with the separation, we will generally be
prohibited, except in specific circumstances, from issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds for a two-year period following the separation. Our liquidity is subject to various risks
including the risks identified in the section entitled "Risk Factors" in Item 1A
and market risks identified in the section entitled "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" in Item 7A, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.

Our
cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world, with substantially all of those amounts held outside of the U.S. We utilize a variety of planning and financing
strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed. Our cash position is strong and we expect that our cash balances, anticipated cash flow generated
from operations and access to capital markets will be sufficient to cover our expected near-term cash outlays.

Amounts
held outside of the U.S. are generally utilized to support non-U.S. liquidity needs, although a portion of those amounts may from time to time be subject to short-term
intercompany loans into the U.S. Most of the amounts held outside of the U.S. could be repatriated to the U.S. but, under current law, some would be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, less
applicable foreign tax credits. Repatriation of some foreign earnings is restricted by local law. Except for foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S., we have
provided for the U.S. federal tax liability on these earnings for financial statement purposes. Repatriation could result in additional income tax payments in future years. Where local restrictions
prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds, our intent is that cash balances would remain outside of the U.S. and we would meet liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows, external
borrowings, or both. We do not expect restrictions or potential taxes incurred on repatriation of amounts held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial
condition or results of operations.

On
October 13, 2015, our Board of Directors announced a $3.0 billion share repurchase program. The number of shares that we repurchase under the share repurchase program
may vary depending on numerous factors, including share price, liquidity and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash,
such as acquisition activity, general economic or business conditions and board and management discretion. Additionally, our share repurchase activity, if any, during any particular period may
fluctuate. We may commence, accelerate, suspend, delay or discontinue any share repurchase activity any time, without notice. This program does not have a specific expiration date.

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $3.3 billion for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 due primarily to
the impact from a four day reduction in the cash conversion cycle in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 as compared to a thirteen day reduction in the cash conversion cycle in fiscal 2014 as
compared to fiscal 2013, and lower cash from financing receivables. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $1.8 billion for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 due primarily
to higher cash payments for accrued expenses and lower net earnings, partially offset by a reduction in the cash conversion cycle.

Days
of sales outstanding in accounts receivable ("DSO") measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding. DSO is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable,
net of allowance for doubtful accounts, by a 90-day average of net revenue. For fiscal 2015 as compared to the prior-year period the increase in DSO was due to unfavorable payment linearity and longer

standard
payment terms for Aruba. For fiscal 2014 as compared to the prior-year period, the decrease in DSO was due primarily to improved accounts receivable management and the impact of currency.

Days
of supply in inventory ("DOS") measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product. DOS is calculated by dividing ending inventory by a 90-day average of
cost of goods sold. For fiscal 2015, the increase in DOS was due to higher inventory to support service levels. For fiscal 2014 and 2013, DOS remained generally consistent.

Days
of purchases outstanding in accounts payable ("DPO") measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding. DPO is calculated by dividing ending accounts
payable by a 90-day average of cost of goods sold. For fiscal 2015 as compared to the prior-year period and for fiscal 2014 as compared to the prior-year period, the increase in DPO as compared to the
prior-year periods was primarily the result of an extension of payment terms with our suppliers.

The
cash conversion cycle is the sum of DSO and DOS less DPO. Items which may cause the cash conversion cycle in a particular period to differ include, but are not limited to, changes in
business mix, changes in payment terms, the extent of receivables factoring, seasonal trends and the timing of revenue recognition and inventory purchases within the period.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities increased by $2.4 billion for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 due primarily to the
acquisition of Aruba. Net cash used in investing activities increased by $747 million in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 due primarily to higher cash utilization for purchases of
property, plant and equipment, net of proceeds from sales.

Financing Activities

Cash flows from financing activities for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 primarily represent Net transfers from (to) Parent and net payments
on debt. As cash and the financing of our operations have historically been managed by Parent, the components of Net transfers from (to) Parent include cash transfers from us to Parent and payments by
Parent to settle our obligations. These transactions are considered to be effectively settled for cash at the time the transaction is recorded.

proceeds
of $14.5 billion from the senior notes offering were distributed to HP Inc. to redeem or repurchase certain of its outstanding notes and to facilitate the separation of Hewlett
Packard Enterprise from HP Inc. For fiscal 2014 and 2013, debt levels reflect only those debt balances which were the legal obligation of the subsidiaries comprising the businesses of the
Company. For more information on our borrowings, see Note 13, "Borrowings", to the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Our
weighted-average interest rate reflects the effective interest rate on our borrowings prevailing during the period and reflects the effect of interest rate swaps. For more
information on our interest rate swaps, see Note 11, "Financial Instruments", to the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Revolving Credit Facility

On November 1, 2015, the Company entered into a revolving credit facility (the "Credit Agreement"), together with the lenders
named therein, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ("JPMorgan"), as co-administrative agent and administrative processing agent, and Citibank, N.A., as co-administrative agent, providing for a senior, unsecured
revolving credit facility with aggregate lending commitments of $4.0 billion. Loans under the revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes. Commitments under the Credit
Agreement are available for a period of five years, which period may be extended, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, by up to two one-year periods. Commitment fees, interest rates and
other terms of borrowing under the credit facility vary based on Hewlett Packard Enterprise's external credit rating.

Available Borrowing Resources

As of October 31, 2015, we had the following resources available to obtain short- or long-term financing if we need additional

(1)

Amounts
represent the principal cash payments relating to our long-term debt and do not include any fair value adjustments, discounts or
premiums.

(2)

Amounts
represent the expected interest payments relating to our long-term debt. We have outstanding interest rate swap agreements accounted
for as fair value hedges that have the economic effect of changing fixed interest rates associated with some of our U.S. Dollar Senior Notes to variable interest rates. The impact of our outstanding
interest rate swaps at October 31, 2015 was factored into the calculation of the future interest payments on long-term debt.

(3)

Purchase
obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all
significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. These purchase obligations are
related principally to inventory and other items. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Purchase obligations also exclude open purchase orders that are routine
arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business as they are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way. Even though open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the
terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust terms based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services.

In
fiscal 2016, HPE anticipates making contributions of $366 million to its non-U.S. pension plans, expects to pay benefits of
$1 million to its U.S. non-qualified pension plan participants and expects to pay claims of $3 million under its post-retirement benefit plans. Our policy is to fund our pension plans so
that we meet at least the minimum contribution requirements, as established by local government, funding and taxing authorities. Expected contributions and payments to our pension and post-retirement
benefit plans are excluded from the contractual obligations table because they do not represent contractual cash outflows as they are dependent on numerous factors which may result in a wide range of
outcomes. For more information on our retirement and post-retirement benefit plans, see Note 4, "Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans", to the Combined and Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

We
expect future cash payments of approximately $3.0 billion in connection with our approved restructuring plans which includes
$1.2 billion expected to be paid in fiscal 2016 with the remaining approximately $1.8 million of cash payments to be made through fiscal 2021. Payments for restructuring have been
excluded from the contractual obligations table, because they do not represent contractual cash outflows and there is uncertainty as to the timing of these payments. For more information on our
restructuring activities, see Note 3, "Restructuring", to the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

(6)

As
of October 31, 2015, we had approximately $2.5 billion of recorded liabilities and related interest and penalties pertaining
to uncertain tax positions. These liabilities and related interest and penalties include $15 million expected to be paid within one year. For the remaining amount, we are unable to make a
reasonable estimate as to when cash settlement with the tax authorities might occur due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters. Payments of these obligations would result from settlements
with taxing authorities. For more information on our uncertain tax positions, see Note 6, "Taxes on Earnings", to the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is
incorporated herein by reference.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

As part of our ongoing business, we have not participated in transactions that generate material relationships with unconsolidated
entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or
other contractually narrow or limited purposes.

We
have third-party revolving short-term financing arrangements intended to facilitate the working capital requirements of certain customers. For more information on our third-party
revolving short-term financing arrangements, see Note 7, "Balance Sheet Details", to the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by
reference.



ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk.

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our
financial position and results of operations. Our risk management strategy with respect to these market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments. We use derivative contracts only
to manage existing underlying exposures. Accordingly, we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes. Our risks, risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects
of changes in fair value for each of these exposures is outlined below.

Actual
gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate
movements and
our actual exposures and derivatives in place at the time of the change, as well as the effectiveness of the derivative to hedge the related exposure.

Foreign currency exchange rate risk

We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales, anticipated purchases and
assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We transact business in approximately 79 currencies worldwide, of which the most significant foreign currencies to our
operations for fiscal 2015 were the euro, the British pound, Chinese yuan (renminbi) and the Japanese yen. For most currencies, we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from
a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currency. Even where we are a net receiver of the foreign currency, a weaker U.S. dollar may adversely
affect certain expense figures, if taken alone.

We
use a combination of forward contracts and, from time to time, options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our
forecasted net revenue and, to a lesser extent, cost of sales and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, when debt is denominated in a foreign currency,
we may use swaps to exchange the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for U.S. dollar-denominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We also
use other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consisting primarily of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures. Alternatively, we may choose not to hedge the
risk associated with our foreign currency exposures, primarily if such exposure acts as a natural hedge for offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or if the currency is too difficult or
too expensive to hedge.

We
have performed sensitivity analyses as of October 31, 2015 and 2014, using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10%
adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant. The analyses cover all of our foreign currency derivative
contracts offset by underlying exposures. The foreign currency exchange rates we used in performing the sensitivity analysis were based on market rates in effect at October 31, 2015 and 2014.
The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange fair value loss of $21 million and
$14 million at October 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Interest rate risk

We also are exposed to interest rate risk related to debt we have issued and our investment portfolio and financing receivables. We
issue long-term debt in either U.S. dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing.

We
often use interest rate and/or currency swaps to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the debt to achieve U.S. dollar LIBOR-based floating interest expense. The swap



transactions
generally involve the exchange of fixed for floating interest payments. However, we may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap
if we believe a larger proportion of fixed-rate debt would be beneficial.

In
order to hedge the fair value of certain fixed-rate investments, we may enter into interest rate swaps that convert fixed interest returns into variable interest returns. We may use
cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of LIBOR-based interest income received on certain variable-rate investments. We may also enter into interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest
returns into fixed-rate interest returns.

We
have performed sensitivity analyses as of October 31, 2015 and 2014, using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10%
adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve, with all other variables held constant. The analyses cover our debt, investments, financing receivables and interest
rate swaps. The analyses use actual or approximate maturities for the debt, investments, financing receivables and interest rate swaps. The discount rates used were based on the market interest rates
in effect at October 31, 2015 and 2014. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our debt,
investments and financing receivables, net of interest rate swaps, of $52 million and $7 million at October 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Quarterly Summary




Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company

We have audited the accompanying combined and consolidated balance sheets of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company and subsidiaries (the
"Company") as of October 31,
2015 and 2014, and the related combined and consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, cash flows, and equity for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2015.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company's internal control over financial
reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose
of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the combined and consolidated financial position of Hewlett Packard Enterprise
Company and subsidiaries at October 31, 2015 and 2014, and the combined and consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
October 31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1: Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Background

Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company ("we", "us", "our", "Hewlett Packard Enterprise", "HPE" or "the Company") is a leading global
provider of the cutting-edge technology solutions customers need to optimize their traditional information technology ("IT") while helping them build the secure, cloud-enabled, mobile-ready future
that is uniquely suited to their needs. Our customers range from small- and medium-sized businesses ("SMBs") to large global enterprises.

On
October 8, 2015, Hewlett Packard Enterprise's Registration Statement on Form 10, as amended, was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
("SEC"). On November 1, 2015, the Company became an independent publicly-traded company through a pro rata distribution by HP Inc. ("Parent" or "HPI"), formerly known as Hewlett-Packard
Company ("HP Co."), of 100% of the outstanding shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company to HP Inc.'s stockholders. Each HP Inc. stockholder of record received one share of Hewlett
Packard Enterprise common stock for each share of HP Inc. common stock held on the record date. Approximately 1.8 billion shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise common stock were
distributed on November 1, 2015 to HP Inc. stockholders. In connection with the separation, Hewlett Packard Enterprise's common stock began trading "regular-way" under the ticker symbol
"HPE" on the New York Stock Exchange on November 2, 2015.

Basis of Presentation

Prior to October 31, 2015, the combined financials statements were derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements and
accounting records of Parent as if it were operated on a standalone basis during the periods presented. On October 31, 2015, the combined and consolidated financial statements included the
accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries in accordance with the separation agreement for the transfer of assets and liabilities from Parent to the Company. These Combined and
Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company were prepared in connection with the separation and in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").

The
Combined and Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income of the Company reflect allocations of general corporate expenses from Parent including, but not limited to,
executive management, finance, legal, information technology, employee benefits administration, treasury, risk management, procurement, and other shared services. These allocations were made on a
direct usage basis when identifiable, with the remainder allocated on the basis of revenue, expenses, headcount or other relevant measures. Management of the Company and Parent consider these
allocations to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services by, or the benefits provided to, the Company. The allocations may not, however, reflect the expense the Company would have
incurred as a standalone company for the periods presented. Actual costs that may have been incurred if the Company had been a standalone company would depend on a number of factors, including the
chosen organizational structure, what functions were outsourced or performed by employees and strategic decisions made in areas such as information technology and infrastructure.

The
Combined and Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Company as of October 31, 2014 included Parent assets and liabilities that were specifically identifiable or otherwise
attributable to the Company, including subsidiaries and affiliates in which Parent had a controlling financial interest or was the primary beneficiary. Parent's cash had not been assigned to the
Company for any of the periods presented because those cash balances are not directly attributable to the Company. The Company



HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

reflected
transfers of cash to and from Parent's cash management system as a component of Parent company investment on the Combined and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Parent's long-term debt had not
been attributed to the Company for any of the periods presented because Parent's borrowings were not the legal obligation of the Company. As of October 31, 2015, substantially all of the assets
and liabilities and operations were transferred from Parent to the Company and the Combined and Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Company included the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries. Additionally, subsequent to the separation, the Company received a final cash allocation from HP Inc. and accrued certain general cross-indemnifications liabilities. See Note 14,
"Related Party Transactions and Parent Company investment", and Note 18, "Guarantees, Indemnifications and Warranties", for a full description of these items.

Parent
maintained various benefit and stock-based compensation plans at a corporate level and other benefit plans at a subsidiary level. The Company's employees participated in those
programs and a portion of the cost of those plans was included in the Company's Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements. However, the Company's Combined Balance Sheet at October 31, 2014
did not include any net benefit plan obligations unless the benefit plan only included active, retired and other former Company employees or any equity related to stock-based compensation plans. See
Note 4, "Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans", and Note 5, "Stock-based Compensation", for a further description.

As
of November 1, 2015, in connection with the separation and distribution, Parent's investment in the Company's business was redesignated as stockholders' equity and allocated
between common stock and additional paid-in capital based on the number of shares of the Company's common stock outstanding at the distribution date.

Principles of Combination and Consolidation

The Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company's net assets and results of operations as described above. All
intercompany transactions and accounts within the combined and consolidated businesses of the Company have been eliminated.

Intercompany
transactions between the Company and Parent are considered to be effectively settled in the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements at the time the transaction is
recorded. The total net effect of the settlement of these intercompany transactions is reflected in the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows within financing activities and in the
Combined and Consolidated Balance Sheets within Parent company investment.

The
Company accounts for investments in companies over which it has the ability to exercise significant influence but does not hold a controlling interest under the equity method, and
the Company records its proportionate share of income or losses in Interest and other, net in the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Non-controlling
interests are presented as a separate component within Equity in the Combined and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net earnings attributable to the non-controlling interests
are recorded within Interest and other, net in the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Earnings and are not presented separately as they were not material for any period presented.



HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the Company's Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

Foreign Currency Translation

The Company predominately uses the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollars are
remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities and at historical exchange rates for nonmonetary assets and liabilities. Net revenue, costs and expenses
denominated in non-U.S. dollars are recorded in U.S. dollars at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the period. The Company includes gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement in
Interest and other, net in the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Earnings and gains and losses from cash flow hedges in Net revenue as the hedged revenue is recognized. Certain non-U.S.
subsidiaries designate the local currency as their functional currency, and the Company records the translation of their assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at the balance sheet date as
translation adjustments and includes them as a
component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Combined and Consolidated Balance Sheets. The effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents was not material for any
of the fiscal years presented.

Parent Company Investment

Parent company investment in the Combined and Consolidated Balance Sheets and Statements of Equity represents Parent's historical
investment in the Company, the net effect of transactions with and allocations from Parent and the Company's accumulated earnings. See Note 14, "Related Party Transactions and Parent Company
Investment", for further information about transactions between the Company and Parent.

Revenue Recognition

General

The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services are rendered, the
sales price or fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Additionally, the Company recognizes hardware revenue on sales to channel partners, including resellers,
distributors or value-added solution providers at the time of delivery when the channel partners have economic substance apart from the Company, and the Company has completed its obligations related
to the sale. The Company generally recognizes revenue for its standalone software sales to channel partners on receipt of evidence that the software has been sold to a specific end user. The Company
limits the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services, future performance obligations or subject to
customer-specified refund or return rights.

The
Company reduces revenue for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings, including price protection, rebates, promotions, other volume-based incentives and expected
returns, at the later of the date of revenue recognition or the date the sales incentive is offered. Future market



HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

conditions
and product transitions may require the Company to take actions to increase customer incentive offerings, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive
is offered. For certain incentive programs, the Company estimates the number of customers expected to redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the
incentive.

In
instances when revenue is derived from sales of third-party vendor products or services, the Company records revenue on a gross basis when the Company is a principal to the
transaction and on a net basis when the Company is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor. The Company considers several factors to determine whether it is acting as a principal or an
agent, most notably whether the Company is the primary obligor to the customer, has established its own pricing and has inventory and credit risks.

The
Company reports revenue net of any taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities, with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to
the relevant government authority.

Multiple element arrangements

When a sales arrangement contains multiple elements or deliverables, such as hardware and software products, and/or services, the
Company allocates revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price for a deliverable is based on its vendor specific objective evidence ("VSOE") of selling price, if
available, third-party evidence ("TPE") if VSOE of selling price is not available, or estimated selling price ("ESP") if neither VSOE of selling price nor TPE is available. The Company establishes
VSOE of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and, in rare instances, using the price established by management having the relevant authority. The Company
establishes TPE of selling price by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. The Company establishes ESP
based on management judgment considering internal factors such as margin objectives, pricing practices and controls, customer segment pricing strategies and the product life cycle. Consideration is
also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and technology industry life cycles. In most arrangements with multiple elements, the Company allocates the transaction price to
the individual units of accounting at inception of the arrangement based on their relative selling price.

In
multiple element arrangements that include software that is more-than-incidental, the Company allocates the transaction price to the individual units of accounting for the
non-software deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative selling price of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the selling price hierarchy. If the
arrangement contains more than one software deliverable, the transaction price allocated to the group of software deliverables is then allocated to each component software deliverable.

The
Company evaluates each deliverable in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting. A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it
has standalone value to the customer. For elements with no standalone value, the Company recognizes revenue consistent with the pattern of the undelivered elements. If the arrangement includes a
customer-negotiated refund or return right or other contingency relative to the delivered items, and the delivery and performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially
within the



HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Company's
control, the delivered element constitutes a separate unit of accounting. In arrangements with combined units of accounting, changes in the allocation of the transaction price among elements
may impact the timing of revenue recognition for the contract but will not change the total revenue recognized for the contract.

Product revenue

Hardware

Under the Company's standard terms and conditions of sale, the Company transfers title and risk of loss to the customer at the time
product is delivered to the customer and recognizes revenue accordingly, unless customer acceptance is uncertain or significant obligations to the customer remain. The Company reduces revenue for
estimated customer returns, price protection, rebates and other programs offered under sales agreements established by the Company with its distributors and resellers. The Company records revenue from
the sale of equipment
under sales-type leases as product revenue at the inception of the lease. The Company accrues the estimated cost of post-sale obligations, including standard product warranties, based on historical
experience at the time the Company recognizes revenue.

Software

The Company recognizes revenue from perpetual software licenses at the inception of the license term, assuming all revenue recognition
criteria have been satisfied. Term-based software license revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the license. The Company uses the residual method to allocate revenue to software
licenses at inception of the arrangement when VSOE of fair value for all undelivered elements, such as post-contract customer support, exists and all other revenue recognition criteria have been
satisfied. The Company recognizes revenue from maintenance and unspecified upgrades or updates provided on a when-and-if-available basis ratably over the period during which such items are delivered.
The Company recognizes revenue for hosting or software-as-a-service ("SaaS") arrangements as the service is delivered, generally on a straight-line basis, over the contractual period of performance.
In hosting arrangements, the Company considers the rights provided to the customer (e.g. whether the customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the
hosting period without significant penalty, and the feasibility of the customer to operate or contract with another vendor to operate the software) in determining whether the arrangement includes the
sale of a software license. In hosting arrangements where software licenses are sold, license revenue is generally recognized according to whether perpetual or term licenses are sold, when all other
revenue recognition criteria are satisfied.

Services revenue

The Company recognizes revenue from fixed-price support or maintenance contracts, including extended warranty contracts and software
post-contract customer support agreements, ratably over the contract period and recognizes the costs associated with these contracts as incurred. For time and material contracts, the Company
recognizes revenue as services are rendered and recognizes costs as they are incurred.

The
Company recognizes revenue from certain fixed-price contracts, such as consulting arrangements, as work progresses over the contract period on a proportional performance basis, as



HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

determined
by the percentage of labor costs incurred to date compared to the total estimated labor costs of a contract. The Company recognizes revenue on fixed-price contracts for design and build
projects (to design, develop and construct software and systems) using the percentage-of-completion method. The Company uses the cost-to-cost method to measure progress toward completion as determined
by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to the total estimated costs of the project. Estimates of total project costs for fixed-price contracts are regularly revised during the life of a
contract. Provisions for estimated losses on fixed-priced contracts are recognized in the period when such losses become known. If reasonable and reliable cost estimates for a project cannot be made,
the Company uses the completed contract method and recognizes revenue and costs upon service completion.

The
Company generally recognizes outsourcing services revenue in the period when the service is provided and the amount earned is not contingent on the occurrence of any future event.
The Company recognizes revenue using an objective measure of output for unit-priced contracts. Revenue for fixed-price outsourcing contracts with periodic billings is recognized on a straight-line
basis if the service is provided evenly during the contract term. Provisions for estimated losses on outsourcing arrangements are recognized in the period when such losses become probable and
estimable.

The
Company recognizes revenue from operating leases on a straight-line basis as service revenue over the rental period.

Financing income

Sales-type and direct-financing leases produce financing income, which the Company recognizes at consistent rates of return over the
lease term.

Deferred revenue and deferred costs

The Company records amounts invoiced to customers in excess of revenue recognized as deferred revenue until the revenue recognition
criteria are satisfied. The Company
records revenue that is earned and recognized in excess of amounts invoiced on services contracts as trade receivables.

Deferred
revenue represents amounts invoiced in advance for product support contracts, software customer support contracts, outsourcing startup services work, consulting and integration
projects, product sales or leasing income.

The
Company recognizes costs associated with outsourcing contracts as incurred, unless such costs are considered direct and incremental to the startup phase of the contract, in which
case the Company defers these costs during the startup phase and subsequently amortizes such costs over the period that outsourcing services are provided, once those services commence. The Company
amortizes deferred contract costs on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the contract unless facts and circumstances of the contract indicate a shorter period is more appropriate. Based
on actual and projected contract financial performance indicators, the Company analyzes the recoverability of deferred contract costs using the undiscounted estimated cash flows of the contract over
its remaining term. If such undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of deferred contract costs and long-lived assets directly associated with the contract, the deferred
contract costs are first impaired. If a cash flow deficiency remains after reducing the carrying amount of the deferred



HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

contract
costs to zero, the Company evaluates any remaining long-lived assets related to that contract for impairment.

Shipping and Handling

The Company includes costs related to shipping and handling in Cost of products.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company's employees have historically participated in Parent's stock-based compensation plans. Stock-based compensation expense has
been allocated to the Company based on the awards and terms previously granted to the Company's employees as well as an allocation of Parent's corporate and shared functional employee expenses. The
stock-based compensation expense is based on the measurement date fair value of the award and is recognized only for those awards expected to meet the service and performance vesting conditions on a
straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. Stock-based compensation expense is determined at the aggregate grant level for service-based awards and at the individual vesting
tranche level for awards with performance and/or market conditions. The forfeiture rate is estimated based on Parent's historical experience.

Retirement and Post-Retirement Plans

Prior to October 31, 2015 and with the exception of certain defined benefit pension plans, of which the Company was the sole
sponsor, certain of Hewlett Packard Enterprise eligible employees, retirees and other former employees participated in certain U.S. and international defined benefit pension plans and other
post-employment plans offered by Parent. These plans, which included participants that were both Company employees and other employees of Parent ("Shared" plans), were accounted for as multiemployer
benefit plans and the related net benefit plan obligations were not included in the Company's historical Combined and Consolidated Balance Sheets through July 31, 2015. The related benefit plan
expenses were allocated to the Company based on the Company's labor costs and allocations of corporate and other shared functional personnel.

Certain
benefit plans in the Company's operations only included active, retired and other former Company employees ("Direct" plans) and were accounted for as single employer benefit
plans. Accordingly, the net benefit plan obligations and the related benefit plan expense of those plans have been recorded in the Company's Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements for all
periods presented. The most significant of these Direct plans are located in the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, and the United States.

In
connection with the separation, during the three months ended October 31, 2015, Parent transferred to the Company plan assets and liabilities related to newly-created single
employer plans, primarily associated with Hewlett Packard Enterprise eligible employees, retirees and other former employees.

The
Company generally amortizes unrecognized actuarial gains and losses on a straight-line basis over the average remaining estimated service life or, in the case of frozen plans, life
expectancy of participants. In some cases, actuarial gains and losses are amortized using the corridor approach. See Note 4, "Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans", for a full
description of these plans and the accounting and funding policies.



HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Advertising

Costs to produce advertising are expensed as incurred during production. Costs to communicate advertising are expensed when the
advertising is first run. Such costs totaled approximately $224 million in fiscal 2015, $220 million in fiscal 2014 and $157 million in fiscal 2013.

Restructuring

The Company records charges associated with Parent-approved restructuring plans to reorganize one or more of the Company's business
segments, to remove duplicative headcount and infrastructure associated with business acquisitions or to simplify business processes and accelerate innovation. Restructuring charges can include
severance costs to eliminate a specified number of employees, infrastructure charges to vacate facilities and consolidate operations, and contract cancellation costs. The Company records restructuring
charges based on estimated employee terminations and site closure and consolidation plans. The Company accrues for severance and other employee separation costs under these actions when it is probable
that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable. The rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans, historical experiences and negotiated settlements.

Taxes on Earnings

The Company's operations have historically been included in the tax returns filed by the respective Parent entities of which the
Company's businesses are a part. Income tax expense and other income tax related information contained in these Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements are presented on a separate return basis
as if the Company filed its own tax returns. The separate return method applies the accounting guidance for income taxes to the standalone financial statements as if the Company were a separate
taxpayer and a standalone enterprise for the periods presented. For the tax years 2014 and prior, current income tax liabilities related to entities which file jointly with Parent are assumed to be
immediately settled with Parent and are relieved through the Parent company investment account and the Net transfers to Parent in the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of
October 31, 2015, the current income tax liabilities will be settled by Hewlett Packard Enterprise.

The
Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported
amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more
likely than not to be realized.

The
Company records accruals for uncertain tax positions when the Company believes that it is not more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the
taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The Company makes adjustments to these accruals when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the
refinement of an estimate. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of adjustments for uncertain tax positions, as well as any related interest and penalties.

Accounts Receivable

The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts receivable. The Company records a specific reserve for
individual accounts when the Company becomes
aware of specific customer circumstances, such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing or deterioration in the customer's operating results or financial position. If there are additional changes in
circumstances related to the specific customer, the Company further adjusts estimates of the recoverability of receivables. The Company maintains bad debt reserves for all other customers based on a
variety of factors, including the use of third-party credit risk models that generate quantitative measures of default probabilities based on market factors, the financial condition of customers, the
length of time receivables are past due, trends in the weighted-average risk rating for the portfolio, macroeconomic conditions, information derived from competitive benchmarking, significant one-time
events and historical experience. The past due or delinquency status of a receivable is based on the contractual payment terms of the receivable.

The
Company participates in Parent's third-party revolving short-term financing arrangements intended to facilitate the working capital requirements of certain customers through
July 31, 2015. From and after August 1, 2015, all of the Company's transactions are under its own third-party revolving short-term financing arrangement. These financing arrangements,
which in certain cases provide for partial recourse, result in the transfer of the Company's trade receivables to a third party. The Company reflects amounts transferred to, but not yet collected
from, the third party in Accounts receivable in the Combined and Consolidated Balance Sheets. For arrangements involving an element of recourse, the fair value of the recourse obligation is measured
using market data from similar transactions and reported as a current liability in the Combined and Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Concentrations of Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and
cash equivalents, investments, receivables from trade customers and contract manufacturers, financing receivables and derivatives.

Prior
to October 31, 2015, the Company participates in cash management, funding arrangements and risk management programs managed by Parent. Following October 31, 2015, in
connection with the separation, The Company also maintains cash and cash equivalents, investments, derivatives and certain other financial instruments with various financial institutions. These
financial institutions are located in many different geographic regions, and the Company's policy is designed to limit exposure from any particular institution. As part of its risk management
processes, the Company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial institutions. The Company has not sustained material credit losses from instruments held at
these financial institutions. The Company utilizes derivative contracts to protect against the effects of foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Such contracts involve the risk of
non-performance by the counterparty, which could result in a material loss.

The
Company sells a significant portion of its products through third-party distributors and resellers and, as a result, maintains individually significant receivable balances with these
parties. If the financial
condition or operations of these distributors' and resellers' aggregated business deteriorates substantially, the Company's operating results could be adversely affected. The ten largest distributor
and reseller receivable balances, which were concentrated primarily in North America and Europe,



HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

collectively
represented approximately 8% and 12% of gross accounts receivable at October 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. No single customer accounts for more than 10% of gross accounts
receivable. Credit risk with respect to other accounts receivable and financing receivables is generally diversified due to the large number of entities comprising the Company's customer base and
their dispersion across many different industries and geographic regions. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of its third-party distributors, resellers and
other customers and may require collateral, such as letters of credit and bank guarantees, in certain circumstances.

The
Company utilizes outsourced manufacturers around the world to manufacture company-designed products. The Company may purchase product components from suppliers and sell those
components to its outsourced manufacturers thereby creating receivable balances from the outsourced manufacturers. The three largest outsourced manufacturer receivable balances collectively
represented 80% and 87% of the Company's manufacturer receivables of $414 million and $415 million at October 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company includes the
manufacturer receivables in Other current assets in the Combined and Consolidated Balance Sheets on a gross basis. The Company's credit risk associated with these receivables is mitigated wholly or in
part by the amount the Company owes to these outsourced manufacturers, as the Company generally has the legal right to offset its payables to the outsourced manufacturers against these receivables.
The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in revenue and does not recognize any profit on these component sales until the related products are sold by the Company, at which time any
profit is recognized as a reduction to cost of sales. The Company obtains a significant number of components from single source suppliers due to technology, availability, price, quality or other
considerations. The loss of a single source supplier, the deterioration of the Company's relationship with a single source supplier, or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which
the Company is supplied components by a single source supplier could adversely affect the Company's revenue and gross margins.

Inventory

The Company values inventory at the lower of cost or market. Cost is computed using standard cost which approximates actual cost on a
first-in, first-out basis. Adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value are made, if required, for estimated excess or obsolescence.

Property, Plant and Equipment

The Company states property, plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation. The Company capitalizes additions and
improvements and expenses maintenance and repairs as incurred. Depreciation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives are
five to 40 years for buildings and improvements and three to 15 years for machinery and equipment. The Company depreciates leasehold improvements over the life of the lease or the asset,
whichever is shorter. The Company depreciates equipment held for lease over the initial term of the lease to the equipment's estimated residual value. The estimated useful lives of assets used solely
to support a customer services contract generally do not exceed the term of the customer contract. On retirement or disposition, the asset cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from
the Combined and Consolidated Balance Sheets with any gain or loss recognized in the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Earnings.



HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

The
Company capitalizes certain internal and external costs incurred to acquire or create internal use software, principally related to software coding, designing system interfaces and
installation and testing
of the software. The Company amortizes capitalized internal use software costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the software, generally from three to five years.

In
connection with the separation, during the three months ended October 31, 2015, Parent transferred to the Company, property, plant and equipment primarily related to its global
real estate portfolio, IT and other assets.

Software Development Costs

The Company capitalizes costs incurred to acquire or develop software for resale subsequent to establishing technological feasibility
for the software, if significant. The Company amortizes capitalized software development costs using the greater of the straight-line amortization method or the ratio that current gross revenues for a
product bear to the total current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product. The estimated useful life for capitalized software for resale is generally three years or less. Software
development costs incurred subsequent to establishing technological feasibility are generally not significant.

Business Combinations

The Company includes the results of operations of acquired businesses in the Company's combined and consolidated results prospectively
from the date of acquisition. The Company allocates the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired including in-process research and development ("IPR&D"), liabilities assumed, and
non-controlling interests in the acquired entity generally based on their fair values at the acquisition date. IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite
life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When the IPR&D project is complete, it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible assets and is amortized over its estimated useful life. If an
IPR&D project is abandoned, the Company will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to the Company's Combined and Consolidated Statement of Earnings in the period it is
abandoned. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling interests in the acquired entity is recorded as
goodwill. The primary items that generate goodwill include the value of the synergies between the acquired company and the Company and the value of the acquired assembled workforce, neither of which
qualifies for recognition as an intangible asset. Acquisition-related expenses and post-acquisition restructuring costs are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as
incurred.

Goodwill

The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of
goodwill may not be recoverable. The Company is permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. At the
annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, the Company performs a quantitative test for all of its reporting units.

Goodwill
is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. As of October 31, 2015, the Company's reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in
Note 2, "Segment



HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Information",
except for Enterprise Services ("ES"), which includes two reporting units: (1) MphasiS Limited and (2) the remainder of ES. In the first step of the impairment test, the
Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived most significantly
from the income approach, and to a lesser extent, the market approach. Under the income approach, the Company estimates the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated
future cash flows. The Company prepares cash flow projections based on management's estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market conditions.
The Company bases the discount rate on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the
reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. Under the market approach, the Company estimates fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable
publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit. The Company weights the fair value derived from the market approach depending on the level of
comparability of these publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. When market comparable are not meaningful or not available, the Company estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using only
the income approach. For the MphasiS Limited reporting unit, the Company utilized the quoted market price in an active market to estimate fair value.

If
the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required. If the
fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the Company performs the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. In the
second step, the Company measures the reporting unit's assets, including any unrecognized intangible assets, liabilities and non-controlling interests at fair value in a hypothetical analysis to
calculate the implied fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a
business combination. If the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is less than its carrying amount, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss.

Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets

The Company reviews intangible assets with finite lives and long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company assesses the recoverability of assets based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to
result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount, the asset is impaired. The Company measures the amount of impairment
loss, if any, as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value using an income approach or, when available and appropriate, using a market approach. The Company amortizes
intangible assets with finite lives using the straight-line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets, ranging from one to ten years.

Debt and Marketable Equity Securities Investments

Debt and marketable equity securities are generally considered available-for-sale and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains
and losses, net of applicable taxes, in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Combined and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Realized gains and losses for available-for-sale securities are calculated
based on the specific identification method and included in



HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Interest
and other, net in the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The Company monitors its investment portfolio for potential impairment on a quarterly basis. When the carrying amount
of an investment in debt securities exceeds its fair value and the decline in value is determined to be other-than-temporary (i.e., when the Company does not intend to sell the debt securities
and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the debt securities prior to anticipated recovery of its amortized cost basis), the Company records an impairment charge to
Interest and other, net in the amount of the credit loss and the balance, if any, is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Combined and Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Derivatives

The Company uses derivative financial instruments, primarily forwards, swaps, and, at times, options, to hedge certain foreign currency
and interest rate exposures. The Company also may use other derivative instruments not designated as hedges, such as forwards used to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures. The Company does
not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. See Note 12, "Financial Instruments", for a full description of the Company's derivative financial instrument activities and
related accounting policies.

Loss Contingencies

The Company is involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. The
Company records a liability for contingencies when it believes it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. See Note 17,
"Litigation and Contingencies", for a full description of the Company's loss contingencies and related accounting policies.

Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") amended the existing accounting standards for income taxes. The
amendments require deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The Company is required to adopt the guidance in the first
quarter of fiscal 2018; however early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied retrospectively with the adjusted balance sheet of each individual period presented, in order to reflect
the period-specific effects of applying the new guidance. The Company is currently evaluating the timing and the impact of these amendments on its Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements.

In
April 2015, the FASB amended the existing accounting standards for intangible assets. The amendments provide explicit guidance to customers in determining the accounting for fees paid
in a cloud computing arrangement, wherein the arrangements that do not convey a software license to the customer are accounted for as service contracts. The amendments also eliminate the practice of
accounting for software license as executory contracts which may cause more software assets to be
capitalized. The Company is required to adopt the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2017; however early adoption is permitted as is retrospective application. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact of these amendments on its Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements.

In
April 2015, the FASB amended the existing accounting standards for imputation of interest. The amendments require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be
presented in the



HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

balance
sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected
by these amendments. The Company is required to adopt the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied retrospectively with the adjusted
balance sheet of each individual period presented, in order to reflect the period-specific effects of applying the new guidance. The Company is currently evaluating the timing and the impact of these
amendments on its Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements.

In
May 2014, the FASB amended the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. The amendments are based on the principle that revenue should be recognized to depict the
transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the
FASB issued an accounting standard update for a one-year deferral of the effective date, with an option of applying the standard on the original effective date, which for the Company is the first
quarter of fiscal 2018. In accordance with this deferral, the Company is required to adopt these amendments in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The amendments may be applied retrospectively to each
prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of these amendments and the
transition alternatives on its Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements.

In
April 2014, the FASB issued guidance which changes the criteria for identifying a discontinued operation. The guidance limits the definition of a discontinued operation to the
disposal of a component or group of components that is disposed of or is classified as held for sale and represents a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on an entity's operations
and financial results. The Company is required to adopt the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, with early adoption permitted for transactions that have not been reported in financial
statements previously issued.

In
July 2013, the FASB issued a new accounting standard requiring the presentation of certain unrecognized tax benefits as reductions to deferred tax assets rather than as liabilities in
the Company's Combined and Consolidated Balance Sheets when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists. The Company adopted the new standard in the first
quarter of fiscal
2015 on a prospective basis. The adoption of this new standard did not have a material effect on the Company's Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements.

Note 2: Segment Information

The Company is a leading global provider of the cutting-edge technology solutions customers need to optimize their traditional IT while helping them build the secure, cloud-enabled,
mobile-ready future that is uniquely suited to their needs. Hewlett Packard Enterprise's customers range from SMBs to large global enterprises. Hewlett Packard Enterprise's operations are organized
into five segments for financial reporting purposes: the Enterprise Group ("EG"), Enterprise Services ("ES"), Software, Financial Services ("FS") and Corporate Investments. Hewlett Packard
Enterprise's organizational structure is based on a number of factors that management uses to evaluate, view and run its business operations, which include, but are not limited to, customer base and
homogeneity of products and technology. The segments are based on this organizational structure and information reviewed by Hewlett Packard Enterprise's management to evaluate segment results.

A
summary description of each segment follows.

of
investment solution capabilities for large enterprise customers and channel partners, along with an array of financial options to SMBs and educational and governmental entities.

Corporate Investments

includes Hewlett Packard Labs and certain cloud-related business incubation projects among others.

Segment Policy

Hewlett Packard Enterprise derives the results of the business segments directly from its internal management reporting system. The
accounting policies Hewlett Packard Enterprise uses to derive segment results are substantially the same as those the consolidated company uses. Management measures the performance of each segment
based on several metrics, including earnings from operations. Management uses these results, in part, to evaluate the performance of, and to allocate resources to, each of the segments.

Segment
revenue includes revenues from sales to external customers and intersegment revenues that reflect transactions between the segments on an arm's-length basis. Intersegment
revenues primarily consist of sales of hardware and software that are sourced internally and, in the majority of the cases, are financed as operating leases by FS. Hewlett Packard Enterprise's
consolidated net revenue is derived and reported after the elimination of intersegment revenues from such arrangements.

Hewlett
Packard Enterprise periodically engages in intercompany advanced royalty payment and licensing arrangements that may result in advance payments between subsidiaries. Revenues
from these intercompany arrangements are deferred and recognized as earned over the term of the arrangement by the Hewlett Packard Enterprise legal entities involved in such transactions; however,
these advanced payments are eliminated from revenues as reported by Hewlett Packard Enterprise and its business segments. As disclosed in Note 6, "Taxes on Earnings", during fiscal 2015,
Hewlett Packard Enterprise executed intercompany advanced royalty payment arrangements resulting in advanced payments of $5.0 billion, while during fiscal 2014, Hewlett Packard Enterprise
executed a multi-year intercompany licensing arrangement and intercompany advanced royalty payment arrangement which resulted in combined advanced payments of $7.8 billion. In these
transactions, the payments were received in the U.S. from a foreign consolidated affiliate, with a deferral of intercompany revenues over the term of the arrangements, approximately 5 years and
15 years, respectively. The impact of these intercompany arrangements is eliminated from both Hewlett Packard Enterprise consolidated and segment revenues.

Financing
interest in the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Earnings reflects interest expense on borrowing-and funding-related activity associated with FS and its subsidiaries,
and debt issued by Hewlett Packard Enterprise for which a portion of the proceeds benefited FS. Prior to October 9, 2015, such financing interest expense resulted from debt issued by Parent.

Hewlett
Packard Enterprise does not allocate to its segments certain operating expenses, which it manages at the corporate level. These unallocated costs include certain corporate
governance costs, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring charges, acquisition and other related charges, separation costs, defined benefit plan settlement
charges and impairment of data center assets.

Note 2: Segment Information (Continued)

Segment Organizational Changes

In connection with a strategic review of its software business by HP Inc. prior to the separation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise
from HP Inc., and effective at the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, the marketing optimization software product group, a business which was historically managed by us and is
included in our Software segment financial information prior to the effective date, was retained by HP Inc. The strategic review determined that these software assets no longer aligned with the
software business's strategic charter as they were outside the go-to-market focus of selling to IT departments.

In
connection with the acquisition of Aruba Networks, Inc. ("Aruba") during fiscal 2015, Hewlett Packard Enterprise recorded approximately $1.8 billion of goodwill and
$643 million of intangible assets and $153 million of in-process research and development. Hewlett Packard Enterprise reports the financial results of Aruba's business in the Networking
business unit within the EG segment.

Assets
allocated to the EG segment in fiscal 2015 increased as compared to fiscal 2014 as a result of the acquisition of Aruba. Assets allocated to the ES segment increased in fiscal
2015 due primarily to property, plant and equipment transferred from Parent. In addition, the increase in Corporate and unallocated assets in fiscal 2015 was due primarily to the cash allocation from
Parent and an increase in deferred tax assets.

Major Customers

No single customer represented 10% or more of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's total net revenue in any fiscal year presented.

Geographic Information

Net revenue by country is based upon the sales location that predominately represents the customer location. For each of the fiscal
years of 2015, 2014 and 2013,
other than the U.S. and the United Kingdom, no country represented more than 10% of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's net revenue.

The
current restructuring liability reported in Accrued restructuring in the Combined and Consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $628 million, $711
million and $698 million, respectively. The long-term restructuring liability reported in Other liabilities in the Combined and Consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 were
$114 million, $178 million and $180 million, respectively.

Fiscal 2015 Restructuring Plan

On September 14, 2015, Parent's Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan (the "2015 Plan") in connection with the
separation which will be implemented through fiscal 2018. As part of the 2015 Plan, the Company expects up to approximately 30,000 employees to exit the Company by the end of 2018. These workforce
reductions are primarily associated with our Enterprise Services segment. The changes to the workforce will vary by country, based on local legal requirements and consultations with employee works
councils and other employee representatives, as appropriate. The Company estimates



HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 3: Restructuring (Continued)

that
it will incur aggregate pre-tax charges through fiscal 2018 of approximately $2.6 billion in connection with the 2015 Plan, of which approximately $2.2 billion relates to workforce
reductions and approximately $400 million primarily relates to real estate consolidation.

Fiscal 2012 Restructuring Plan

On May 23, 2012, Parent adopted a multi-year restructuring plan (the "2012 Plan") designed to simplify business processes,
accelerate innovation and deliver better results for customers, employees and stockholders. As of October 31, 2015 the Company had eliminated 42,100 positions in connection with the 2012 Plan,
with a portion of those employees exiting the company as part of voluntary enhanced early retirement ("EER") programs in the U.S. and in certain other countries. The Company recognized
$4.4 billion in total aggregate charges in connection with the 2012 Plan, with $3.9 billion related to workforce reductions, including the EER programs, and $545 million related
to infrastructure, including data center and real estate consolidation and other items. The severance and infrastructure related cash payments associated with the 2012 Plan are expected to be paid out
through fiscal 2021.

Other Plans

Restructuring plans initiated by Parent in fiscal 2008 and 2010 were substantially completed as of April 30, 2015. Severance and
infrastructure related cash payments associated with these plans are expected to be paid out through fiscal 2019.

Note 4: Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans

Defined Benefit Plans

Prior to October 31, 2015 and with the exception of certain defined benefit pension plans, of which the Company was the sole
sponsor, certain of Hewlett Packard Enterprise eligible employees, retirees and other former employees participated in certain U.S. and international defined benefit pension plans offered by Parent.
These plans which included participants of both Company employees and other employees of Parent were accounted for as multiemployer benefit plans and the related net benefit plan obligations were not
included in the Company's Combined and Consolidated Balance Sheets through July 31, 2015. The related benefit plan expense was allocated to the Company based on the Company's labor costs and
allocations of corporate and other shared functional personnel. Parent contributions to these Shared plans were $518 million in fiscal 2015, $277 million in fiscal 2014 and
$354 million in fiscal 2013.

Certain
benefit plans in the Company's operations only included active, retired and other former Company employees and were accounted for as single employer benefit plans. Accordingly,
the net benefit plan obligations and the related benefit plan expense of those plans have been recorded in the Company's Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented. The
most significant of these Direct plans are located in the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, and the United States.

In
connection with the separation, during the three months ended October 31, 2015, Parent transferred to the Company plan assets and liabilities primarily associated with Hewlett
Packard Enterprise eligible employees, retirees and other former employees. As a result, in the fourth quarter



HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 4: Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans (Continued)

of
fiscal 2015, plan assets of $11.7 billion, a benefit obligation of $11.9 billion and an accumulated other comprehensive loss of $2.6 billion primarily related to non-U.S.
defined benefit pension plans were assumed and recorded by the Company. The net benefit plan obligations transferred were re-measured on the date of transfer resulting in an additional loss of
$553 million recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss during the three months ended October 31, 2015.

Post-Retirement Benefit Plans

Prior to July 31, 2015, Parent sponsored retiree health and welfare benefit plans, of which the most significant plans were in
the U.S. All of these plans were accounted for as multiemployer benefit plans. The Company recognized post-retirement benefit credits of $28 million in fiscal 2015, $18 million in fiscal
2014 and $66 million in fiscal 2013 in the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

In
connection with the separation, during the three months ended October 31, 2015, Parent transferred to the Company a benefit obligation of $150 million, plan assets of
$40 million and accumulated other comprehensive income of $10 million primarily associated with Hewlett Packard Enterprise eligible employees, retirees and other former employees.

Defined Contribution Plans

Prior to separation, Parent offered various defined contribution plans for U.S. and non-U.S. employees. The Company's defined
contribution expense was approximately $450 million in fiscal 2015, $480 million in fiscal 2014 and $505 million in fiscal 2013. Prior to separation, U.S. employees were
automatically enrolled in the Hewlett-Packard Company 401(k) Plan ("HP 401(k) Plan") when they meet eligibility requirements, unless they decline participation. The quarterly employer matching
contributions in the HP 401(k) Plan was 100% of an employee's contributions, up to a maximum of 4% of eligible compensation.

Effective
November 1, 2015 the Company's active employees became eligible to participate in the newly created Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company 401(k) Plan.

Pension Benefit Expense

The Company's total net pension benefit cost recognized in the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Earnings was $341 million
in fiscal 2015, $142 million in fiscal 2014 and $302 million in fiscal 2013.

In
January 2015, Parent offered certain terminated vested participants of the U.S. HP Pension Plan (a Shared plan) a one-time voluntary window during which they could elect to receive
their pension benefit as a lump sum payment. As a result, the Parent pension plan trust made lump sum payments to eligible participants who elected to receive their pension benefit under this lump sum
program. The defined benefit plan settlement charges of $225 million recorded in the Combined and Consolidated Statement of Earnings for the year ended October 31, 2015, primarily include
settlement expenses and additional net periodic benefit cost resulting from this lump sum program incurred by the Parent, which was determined to be directly attributable to the Company and the impact
of remeasurement of the related U.S. defined benefit plans.

The
following is a description of the valuation methodologies used to measure plan assets at fair value. There have been no changes in the methodologies used during the reporting period.

Investments
in publicly traded equity securities are valued using the closing price on the measurement date as reported on the stock exchange on which the individual securities are
traded. For corporate, government and asset-backed debt securities, fair value is based on observable inputs of comparable market transactions. For corporate and government debt securities traded on
active exchanges, fair value is based on observable quoted prices. The valuation of alternative investments,



HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 4: Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans (Continued)

such
as limited partnerships and joint ventures, may require significant management judgment. For alternative investments, valuation is based on net asset value ("NAV") as reported by the asset
manager and adjusted for cash flows, if necessary. In making such an assessment, a variety of factors are reviewed by management, including, but not limited to, the timeliness of NAV as reported by
the asset manager and changes in general economic and market conditions subsequent to the last NAV reported by the asset manager. Depending on the amount of management judgment, the lack of near-term
liquidity, and the absence of quoted market prices, these assets are classified in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

Further,
depending on how quickly the Company can redeem its hedge fund investments, and the extent of any adjustments to NAV, hedge funds are classified in either Level 2 or
Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The valuation for some of these assets requires judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices, and these assets are generally classified in either
Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Cash and cash equivalents includes money market funds, which are valued based on NAV. Other assets, including insurance group annuity
contracts, were classified in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input (e.g., quoted prices and observable inputs) that is significant to the fair value measure in its entirety.

Plan Asset Allocations

The weighted-average target and actual asset allocations across the benefit plans at the respective measurement dates for the non-U.S.
defined benefit plans and post-retirement benefit plan were as follows:

Investment Policy

Company's investment strategy is to seek a competitive rate of return relative to an appropriate level of risk depending on the funded
status of each plan and the timing of expected benefit payments. The majority of the plans' investment managers employ active investment management strategies with the goal of outperforming the broad
markets in which they invest. Risk management practices include diversification across asset classes and investment styles and periodic rebalancing toward asset allocation targets. A number of the
plans' investment managers are authorized to utilize derivatives for



HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 4: Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans (Continued)

investment
or liability exposures, and the Company may utilize derivatives to effect asset allocation changes or to hedge certain investment or liability exposures.

Outside
the U.S., asset allocation decisions are typically made by an independent board of trustees for the specific plan. Investment objectives are designed to generate returns that
will enable the plan to meet its future obligations. In some countries, local regulations may restrict asset allocations, typically leading to a higher percentage of investment in fixed income
securities than would otherwise be deployed. The Company reviews the investment strategy and provides a recommended list of investment managers for each country plan, with final decisions on asset
allocation and investment managers made by the board of trustees for the specific plan.

Basis for Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the expected returns for each major asset class in which the plan invests
and the weight of each asset class in the target mix. Expected asset returns reflect the current yield on government bonds, risk premiums for each asset class and expected real returns, which
considers each country's specific inflation outlook. Because the Company's investment policy is to employ primarily active investment managers who seek to outperform the broader market, the expected
returns are adjusted to reflect the expected additional returns, net of fees.

Future Contributions and Funding Policy

In fiscal 2016, the Company expects to contribute approximately $366 million to its non-U.S. pension plans and approximately
$1 million to cover benefit payments to U.S. non-qualified plan participants. The Company expects to pay approximately $3 million to cover benefit claims for its post-retirement benefit
plans. The Company's policy is to fund its pension plans so that it makes at least the minimum contribution required by local government, funding and taxing authorities.

Estimated Future Benefits Payments

As of October 31, 2015, estimated future benefits payments for the Company's retirement plans were as follows:

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 5: Stock-Based Compensation

Prior to the separation, certain of the Company's employees participated in stock-based compensation plans sponsored by Parent. Parent's stock-based compensation plans include incentive
compensation plans and an employee stock purchase plan ("ESPP"). All awards granted under the plans are based on Parent's common shares and, as such, are not reflected in the Company's Combined and
Consolidated
Statements of Equity. Stock-based compensation expense includes expense attributable to the Company based on the awards and terms previously granted under the incentive compensation plan to the
Company's employees and an allocation of Parent's corporate and shared functional employee expenses. Accordingly, the amounts presented are not necessarily indicative of future awards and do not
necessarily reflect the results that we would have experienced as an independent, publicly-traded company for the periods presented.

In
conjunction with the separation, the Company adopted the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company 2015 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). Upon the separation, the outstanding Parent
equity-based compensation awards were converted into the Company equity-based compensation awards issued pursuant to the Plan and will reduce the shares authorized for issuance under the Plan.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Stock-Based Plans

The Plan became effective on November 1, 2015. The total number of shares of the Company's common stock authorized and available
for issuance under the Plan is 260 million. The Plan provides for the grant of various types of awards including restricted stock awards, stock options, and performance-based awards.

Parent's Stock-Based Incentive Compensation Plans

Prior to the separation, Parent's stock-based incentive compensation plans included equity plans adopted in 2004 and 2000, as amended
("principal equity plans"), as well as various equity plans assumed through acquisitions under which stock-based awards were outstanding. Stock-based awards granted from the principal equity plans
include restricted stock awards, stock options, and performance-based awards. Employees who had met certain employment qualifications were eligible to receive stock-based awards.

Restricted
stock awards are non-vested stock awards that may include grants of restricted stock or restricted stock units. Restricted stock awards and cash-settled awards were generally
subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the lapse of the restrictions. Such awards generally vested one to three years from the date of grant. During the vesting period, ownership of
the restricted stock could not be transferred. Restricted stock had the same dividend and voting rights as common stock and was considered to be issued and outstanding upon grant. The dividends paid
on restricted stock were non-forfeitable. Restricted stock units had forfeitable dividend equivalent rights equal to the dividend paid on common stock. Restricted stock units did not have the voting
rights of common stock,
and the shares underlying restricted stock units were not considered issued and outstanding upon grant. The Company expensed the fair value of restricted stock awards ratably over the period during
which the restrictions lapse.

Stock
options granted under the principal equity plans were generally non-qualified stock options, but the principal equity plans permitted some options granted to qualify as incentive
stock options under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Stock options generally vested over three to four years from the date of grant. The exercise price of a stock option was equal to the closing price
of Parent's stock



HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 5: Stock-Based Compensation (Continued)

on
the option grant date. The majority of stock options issued by Parent contained only service vesting conditions. However, starting in fiscal 2011, Parent began granting performance-contingent stock
options that vest only on the satisfaction of both service and market conditions prior to the expiration of the awards.

In
connection with the separation and in accordance with the Employee Matters Agreement between HP Inc. and the Company, the Company's employees with outstanding Parent
stock-based awards received replacement stock-based awards under the Plan at separation. The value of the replaced Company stock-based awards was designed to generally preserve the intrinsic value of
the award immediately prior to separation. The share and per share data presented in this note has not been adjusted to reflect the impact of the separation.

Stock-Based Compensation Expense and Related Income Tax Benefits

In
connection with the separation, the Board of Directors approved amendments to certain outstanding long-term incentive awards on July 29, 2015. The amendments provided for the
accelerated vesting on September 17, 2015 of certain stock-based awards that were otherwise scheduled to vest between September 18, 2015 and December 31, 2015. The increased
pre-tax stock-based compensation expense due to the acceleration was approximately $61 million in fiscal year 2015.

Stock-based
compensation expense includes an allocation of Parent's corporate and shared functional employees expenses of $151 million, $113 million and $76 million

The
Employee transition amounts consist of restricted stock award activity for employees transitioning between the Company and Parent.

In
fiscal 2015, approximately 8 million shares of restricted stock units were assumed through acquisition with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $33 per share.

The
total grant date fair value of restricted stock awards vested for Company employees in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $451 million, $128 million and
$137 million, respectively, net of taxes. As of
October 31, 2015, total unrecognized pre-tax stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock awards to Company employees was $530 million, which is expected to be
recognized over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of 1.5 years.

Stock Options

Parent utilizes the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula to estimate the fair value of stock options subject to service-based
vesting conditions. Parent estimates the fair value of stock options subject to performance-contingent vesting conditions using a combination of a Monte Carlo simulation

The

For
awards granted in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2013, expected volatility was estimated using the implied volatility derived from options traded
on Parent's common stock. For awards granted in fiscal 2014, expected volatility for awards subject to service-based vesting was estimated using the implied volatility derived from options traded on
Parent's common stock, whereas for performance-contingent awards, expected volatility was estimated using the historical volatility of Parent's common stock.

The
risk-free interest rate was estimated based on the yield on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues.

(4)

The
expected dividend yield represents a constant dividend yield applied for the duration of the expected term of the award.

For
awards subject to service-based vesting, the expected term was estimated using historical exercise and post-vesting termination patterns.
For performance-contingent awards, the expected term represents an output from the lattice model.

Note 5: Stock-Based Compensation (Continued)

The
aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value that Company employee option holders would have realized had all Company employee option
holders exercised their options on the last trading day of fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013. The aggregate intrinsic value is the difference between Parent's closing stock price on the last trading day of
the fiscal year and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options. The total intrinsic value of options exercised by Company employees in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 was
$94 million, $78 million and $26 million, respectively. The total grant date fair value of options granted to Company employees which vested in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 was
$38 million, $46 million and $63 million, respectively, net of taxes.

As
of October 31, 2015, total unrecognized pre-tax stock-based compensation expense related to stock options for Company employees was $32 million, which is expected to be
recognized over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of 1.8 years.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Effective November 1, 2015, the Company adopted the Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP"). The total number of shares of
Company's common stock authorized and available for issuance under the ESPP is 80 million. The ESPP allows eligible employees to contribute up to 10% of their eligible compensation to purchase Hewlett
Packard Enterprise's common stock. The plan provides for a discount not to exceed 15% and an offering period up to 24 months. The Company currently offers 6 month offering periods during which
employees have the ability to purchase shares at 95% of the closing market price on the purchase date. No stock-based compensation expense is expected to be recorded as the criteria of a
non-compensatory plan will be met.

Prior
to the separation, Parent sponsored the ESPP, pursuant to which eligible employees may contribute up to 10% of their eligible compensation, subject to certain income limits, to
purchase shares of Parent's common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the ESPP, employees purchase stock under the ESPP at a price equal to 95% of Parent's closing stock price on the purchase date. No
stock-based

compensation
expense was recorded in connection with those purchases because the criteria of a non-compensatory plan were met.

Note 6: Taxes on Earnings

Prior to the separation, Hewlett Packard Enterprise's operating results were included in Parent's various consolidated U.S. federal and state income tax returns, as well as non-U.S. tax
filings. For purposes of the Company's Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements for periods prior to the separation, income tax expense and deferred tax balances have been recorded as if the
Company filed tax returns on a standalone basis separate from Parent. The Separate Return Method applies the accounting guidance for income taxes to the standalone financial statements as if the
Company was a separate taxpayer and a standalone enterprise for the periods presented.

The
jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that have the most significant impact on the Company's effective tax rate in the periods presented include Puerto Rico, Singapore and China.
The Company plans to reinvest earnings of these jurisdictions indefinitely outside the U.S., and therefore have not provided for U.S. taxes on those indefinitely reinvested earnings.

In
fiscal 2015, the Company recorded $1.6 billion of net income tax benefits related to items unique to the year. These amounts primarily included $1.8 billion of income
tax benefits due to a release of valuation allowances pertaining to certain U.S. deferred tax assets, $447 million of income tax benefits
related to restructuring and separation related costs, and $131 million of income tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions, the effects of which were partially offset by
$486 million of tax charges to record valuation allowances on certain foreign deferred tax assets and $217 million of income tax charges related to state tax impacts of the separation of
deferred taxes under the Separate Return Method.

In
fiscal 2014, the Company recorded $113 million of net income tax benefits related to items unique to the year. These amounts included $66 million of income tax benefits
related to provision to return adjustments and $35 million of income tax benefits related to state rate changes.

In
fiscal 2013, the Company recorded $283 million of net income tax charges related to items unique to the year. These amounts included $231 million of income tax charges
for adjustments related to uncertain tax positions and $54 million related to the settlement of tax audit matters.

As
a result of certain employment actions and capital investments the Company has undertaken, income from manufacturing and services in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates,
and in some cases is wholly exempt from taxes, through 2024. The gross income tax benefits attributable to these actions and investments were estimated to be $260 million ($0.14 diluted net
EPS) in fiscal 2015, $546 million ($0.30 diluted net EPS) in fiscal 2014 and $372 million ($0.20 diluted net EPS) in fiscal 2013. For comparative purposes the number of shares used to
compute the diluted net EPS as of October 31, 2015 is used for calculation of diluted net EPS for all the periods presented. Refer Note 16, "Net Earnings Per Share" for details on shares
used to compute diluted net EPS.

Up
to $0.6 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's unrecognized tax benefits at October 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively,
would affect the Company's effective tax rate if realized. The $2.8 billion increase in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the year ended October 31, 2015, primarily relates to
the timing of intercompany royalty income recognition which does not affect the Company's effective tax rate.

Hewlett
Packard Enterprise recognizes interest income from favorable settlements and interest expense and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits in Provision for taxes in the
Combined and Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The Company had accrued $269 million and $152 million for interest and penalties as of October 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

For
the periods presented, the unrecognized tax benefits reflected in the Company's Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements have been determined using the Separate Return Method.
The increase in the balance of the Company's unrecognized tax benefits reflect the impact of tax carryforwards and credits that resulted from the separation. Hewlett Packard Enterprise engages in
continuous discussion and negotiation with taxing authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. Hewlett Packard Enterprise does not expect complete resolution of any U.S. Internal
Revenue Service ("IRS") audit cycle within the next 12 months. However, it is reasonably possible that certain federal, foreign and state tax issues may be concluded in the next
12 months, including issues involving transfer pricing and other matters. Accordingly, Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes it is reasonably possible that its existing unrecognized tax benefits
may be reduced by an amount up to $122 million within the next 12 months.

Hewlett
Packard Enterprise is subject to income tax in the U.S. and approximately 105 other countries and is subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these
jurisdictions. In addition, HPI is subject to numerous ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. The IRS is conducting an audit of former parent's 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and
2014 income tax returns. Former parent has received from the IRS Notices of Deficiency for its fiscal 1999, 2000, 2003, 2004 and 2005 tax years, and Revenue Agent Reports ("RAR") for its fiscal 2001,
2002, 2006, 2007 and



HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 6: Taxes on Earnings (Continued)

tax years. The proposed IRS adjustments for these tax years would, if sustained, reduce the benefits of refund claims the former parent has filed for net operating loss carrybacks to earlier
fiscal years and tax credit carryforwards to subsequent years by approximately $445 million. In addition, HPI expects the IRS to issue an RAR for 2009 through 2011 relating to certain tax
positions taken on the filed tax returns of the former parent HP Co., including matters related to the U.S. taxation of certain intercompany loans. While the RAR may be material in amount, the
HPI believes it has valid positions supporting its tax returns and, if necessary, it will vigorously defend such matters.

Former
parent HP Co., has filed petitions with the U.S. Tax Court regarding certain proposed IRS adjustments regarding tax years 1999 through 2003 and is continuing to contest
additional adjustments proposed by the IRS for other tax years. The U.S. Tax Court ruled in May 2012 against Parent regarding one of the IRS adjustments for which former parent has filed a formal
Notice of Appeal. The Court proceedings are expected to begin in fiscal 2016.

Pre-acquisition
tax years of former parent's U.S. group of subsidiaries providing enterprise services through 2004 have been audited by the IRS, and all proposed adjustments have been
resolved. RARs have been received for tax years 2005, 2006, 2007 and the short period ended August 26, 2008, proposing total tax deficiencies of $274 million. Parent is contesting
certain of these issues.

The
IRS began an audit in fiscal 2013 of the 2010 income tax return for former parent's U.S. group of subsidiaries providing enterprise services, and has issued an RAR for the short
period ended October 31, 2008 and the period ending October 31, 2009 proposing a total tax deficiency of $62 million. HPI is contesting certain of these issues.

With
respect to major foreign and state tax jurisdictions, former parent is no longer subject to tax authority examinations for years prior to 1999. Former parent is subject to a foreign
tax audit concerning an intercompany transaction for fiscal 2009. The relevant taxing authority has proposed an assessment of approximately $733 million. HPI is contesting this proposed
assessment.

Hewlett
Packard Enterprise believes it has provided adequate reserves for all tax deficiencies or reductions in tax benefits that could result from federal, state and foreign tax audits.
The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of the Company's tax provision. The Company adjusts its uncertain tax positions to reflect
the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular audit. However, income tax audits are inherently unpredictable
and there can be no assurance that the Company's will accurately predict the outcome of these audits. The amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the
amounts previously included in the Provision for taxes and therefore the resolution of one or more of these uncertainties in any particular period could have a material impact on net earnings or cash
flows.

Hewlett
Packard Enterprise has not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on $27.6 billion of undistributed earnings from non-U.S. operations as of
October 31, 2015 because the Company intends to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside of the U.S. If the Company were to distribute these earnings, foreign tax credits may become
available under current law to reduce the resulting U.S. income tax liability. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable. The
Company will remit non-indefinitely reinvested earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries for which deferred U.S. federal and withholding taxes have been

provided
where excess cash has accumulated and the Company determines that it is advantageous for business operations, tax or cash management reasons.

Deferred Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting
and tax purposes. For purposes of the Company's Combined and Consolidated Balance Sheets for periods prior to the separation, deferred tax balances and tax carryforwards and credits have been recorded
under the Separate Return Method. The deferred tax balances reflected in the Company's Combined and Consolidated Balance Sheets in the periods presented have been recorded on a consolidated return
basis and include tax attributes allocated to the Company at the time of the separation. The inclusion of these tax attributes resulted in tax carryforwards and credits, which generated higher
deferred income tax assets for the Company as of the periods presented.

The

The
Company periodically engages in intercompany advanced royalty payment and licensing arrangements that may result in advance payments between subsidiaries in different tax
jurisdictions. When the local tax treatment of the intercompany licensing arrangements differs from U.S. GAAP treatment, deferred taxes are recognized. During fiscal 2015, the Company executed
intercompany advanced royalty payment arrangements resulting in advanced payments of $5.0 billion, while during fiscal 2014, the Company executed a multi-year intercompany licensing arrangement
and an intercompany advanced royalty payment arrangement which resulted in combined advanced payments of $7.8 billion, the result of which was the recognition of $1.1 billion net U.S.
deferred tax assets in fiscal 2014. In these transactions, the payments were received in the U.S. from a foreign consolidated affiliate, with a deferral of intercompany revenues over the term of the
arrangements, approximately 5 years and 15 years, respectively. Intercompany royalty revenue and the amortization expense related to the licensing rights are eliminated in consolidation.

Separation
costs are expenses associated with former parent's plan to separate into two independent publicly-traded companies. The former parent recorded a deferred tax asset on these
costs and expenses as they are incurred through fiscal 2015. We expect a portion of these deferred tax assets associated with separation costs and expenses will be non-deductible expenses, at the time
the separation is executed. Furthermore, the former parent also concluded on the legal form of the separation and announced that the Company will be the spinnee in the U.S. Accordingly, during the
second half of fiscal 2015, the former parent implemented certain internal reorganizations of, and transactions among, its wholly owned subsidiaries and operating activities in preparation for the
legal form of separation. As a result, the former parent recorded adjustments to certain deferred and prepaid tax assets as well as income tax liabilities reflecting the impact of separation related
activities.

As
of October 31, 2015, the Hewlett Packard Enterprise had $348 million, $867 million and $5.7 billion of federal, state and foreign net operating loss
carryforwards, respectively. Amounts included in state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2016 and amounts included in federal net operating loss carryforwards will
begin to expire in 2023. Hewlett Packard Enterprise has provided a valuation allowance of $6 million and $1.3 billion for deferred tax assets related to state and foreign net operating
losses carryforwards, respectively.

Total
valuation allowances decreased by $1.7 billion and increased $718 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in fiscal 2015 was due primarily to the
release of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in the U.S., and the increase in fiscal 2014 was due primarily to foreign net operating losses.

Tax Matters Agreement and Other Income Tax Matters

In connection with the separation from Parent, the Company entered into a Tax Matters Agreement with HP Inc., formerly
Hewlett-Packard Company. See Note 18, "Guarantees, Indemnifications and Warranties", for a full description of these Tax Matter Agreement.

expense was $3.1 billion in fiscal 2015, and $3.2 billion for both fiscal 2014 and 2013. The change in gross property, plant and equipment in fiscal 2015 was
due primarily to transfers from parent of $4.0 billion, purchases of $3.4 billion and unfavorable currency impacts of $0.5 billion, the effects of which were partially offset by
sales and retirements totaling $2.5 billion. In fiscal 2015, accumulated depreciation associated with the assets transferred from parent was $2.2 billion and with assets sold and retired
was $2.1 billion.

Credit Quality Indicators

Due to the homogenous nature of its leasing transactions, the Company manages its financing receivables on an aggregate basis when
assessing and monitoring credit risk. Credit risk is generally diversified due to the large number of entities comprising the Company's customer base and their dispersion across many different
industries and geographic regions. The Company evaluates the credit quality of an obligor at lease inception and monitors that credit quality over the term of a transaction. The Company assigns risk
ratings to each lease based on the creditworthiness of the obligor and other variables that augment or mitigate the inherent credit risk of a particular transaction. Such variables include the
underlying value and liquidity of the collateral, the essential use of the equipment, the term of the lease, and the inclusion of credit enhancements, such as guarantees, letters of credit or security
deposits.

Accounts
rated low risk typically have the equivalent of a Standard & Poor's rating of BBB– or higher, while accounts rated moderate risk generally have the
equivalent of BB+ or lower. The Company classifies accounts as high risk when it considers the financing receivable to be impaired or when management believes there is a significant
near-term risk of impairment.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts for financing receivables is comprised of a general reserve and a specific reserve. The Company
maintains general reserve percentages on a regional basis and bases such percentages on several factors, including consideration of historical credit losses and portfolio delinquencies, trends in the
overall weighted-average risk rating of the portfolio, current economic conditions and information derived from competitive benchmarking. The Company excludes accounts evaluated as part of the
specific reserve from the general reserve analysis. The Company establishes a specific reserve for financing receivables with identified exposures, such as customer defaults, bankruptcy or other
events, that make it unlikely the Company will recover its investment. For individually evaluated receivables, the Company determines the expected cash flow for the receivable, which includes
consideration of estimated proceeds from disposition of the collateral, and calculates an estimate of the potential loss and the probability of loss. For those accounts where a loss is considered
probable, the Company records a specific reserve. The Company generally writes off a receivable or records a specific reserve when a receivable becomes 180 days past due, or sooner if the
Company determines that the receivable is not collectible.

Non-Accrual and Past-Due Financing Receivables

The Company considers a financing receivable to be past due when the minimum payment is not received by the contractually specified due
date. The Company generally places financing receivables on non-accrual status, which is suspension of interest accrual, and considers such receivables to be non-performing at the earlier of the time
at which full payment of principal and interest becomes doubtful or the receivable becomes 90 days past due. Subsequently, the Company may recognize revenue on non-accrual financing receivables
as payments are received, which is on a cash basis, if the Company deems the recorded financing receivable to be fully collectible; however, if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of
the recorded financing receivable, all cash receipts are applied to the carrying amount of the financing receivable, which is the cost recovery method. In certain circumstances, such as when the
Company deems a delinquency to be of an administrative
nature, financing receivables may accrue interest after becoming 90 days past due. The non-accrual status of a financing receivable may not impact a customer's risk rating. After all of a
customer's delinquent principal and interest balances are settled, the Company may return the related financing receivable to accrual status.

Note 9: Acquisitions and Divestitures

Acquisitions

In fiscal 2015, the Company completed five acquisitions. The purchase price allocation for these acquisitions as set forth in the table
below reflects various preliminary fair value estimates and analyses, including preliminary work performed by third-party valuation specialists, which are subject to change within the measurement
period as valuations are finalized. The primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate to the fair values of certain tangible assets and liabilities
acquired, the valuation of intangible assets acquired, certain legal matters, income and non-income based taxes, and residual goodwill. The Company expects to continue to obtain information to assist
it in determining the fair value of the net assets acquired at the acquisition date during the measurement period. Measurement period adjustments that the Company determines to be material will be
applied retrospectively to the period of acquisition in the Company's combined financial statements and, depending on the nature of the adjustments, other periods subsequent to the period of
acquisition could also be affected.

Pro
forma results of operations for these acquisitions have not been presented because they are not material to the Company's combined and consolidated results of operations, either
individually or in the aggregate. Goodwill, which represents the excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and intangible assets acquired, is not deductible for tax purposes.

The
following table presents the aggregate purchase price allocation, including those items that are still preliminary allocations, for the Company's acquisitions for the fiscal period
ended October 31, 2015:

Acquisition of Aruba

The Company's largest acquisition in fiscal 2015 was Aruba, which was completed in May 2015. Aruba is a leading provider of
next-generation network access solutions for the mobile enterprise. The Company reports the financial results of Aruba's business in the Networking business unit within the EG segment. The acquisition
date fair value of consideration of $2.8 billion consisted of cash paid for outstanding common stock, vested in-the-money stock awards and the estimated fair value of earned unvested stock
awards assumed by the Company. In connection with this acquisition, the Company recorded approximately $1.8 billion of goodwill, $643 million of intangible assets and $153 million
of in-process research and development. The Company is amortizing intangible assets on a straight-line basis over an estimated weighted-average life of six years.

Acquisitions in Prior Year

In fiscal 2014, the Company completed two acquisitions with a combined purchase price of $55 million, of which
$12 million was recorded as goodwill and $25 million was recorded as intangible

assets
related to these acquisitions. In fiscal 2013, MphasiS Limited, a majority-owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired Digital Risk LLC for $174 million. The Company recorded
$112 million of goodwill and $48 million of intangible assets related to this acquisition.

Divestitures

In fiscal 2015, the Company completed four divestitures which resulted in $140 million of proceeds. These divestitures include
the sale of its LiveVault and iManage businesses, which were previously reported within the Software segment. The gains associated with these divestitures were included in Selling, general and
administrative expense on the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

In
May 2015, the Company and Tsinghua Holdings jointly announced a partnership that will bring together the Chinese enterprise technology assets of the Company and Tsinghua University to
create a Chinese provider of technology infrastructure. Under the definitive agreement, Tsinghua Holdings' subsidiary, Unisplendour Corporation, will purchase 51% of a new business called H3C,
comprising the Company's current H3C Technologies and China-based server, storage and technology services businesses, for approximately $2.3 billion. The Company's China subsidiary will
maintain 100% ownership of its existing China-based Enterprise Services, Software and Helion Cloud businesses. Once the transaction closes, the new H3C will be the exclusive provider for the Company's
server, storage and networking portfolio, as well as the Company's exclusive hardware support services provider in China, customized for that market. The transaction is expected to close in the first
quarter of fiscal 2016, subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.

In
October 2015, the Company signed a definitive agreement with Trend Micro International to sell the TippingPoint business for approximately $300 million. TippingPoint is a
provider of next-generation intrusion prevention systems and related network security solutions. The results of TippingPoint are recorded within the Software segment. The transaction is expected to
close during the Company's first fiscal quarter 2016, subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.

(2)

In
connection with the separation, Parent will retain the marketing optimization software product group, a continuing business which has
historically been managed by the Company and included in the Software segment. The adjustment reflects the impact of removing the related goodwill of $512 million allocated on a relative fair
value basis from Parent.

(3)

Goodwill
is net of accumulated impairment losses of $13.7 billion, which were recorded prior to October 31, 2013. Of that
amount, $8.0 billion relates to the ES segment and the remaining $5.7 billion relates to Software.

Goodwill Impairments

Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. As of October 31, 2015, the Company's reporting units are
consistent with the reportable segments identified in Note 2, "Segment Information", except for ES, which includes two reporting units: (1) MphasiS Limited and (2) the remainder
of ES. Based on the results of the Company's annual impairment tests for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 the Company determined that no impairment of goodwill existed.

For
fiscal 2015, the decrease in gross intangible assets was due primarily to $703 million of intangible assets that became fully amortized and have been eliminated from gross
intangible assets and accumulated amortization and the impact of removing intangible assets related to the marketing optimization software product group which was retained by Parent. The decrease was
partially offset by intangible assets and in-process research and development resulting from the Company's acquisitions, primarily the acquisition of Aruba. For fiscal 2014, $833 million of
intangible assets became fully amortized and have been eliminated from gross intangible assets and accumulated amortization.

As
of October 31, 2015, the weighted-average remaining useful lives of the Company's finite-lived intangible assets were as follows:

Note 11: Fair Value

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date.

Fair Value Hierarchy

The Company uses valuation techniques that are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs are developed using
market data such as publicly available information and reflect the assumptions market participants would use, while unobservable inputs are developed using the best information available about the
assumptions market participants would use. Assets and liabilities are classified in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement:

Level 1—Quoted
prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2—Quoted
prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active,
inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and market-corroborated inputs.

Level 3—Unobservable
inputs for the asset or liability.

The
fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to observable inputs and lowest priority to unobservable inputs.

For
the year ended October 31, 2015 and 2014, there were no material transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy.

Valuation Techniques

Cash Equivalents and Investments:    The Company holds time deposits, money market funds, mutual funds, other debt securities
primarily consisting of corporate and foreign government notes and bonds, and common stock and equivalents. The Company values cash equivalents and equity investments using quoted market prices,
alternative pricing sources, including NAV, or models utilizing market observable inputs. The fair value of debt investments was based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using inputs
primarily derived from or corroborated by observable market data, and, in certain instances, valuation models that utilize assumptions which cannot be corroborated with observable market data.

Derivative
Instruments:    The Company uses forward contracts, interest rate and total return swaps to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures. The Company
uses industry standard valuation models to measure fair value. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to present value using market-based observable
inputs, including interest rate curves, the Company and counterparty credit risk, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot



HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 11: Fair Value (Continued)

prices
for currencies and interest rates. See Note 12, "Financial Instruments", for a further discussion of the Company's use of derivative instruments.

Other Fair Value Disclosures

Short- and Long-Term Debt:    The Company estimates the fair value of its debt primarily using an expected present value
technique, which is based on observable market inputs using interest rates currently available to companies of similar credit standing for similar terms and remaining maturities, and considering its
own credit risk. The portion of the Company's debt that is hedged is reflected in the Combined and Consolidated Balance Sheets as an amount equal to the debt's carrying amount and a fair value
adjustment representing changes in the fair value of the hedged debt obligations arising from movements in benchmark interest rates. The estimated fair value of the Company's short- and long-term debt
approximated its carrying value of $15.8 billion and $1.4 billion as of October 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. If measured at fair value in the Combined and Consolidated Balance
Sheets, short- and long-term debt would be classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

Other
Financial Instruments:    For the balance of the Company's financial instruments, primarily accounts receivable, accounts payable and financial liabilities included in
other accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities. If measured at fair value in the Combined and Consolidated Balance Sheets, these other financial
instruments would be classified in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

Non-Marketable
Equity Investments and Non-Financial Assets:    The Company's non-marketable equity investments and non-financial assets, such as intangible assets, goodwill and
property, plant and equipment, are recorded at fair value in the period an impairment charge is recognized. If measured at fair value in the Combined and Consolidated Balance Sheets, these would
generally be classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. In fiscal 2015, the Company determined that it would exit certain data centers. The Company conducted an analysis of the
respective asset group to determine if the carrying value was greater than the fair value. As a result of this assessment, the Company recorded a $136 million impairment charge to Impairment of
data center assets on the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

All
highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition are considered cash equivalents. As of October 31, 2015 and 2014, the
carrying amount of cash equivalents approximated fair value due to the short period of time to maturity. Interest income related to cash, cash equivalents and debt securities was approximately
$54 million in fiscal 2015, $64 million in fiscal 2014 and $72 million in fiscal 2013. Time deposits were primarily issued by institutions outside the U.S. as of
October 31, 2015 and 2014. The estimated fair value of the available-for-sale investments may not be representative of values that will be realized in the future.

The
gross unrealized loss as of October 31, 2015 was due primarily to a decline in the fair value of a debt security of $13 million that has been in a continuous loss
position for more than twelve months. There was no gross unrealized loss as of October 31, 2014.

Equity
securities in privately held companies include cost basis and equity method investments and are included in Long-term financing receivables and other assets in the Combined and
Consolidated Balance Sheets. These investments amounted to $45 million and $90 million at October 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Derivative Instruments

The Company is a global company exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate changes in the normal course
of its business. As part of its risk management strategy, the Company uses derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts, interest rate swaps, total return swaps to hedge certain foreign
currency, interest rate and, to a lesser extent, equity exposures. The Company's objective is to offset gains and losses resulting from these exposures with losses and gains on the derivative
contracts used to hedge them, thereby reducing volatility of earnings or protecting the fair value of assets and liabilities. The Company does not have any leveraged derivatives and does not use
derivative contracts for speculative purposes. The Company may designate its derivative contracts as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment
in a foreign operation ("net investment hedges"). Additionally, for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, the Company categorizes those economic hedges as other derivatives. Derivative
instruments directly attributable to the Company are recognized at fair value in the Combined and Consolidated Balance Sheets. The change in fair value of the derivative instruments is recognized in
the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Earnings or Combined and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income dependent upon the type of hedge as further discussed below. The Company classifies
cash flows from its derivative programs with the activities that correspond to the underlying hedged items in the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

As
a result of its use of derivative instruments, the Company is exposed to the risk that its counterparties will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate counterparty
credit risk, the Company has a policy of only entering into derivative contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions based on their credit ratings and other factors, and the Company
maintains dollar risk limits that correspond to each financial institution's credit rating and other factors. The Company's established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk include
reviewing and establishing limits for credit exposure and periodically reassessing the creditworthiness of its counterparties. Through October 31, 2015, the Company participated in Parent's
master netting agreements, which further mitigated credit exposure to counterparties by permitting the Company to net amounts due from the Company to counterparty against amounts due to the Company
from the same counterparty under



HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 12: Financial Instruments (Continued)

certain
conditions. From and after November 1, 2015, in connection with the separation, all of the Company's contracts are transacted under its own master netting agreements.

To
further mitigate credit exposure to counterparties, through October 31, 2015, the Company participated in Parent's collateral security agreements, which allow the Company to
hold collateral from, or require the Company to post collateral to, counterparties when aggregate derivative fair values exceed contractually established thresholds which are generally based on the
credit ratings of Parent and its counterparties. If Parent's credit rating falls below a specified credit rating, the counterparty has the right to request full collateralization of the derivatives'
net liability position. Conversely, if the counterparty's credit rating falls below a specified credit rating, the Parent has the right to request full collateralization of the derivatives' net
liability position. From and after November 1, 2015, in connection with the separation, the Company transacts all contracts under its own collateral security agreements where the contractually
established threshold are based on the Company's credit ratings. Collateral is generally posted within two business days. The fair value of the Company's derivatives with credit contingent features in
a net liability position was $35 million and $0.2 million at October 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, all of which were fully collateralized within two business days.

Under
the Company's derivative contracts, the counterparty can terminate all outstanding trades following a covered change of control event affecting the Company that results in the
surviving entity being rated below a specified credit rating. This credit contingent provision did not affect the Company's financial position or cash flows as of October 31, 2015 and 2014.

Fair Value Hedges

The Company issues long-term debt in U.S. dollars based on market conditions at the time of financing. The Company may enter into fair
value hedges, such as interest rate swaps, to reduce the exposure of its debt portfolio to changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates by achieving a primarily U.S. dollar
LIBOR-based floating interest expense. The swap transactions generally involve principal and interest obligations for U.S. dollar-denominated amounts. Alternatively, the Company may choose not to swap
fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if it believes a larger proportion of fixed-rate debt would be beneficial. When investing in fixed-rate instruments,
the Company may enter into interest rate swaps that convert the fixed interest payments into variable interest payments and may designate these swaps as fair value hedges.

In
fiscal 2015, concurrent with issuance of senior notes, the Company entered into interest rate swaps to reduce the exposure of $9.5 billion of aggregate principal amount of
fixed rate senior notes to changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates by achieving LIBOR-based floating interest expense. See Note 13, "Borrowing", for more information
related to issuance of senior notes.

For
derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the Company recognizes the change in fair value of the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting
change in the fair value of the hedged item, in Interest and other, net in the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the period of change.

Cash Flow Hedges

The Company uses forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent
in its forecasted net revenue and, to a lesser extent, cost of sales,



HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 12: Financial Instruments (Continued)

operating
expenses, and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company's foreign currency cash flow hedges mature generally within twelve months; however, forward
contracts associated with sales-type and direct-financing leases and intercompany loans extend for the duration of the lease or loan term, which typically range from two to five years.

For
derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the Company initially records changes in fair value for the effective portion of the derivative instrument
in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of equity in the Combined and Consolidated Balance Sheets and subsequently reclassifies these amounts into earnings in the period during
which the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. The Company reports the effective portion of its cash flow hedges in the same financial statement line item as changes in the fair value of the
hedged item.

Net Investment Hedges

The Company uses forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries whose
functional currency is the local currency. The Company records the effective portion of such derivative instruments together with changes in the fair value of the hedged items in Cumulative
translation adjustment as a separate component of Equity in the Combined and Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Other Derivatives

Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist primarily of forward contracts used to hedge foreign
currency-denominated balance sheet exposures. The Company also uses total return swaps and, to a lesser extent, interest rate swaps, based on equity or fixed income indices, to hedge its executive
deferred compensation plan liability.

For
derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, the Company recognizes changes in fair value of the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting change in the fair
value of the hedged item, in Interest and other net in the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the period of change.

Hedge Effectiveness

For interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges, the Company measures hedge effectiveness by offsetting the change in fair
value of the hedged items with the change in fair value of the derivative. For forward contracts designated as cash flow or net investment hedges, the Company measures hedge effectiveness by comparing
the cumulative change in fair value of the hedge contract with the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item, both of which are based on forward rates. The Company recognizes any ineffective
portion of the hedge in the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the same period in which ineffectiveness occurs. Amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in
the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the period they arise.

Offsetting of Derivative Instruments

The Company recognizes all derivative instruments on a gross basis in the Combined and Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of
October 31, 2015, the Company participated in Parent's master netting arrangements and collateral security arrangements. From and after November 1, 2015, in connection with the
separation, the Company's derivative instruments are subject to its own master netting arrangements and collateral security arrangements. The Company does not offset the fair value of its derivative
instruments against the fair value of cash collateral posted under collateral security agreements. As of October 31, 2015 and 2014, information related to the potential effect of the Company's
use of the master netting agreements and collateral security agreements was as follows:

Note 12: Financial Instruments (Continued)

As
of October 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 no portion of the hedging instruments' gain or loss was excluded from the assessment of effectiveness for fair value, cash flow or net
investment hedges. Hedge ineffectiveness for fair value, cash flow and net investment hedges was not material for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013.

As
of October 31, 2015, the Company expects to reclassify an estimated net Accumulated other comprehensive gain of approximately $66 million, net of taxes, to earnings in
the next twelve months along with the earnings effects of the related forecasted transactions associated with cash flow hedges.

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 13: Borrowings (Continued)

Hewlett Packard Enterprise Senior Notes

On October 9, 2015, Hewlett Packard Enterprise completed its offering of $14.0 billion of fixed rate notes and
$0.6 billion of floating rate notes, with the interest rate and maturity date described in the table above.

The
Notes are Hewlett Packard Enterprise's senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's existing and future senior unsecured
indebtedness. The Notes were initially guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by HP Co., which guarantee was automatically and unconditionally released upon HP Co.'s distribution of all
of the outstanding shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise common stock to HP Co.'s shareholders on November 1, 2015, in connection with the separation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise from
HP Co. (the "Distribution"), and beneficial ownership of substantially all of the assets intended to be included in Hewlett Packard Enterprise were transferred to Hewlett Packard Enterprise.

Hewlett
Packard Enterprise distributed approximately $14.5 billion of net proceeds from the Notes offering to HP Co. HP Co. utilized the net proceeds to fund
repurchases and redemptions of its outstanding senior notes, and to repay other indebtedness, to facilitate the separation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise from HP Co.

The
Company incurred issuance costs of $54 million which are included in other assets in the Combined and Consolidated Balance Sheets and are being amortized to interest expense
over the term of the Notes.

As
disclosed in Note 12, "Financial Instruments", the Company uses interest rate swaps to mitigate the exposure of its debt portfolio to changes in fair value resulting from
changes in interest rates by achieving a primarily U.S. dollar LIBOR-based floating interest expense. Concurrent with the issuance of the senior notes, Hewlett Packard Enterprise entered into interest
rate swaps to reduce the exposure of $9.5 billion of aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior notes to changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates by achieving
LIBOR-based floating interest expense. Interest rates on long-term debt in the table above have not been adjusted to reflect the impact of any interest rate swaps.

Available Borrowing Resources

The Company had the following resources available to obtain short- or long-term financing if additional liquidity is needed:

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 13: Borrowings (Continued)

Enterprise's
subsidiaries are authorized to issue up to an additional $500 million in aggregate principal amount of commercial paper. Hewlett Packard Enterprise maintains two commercial paper
programs, and a wholly-owned subsidiary maintains a third program. Hewlett Packard Enterprise's U.S. program provides for the issuance of U.S. dollar-denominated commercial paper up to a maximum
aggregate principal amount of $4.0 billion. Hewlett Packard Enterprise's euro commercial paper program provides for the issuance of commercial paper outside of the U.S. denominated in U.S.
dollars, euros or British pounds up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion or the equivalent in those alternative currencies. The combined aggregate principal amount of
commercial paper outstanding under those programs at any one time cannot exceed the $4.0 billion authorized by Hewlett Packard Enterprise's Board of Directors. The Hewlett Packard Enterprise
subsidiary's euro Commercial Paper/Certificate of Deposit Program provides for the issuance of commercial paper in various currencies of up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of
$500 million.

Revolving Credit Facility

On November 1, 2015, the Company entered into a revolving credit facility (the "Credit Agreement"), together with the lenders
named therein, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ("JPMorgan"), as co-administrative agent and administrative processing agent, and Citibank, N.A., as co-administrative agent, providing for a senior, unsecured
revolving credit facility with aggregate
lending commitments of $4.0 billion. Loans under the revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes. Commitments under the Credit Agreement are available for a period of
five years, which period may be extended, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, by up to two one-year periods. Commitment Fees, interest rates and other terms of borrowing under the credit
facility vary based on Hewlett Packard Enterprise's external credit rating.

Future maturities of long-term debt

As of October 31, 2015, aggregate future maturities of the Company's long-term debt at face value (excluding a fair value
adjustment related to hedged debt of $55 million, a net discount on debt issuance of $4 million), including capital lease obligations were as follows:

HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 14: Related Party Transactions and Parent Company Investment (Continued)

Allocation of Corporate Expenses

The Combined and Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income include an allocation of general corporate expenses from
Parent for certain management and support functions which are provided on a centralized basis within Parent. These management and support functions include, but are not limited to, executive
management, finance, legal, information technology, employee benefits administration, treasury, risk management, procurement, and other shared services. These allocations were made on a direct usage
basis when identifiable, with the remainder allocated on the basis of revenue, expenses, headcount or other relevant measures. These allocations were $3.6 billion, $4.2 billion and
$4.2 billion in each of fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.

Management
of the Company and Parent consider these allocations to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services by, or the benefits provided to, the Company. These
allocations may not, however, reflect the expense the Company would have incurred as a standalone company for the periods presented. Actual costs that may have been incurred if the Company had been a
standalone company would depend on a number of factors, including the chosen organizational structure, what functions were outsourced or performed by employees and strategic decisions made in areas

Dividends

On November 11, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a regular quarterly cash dividend for its common stock.
The Board of Directors further authorized a regular quarterly cash dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2016, payable on January 6, 2016 to holders of record of its outstanding common stock
on December 9, 2015, in the amount of $0.055 per share.

Share Repurchase Program

On October 13, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company announced the authorization of a $3.0 billion share repurchase
program. The Company may choose to repurchase shares when sufficient liquidity exists and the shares are trading at a discount relative to estimated intrinsic value. This program, which does not have
a specific expiration date, authorizes repurchases in the open market or in private transactions.

Note 16: Net Earnings Per Share

The Company calculated basic net EPS using the net earnings and number of Hewlett-Packard Company shares outstanding as of October 31, 2015. On November 1, 2015, the
distribution date, Hewlett-Packard Company shareholders received one share of HPE common stock for every share of Hewlett-Packard Company common stock held as of the record date on October 21,
2015.

Diluted
net EPS includes the weighted-average dilutive effect of restricted stock awards, stock options and performance-based awards. The Company calculates the weighted-average dilutive
effect of employee stock plans after conversion, by multiplying the dilutive Hewlett-Packard Company stock-based awards for the year ended October 31, 2015, attributable to HPE employees with
the price conversion ratio used to convert those awards to equivalent units of HPE awards on the separation date. The price conversion ratio was calculated using the closing price of Hewlett-Packard
Company common shares on October 31, 2015 divided by the opening price of HPE common shares on November 2, 2015.

The
Company considers restricted stock that provide the holder with a non-forfeitable right to receive dividends to be participating
securities. As of October 31, 2015, there was no restricted stock outstanding. For fiscal 2014 and 2013, net earnings allocated to participating securities were not significant.

(2)

For
comparative purposes, the same number of shares used to compute basic and diluted net earnings per share for the period ended
October 31, 2015 is used in the calculation of net earnings per share for all periods presented.

(3)

The
Company excludes stock awards where the assumed proceeds exceed the average market price from the calculation of diluted net EPS, because
their effect would be anti-dilutive. The assumed proceeds of a stock award includes the sum of its exercise price (if the award is an option), average unrecognized compensation cost and excess tax
benefit. The Company's anti-dilutive shares were calculated based on Hewlett-Packard Company anti-dilutive awards for the fiscal period ended October 31, 2015 attributable to HPE employees,
with the price conversion ratio used to convert those awards to equivalent units of HPE awards on the distribution date. The price conversion ratio was calculated using the closing price of
Hewlett-Packard Company common shares on October 31, 2015 divided by the opening price of HPE common shares on November 2, 2015.



HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 17: Litigation and Contingencies

Hewlett Packard Enterprise is involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings including those consisting of IP, commercial, securities, employment, employee benefits
and environmental matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business. In addition, as part of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Company and HP Inc. agreed to cooperate with
each other
in managing certain existing litigation related to both parties' businesses. The Separation and Distribution Agreement also included provisions that assign to the parties responsibility for managing
pending and future litigation related to the general corporate matters of HP Inc. arising prior to the separation. Hewlett Packard Enterprise records a liability when it believes that it is
both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability of having incurred a liability
and the estimated amount of the liability. Hewlett Packard Enterprise reviews these matters at least quarterly and adjusts these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements,
rulings, advice of legal counsel and other updated information and events pertaining to a particular matter. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However, Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes it has
valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us. Nevertheless, cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or
more of these contingencies. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes it has recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and, as of October 31, 2015, it was not reasonably possible that a
material loss had been incurred in connection with such matters in excess of the amounts recognized in its financial statements.

Litigation, Proceedings and Investigations

Fair Labor Standards Act Litigation.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise is involved in several pre-separation lawsuits in which
the plaintiffs are seeking unpaid overtime compensation and other damages based on allegations that various employees of Electronic Data Systems Corporation ("EDS") or HP Inc. have been
misclassified as exempt employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act (the "FLSA") and/or in violation of the California Labor Code or other state laws. Those matters include the
following:

•

Cunningham and Cunningham, et al. v. Electronic Data Systems
Corporation

is a purported collective action filed on May 10, 2006 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York claiming that
current and former EDS employees allegedly involved in installing and/or maintaining computer software and hardware were misclassified as exempt employees. Another purported collective action,

Steavens, et al. v. Electronic
Data Systems Corporation

, was filed on October 23, 2007 in the same court alleging
similar facts. The

Steavens

case was consolidated for pretrial purposes with the

Cunningham

case. On December 14, 2010, the court
granted conditional certification of a class consisting of
employees in 20 legacy EDS job codes in the consolidated

Cunningham/Steavens

matter. On December 11, 2013,
HP Inc. and plaintiffs' counsel in the consolidated

Cunningham/Steavens

matter, and the

Salva

matter described below, mediated these
cases and reached a settlement agreement. The court approved the settlement on
June 16, 2015 and HP Inc. funded the settlement on July 27, 2015.

•

Salva v. Hewlett-Packard Company

is a purported
collective action filed on June 15, 2012 in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York alleging that certain information technology employees allegedly involved in
installing and/or maintaining computer software and hardware were misclassified as exempt employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act. On December 11, 2013, HP Inc. and plaintiffs'
counsel in the consolidated

Cunningham/Steavens

matter and the

Salva

matter mediated these cases and reached a settlement agreement.

Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 17: Litigation and Contingencies (Continued)

The
court consolidated the

Salva

matter into the

Cunningham/Steavens

matter and approved the settlement on June 16, 2015. HP Inc.
funded the settlement on
July 27, 2015.

•

Karlbom, et al. v. Electronic Data Systems Corporation

is
a class action filed on March 16, 2009 in California Superior Court alleging facts similar to the

Cunningham

and

Steavens

matters. On
October 30, 2015, plaintiffs filed a motion to certify a Rule 23 state class of all
California-based EDS employees in the Infrastructure Associate, Infrastructure Analyst, Infrastructure Specialist, and Infrastructure Specialist Senior job codes from March 16, 2005 through
October 31, 2009 that they claim were improperly classified as exempt from overtime under state law.

•

Benedict v. Hewlett-Packard Company

is a purported class
action filed on January 10, 2013 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that certain technical support employees allegedly involved in installing,
maintaining and/or supporting computer software and/or hardware for HP Inc. were misclassified as exempt employees under the FLSA. The plaintiff has also alleged that HP Inc. violated
California law by, among other things, allegedly improperly classifying these employees as exempt. On February 13, 2014, the court granted the plaintiff's motion for conditional class
certification. On May 7, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a motion to certify a Rule 23 state class of certain Technical Solutions Consultants in California, Massachusetts, and Colorado that
they claim were improperly classified as exempt from overtime under state law. On July 30, 2015, the court dismissed the Technology Consultant and certain Field Technical Support Consultant
opt-ins from the conditionally certified FLSA collective action.

India Directorate of Revenue Intelligence Proceedings

.

On April 30 and May 10, 2010, the India Directorate
of Revenue Intelligence (the "DRI") issued show cause notices to Hewlett-Packard India Sales Private Ltd ("HP India"), a subsidiary of HP Inc., seven HP India employees and one former HP
India employee alleging that HP India underpaid customs duties while importing products and spare parts into India and seeking to recover an aggregate of approximately $370 million, plus
penalties. Prior to the issuance of the show cause notices, HP India deposited approximately $16 million with the DRI and agreed to post a provisional bond in exchange for the DRI's agreement
to not seize HP India products and spare parts and to not interrupt the transaction of business by HP India.

On
April 11, 2012, the Bangalore Commissioner of Customs issued an order on the products-related show cause notice affirming certain duties and penalties against HP India and the
named individuals of approximately $386 million, of which HP India had already deposited $9 million. On December 11, 2012, HP India voluntarily deposited an additional
$10 million in connection with the products-related show cause notice. On April 20, 2012, the Commissioner issued an order on the parts-related show cause notice affirming certain duties
and penalties against HP India and certain of the named individuals of approximately $17 million, of which HP India had already deposited $7 million. After the order, HP India deposited
an additional $3 million in connection with the parts-related show cause notice so as to avoid certain penalties.

HP
India filed appeals of the Commissioner's orders before the Customs Tribunal along with applications for waiver of the pre-deposit of remaining demand amounts as a condition for
hearing the appeals. The Customs Department has also filed cross-appeals before the Customs Tribunal. On January 24, 2013, the Customs Tribunal ordered HP India to deposit an additional
$24 million against the products order, which HP India deposited in March 2013. The Customs Tribunal did not order any additional deposit to be made under the parts order. In December 2013, HP
India filed applications before the Customs Tribunal seeking early hearing of the appeals as well as an extension of the stay of



HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 17: Litigation and Contingencies (Continued)

deposit
as to HP India and the individuals already granted until final disposition of the appeals. On February 7, 2014, the application for extension of the stay of deposit was granted by the
Customs Tribunal until disposal of the appeals. On October 27, 2014, the Customs Tribunal commenced hearings on the cross-appeals of the Commissioner's orders. The Customs Tribunal rejected HP
India's request to remand the matter to the Commissioner on procedural grounds. The hearings scheduled to reconvene on April 6, 2015 and again on November 3, 2015 were cancelled at the
request of the Customs Tribunal. A new hearing date has not been set.

Russia GPO and Other Anti-Corruption Investigations

.

The German Public Prosecutor's Office ("German PPO") has
been conducting an investigation into allegations that current and former employees of HP Inc. engaged in bribery, embezzlement and tax evasion relating to a transaction between Hewlett-Packard
ISE GmbH in Germany, a former subsidiary of HP Inc., and the General Prosecutor's Office of the Russian Federation. The approximately €35 million transaction,
which was referred to as the Russia GPO deal, spanned the years 2001 to 2006 and was for the delivery and installation of an IT network. The German PPO issued an indictment of four individuals,
including one current and two former HP Inc. employees, on charges including bribery, breach of trust and tax evasion. The German PPO also requested that HP Inc. be made an associated
party to the case, and, if that request is granted, HP Inc. would participate in any portion of the court proceedings that could ultimately bear on the question of whether HP Inc. should
be subject to potential disgorgement of profits based on the conduct of the indicted current and former employees. The Regional Court of Leipzig will determine whether the matter should be admitted to
trial. The Polish Central Anti-Corruption Bureau is also investigating potential corrupt actions by a former employee of Hewlett-Packard Polska Sp. z o.o., an indirect subsidiary of HP Inc., in
connection with certain public-sector transactions in Poland. HP Inc. and the Company are cooperating with these investigating agencies.

ECT Proceedings

.

In January 2011, the postal service of Brazil, Empresa Brasileira de Correios e
Telégrafos ("ECT"), notified a former subsidiary of HP Inc. in Brazil ("HP Brazil") that it had initiated administrative proceedings to consider whether to suspend HP Brazil's
right to bid and contract with ECT related to alleged improprieties in the bidding and contracting processes whereby employees of HP Brazil and employees of several other companies allegedly
coordinated their bids and fixed results for three ECT contracts in 2007 and 2008. In late July 2011, ECT notified HP Brazil it had decided to apply the penalties against HP Brazil and suspend HP
Brazil's right to bid and contract with ECT for five years, based upon the evidence before it. In August 2011, HP Brazil appealed ECT's decision. In April 2013, ECT rejected HP Brazil's appeal, and
the administrative proceedings were closed with the penalties against HP Brazil remaining in place. In parallel, in September 2011, HP Brazil filed a civil action against ECT seeking to have ECT's
decision revoked. HP Brazil also requested an injunction suspending the application of the penalties until a final ruling on the merits of the case. The court of first instance has not issued a
decision on the merits of the case, but it has denied HP Brazil's request for injunctive relief. HP Brazil appealed the denial of its request for injunctive relief to the intermediate appellate court,
which issued a preliminary ruling denying the request for injunctive relief but reducing the length of the sanctions from five to two years. HP Brazil appealed that decision and, in December 2011,
obtained a ruling staying enforcement of ECT's sanctions until a final ruling on the merits of the case. Hewlett Packard Enterprise expects the decision may be issued in 2015 and any subsequent appeal
on the merits to last several years.

Cisco Systems

.

On August 21, 2015, Cisco Systems, Inc. ("Cisco Systems") and Cisco Systems Capital
Corporation ("Cisco Capital") filed an action in Santa Clara County Superior Court for declaratory judgment and breach of contract against HP Inc. in connection with a dispute arising out of a
third-party's termination of a services contract with HP Inc. As part of that third-party services contract, HP Inc. separately contracted with Cisco on an agreement to utilize Cisco
products and services. HP Inc. prepaid the entire amount due Cisco through a financing arrangement with Cisco Capital. Following the termination of HP Inc.'s services contract with the
third-party, HP Inc. no longer required Cisco's products and services, and, accordingly, exercised its contractual termination rights under the agreement with Cisco, and requested that Cisco
apply the appropriate credit toward the remaining balance owed Cisco Capital. This lawsuit relates to the calculation of that credit under the agreement between Cisco and HP Inc. Cisco contends
that after the credit is applied, HP Inc. still owes Cisco Capital approximately $58 million. HP Inc. contends that under a proper reading of the agreement, HP Inc. owes
nothing to Cisco Capital, and that Cisco owes significant amounts to HP Inc. No responsive pleadings will be filed until after a December 18, 2015 status conference with the court.

Abstrax Proceeding

.

On February 28, 2014, Abstrax, Inc. ("Abstrax"), a company with a principal place of
business in Mesa, Arizona, filed a patent infringement lawsuit against HP Inc. Abstrax claimed to market software for sales operations and manufacturing operations for configurable products,
including those in the custom shutter industry. The case was pending in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Marshall Division. Abstrax asserted one patent, U.S. Patent 6,240,328,
which is directed generally to a method of generating assembly instructions. In its complaint, Abstrax claimed that HP Inc.'s methods and processes of manufacturing configurable servers,
storage, networking devices, PCs, laptops, imaging and printing devices and their sub-systems infringe its patent, as do the products made by the accused processes. Abstrax also claimed that
HP Inc.'s alleged infringement was willful and that the case was exceptional. On November 14, 2014, HP Inc. filed a petition with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office challenging
the validity of the Abstrax patent based on prior art. In late January 2015, Abstrax dropped its infringement allegations against the manufacturing of PCs and imaging and printing devices from its
expert reports. On March 4, 2015, the court heard HP Inc.'s motion challenging the subject matter of the patent under 35 U.S.C. Section 101. Trial was scheduled for May 11,
2015. The parties reached a settlement in principle in early April, which was finalized on April 28, 2015. The parties agreed to file separate dismissal papers at the Patent Office to dismiss
HP Inc.'s challenge to the validity of patent. The district court litigation was dismissed on May 5, 2015. HP Inc.'s challenge to the validity of the patent was terminated on
May 18, 2015.

Stockholder Litigation

.

As described below, HP Inc. is involved in various stockholder litigation matters
commenced against certain current and former HP Inc. executive officers and/or certain current and former members of HP Inc.'s board of directors in which the plaintiffs are seeking to
recover damages related to HP Inc.'s allegedly inflated stock price, certain compensation paid by HP Inc. to the defendants, other damages and/or injunctive relief. As part of the
Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Company and HP Inc. have agreed to cooperate with each other in managing this pending litigation, as it relates to the general corporate matter of
HP Inc. arising prior to the separation:

HP Inc.'s
severance payments made to Mark Hurd (a former Chairman of HP Inc.'s board of directors and HP Inc.'s Chief Executive Officer), and HP Inc.'s acquisition of
3PAR Inc. The lawsuit also alleges violations of Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") in connection with HP Inc.'s 2010 and 2011 proxy
statements. On February 8, 2012, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit. On October 10, 2012, the court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss with leave to file an
amended complaint. On November 1, 2012, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint adding an unjust enrichment claim and claims that the defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange
Act and breached their fiduciary duties in connection with HP Inc.'s 2012 proxy statement. On December 13, 14 and 17, 2012, the defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint. On
December 28, 2012, the plaintiff moved for leave to file a third amended complaint. On May 6, 2013, the court denied the motion for leave to amend, granted the motions to dismiss
with prejudice and entered judgment in the defendants' favor. On May 31, 2013, the plaintiff filed an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On October 26,
2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the action.

•

A.J. Copeland v. Léo Apotheker, et al. ("Copeland
II")

is a lawsuit filed on February 10, 2014 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging, among other things,
that the defendants used their control over HP Inc. and its corporate suffrage process in effectuating, directly participating in and/or aiding and abetting violations of Section 14(a)
of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, and violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The complaint
asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, unjust enrichment, and breach of the duty of candor. The claims arise out of the circumstances at HP Inc. relating to its
2013 and 2014 proxy statements, the departure of Mr. Hurd as Chairman of HP Inc.'s board of directors and HP Inc.'s Chief Executive Officer, alleged violations of the FCPA, and
HP Inc.'s acquisition of 3PAR Inc. and Autonomy Corporation plc ("Autonomy"). On February 25, 2014, the court issued an order granting HP Inc.'s administrative

Cement & Concrete Workers District Council Pension Fund v. Hewlett-Packard Company, et
al.

is a putative securities class action filed on August 3, 2012 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging,
among other things, that from November 13, 2007 to August 6, 2010 the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act by making statements regarding
HP Inc.'s Standards of Business Conduct ("SBC") that were false and misleading because Mr. Hurd, who was serving as HP Inc.'s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer during that
period, had been violating the SBC and concealing his misbehavior in a manner that jeopardized his continued employment with HP Inc. On February 7, 2013, the defendants moved to dismiss
the amended complaint. On August 9, 2013, the court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss with leave to amend the complaint by September 9, 2013. The plaintiff filed an amended
complaint on September 9, 2013, and the defendants moved to dismiss that complaint on October 24, 2013. On June 25, 2014, the court issued an order granting the defendants'
motions to dismiss and on July 25, 2014, plaintiff filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On November 4, 2014, the plaintiff-appellant

Autonomy-Related Legal Matters

Investigations

.

As a result of the findings of an ongoing investigation, HP Inc. has provided information to the
U.K. Serious Fraud Office, the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") and the SEC related to the accounting improprieties, disclosure failures and misrepresentations at Autonomy that occurred prior to and
in connection with HP Inc.'s acquisition of Autonomy. On November 21, 2012, DOJ representatives advised HP Inc. that they had opened an investigation relating to Autonomy. On
February 6, 2013,
representatives of the U.K. Serious Fraud Office advised HP Inc. that they had also opened an investigation relating to Autonomy. On January 19, 2015, the U.K. Serious Fraud Office
notified HP Inc. that it was closing its investigation and had decided to cede jurisdiction of the investigation to the U.S. authorities. HP Inc. is cooperating with the DOJ and the SEC,
whose investigations are ongoing.

Litigation

.

As described below, HP Inc. is involved in various stockholder litigation relating to, among other
things, its October 2011 acquisition of Autonomy and its November 20, 2012 announcement that it recorded a non-cash charge for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets within its
Software segment of approximately $8.8 billion in the fourth quarter of its 2012 fiscal year and HP Inc.'s statements that, based on HP Inc.'s findings from an ongoing
investigation, the majority of this impairment charge related to accounting improprieties, misrepresentations to the market and disclosure failures at Autonomy that occurred prior to and in connection
with HP Inc.'s acquisition of Autonomy and the impact of those improprieties, failures and misrepresentations on the expected future financial performance of the Autonomy business over the long
term. This stockholder litigation was commenced against, among others, certain current and former HP Inc. executive officers, certain current and former members of HP Inc.'s board of
directors and certain advisors to HP Inc. The plaintiffs in these litigation matters are seeking to recover certain compensation paid by HP Inc. to the defendants and/or other damages.
As part of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Company and HP Inc. have agreed to cooperate with each other in managing this pending litigation, as it relates to the general
corporate matter of HP Inc. arising prior to the separation. These matters include the following:

•

In re HP Securities Litigation

consists of two
consolidated putative class actions filed on November 26 and 30, 2012 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging, among other things, that from
August 19, 2011 to November 20, 2012, the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act by concealing material information and making false statements related
to HP Inc.'s acquisition of Autonomy and the financial performance of HP Inc.'s enterprise services business. On May 3, 2013, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated complaint
alleging that, during that same period, all of the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5(b) by concealing material information and making
false statements related to HP Inc.'s acquisition of Autonomy and that certain defendants violated SEC Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) by engaging in a "scheme" to defraud investors. On
July 2, 2013, HP Inc. filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit. On November 26, 2013, the court granted in part and denied in part HP Inc.'s motion to dismiss, allowing claims
to proceed against HP Inc. and Margaret C. Whitman based on alleged statements and/or omissions made on or after May 23, 2012. The court dismissed all of the plaintiff's claims
that were based on alleged statements and/or omissions made between

In re Hewlett-Packard Shareholder Derivative Litigation

consists of seven consolidated lawsuits filed beginning on November 26, 2012 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging, among other things, that the
defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act by concealing material information and making false statements related to HP Inc.'s acquisition of Autonomy and the
financial performance of HP Inc.'s enterprise services business. The lawsuits also allege that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties, wasted corporate assets and were unjustly enriched
in connection with HP Inc.'s acquisition of Autonomy and by causing HP Inc. to repurchase its own stock at allegedly inflated prices between August 2011 and October 2012. One lawsuit
further alleges that certain individual defendants engaged in or assisted insider trading and thereby breached their fiduciary duties, were unjustly enriched and violated Sections 25402 and
25403 of the California Corporations Code. On May 3, 2013, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated complaint alleging, among other things, that the defendants concealed material information and
made false statements related to HP Inc.'s acquisition of Autonomy and Autonomy's Intelligent Data Operating Layer technology and thereby violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the
Exchange Act, breached their fiduciary duties, engaged in "abuse of control" over HP Inc., corporate waste and were unjustly enriched. The litigation was stayed until June 2014. The lead
plaintiff filed a stipulation of proposed settlement on June 30, 2014. The court declined to grant preliminary approval to this settlement, and, on December 19, 2014, also declined to
grant preliminary approval to a revised version of the settlement. On January 22, 2015, the lead plaintiff moved for preliminary approval of a further revised version of the settlement. On
March 13, 2015, the court issued an order granting preliminary approval to the settlement. On July 30, 2015, the court granted final approval to the settlement and denied all remaining

the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, by concealing negative information regarding the financial performance of Autonomy and HP Inc.'s enterprise services business
and by failing to restrict participants from investing in HP Inc. stock. On August 16, 2013, HP Inc. filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit. On March 31, 2014, the court

Vincent Ho v. Margaret C. Whitman, et al.

is a lawsuit
filed on January 22, 2013 in California Superior Court alleging, among other things, that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties and wasted corporate assets in connection with
HP Inc.'s acquisition of Autonomy and by causing HP Inc. to repurchase its own stock at allegedly inflated prices between August 2011 and October 2012. On April 22, 2013, the

Autonomy Systems, Limited, and Autonomy, Inc.) initiated civil proceedings in the U.K. High Court of Justice against two members of Autonomy's former management, Michael Lynch and Sushovan
Hussain. The Particulars of Claim seek damages in excess of $5 billion from Messrs. Lynch and Hussain for breach of their fiduciary duties by causing Autonomy group companies to engage
in improper transactions and accounting practices. On October 1, 2015, Messrs. Lynch and Hussain filed their defenses. Mr. Lynch also filed a counterclaim against Autonomy
Corporation Limited seeking $160 million in damages, among other things, for alleged misstatements regarding Lynch. The HP Inc. subsidiary claimants will have an opportunity to
file a response to the defenses and asserted counterclaim.

Environmental

The Company's operations and products are or may in the future become subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and
regulations concerning environmental protection, including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of



HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 17: Litigation and Contingencies (Continued)

hazardous
substances and wastes, the clean-up of contaminated sites, the substances and materials used in the Company's products, the energy consumption of products, services and operations and the
operational or financial responsibility for recycling, treatment and disposal of those products. This includes legislation that makes producers of electrical goods, including servers and networking
equipment, financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products (sometimes referred to as "product take-back legislation"). The
Company
could incur substantial costs, its products could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions, and it could face other sanctions, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws
or if its products become non-compliant with environmental laws. The Company's potential exposure includes impacts on revenue, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party property damage or
personal injury claims and clean-up costs. The amount and timing of costs to comply with environmental laws are difficult to predict.

In
particular, the Company may become a party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by U.S. or state environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), known as "Superfund," or other federal, state or foreign laws and regulations addressing the clean-up of contaminated sites, and may become a party to, or
otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by private parties for contribution towards clean-up costs. The Company is also contractually obligated to make financial contributions to address actions
related to certain environmental liabilities, both ongoing and arising in the future, pursuant to its separation and distribution agreement with HP Inc.

Note 18: Guarantees, Indemnifications and Warranties

Guarantees

In the ordinary course of business, the Company may issue performance guarantees to certain of its clients, customers and other parties
pursuant to which the Company has guaranteed the performance obligations of third parties. Some of those guarantees may be backed by standby letters of credit or surety bonds. In general, the Company
would be obligated to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event a specified triggering event occurs as defined by the guarantee. The Company believes the likelihood of having to perform
under a material guarantee is remote.

The
Company has entered into service contracts with certain of its clients that are supported by financing arrangements. If a service contract is terminated as a result of the Company's
non-performance under the contract or failure to comply with the terms of the financing arrangement, the Company could, under certain circumstances, be required to acquire certain assets related to
the service contract. The Company believes the likelihood of having to acquire a material amount of assets under these arrangements is remote.

Indemnifications

In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into contractual arrangements under which the Company may agree to indemnify a
third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of the Company or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular
contract, which may include, for example, litigation or claims relating to past performance. The Company also provides indemnifications to certain vendors and customers against claims of IP
infringement made by third parties arising from the use by such vendors and customers of the Company's software products and services and certain other matters. Some



HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 18: Guarantees, Indemnifications and Warranties (Continued)

indemnifications
may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial.

General Cross-indemnification

In connection with the separation, the Company entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement with HP Inc. effective
November 1, 2015 where the Company agreed to indemnify HP Inc., each of its subsidiaries and each of their respective directors, officers and employees from and against all liabilities
relating to, arising out of or resulting from, among other matters, the liabilities allocated to the Company as part of the separation. HP Inc. similarly agreed to indemnify the Company, each
of its subsidiaries and each of their respective directors, officers and employees from and against all liabilities relating to, arising out of or resulting from, among other matters, the liabilities
allocated to HP Inc. as part of the separation. As a result, as of October 31, 2015 the Company has
recorded both a receivable from HP Inc. of $232 million and a payable to HP Inc. of $38 million related to litigation matters.

Shared Litigation with HP Inc.

As part of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Company and HP Inc. agreed to cooperate with each other in managing
certain existing litigation related to both parties' businesses. The Separation and Distribution Agreement also included provisions that assign to the parties responsibility for managing pending and
future litigation related to general corporate matters of HP Inc. arising prior to the separation.

Tax Matters Agreement and Other Income Tax Matters

In connection with the separation, the Company entered into a Tax Matters Agreement (the "Tax Matters Agreement") with HP Inc.
effective November 1, 2015 that governs the rights and obligations of the Company and HP Inc. for certain pre-separation tax liabilities. The Tax Matters Agreement provides that the
Company and HP Inc. will share certain pre-separation income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to the Company and HP Inc.'s U.S. and certain non-U.S.
income tax returns. In certain jurisdictions, the Company and HP Inc. have joint and several liability for past income tax liabilities and accordingly, the Company could be legally liable under
applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments.

In
addition, if the Distribution of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's common shares to the HP Inc. shareholders are determined to be taxable, the Company and HP Inc. would share
the tax liability equally, unless the taxability of the Distribution is the direct result of action taken by either the Company or HP Inc. subsequent to the Distribution in which case the party
causing the Distribution to be taxable would be responsible for any taxes imposed on the Distribution.

Upon
completion of the separation on November 1, 2015, the Company recorded a net receivable of $390 million from HP Inc. for certain tax liabilities that the Company is
joint and severally liable for, but for which it is indemnified by the Company under the Tax Matters Agreement. The actual amount that the Company may receive could vary depending upon the outcome of
certain unresolved tax matters, which may not be resolved for several years.

Warranties

The Company accrues the estimated cost of product warranties at the time it recognizes revenue. The Company engages in extensive
product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers; however, contractual warranty terms, repair costs, product call rates,
average cost per call, current period product shipments and ongoing product failure rates, as well as specific product class failures outside of the Company's baseline experience, affect the estimated
warranty obligation.

ITEM 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.

None.

ITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act as of the end of the period covered by this report (the "Evaluation Date"). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded as of the Evaluation
Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective such that the information relating to Hewlett Packard Enterprise, including our consolidated subsidiaries, required to be disclosed in
our SEC reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to Hewlett Packard
Enterprise's management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

This annual report does not include a report of management's assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting or an
attestation report of the company's registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules of the SEC for newly public companies.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, we completed our preparations and implementation for a series of changes to our information technology environment, which includes our financial
reporting systems, to support the separate financial reporting requirements for Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. There were no other changes in our internal control over financial
reporting during fiscal 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 9B. Other Information.

We anticipate holding our first Annual Meeting of Shareholders on or about March 23, 2016. Because the 2016 Annual Meeting is
our first Annual Meeting, pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), we have set a deadline for the receipt of any shareholder proposals
submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 for inclusion in our proxy materials for the 2016 Annual Meeting. In order to be considered timely, such shareholder proposals must be received by us on or
before December 27, 2015, which we believe is a reasonable time before we begin to print and distribute our proxy materials for the 2016 Annual Meeting. Such proposals must also comply with the
SEC's regulations regarding the inclusion of shareholder proposals in our proxy materials. The December 27, 2015 deadline also will apply in determining whether notice is timely for purposes of
exercising discretionary voting authority with respect to proxies for purposes of Rule 14a-4(c) under the Exchange Act.

A
shareholder intending to submit a proposal outside of Rule 14a-8 or to nominate persons for election to serve as a director of the Company, in each case in connection with the
2016 Annual Meeting, must provide written notice of such proposal or nomination in accordance with the requirements set forth in our Amended and Restated Bylaws. To be considered timely, any such
notice



must
be received by the Secretary of the Company not later than the close of business on December 27, 2015. The notice must comply with and contain the information required by our Amended and
Restated Bylaws.

In
addition, our Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that under certain circumstances, a shareholder or group of shareholders may include director candidates that they have nominated in
our annual meeting proxy statement. These proxy access provisions of our Amended and Restated Bylaws provide, among other things, that a shareholder or group of up to 20 shareholders seeking to
include director candidates in our annual meeting proxy statement must own 3% or more of our outstanding common stock continuously for at least the previous three years. The nominating shareholder or
group of shareholders must deliver the information required by and otherwise comply with the provisions of our Amended and Restated Bylaws, and each nominee must meet the qualifications required by
our Amended and Restated Bylaws. Requests to include shareholder-nominated candidates in our proxy materials for the 2016 Annual Meeting must be received by the Secretary of the Company not later than
the close of business on January 16, 2016.
