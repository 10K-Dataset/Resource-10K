PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

Cabot Oil & Gas is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration,
development, acquisition and exploitation of oil and gas properties located in North America. The five principal areas of operation are Appalachian Basin, Rocky Mountains, Anadarko Basin, onshore and offshore the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast, and
the gas basin of West Canada. Operationally, we have four regional offices located in the East region, the West region, which is comprised of the Rocky Mountains and Mid-Continent areas, the Gulf Coast region and Canada.

In 2004, energy commodity prices remained strong throughout the year. This strong price
environment allowed us to pursue our largest organic capital program ever while still maintaining our financial flexibility. This flexibility should provide us the ability to take advantage of attractive acquisition opportunities that may arise. At
December 31, 2004, our debt to total capital ratio was 37%, down from 43% at the end of 2003. Natural gas production increased to 72.8 Bcf in 2004 from 71.9 Bcf in 2003. This growth was directly related to our 2003 drilling program which focused on
natural gas projects. On an equivalent basis, our production level in 2004 was down slightly from 2003. We produced 84.8 Bcfe, or 232.3 Mmcfe per day, this year, as compared to 89.0 Bcfe, or 243.8 Mmcfe per day, in 2003. The growth in natural gas
production was offset by the loss of production associated with the late 2003 sale of non-strategic properties and natural decline in oil production in south Louisiana. Our 2004 realized natural gas price was $5.20 per Mcf, compared to a 2003 price
of $4.51. Our realized crude oil price was $31.55 per Bbl, compared to a 2003 price of $29.55. Our average hedged prices on natural gas and crude oil for 2005 anticipated production are expected to be higher than comparable prices realized from
hedging in 2004. To lock in prices above historical levels for a portion of our production as a result of the strong commodity prices, we layered in oil and gas hedge instruments throughout 2004 to cover production in 2004 and 2005. At December 31,
2004, 44% and 25% of our natural gas and crude oil anticipated production, respectively, are hedged for 2005 through the use of derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting. Including our range swaps, which do not qualify for hedge accounting, 75%
of our crude oil production is hedged for 2005. No derivatives are in place for 2006. Our decision to hedge 2005 production fits with our risk management strategy and allows the Company to lock in the benefit of high commodity prices on a portion of
our anticipated production.

Net income of $88.4 million or $2.72 per share
exceeded last year by $67.2 million or $2.06 per share. The year over year net income increase was achieved due to higher natural gas revenues from higher commodity prices. Operating Revenues increased by $21.0 million or 4% due to strong commodity
prices. Natural gas production revenues increased by $57.1 million over the prior year; this increase was partially offset by a decrease in crude oil and condensate revenues of $21.0 million and a decrease in brokered natural gas revenues of $11.4
million. In addition, operating expenses decreased between 2004 and 2003 as a result of the 2003 non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $93.8 million. Also contributing to the decrease were lower brokered natural gas cost and lower exploration
expense. Net income in 2003 was also reduced by a $6.8 million cumulative effect of accounting change related to SFAS 143.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, we drilled 256 gross wells with a success rate of 95% compared to 173 gross wells with a success rate of 89% for the comparable
period of the prior year. Our 2004 capital and exploration spending was $259.5 million compared to $188.2 million in 2003. We concentrated our 2004 capital spending program on projects balancing acceptable risk with the strongest economics. In the
past, we have used a portion of the cash flow from our long-lived East and Mid-Continent natural gas reserves to fund our exploration and development efforts in the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain areas. In 2004, we continued that practice to a lesser
extent as we increased our capital expenditures in the East in response to the success of the 2003 drilling program. The main recipient of these dollars was Canada where we commenced our drilling program with a $16.2 million investment. In 2005, we
plan to spend approximately $280 million which includes a layer of investment for new projects or property acquisitions that may arise during 2005.

Our proved reserves totaled approximately 1,202 Bcfe at December 31, 2004, of which 94% was natural gas. This reserve level was up slightly from 1,142 Bcfe at December
31, 2003 on the strength of results from our drilling program and the lack of reserve sales during the year.

The following table presents certain information as of December 31, 2004.

(1)

Reserve Life Index is equal to year-end reserves divided by annual production. Canada is
not calculated since initial production commenced in mid-2004. Canada has also been excluded from the Total for purposes of the reserve life index calculation.

(2)

The term “net” as used in “net acreage” or “net production”
throughout this document refers to amounts that include only acreage or production that is owned by Cabot Oil & Gas and produced to its interest, less royalties and production due others. “Net wells” represents our working interest
share of each well.

EAST REGION

Our East activities are concentrated in West Virginia, and to a lesser extent in New York.
In this region, our assets include a large undeveloped acreage position, a high concentration of wells, natural gas gathering and pipeline systems, and storage capacity. Capital and exploration expenditures were $75.2 million for 2004, or 29% of our
total 2004 capital spending, and $40.6 million for 2003. For 2005, we have budgeted $75.3 million for capital and exploration expenditures in the region.

At December 31, 2004, we had 2,584 wells (2,393.3 net), of which 2,497 wells are operated by us. There are multiple producing intervals that include the Big Lime, Weir,
Berea, Devonian Shale and Oriskany formations at depths primarily ranging from 1,000 to 9,500 feet. Average net daily production in 2004 was 53.6 Mmcfe. While natural gas production volumes from East reservoirs are relatively low on a per-well basis
compared to other areas of the United States, the productive life of East reserves is relatively long. At December 31, 2004, we had 550.5 Bcfe of proved reserves (substantially all natural gas) in the East region, constituting 46% of our total
proved reserves. This region is managed from our office in Charleston, West Virginia.

In 2004, we drilled 171 wells (167.5 net) in the East region, of which 166 wells (163 net) were development and extension wells. In 2005, we plan to drill approximately 200 wells.

In 2004, we produced and marketed approximately 80 barrels of crude oil/condensate per day in
the East region at market responsive prices.

Ancillary to our exploration,
development and production operations, we operate a number of gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems with interconnects to three interstate transmission systems, seven local distribution companies and numerous end users as of the end of
2004. The majority of our pipeline infrastructure in West Virginia is regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). As such, the transportation rates and terms of service of our pipeline subsidiary, Cranberry Pipeline Corporation,
are subject to the rules and regulations of the FERC. Our natural gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems enable us to connect new wells quickly and to transport natural gas from the wellhead directly to interstate pipelines, local
distribution companies and industrial end users. Control of our gathering and transmission pipeline systems also enables us to purchase, transport and sell natural gas produced by third parties. In addition, we can engage in development drilling
without relying upon third parties to transport our natural gas and incur only the incremental costs of pipeline and compressor additions to our system.

- 4 -


We have two natural gas storage fields located in West Virginia with a combined working capacity of approximately 4 Bcf.
We use these storage fields to take advantage of the seasonal variations in the demand for natural gas and the higher prices typically associated with winter natural gas sales, while maintaining production at a nearly constant rate throughout the
year. The storage fields also enable us to increase for shorter intervals of time the volume of natural gas that we can deliver by more than 40% above the volume that we could deliver solely from our production in the East region. The pipeline
systems and storage fields are fully integrated with our operations.

The
principal markets for our East region natural gas are in the northeast United States. We sell natural gas to industrial customers, local distribution companies and gas marketers both on and off our pipeline and gathering system. Cabot Oil & Gas
Marketing, our subsidiary, purchases gas from local third-party producers and other suppliers to aggregate larger volumes of gas for resale.

Approximately 65% of our natural gas sales volume in the East region is sold at index-based prices under contracts with a term of one year or greater. In addition, spot
market sales are made under month-to-month contracts, while industrial and utility sales generally are made under year-to-year contracts. Approximately 2% of East production is sold on fixed price contracts that typically renew annually.

WEST REGION

Our activities in the West region are managed by a regional office in Denver. At December
31, 2004, we had 426.9 Bcfe of proved reserves (96% natural gas) in the West region, constituting 36% of our total proved reserves.

Rocky Mountains

Our Rocky Mountains activities are concentrated in the Green River, Wind River and Big Horn Basins in Wyoming and Paradox Basin in Colorado. At December 31, 2004, we had 237.6 Bcfe of proved reserves (95% natural gas)
in the Rocky Mountain area, 20% of our total proved reserves. Capital and exploration expenditures in the Rocky Mountains were $41.5 million for 2004, or 16% of our total capital and exploration expenditures, and $22.3 million for 2003. Spending for
2004 included $30.5 million for drilling activity and $7.5 million of dry hole expense and geophysical and geological procedures. For 2005, we have budgeted $33.6 million for capital and exploration expenditures in the area.

We had 533 wells (242.6 net) in the Rocky Mountains area as of December 31, 2004, of which
282 wells are operated by us. Principal producing intervals in the Rocky Mountains area are in the Almond, Frontier, Dakota and Honaker Trail formations at depths ranging from 5,500 to 15,000 feet. Average net daily production in the Rocky Mountains
during 2004 was 35.9 Mmcfe.

In 2004, we drilled 29 wells (14.3 net) in the
Rocky Mountains, of which 26 wells (13.0 net) were development wells. In 2005, we plan to drill 30 wells.

Mid-Continent

Our Mid-Continent
activities are concentrated in the Anadarko Basin in southwest Kansas, Oklahoma and the panhandle of Texas. Capital and exploration expenditures were $12.1 million for 2004, or 5% of our total 2004 capital and exploration expenditures, and $11.2
million for 2003. For 2005, we have budgeted $8.5 million for capital and exploration expenditures in the area.

As of December 31, 2004, we had 650 wells (452.9 net) in the Mid-Continent area, of which 508 wells are operated by us. Principal producing intervals in the Mid-Continent
are in the Chase, Morrow, Red Fork and Chester formations at depths ranging from 2,200 to 10,000 feet. Average net daily production in 2004 was 26.5 Mmcfe. At December 31, 2004, we had 189.3 Bcfe of proved reserves (97% natural gas) in the
Mid-Continent area, 16% of our total proved reserves.

In 2004, we drilled 21
wells (18.9 net) in the Mid-Continent, all of which were development and extension wells. In 2005, we plan to drill 11 wells.

- 5 -


Our principal markets for West region natural gas are in the northwest and midwest United States. We sell natural gas to
power generators, natural gas processors, local distribution companies, industrial customers and marketing companies. Currently, approximately 75% of our natural gas production in the West region is sold primarily under contracts with a term of one
to three years at index-based prices. Another 23% of the natural gas production is sold under short-term arrangements at index-based prices and the remaining 2% is sold under certain fixed-price contracts. The West region properties are connected to
the majority of the midwest and northwest interstate and intrastate pipelines, affording us access to multiple markets.

In 2004, we produced and marketed approximately 450 barrels of crude oil/condensate per day in the West region at market responsive prices.

GULF COAST REGION

Our exploration, development and production activities in the Gulf Coast region are primarily concentrated in north and south Louisiana,
south Texas and the Gulf of Mexico. A regional office in Houston manages the operations. Principal producing intervals are in the Cotton Valley, Hosston, Miocene and Frio age formations in Louisiana and the Frio, Vicksburg and Wilcox formations in
Texas at depths ranging from 3,000 to 25,000 feet. Capital and exploration expenditures were $112.6 million for 2004, or 43% of our total capital and exploration expenditures, and $111.6 million for 2003. For 2005, we have budgeted $105.0 million of
our total budget for capital and exploration expenditures in the region. Our 2005 Gulf Coast drilling program will continue to emphasize impact exploration opportunities both on and offshore, augmented by development activity in our focus areas of
south Texas and throughout coastal Louisiana.

In 2004, we drilled 31 wells
(17.6 net) in the Gulf Coast region, of which 20 wells (12.4 net) were development wells. In 2005 we plan to drill 42 wells. We had 751 wells (495.4 net) in the Gulf Coast region as of December 31, 2004, of which 558 wells are operated by us.
Average daily production in 2004 was 115.3 Mmcfe, compared to 124.1 Mmcfe in 2003. The decline is the result of lower production from our properties in south Louisiana, offset partially by increased production from the coastal Texas area. At
December 31, 2004, we had 217.1 Bcfe of proved reserves (78% natural gas) in the Gulf Coast region, which represented 18% of our total proved reserves.

Our principal markets for Gulf Coast region natural gas are in the industrialized Gulf Coast area and the northeast United States. We sell natural gas to intrastate
pipelines, natural gas processors and marketing companies. Currently, approximately 40% of our natural gas sales volumes in the Gulf Coast region are sold at index-based prices under contracts with terms of one to three years. The remaining 60% of
our sales volumes are sold at index-based prices under short-term agreements. The Gulf Coast properties are connected to various processing plants in Texas and Louisiana with multiple interstate and intrastate deliveries, affording us access to
multiple markets.

In 2004, we produced and marketed approximately 5,000
barrels of crude oil/condensate per day in the Gulf Coast region at market responsive prices.

- 6 -


CANADA REGION

Our activities in the Canada region are managed by a regional office in Calgary, Alberta. Our Canadian exploration, development and producing activities are concentrated
in the Provinces of Alberta and British Columbia. At December 31, 2004, we had 7.9 Bcfe of proved reserves (91% natural gas) in the Canada region, constituting less than 1% of our total proved reserves.

Capital and exploration expenditures in Canada were $16.2 million for 2004, or 6% of our
total capital and exploration expenditures, and $0.8 million for 2003. For 2005, we have budgeted $16.0 million for capital and exploration expenditures in the area.

We had 14 wells (1.5 net) in the Canada region as of December 31, 2004, of which 3 wells are operated by us. Principal producing intervals
in the Canada region are in the Falher, Bluesky, Cadomin and the Swan Hills formations at depths ranging from 9,500 to 16,000 feet. Average net daily production in Canada during 2004 was 1.0 Mmcfe.

In 2004, we drilled 4 wells (1.5 net) in Canada, of which 3 wells (1.1 net) were development
and extension wells. In 2005, we plan to drill 10 wells.

In 2004, we produced
and marketed approximately 10 barrels of crude oil/condensate per day in the Canada region at market responsive prices.

RISK MANAGEMENT

From time to time, when we believe that market conditions are favorable, we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage price risks associated with our production in all of our regions. While there are many
different types of derivatives available, in 2004 we primarily employed natural gas and oil price swap and collar agreements to attempt to manage price risk more effectively. The price swaps call for payments to, or receipts from, counterparties
based on whether the market price of natural gas or crude oil for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap is put in place. The collar arrangements are put and call options used to establish floor
and ceiling commodity prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period. They provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price is below the
floor.

We will continue to evaluate the benefit of employing derivatives in
the future. Please read Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Commodity Price Swaps and Options for further discussion concerning our use of derivatives.

RESERVES

Current Reserves

The following table presents our estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2004.

(1)

Liquids include crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids (Ngl).

(2)

Natural gas equivalents are determined using the ratio of 6 Mcf of natural gas to 1 Bbl of crude oil, condensate or natural gas liquids.

The proved reserve estimates presented here were prepared by our petroleum engineering staff
and reviewed by Miller and Lents, Ltd., independent petroleum engineers. Miller and Lents concluded the following: In their judgment 1) we have an effective system for gathering data and documenting information required to estimate our proved
reserves and project our future revenues, 2) we used appropriate engineering, geologic and evaluation principles in making our estimates and projections and 3) our total proved reserves are reasonable. For additional information regarding estimates
of proved reserves, the review of such estimates by Miller and Lents, Ltd., and other information about our oil and gas reserves, see the Supplemental Oil and Gas Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. A copy of the
review letter by Miller and Lents, Ltd. has been filed as an exhibit to this Form 10-K. Our estimates of proved reserves in the table above are consistent with those filed by us with other federal agencies. Our reserves are sensitive to natural gas
and crude oil sales prices and their effect on economic producing rates. Our reserves are based on oil and gas index prices in effect on the last day of December 2004.

There are a number of uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves, including many factors beyond our control such as
commodity pricing. Therefore, the reserve information in this Form 10-K represents only estimates. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas that can not be measured in an exact
manner. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As a result, estimates of different engineers may vary. In addition, results of drilling,
testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising the original estimate. Accordingly, initial reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. The
meaningfulness of such estimates depends primarily on the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based. Except to the extent we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves or conduct successful exploration and development
activities or both, our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced.

Total does not include service wells of 74 (64.5 net).

Drilling Activity

We drilled wells, participated in the drilling of wells, or acquired wells as indicated in
the region table below.

(1)

Includes the acquisition of net interest in wells in which we already held an ownership interest.

- 13 -


Competition

Competition in our primary producing areas is intense. Price, contract terms and quality of service, including pipeline connection times, distribution efficiencies and
reliable delivery records, affect competition. We believe that our extensive acreage position, existing natural gas gathering and pipeline systems and storage fields enhance our competitive position over other producers in the East region who do not
have similar systems or facilities in place. We also believe that our competitive position in the East region is enhanced by the lack of significant competition from major oil and gas companies. We also actively compete against other companies with
substantially larger financial and other resources, particularly in the West and Gulf Coast regions and Canada.

OTHER BUSINESS MATTERS

Major Customer

In 2004, approximately 11% of our total sales were made to one customer. In 2003 and 2002, approximately 11% and 14%, respectively, of our total sales were made to one customer. In 2002, this customer operated certain
properties in which we have interests in the Gulf Coast and purchased all of the production from these wells. This customer would resell the natural gas and oil to third parties with whom we would deal directly if the customer either ceased to exist
or stopped buying our portion of the production.

Seasonality

Demand for natural gas has historically been seasonal, with peak
demand and typically higher prices occurring during the colder winter months.

Regulation of Oil and Natural Gas Exploration and Production

Exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. This regulation includes requiring permits to drill wells, maintaining bonding requirements to drill or operate wells,
and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties on which wells are drilled, and the plugging and abandoning of wells. Our operations are also subject to various
conservation laws and regulations. These include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the density of wells that may be drilled in a given field, and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas
properties. Some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil
and natural gas wells, generally prohibiting the venting or flaring of natural gas and imposing certain requirements regarding the ratability of production. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas we can
produce from our wells, and to limit the number of wells or the locations where we can drill. Because these statutes, rules and regulations undergo constant review and often are amended, expanded and reinterpreted, we are unable to predict the
future cost or impact of regulatory compliance. The regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases its cost of doing business and, consequently, affects its profitability. We do not believe, however, we are affected differently by these
regulations than others in the industry.

- 14 -


Natural Gas Marketing, Gathering and Transportation

Federal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the price of the
natural gas we produce and the manner in which our production is transported and marketed. Under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, the FERC regulates the interstate sale for resale of natural gas and the transportation of natural gas in interstate
commerce, although facilities used in the production or gathering of natural gas in interstate commerce are generally exempted from FERC jurisdiction. Effective January 1, 1993, the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act deregulated natural gas prices
for all “first sales” of natural gas, which definition covers all sales of our own production. In addition, as part of the broad industry restructuring initiatives described below, the FERC has granted to all producers such as us a
“blanket certificate of public convenience and necessity” authorizing the sale of gas for resale without further FERC approvals. As a result, all of our produced natural gas may now be sold at market prices, subject to the terms of any
private contracts that may be in effect.

Our natural gas sales prices
nevertheless continue to be affected by intrastate and interstate gas transportation regulation, because the prices we receive for our production are affected by the cost of transporting the gas to the consuming market. Through a series of
comprehensive rulemakings, beginning with Order No. 436 in 1985 and continuing through Order No. 636 in 1992 and Order No. 637 in 2000, the FERC has adopted regulatory changes that have significantly altered the transportation and marketing of
natural gas. These changes were intended by the FERC to foster competition by, among other things, transforming the role of interstate pipeline companies from wholesale marketers of gas to the primary role of gas transporters, and by increasing the
transparency of pricing for pipeline services. The FERC has also developed rules governing the relationship of the pipelines with their marketing affiliates, and implemented standards relating to the use of electronic data exchange by the pipelines
to make transportation information available on a timely basis and to enable transactions to occur on a purely electronic basis.

In light of these statutory and regulatory changes, most pipelines have divested their gas sales functions to marketing affiliates, which operate separately from the
transporter and in direct competition with all other merchants, and most pipelines have also implemented the large-scale divestiture of their gas gathering facilities to affiliated or non-affiliated companies. Interstate pipelines thus now generally
provide unbundled, open and nondiscriminatory transportation and transportation-related services to producers, gas marketing companies, local distribution companies, industrial end users and other customers seeking such services. Sellers and buyers
of gas have gained direct access to the particular pipeline services they need, and are better able to conduct business with a larger number of counterparties. We believe these changes generally have improved our access to markets while, at the same
time, substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace.

Certain of our pipeline systems and storage fields in West Virginia are regulated for safety compliance by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and the West Virginia Public Service Commission. In 2002, Congress enacted the Pipeline
Safety Improvement Act of 2002, which contains a number of provisions intended to increase pipeline operating safety. The DOT’s final regulations implementing the act became effective February 2004. Among other provisions, the regulations
require that pipeline operators implement a pipeline integrity management program that must at a minimum include an inspection of gas transmission pipeline facilities within the next ten years, and at least every seven years thereafter.

We cannot predict what new or different regulations the FERC and other regulatory agencies
may adopt, or what effect subsequent regulations may have on our activities. Similarly, it is impossible to predict what proposals, if any, that affect the oil and natural gas industry might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state
legislatures and what effect, if any, such proposals might have on us. Similarly, and despite the recent trend toward federal deregulation of the natural gas industry, whether or to what extent that trend will continue, or what the ultimate effect
will be on our sales of gas, cannot be predicted.

Federal Regulation of Petroleum

Our sales of oil and natural gas liquids are not regulated and are at market prices. The price received from the sale of these products is
affected by the cost of transporting the products to market. Much of that transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines. Effective January 1, 1995, the FERC implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved
interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation, subject to certain conditions and limitations. These regulations may tend to increase the cost
of transporting oil and natural gas liquids by interstate pipeline, although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year. These regulations have generally been approved on judicial review. Every five years, the FERC must
examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry. The first such review was completed in December 2000, where the FERC concluded that the rate index
reasonably reflected actual pipeline costs. Upon judicial review, the pipeline transportation rates established under the index were increased slightly. The next review is scheduled in July 2005. Another FERC proceeding that may impact our
transportation costs relates to an ongoing proceeding to determine whether and to what extent pipelines should be permitted to include in their transportation rates an allowance for income taxes attributable to non-corporate partnership interests.
We are not able to predict with certainty the effect upon us of these relatively new federal regulations, or of the periodic review by the FERC of the index, or the ongoing review of the income tax allowance.

Environmental Regulations

General

. Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and
regulations relating to the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment. Permits are required for the operation of our various facilities. These permits can be revoked, modified or renewed
by issuing authorities. Governmental authorities enforce compliance with their regulations through fines, injunctions or both. Government regulations can increase the cost of planning, designing, installing and operating oil and gas facilities.
Although we believe that compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us, risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are part of oil and gas production operations. No
assurance can be given that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred. Also, it is possible that other developments, such as stricter environmental laws and regulations, and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from oil
and gas production could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us.

The transition zone and shallow-water areas of the U.S. Gulf Coast are ecologically sensitive. Environmental issues have led to higher drilling costs and a more difficult and lengthy well permitting process. U.S. laws and regulations
applicable to our operations include those controlling the discharge of materials into the environment, requiring removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment, requiring consistency with applicable coastal zone management plans, or
otherwise relating to the protection of the environment.

Outer Continental
Shelf Lands Act.

The federal Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto impose a variety of regulations relating to safety and environmental protection applicable to lessees, permits and other parties
operating on the Outer Continental Shelf. Specific design and operational standards may apply to Outer Continental Shelf vessels, rigs, platforms, vehicles and structures. Violations of lease conditions or regulations issued pursuant to the Outer
Continental Shelf Lands Act can result in substantial civil and criminal penalties as well as potential court injunctions curtailing operations and the cancellation of leases. Such enforcement liabilities can result from either governmental or
citizen prosecution. We believe that we substantially comply with the OCSLA and its regulations.

Solid and Hazardous Waste

. We currently own or lease, and have in the past owned or leased, numerous properties
that were used for the production of oil and gas for many years. Although operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time may have been utilized, it is possible that hydrocarbons or other solid wastes may have been
disposed of or released on or under the properties currently owned or leased by us. State and federal laws applicable to oil and gas wastes and properties have become more strict over time. Under these increasingly stringent requirements, we could
be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed or released by prior owners and operators) or clean up property contamination (including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators) or to perform
plugging operations to prevent future contamination. We generate some hazardous wastes that are already subject to the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and comparable state statutes. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has
limited the disposal options for certain hazardous wastes. It is possible that certain wastes currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes under RCRA or other applicable statutes. We could,
therefore, be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements in the future than we encounter today.

Superfund

. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), also known as the “Superfund” law, imposes liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the
original conduct, on certain persons with respect to the release of hazardous substances into the environment. These persons include the owner and operator of a site and any party that disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances
found at a site. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA, and in some cases, private parties, to undertake actions to clean up such hazardous substances, or to recover the costs of such actions from the responsible parties. In the course of business, we have
generated and will continue to generate wastes that may fall within CERCLA’s definition of hazardous substances. We may also be an owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released. As a result, we may be responsible
under CERCLA for all or part of the costs to clean up sites where such wastes have been disposed.

Oil Pollution Act

. The federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) and resulting regulations impose a variety of obligations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages
resulting from such spills in waters of the United States. The term “waters of the United States” has been broadly defined to include inland water bodies, including wetlands and intermittent streams. The OPA assigns liability to each
responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages. We believe that we substantially comply with the Oil Pollution Act and related federal regulations.

Clean Water Act

. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA or Clean Water Act) and resulting regulations, which are implemented
through a system of permits, also govern the discharge of certain contaminants into waters of the United States. Sanctions for failure to comply strictly with the Clean Water Act are generally resolved by payment of fines and correction of any
identified deficiencies. However, regulatory agencies could require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities that are the source of water discharges. We believe that we substantially comply with the Clean Water Act and related
federal and state regulations.

Clean

Air Act

. Our operations are
subject to local, state and federal laws and regulations to control emissions from sources of air pollution. Payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies generally resolve penalties for failure to comply strictly with air
regulations or permits. Regulatory agencies could also require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities that are air emission sources. We believe that we substantially comply with the emission standards under local, state, and
federal laws and regulations.

Employees

As of December 31, 2004, Cabot Oil & Gas had 346 active employees. We recognize that our
success is significantly influenced by the relationship we maintain with our employees. Overall, we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory. The Company and its employees are not represented by a collective bargaining
agreement.

Other

Our profitability depends on certain factors that are beyond our
control, such as natural gas and crude oil prices. Please see Items 7 and 7A. We face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses. Our business involves a variety of operating risks, including blowouts, cratering,
explosions and fires, mechanical problems, uncontrolled flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, formations with abnormal pressures, pollution and other environmental risks, and natural disasters. We conduct operations in shallow offshore areas,
which are subject to additional hazards of marine operations, such as capsizing, collision and damage from severe weather.

Our operation of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks, including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline
leaks and ruptures. Any of these events could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us. The location of pipelines near populated areas, including
residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase these risks. In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. The occurrence of any of
these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. The costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas
in which we choose to operate. During the past few years, we have invested a higher percentage of our drilling dollars in the Gulf Coast, where insurance rates are significantly higher than in other regions such as the East. At December 31, 2004, we
owned or operated approximately 3,300 miles of natural gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems throughout the United States. As part of our normal maintenance program, we have identified certain segments of our pipelines that we believe may
require repair, replacement or additional maintenance, and we schedule this maintenance as appropriate.

The sale of our oil and gas production depends on a number of factors beyond our control. The factors include the availability and capacity of transportation and processing facilities. Our failure to access these
facilities and obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are a party to
various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of our business. All known liabilities are fully accrued based on management’s best estimate of the potential loss. While the outcome and impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty,
management believes that the resolution of these proceedings through settlement or adverse judgment will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. Operating results and cash flow, however, could be significantly
impacted in the reporting periods in which such matters are resolved.

Wyoming Royalty Litigation

In June 2000, we were sued
by two overriding royalty owners in Wyoming state court for unspecified damages. The plaintiffs requested class certification and alleged that we had improperly deducted costs of production from royalty payments to the plaintiffs and other similarly
situated persons. Additionally, the suit claimed that we had failed to properly inform the plaintiffs and other similarly situated persons of the deductions taken from royalties. At a mediation held in April 2003, the plaintiffs in this case claimed
total damages of $9.5 million plus attorney fees. We settled the case for a total of $2.25 million and the State District Court Judge entered his order approving the settlement in the fourth quarter of 2003. The class included all private fee
royalty and overriding royalty owners of the Company in the State of Wyoming except those in the suit discussed below and one owner who opted out of the settlement. It also includes provisions for the method of valuation of gas for royalty payment
purposes going forward and for reporting of royalty payments, which should prevent further litigation of these issues by the class members.

In January 2002, 13 overriding royalty owners sued us in Wyoming federal district court. The plaintiffs in the federal case have made the same general claims pertaining
to deductions from their overriding royalty as the plaintiffs in the Wyoming state court case but have not asked for class certification.

The federal district court judge certified two questions of state law for decision by the Wyoming State Supreme Court, which recently answered both questions. The Wyoming
Supreme Court ruled that certain deductions taken by us from the plaintiffs were not proper and that the statutes of limitations advanced by us are discovery statutes and accordingly do not begin to run until the plaintiffs knew, or had reason to
know, of the violation. We believe we have properly reported to the plaintiffs and, that if we did not, the plaintiffs knew or should have known the reporting was improper and the nature of the deductions, thus triggering the statutes of
limitations. We still intend to raise defenses to the alleged failure to report claims. There is also a dispute as to how the interest should be calculated.

The federal judge refused to certify a question relating to the issue of the proper calculation of damages for failure to provide certain information required by statute
on overriding royalty owner check stubs that had been decided adversely to our position in a state district court letter decision in a separate case. After the federal judge’s refusal to certify this issue, the plaintiffs reduced the damages
they were claiming. Based upon recent communication from the plaintiffs, they are now claiming $26.2 million in total damages which consists of $20.3 million for alleged violations of the check stub reporting statute and $5.9 million for all other
damages.

In the opinion of our outside counsel, Brown, Drew & Massey, LLP,
the likelihood of the plaintiffs recovering $20.3 million for the check stub reporting statute is remote. However, a reserve that management believes is adequate to provide for the check stub reporting statute and all other damages has been
established based on management’s estimate at this time of the probable outcome of this case.

West Virginia Royalty Litigation

In December 2001, we were sued by two royalty owners in West Virginia state court for an unspecified amount of damages. The plaintiffs have requested class certification under the West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure and allege that we
failed to pay royalty based upon the wholesale market value of the gas produced, that it had taken improper deductions from the royalty and failed to properly inform the plaintiffs and other similarly situated persons of deductions taken from the
royalty. The plaintiffs have also claimed that they are entitled to a


/


th royalty share of the gas sales
contract settlement that we reached with Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation in the 1995 Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation bankruptcy proceeding.

- 19 -


Discovery and pleadings necessary to place the class certification issue before the state court have been ongoing. A
hearing on the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification was held on October 20, 2003, and proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law were submitted to the court on December 5, 2003. A status conference was held with the court and the
court advised it intends to issue a ruling on the class certification motion. The court was expected to rule by December 2004, and we are still awaiting a decision. Discovery is proceeding on the claims pending the ruling on the class certification
motion. Discovery is to be completed by April 1, 2005, and the trial is currently scheduled for August 15, 2005. If a class is certified it is expected this trial date will be continued to a later date.

The investigation into this claim continues and it is in the discovery phase. We are
vigorously defending the case. We have a reserve that management believes is adequate based on its estimate at this time of the probable outcome of this case.

Texas Title Litigation

On January 6, 2003, we were served with Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Original Petition in Romeo Longoria, et al. v. Exxon Mobil Corporation, et al. in the 79th
Judicial District Court of Brooks County, Texas. Plaintiffs filed their First Supplemental Original Petition on March 17, 2004 and their Second Supplemental Petition on November 12, 2004. The significant change in the second Supplemental Petition is
that plaintiffs appear to limit their claim to the mineral estate, rather than making claims to both the surface and mineral estate. The plaintiffs allege that they are the rightful owners of a one-half undivided mineral interest in and to certain
lands in Brooks County, Texas. As Cody Energy, LLC, we acquired certain leases and wells from Wynn-Crosby 1996, Ltd. in 1997 and 1998 and we subsequently acquired a 320 acre lease from Hector and Gloria Lopez in 2001. The plaintiffs allege that they
are entitled to be declared the rightful owners of an undivided interest in minerals and all improvements on the lands on which we acquired these leases. The plaintiffs also assert claims for trespass to try title, action to remove a cloud on the
title, failure to properly account for royalty, fraud, trespass, conversion, all for unspecified actual and exemplary damages. The original trial date of May 19, 2003 was cancelled and a new trial date has not been set. We have not had the
opportunity to conduct discovery in this matter. We estimate that production revenue from this field since its predecessor, Cody Energy, LLC, acquired title and since we acquired its lease is approximately $14.9 million. The carrying value of this
property is approximately $34 million. Co-defendants Shell Oil Company and Shell Western E&P filed a motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal of plaintiffs’ causes of action on multiple grounds. The original plaintiffs’ attorneys
asked permission from the Court to withdraw from the representation. The Court granted that request, and new attorneys for some, but not all of the plaintiffs have recently entered the case. The motion for summary judgment was reset and a hearing
was held in December of 2003. We joined in the motion. After a second hearing, the Court denied the motion for summary judgment. The defendants have moved to add parties whose title interests are being challenged by the plaintiffs, and who are
therefore necessary to the case, or in the alternative, abate the proceeding until the plaintiffs join all parties whose interests may be affected by plaintiffs’ claims.

Although the investigation into this claim is in its early stages, we intend to vigorously defend the case. Should we receive an adverse
ruling in this case, an impairment review would be assessed to ensure the carrying value of the property is recoverable. Management cannot currently determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or range of any potential loss should the outcome
be unfavorable. Accordingly, there has been no reserve established for this matter.

Raymondville Area

In April 2004, our wholly owned subsidiary, Cody Energy, LLC, filed suit in Willacy County, Texas against certain of our co-working interest owners in the Raymondville
Area, located in Kenedy and Willacy Counties. In early 2003, Cody had proposed a new prospect to certain of these co-working interest owners located within jointly owned oil and gas leases. Some of the co-working interest owners elected to
participate and some did not. The initial well was successful and subsequent wells have been drilled to exploit the discovery made in the first well.

In December 2003, certain of the co-working interest owners who elected not to participate in the initial well notified Cody that they believed that they had the right to
participate in subsequent wells. Cody contends that, under the terms of the agreements between the parties, the co-working interest owners that elected not to participate in the initial well in the prospect were required to assign their interest in
the proposed prospect to those who elected to participate. Alternatively, Cody contends that such owners lost their right to participate in subsequent wells within a 1,200 foot radius of the initial well.

The defendants have filed a counter claim against us and one of the defendants has filed a
lien against Cody’s interest in the leases in the Raymondville Area. Cody contends that this lien is improper and has sought damages for its filing. Cody is vigorously prosecuting this case which is in its early stage of discovery. No trial
date has been set by the court.

Certain of the defendants filed a Motion for
Partial Summary Judgment contending that they did not have adequate notice of the prospect proposal. Cody is contesting this Motion. In addition, in late December 2004, Cody filed a Motion for Final Summary Judgment asking the court to find that,
under the terms of the agreements, Cody and the participating working interest owners are entitled to an assignment of the interests of the co-working interest owners who elected not to participate in the prospect. No hearing date has been set by
the court.

Management cannot currently determine the likelihood of an
unfavorable outcome or range of any potential loss should the outcome be unfavorable. Accordingly, there has been no reserve established for this matter.

Commitment and Contingency Reserves

We have established reserves for certain legal proceedings. The establishment of a reserve involves an estimation process that includes the advice of legal counsel and
subjective judgment of management. While management believes these reserves to be adequate, it is reasonably possible that we could incur approximately $11.1 million of additional loss with respect to those matters in which reserves have been
established. Future changes in the facts and circumstances could result in the actual liability exceeding the estimated ranges of loss and amounts accrued.

While the outcome and impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the resolution of these proceedings through settlement or adverse judgment
will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. Operating results and cash flow, however, could be significantly impacted in the reporting periods in which such matters are resolved.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition. Our Consolidated Financial Statements
and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material.

Statements in this discussion may be forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below, which could cause
actual results to differ from those expressed. Please read Forward-Looking Information on page 36.

We operate in one segment, natural gas and oil exploration and development.

OVERVIEW

Cabot Oil & Gas is
a leading independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration, development and exploitation of natural gas and crude oil from its properties in North America. Our exploration activities are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon
resources, which are conducive to multi-well, repeatable drilling programs. Our program is designed to be disciplined and balanced with a focus on achieving strong financial returns.

At Cabot, there are three types of investment alternatives that constantly compete for available capital. These include drilling
opportunities, acquisition opportunities and financial opportunities such as debt repayment or repurchase of common stock. Depending on circumstances, we allocate capital among the alternatives based on a rate-of-return approach. Our goal is to
invest capital in the highest return opportunities available at any given time.

Our financial results depend upon many factors, particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms. Price volatility in the commodity markets has remained prevalent
in the last few years. Throughout 2003 and 2004, the futures market reported unprecedented natural gas and crude oil contract prices. Our realized natural gas and crude oil price, net of the impact of derivative instruments, was $5.20 per Mcf and
$31.55 per Bbl, respectively, in 2004. To ensure a certain rate of return for our program, we entered into a series of crude oil and natural gas price collars and swaps. These financial instruments are an integral element of our risk management
strategy but prevented us from realizing the full impact of the price environment.

Commodity prices are impacted by many factors that are outside of our control. Historically, commodity prices have been volatile and we expect them to remain volatile. Commodity prices are affected by changes in market demands, which are
impacted by overall economic activity, weather, pipeline capacity constraints, inventory storage levels, basis differentials and other factors. As a result, we cannot accurately predict future natural gas and crude oil prices, and therefore, we
cannot determine what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program, production volumes and future revenues. In addition to production volumes and commodity prices, finding and developing sufficient amounts of crude oil and natural
gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our long-term success.

The
tables below illustrate how natural gas prices have fluctuated over the course of 2003 and 2004. “Index” represents the Henry Hub index price per Mmbtu. The “2003” and “2004” price is the natural gas price per Mcf
realized by us and includes the realized impact of our natural gas price collar and swap arrangements, as applicable:

- 25 -


Prices for crude oil have followed a
similar path as the commodity price continued to maintain strength in 2003 and rose further in 2004. The tables below contain the NYMEX average crude oil price (Index) and our realized per barrel (Bbl) crude oil prices by month for 2003 and 2004.
The “2003” and “2004” price is the crude oil price per Bbl realized by us and includes the realized impact of our crude oil derivative arrangements:

We reported earnings of $2.72 per
share, or $88.4 million, for 2004. This is up from the $0.66 per share, or $21.1 million, reported in 2003. The decline in impairments of oil and gas properties was the driving factor in this improvement. In 2003, there was an after-tax impairment
of $54.4 million related to our Kurten field (see

Limited Partnership

for discussion of the impairment). In addition, the stronger price environment contributed to the earnings increase. Prices, including the impact of the hedge arrangements,
rose 15% for natural gas and 7% for oil.

We drilled 256 gross wells with a
success rate of 95% in 2004 compared to 173 gross wells with an 89% success rate in 2003. Total capital and exploration expenditures increased $71.3 million to $259.5 million in 2004 compared to $188.2 million for 2003. We believe our operating cash
flow in 2005 will be sufficient to fund our capital and exploration budgeted spending of approximately $280 million and again provide excess cash flow. Any excess cash flow may be used for acquisitions, to pay current debt due, repurchase common
stock, expand our capital program or other opportunities.

Our 2005 strategy
will remain consistent with 2004 focusing on a disciplined approach to investment that balances our drilling effort between exploration opportunities and the development program, along with acquisition opportunities and a continued financial focus
including stock buyback and debt repayment.

The preceding paragraphs,
discussing our strategic pursuits and goals, contain forward-looking information. Please read Forward-Looking Information on page 36.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Capital Resources and Liquidity

Our primary source of cash in 2004 was from funds generated from operations. Proceeds from the sale of common stock under stock option plans during 2004 roughly offset
our repurchase of 405,100 treasury shares of Company stock at a weighted average purchase price of $38.58. The Company generates cash from the sale of natural gas and crude oil. Operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity
prices and changes in our production volumes. Prices for crude oil and natural gas have historically been subject to seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season; however, the impact of other risks
and uncertainties have influenced prices throughout the recent years. Working capital is substantially influenced by these variables. Fluctuation in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital and exploration expenditures. See
Results of Operations for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales. Cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily used to fund exploration and development expenditures, purchase treasury stock and pay dividends. See below
for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow.

Operating Activities.

Net cash
provided by operating activities in 2004 increased $31.4 million over 2003. This increase is primarily due to higher commodity prices. Key drivers of net operating cash flows are commodity prices, production volumes and operating costs. Average
realized natural gas prices increased 15% over 2003, while crude oil realized prices increased 7% over the same period. Production volumes declined slightly, with a 5 percent reduction of equivalent production in 2004 compared to 2003. While we
believe 2005 commodity production may exceed 2004 levels, we are unable to predict future commodity prices, and as a result cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities.

Net cash provided by operating activities in 2003 increased $77.5 million over 2002. This
increase is primarily due to higher commodity prices. Key drivers of net operating cash flows are commodity prices, production volumes and operating costs. Average natural gas prices increased 49% over 2002, while crude oil prices increased 24% over
the same period. Production volumes declined slightly with a 2% reduction of equivalent production in 2003 compared to 2002. See page 25 for a discussion on commodity prices and Results of Operations for a review of the impact of prices and volumes
on sales revenue.

- 27 -


Investing Activities.

The primary driver of cash used by investing activities is capital spending and exploration
expense. We establish the budget for these amounts based on our current estimate of future commodity prices. Due to the volatility of commodity prices our budget may be periodically adjusted during any given year. Cash flows used in investing
activities increased for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 in the amounts of $103.5 million and $13.2 million. The increase from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to an increase in drilling activity as a result of higher commodity prices. This
increase largely occurred in our East region and the Rocky Mountain area of our West region. Our initial drilling activity in Canada also contributed to the increase. Cash flows used in investing activities increased from 2002 to 2003 due to an
increase in capital spending and exploration expense in response to higher commodity prices and exploitation of acquired properties. This increase was partially offset by proceeds received from the sale of certain non-strategic assets.

Financing Activities.

Cash flows used by financing activities were $8.4 million for
the year ended December 31, 2004. This is the result of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, offset by the purchase of treasury shares and dividend payments. Cash flows used by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2003 was
$90.7 million. This is substantially due to a net repayment on our revolving credit facility in the amount of $95.0 million. Cash utilized for the repayments was generated from operating cash flows. The cash flows used by financing activities in
2002 is primarily due to a net repayment on our revolving credit facility of $25.0 million.

The available credit line under our revolving credit facility, which was $250 million at year end, but can be expanded up to $350 million, is subject to adjustment on the basis of the present value of estimated future
net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves (as determined by the bank’s petroleum engineer) and other assets. At December 31, 2004, we had no outstanding balance on the credit facility. The revolving term of the credit facility ends in
December 2009. We strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain excess borrowing capacity. Management believes that we have the ability to finance through new debt or equity offerings, if necessary, our
capital requirements, including acquisitions.

Our Board of Directors
authorized the repurchase of two million shares of our common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions. All purchases executed have been through open market transactions. There is no expiration date associated with the authorization to
repurchase securities of the Company. See “Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” in Item 5 “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities” for additional
information.

Capitalization

Information about our capitalization is as follows:

(1)

Includes $20.0 million of current portion of long term debt in 2004.

(2)

Includes common stock, net of treasury stock.

(3)

Includes the impact of the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss at December 31, 2004 and 2003 of $20.4 million and $23.1
million, respectively.

For the year ended December
31, 2004, we paid dividends of $5.2 million on our common stock. A regular dividend of $0.04 per share of common stock has been declared for each quarter since we became a public company.

Capital and Exploration Expenditures

On an annual basis, we generally fund most of our capital and exploration activities, excluding major oil and gas property acquisitions, with cash generated from
operations and, when necessary, our revolving credit facility. We budget these capital expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year.

The following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures for the three years ended December 31, 2004.

We plan to drill about 300 gross wells
in 2005 compared with 256 gross wells drilled in 2004. This 2005 drilling program includes approximately $280.0 million in total capital and exploration expenditures, up from $259.5 million in 2004. We will continue to assess the natural gas price
environment and may increase or decrease the capital and exploration expenditures accordingly.

There are many factors that impact our depreciation, depletion and amortization rate. These include reserve additions and revisions, development costs, impairments and changes in anticipated production in a future
period. In 2005 management expects an increase in our depreciation, depletion and amortization rate due to production declines and higher capital costs. This change may result in an increase of depreciation, depletion and amortization of 5% to 10%
greater than 2004 levels. This increase will not have an impact on our cash flows.

- 29 -


Contractual Obligations

Our known material contractual obligations include long-term debt, interest on long-term debt and operating leases. We have no off-balance sheet debt or other similar
unrecorded obligations, and we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party.

A summary of our known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004 are set forth in the following table:

(1)

Including current portion.

(2)

Interest payments have been calculated utilizing the fixed rate of our $270
million long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2004 we had no outstanding debt on our revolving credit facility. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details of long-term debt.

Amounts related to our asset retirement obligations are not
included in the above table given the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures. The total amount of asset retirement obligations at December 31, 2004 is $40.4 million.

Potential Impact of Our Critical Accounting Policies

Readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how
certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place. The most significant policies are discussed below.

Oil and Gas Reserves

The process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently uncertain, and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates. The process relies on
interpretations of available geologic, geophysic, engineering and production data. The extent, quality and reliability of this technical data can vary. The degree of uncertainty varies among the three regions in which we operate. The estimation of
reserves in the Gulf Coast region requires more estimates than the East and West regions and inherently has more uncertainty surrounding reserve estimation. The differences in the reserve estimation process are substantially due to the geological
conditions in which the wells are drilled. The process also requires certain economic assumptions, some of which are mandated by the SEC, such as oil and gas prices. Additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses, capital
expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. The accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of:

•

the quality and quantity of available data;

•

the interpretation of that data;

•

the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions; and

•

the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate.

In 2004, 2003 and 2002, 100% of our reserves were subject to an external review by Miller & Lents, Ltd., an independent oil and gas reservoir engineering consulting
firm, who in their opinion determined the estimates to be reasonable in the aggregate. Additionally, in 2004, 2003 and 2002, we did not have a significant reserve revision recorded. For more information regarding reserve estimation, including
historical reserve revisions, refer to the Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosure beginning on page 85.

- 30 -


Our rate of recording depreciation, depletion and amortization expense (DD&A) is dependent upon our estimate of
proved reserves, which is utilized in our unit-of-production method calculation. If the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced, the rate at which we record DD&A expense would increase, reducing net income. Such a reduction in reserves
may result from lower market prices, which may make it non-economic to drill for and produce higher cost fields. A five percent positive or negative revision to proved reserves throughout the Company would decrease or increase the DD&A rate by
approximately $0.04 to $0.05 per Mcfe. Revisions in significant fields may individually affect our DD&A rate. It is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of 10% in one of our most productive fields would have a $0.02 impact on
our total DD&A rate.

In addition, a decline in proved reserve estimates
may impact the outcome of our annual impairment test under SFAS 144, “

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

”. Due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process, risks associated with the
operations of proved producing properties, and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis, management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future.

Carrying Value of Oil and Gas Properties

We evaluate the impairment of our oil and gas properties on a lease-by-lease basis whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable. We compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset. If the future undiscounted cash flows, based on our estimate
of future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Commodity pricing is estimated by using a
combination of historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials, as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices. Fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash
flows. In 2002 there were no unusual or unexpected occurrences that caused significant revisions in estimated cash flows which were utilized in our impairment test. In 2003 we significantly revised the estimated cash flow utilized in our impairment
review of the Kurten field due to a loss of a reversionary interest in the field. In December 2003 our remaining interest in the field was sold. For additional discussion on the Kurten field impairment see Note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements. In 2004 there were no unusual or unexpected occurrences that caused significant revisions in estimated cash flows which were utilized in our impairment test.

Costs attributable to our unproved properties are not subject to the impairment analysis described above, however, a portion of the costs
associated with such properties is subject to amortization based on past experience and average property lives. Average property lives are determined on a regional basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights.
Historically, the average property lives in each of the regions have not significantly changed. However, if the average property life increases, the amount of the amortization charge in a given reporting period will decrease. If the average unproved
property life decreases or increases by one year the amortization would increase by approximately $2.3 million or decrease by approximately $1.9 million, respectively per year.

In the past the average leasehold life in the Gulf Coast region has been shorter than the average life in the East and West regions. Average
property lives in the Gulf Coast, East and West regions have been four, six and six years, respectively. Average property lives in Canada are estimated to be five years. As these properties are developed and reserves are proven, the remaining
capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion. If the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful, the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made. The rate at
which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration program.

- 31 -


Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

Periodically we enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price
fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production. We follow the accounting prescribed in SFAS 133. Under SFAS 133, the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet. At the end of each
period, these instruments are marked-to-market. The gain or loss on the change in fair value is recorded as Other Comprehensive Income, a component of equity, to the extent that the derivative instrument is designated as an effective hedge. Under
SFAS 133, effectiveness is a measurement of how closely correlated the hedge instrument is with the underlying physical sale. For example, a natural gas price swap that converts Henry Hub index to a fixed price would be perfectly correlated, and
100% effective, if the underlying gas were sold at the Henry Hub index. Any portion of the gains or losses that are considered ineffective under the SFAS 133 test are recorded immediately as a component of operating revenue on the statement of
operations.

Long-Term Employee Benefit Costs

Our costs of long-term employee benefits, particularly pension and postretirement benefits,
are incurred over long periods of time, and involve many uncertainties over those periods. The net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties, and is sensitive to changes in
those assumptions. It is management’s responsibility, often with the assistance of independent experts, to select assumptions that in its judgment represent best estimates of those uncertainties. It also is management’s responsibility to
review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions.

The current benefit service costs, as well as the existing liabilities, for pensions and other postretirement benefits are measured on a discounted present value basis.
The discount rate is a current rate, related to the rate at which the liabilities could be settled. Our assumed discount rate is based on average rates published for high-quality fixed income securities.

The benefit obligation and the periodic cost of postretirement medical benefits also are
measured based on assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits. As of December 31, 2004, the assumed rate of increase was 10.0%. The net periodic cost of pension benefits included in expense also is
affected by the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption. The expected return on plan assets rate is normally changed less frequently than the assumed discount rate, and reflects long-term expectations, rather than current
fluctuations in market conditions. The actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets. Management’s goal is to manage the investments over the long term to
achieve optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility.

Stock Based Compensation

Prior to the issuance of SFAS
123R “Share Based Payment”, there were two alternative methods that could be used to account for stock-based compensation. The first method is the Intrinsic Value method and recognizes compensation cost as the excess, if any, of the quoted
market price of our stock at the grant date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. The second method is the Fair Value method. Under the fair value method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of an
award and is recognized over the service period, which is usually the vesting period. Currently, we account for stock-based compensation in accordance with the Intrinsic Value method. SFAS 123R requires that the fair value of stock options and any
other equity-based compensation must be expensed at the grant date. To calculate the fair value, either a binomial or Black-Scholes valuation model may be used. We currently expense performance share awards; however, beginning in the third quarter
of 2005, we will be required to expense all stock based compensation. Further discussion of SFAS 123R and stock compensation is included in “Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements” on page 35.

OTHER ISSUES AND CONTINGENCIES

Corporate Income Tax

. We generated tax credits for the production of certain qualified fuels, including natural gas produced from
tight sands formations and Devonian Shale. The credit for natural gas from a tight sand formation (tight gas sands) amounted to $0.52 per Mmbtu for natural gas sold prior to 2003 from qualified wells drilled in 1991 and 1992. A number of wells
drilled in the East region and Rocky Mountains during 1991 and 1992 qualified for the tight gas sands tax credit. The credit for natural gas produced from Devonian Shale was $1.09 per Mmbtu in 2002. In 1995 and 1996, we completed three transactions
to monetize the value of these tax credits, resulting in revenues of $2.0 million in 2002. The tax credit wells were repurchased in December 2002 and no tax credits were generated in 2003 or 2004 as the credits expired in 2002. See Note 13 of the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

We have
benefited in the past and may benefit in the future from the alternative minimum tax (AMT) relief granted under the Comprehensive National Energy Policy Act of 1992 (the Act). The Act repealed provisions of the AMT requiring a taxpayer’s
alternative minimum taxable income to be increased on account of certain intangible drilling costs (IDC) and percentage depletion deductions. The repeal of these provisions generally applies to taxable years beginning after 1992. The repeal of the
excess IDC preference can not reduce a taxpayer’s alternative minimum taxable income by more than 40% of the amount of such income determined without regard to the repeal of such preference.

Regulations

. Our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal,
state and local authorities. See “Regulation of Oil and Natural Gas Production and Transportation” and “Environmental Regulations” in the “Other Business Matters” section of Item 1 “Business” for a discussion
of these regulations.

Restrictive Covenants.

Our ability to incur debt
and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in the Company’s various debt instruments. Among other requirements, our Revolving Credit Agreement and the Notes specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of
operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 2.8 to 1.0. At December 31, 2004, we are in compliance with all restrictive covenants on both the Revolving Credit Agreement and the Notes. In the unforeseen event that we
fail to comply with these covenants, the Company may apply for a temporary waiver with the lender, which, if granted, would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation. See further discussion in Capital Resources and Liquidity.

Limited Partnership.

As part of the 2001 Cody acquisition, we acquired an interest in
certain oil and gas properties in the Kurten field, as general partner of a partnership and as an operator. We had approximately a 25% interest in the field, including a one percent interest in the partnership. Under the partnership agreement, we
had the right to a reversionary working interest that would bring our ultimate interest to 50% upon the limited partner reaching payout. Based on the addition of this reversionary interest, and because the field has over a 40-year reserve life,
approximately $91 million was allocated to this field under purchase accounting at the time of the acquisition. Additionally, the limited partner had the sole option to trigger a liquidation of the partnership.

Effective February 13, 2003, liquidation of the partnership commenced at the election of the
limited partner. The limited partner was a financial entity and not an industry operator. Their decision to liquidate was based upon their perception that the value of their investment in the partnership had increased due to an increase in
underlying commodity prices, primarily oil, since their investment in 1999. We proceeded with the liquidation to avoid having a minority interest in a non-operated water flood field for which the new operator was not designated at the time of
liquidation. In connection with the liquidation, an appraisal was required to be obtained to allocate the interest in the partnership assets. Additionally, we were required to test the field for recoverability in accordance with FAS 144. Pursuant to
the terms of the partnership agreement and based on the appraised value of the partnership assets it was not possible for us to obtain the reversionary interest as part of the liquidation. Due to the impact of the loss of the reversionary interest
on future estimated net cash flows of the Kurten field, the limited partner’s decision and our decision to proceed with the liquidation, an impairment review was performed which required an after-tax impairment charge in the first quarter of
2003 of $54.4 million. This impairment charge is reflected in the 2003 Statement of Operations as an operating expense but did not impact our cash flows.

Operating Risks and Insurance Coverage.

Our business involves a variety of operating risks, including:

•

blowouts, cratering and explosions;

•

mechanical problems;

•

uncontrolled flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids;

•

fires;

•

formations with abnormal pressures;

•

pollution and other environmental risks; and

•

natural disasters.

The operation of our natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks, including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures. The location of pipelines
near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase these risks. Any of these events could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution,
impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us. In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. The occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by
insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. The costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we choose to operate.
During the past few years, we have invested a significant portion of our drilling dollars in the Gulf Coast, where insurance rates are significantly higher than in other regions such as the East.

Commodity Pricing and Risk Management Activities.

Our revenues, operating results,
financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and, to a lesser extent, oil. Declines in oil and gas prices may materially adversely affect our financial
condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and operating results. Lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically. Historically, oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile, with
prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. Depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results. In particular, substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and
could potentially impact the outcome of our annual impairment test under SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Because our reserves are predominantly natural gas, changes in natural gas prices may have a
particularly large impact on our financial results.

The majority of our
production is sold at market responsive prices. Generally, if the commodity indexes fall, the price that we receive for our production will also decline. Therefore, the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our
control. However, management may mitigate this price risk with the use of financial instruments. Most recently, we have used financial instruments such as price collar and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue.
Under both arrangements, there is also risk that the movement of the index prices will result in the Company not being able to realize the full benefit of a market improvement.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 106-2, “Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.” This FSP provides guidance on the accounting for the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the
Act) for employers that sponsor postretirement health care plans that provide prescription drug benefits. This FSP also requires those employers to provide certain disclosures regarding the effect of the federal subsidy provided by the Act (the
subsidy). This FSP supersedes FSP 106-1, “Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003” and is effective for the first interim period beginning after June 15,
2004. Our current accumulated projected benefit obligation and net periodic postretirement benefit cost does not reflect any amount associated with the subsidy. Furthermore, in 2004, we amended our postretirement benefit plan to exclude prescription
drug benefits for participants age 65 and older effective January 1, 2006. The adoption of this FSP is not expected to impact our operating results, financial position or cash flows.

In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 151, “Inventory Costs—an amendment of ARB
No. 43, Chapter 4” in an effort to unite the United States accounting standards for inventories with International Accounting Standards leading to consistent application of certain accounting requirements. FAS 151 addresses accounting for
abnormal amounts of freight, handling costs, idle facility expense and spoilage (wasted material) and requires that these costs be recognized as current period expenses. Previously, these costs had to be categorized as “so abnormal as to
require treatment as current period charges.” In addition, allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion must be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. FAS 151 will be effective for fiscal periods
beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of this statement is not expected to impact our operating results, financial position or cash flows.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 153 “Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets – an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29.” This statement requires that nonmonetary
exchanges must be recorded at fair value and the appropriate gain or loss must be recognized so long as the fair value is determinable and the transaction has commercial substance. According to this statement, companies can no longer use the
“similar productive assets” concept to account for nonmonetary exchanges at book value with no gain or loss being recognized. FAS 153 will be effective for fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of this statement may
impact our operating results, financial position or cash flows in future periods if such a nonmonetary exchange occurs.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment.” SFAS 123R revises SFAS 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”, and
focuses on accounting for share-based payments for services by employer to employee. The statement requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other equity-based compensation at the grant date. The statement does not
require a certain type of valuation model and either a binomial or Black-Scholes model may be used. The provisions of SFAS 123R are effective for financial statements for fiscal periods ending after June 15, 2005. We are currently evaluating the
method of adoption and the impact on our operating results. Our future cash flows will not be impacted by the adoption of this standard. See Footnote 1 “Stock Based Compensation” for further information.

- 35 -


In February 2005, the FASB released for public comment proposed Staff Position FAS 19-a “Accounting for Suspended
Well Costs.” This proposed staff position would amend FASB Statement No. 19 “Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies” and provides guidance about exploratory well costs to companies who use the successful
efforts method of accounting. The proposed position states that exploratory well costs should continue to be capitalized if: 1) a sufficient quantity of reserved are discovered in the well to justify its completion as a producing well and 2)
sufficient progress is made in assessing the reserves and the well’s economic and operating feasibility. If the exploratory well costs do not meet both of these criteria, these costs should be expensed, net of any salvage value. Additional
disclosures are required to provide information about management’s evaluation of capitalized exploratory well costs. In addition, the Staff Position requires the disclosure of: 1) net changes from period to period of capitalized exploratory
well costs for wells that are pending the determination of proved reserves, 2) the amount of exploratory well costs that have been capitalized for a period greater than one year after the completion of drilling and 3) an aging of exploratory well
costs suspended for greater than one year with the number of wells it related to. Further, the disclosures should describe the activities undertaken to evaluate the reserves and the projects, the information still required to classify the associated
reserves as proved and the estimated timing for completing the evaluation. Although this Staff Position is not final and has not been adopted by us, we have included the additional disclosures in Note 2. Comments on this proposed FSP are expected by
March 7, 2005.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

2004 and 2003 Compared

We reported net income for the year ended December 31, 2004 of $88.4 million, or $2.72 per share. During 2003, we reported net income of $21.1 million, or $0.66 per
share. Operating income increased by $94.1 million compared to the prior year, from $66.6 million to $160.7 million. The increase in net income and operating income was principally due to decreased operating expenses from 2003 to 2004 related to the
decrease in impairments of oil and gas properties of $90.3 million related to the loss in 2003 of a reversionary interest in the Kurten field. In addition, the increases in operating income and net income were due to an increase in our realized
natural gas and crude oil prices.

Natural Gas Production Revenues

Our average total company realized natural gas production sales price,
including the realized impact of derivative instruments, was $5.20 per Mcf compared to $4.51 per Mcf for the comparable period of the prior year. These prices include the realized impact of derivative instruments which reduced these prices by $0.76
per Mcf in 2004 and $0.68 per Mcf in 2003. The following table excludes the unrealized gain from the change in derivative fair value of $0.9 million and the unrealized loss of $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. These unrealized changes in fair value have been included in the Natural Gas Production revenues line item on the Statement of Operations.

The increase in natural gas production
revenues was mainly a result of increased sales prices as well as the increase in overall production. Natural gas production was up slightly from the prior year and production revenues also increased from 2003. Natural gas production increased
slightly in all regions except the West region, where the decline in production was due to lower capital spending in 2003 and continued natural decline. The increases in both sales price and production resulted in an increase in natural gas
production revenues of $54.7 million.

- 37 -


Brokered Natural Gas Revenue and Cost

The decrease in brokered natural gas
revenues of $11.3 million combined with the decline in brokered natural gas cost of $10.9 million resulted in a decrease to the brokered natural gas margin of $0.5 million.

- 38 -


Crude Oil and Condensate Revenues

Our average total company realized crude oil sales price, including the realized impact of derivative instruments, was $31.55 per Bbl
compared to $29.55 per Bbl for 2003. These prices include the realized impact of derivative instruments which reduced these prices by $8.98 per Bbl in 2004 and $1.41 per Bbl in 2003. The following table excludes the unrealized loss from the change
in derivative fair value of $2.9 million and $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These unrealized changes in fair value have been included in the Crude Oil and Condensate revenues line item on the Statement of
Operations.

The decline in crude oil production is
due to emphasis on natural gas in the Gulf Coast drilling program, along with the natural decline of existing production in south Louisiana. The increase in the realized crude oil price combined with the decline in production resulted in a net
revenue decrease of $20.0 million.

- 39 -


Other Operating Revenues

Other operating revenues decreased $3.7 million. This change was primarily a result of decreases in natural gas transportation revenue and natural gas liquid revenue
for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Operating Expenses

Total costs and expenses from operations decreased $85.3 million for the year ended December
31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. The primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows:

•

Brokered natural gas cost decreased $10.9 million. For additional information related to this decrease see the analysis performed for Brokered Natural Gas Revenue and Cost.

•

Exploration expense decreased $10.0 million primarily as a result of higher dry hole expense in 2003. During 2004, we drilled 5 dry exploratory wells compared to 15 in the
corresponding period of 2003.

•

Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization increased, as anticipated, by approximately 9% or $8.4 million. The increase was primarily due to negative reserve revisions in south
Louisiana in 2003, which increased the per Mcfe DD&A rate.

•

Impairment of producing properties expense decreased $90.3 million. This decrease is substantially related to a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $87.9 million related to the
loss of a reversionary interest in the Kurten field incurred in 2003 as discussed below in the “Operating Expenses” section of “2003 and 2002 Compared.”

•

General and Administrative expense increased $9.6 million from 2003 to 2004. Stock compensation expense increased by $4.9 million as a result of performance share awards issued in
2004 and increased amortization of restricted stock grants for grants which occurred during the year. Compliance fees related to Sarbanes-Oxley increased expenses by $2.3 million, and there was a $1.2 million increase in employee related expenses.

•

Taxes other than income increased $3.9 million as a result of higher commodity prices realized in the year ended 2004 as compared to the same period of the prior year.

Interest Expense

Interest expense decreased $1.7 million. This variance is due to a lower average level of
outstanding debt on the revolving credit facility offset somewhat by an increase in Prime rates. Average daily borrowings under the revolving credit facility during the year were $0.5 million in 2004 which is a decrease from $0.7 million in 2003.
Our other remaining debt is at fixed interest rates.

Income Tax Expense

Income tax expense increased $35.2 million due to a comparable increase
in our pre-tax net income.

- 40 -


2003 and 2002 Compared

We reported net income for the year ended December 31, 2003 of $21.1 million, or $0.66 per share. During the corresponding period of 2002,
we reported net income of $16.1 million, or $0.51 per share. Operating income increased by $17.5 million compared to the comparable period of the prior year. The increase in net income and operating income was substantially due to an increase in our
realized natural gas and crude oil prices.

Natural Gas Production Revenues

The average total company realized natural gas production sales price,
including the realized impact of derivative instruments, was $4.51 per Mcf. Due to derivative instruments this price was reduced by $0.68 per Mcf. The following table excludes the unrealized impact of the change in derivative fair value for the year
ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. These amounts have been included in the Natural Gas Production Revenues line item on the Statement of Operations. See Item 7A for a discussion of the realized and unrealized impact of derivative instruments on
operating revenues.

The decline in natural gas production
is due substantially to the size and timing of Gulf Coast and West drilling programs, along with the natural decline of existing production. The increase in the realized natural gas price combined with the decline in production resulted in a net
revenue increase of $101.2 million.

Crude Oil and Condensate Revenues

The average total company realized crude oil sales price, including the realized impact of derivative instruments, was $29.55 per Bbl for
the year ended December 31, 2003. Due to derivative instruments, this price was reduced by $1.41 per Bbl. The following table excludes the unrealized impact of the change in derivative fair value for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. These
amounts have been included in the Crude Oil and Condensate revenues line item on the Statement of Operations. See Item 7A for a discussion of the realized and unrealized impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues.

The decline in crude oil production is
due substantially to the size and timing of the Gulf Coast drilling program, along with the natural decline of existing production. The increase in the realized crude oil price combined with the decline in production resulted in a net revenue
increase of $14.6 million.

- 43 -


Other Operating Revenues

Other operating revenues increased $3.6 million. This change was a result of an increase in plant revenue, transportation revenue and natural gas
liquid revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Operating Expenses

Total costs and expenses from operations increased $150.1 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. The primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows:

•

Brokered natural gas cost increased $33.2 million. For additional information related to this increase see the analysis performed for Brokered Natural Gas Revenue and Cost.

•

Exploration expense increased $18.0 million as a result of higher dry hole expense in 2003. During 2003, we drilled 15 dry exploratory wells compared to 3 in the corresponding
period of 2002.

•

Impairment of producing properties expense increased $91.1 million. This increase is substantially related to a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $87.9 million related to the
loss of a reversionary interest in the Kurten field. Effective February 13, 2003, the Kurten partnership commenced liquidation at the limited partner’s election. In connection with the liquidation, an appraisal was obtained to allocate the
interest in the partnership assets. Based on the receipt of the appraisal in February 2003, we would not receive the reversionary interest as part of the liquidation. Due to the impact of the loss of the reversionary interest on future estimated net
cash flows of the Kurten field we performed an impairment review which resulted in an $87.9 million charge.

•

Taxes other than income increased $12.4 million as a result of higher commodity prices realized in the year ended 2003 as compared to the same period of the prior year.

Interest Expense

Interest expense decreased $2.4 million. This variance is due to the combination of a lower
average level of outstanding debt on the revolving credit facility as well as a decline in interest rates.

Income Tax Expense

Income tax expense
increased $7.4 million due to a comparable increase in our pre-tax net income.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Oil and gas prices fluctuate widely, and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business.

Our revenues, operating results, financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on
prevailing prices for natural gas and, to a lesser extent, oil. Declines in oil and natural gas prices may materially adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and operating results. Lower oil and gas prices
also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically. Historically, oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to be volatile.

Prices for oil and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively
minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. These factors include:

•

The domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas.

•

The level of consumer product demand.

•

Weather conditions.

•

Political conditions in oil producing regions, including the Middle East.

•

The ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls.

•

The price of foreign imports.

•

Actions of governmental authorities.

•

Domestic and foreign governmental regulations.

•

The price, availability and acceptance of alternative fuels.

•

Overall economic conditions.

These factors make it impossible to predict with any certainty the future prices of oil and gas.

Our hedging strategy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets. A hedging committee that consists of
members of senior management oversees our hedging activity. Our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection. These hedging arrangements may expose us to risk of financial loss and limit
the benefit of increases in prices. Please read the discussion below related to commodity price swaps for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity

Periodically, we enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production. At December 31, 2004,
we had 15 cash flow hedges open: 7 natural gas price collar arrangements, one crude oil collar arrangement and 7 natural gas price swap arrangements. Additionally, we had two crude oil financial instruments open at December 31, 2004, that did not
qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133. At December 31, 2004, a $28.8 million ($17.8 million net of tax) unrealized loss was recorded to Other Comprehensive Income, along with a $38.4 million derivative liability and a $2.9 million derivative
receivable. The change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges that is effective is initially recorded to Other Comprehensive Income. The ineffective portion, if any, of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges,
and the change in fair value of all other derivatives is recorded currently in earnings as a component of Natural Gas Production and Crude Oil and Condensate revenue, as appropriate.

- 45 -


The following table summarizes the realized and unrealized impact of derivative activity reflected in the respective line
item in Operating Revenues.

Assuming no change in commodity
prices, after December 31, 2004 we would reclassify to earnings, over the next 12 months, $17.8 million in after-tax expenditures associated with commodity derivatives. This reclassification represents the net liability associated with open
positions currently not reflected in earnings at December 31, 2004 related to anticipated 2005 production.

Hedges on Production - Swaps

From time to time, we enter into natural gas and crude oil swap agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production. These derivatives are not held for trading purposes. Under these price swaps, we
receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas and crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a market-based index, such as the NYMEX gas and crude oil futures. Under our Revolving Credit Agreement, the aggregate level
of commodity hedging must not exceed 100% of the anticipated future equivalent production during the period covered by these cash flow hedges. During 2004, natural gas price swaps covered 29,617 Mmcf, or 41% of our gas production, fixing the sales
price of this gas at an average of $5.04 per Mcf.

At December 31, 2004, we had
open natural gas price swap contracts covering 2005 production as follows:

From time to time we enter into
natural gas and crude oil derivative arrangements that do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133. These financial instruments are recorded at fair value at the balance sheet date. At December 31, 2004, we had two open crude oil swap
arrangements with an unrealized net loss of $5.5 million recognized in Operating Revenues.

- 46 -


Hedges on Production - Options

From time to time, we enter into natural gas and crude oil collar agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a
portion of our production. These cash flow hedges are not held for trading purposes. Under the collar arrangements, if the index price rises above the ceiling price, we pay the counterparty. If the index falls below the floor price, the counterparty
pays us. During 2004, natural gas price collars covered 22,954 Mmcf of our gas production, or 32% of our gas production with a weighted average floor of $4.78 per Mcf and a weighted average ceiling of $6.06 per Mcf.

At December 31, 2004, we had open natural gas price collar contracts covering our 2005
production as follows:

At December 31, 2004, we had one open
crude oil price collar contract covering our 2005 production as follows:

We are exposed to market risk on these
open contracts, to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and oil. However, the market risk exposure on these hedged contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity that is hedged.

The preceding paragraphs contain forward-looking information concerning future
production and projected gains and losses, which may be impacted both by production and by changes in the future market prices of energy commodities. See Forward-Looking Information on page 36.

Fair Market Value of Financial Instruments

The estimated fair value of financial instruments is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged currently between willing
parties. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value. The Company uses available marketing data and valuation methodologies to
estimate the fair value of debt. This disclosure is presented in accordance with SFAS 107, “Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments” and does not impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

- 49 -


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation:

We have completed an integrated audit of Cabot Oil & Gas
Corporation’s 2004 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 and audits of its 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated financial statements

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” effective January 1, 2003.

Internal control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on management’s assessment and on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over
financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such
other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

- 50 -


A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

CABOT OIL & GAS CORPORATION

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation and Nature of Operations

Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation and its subsidiaries are engaged in the exploration, development, production and marketing of natural gas
and, to a lesser extent, crude oil and natural gas liquids. The Company also transports, stores, gathers and purchases natural gas for resale. The Company operates in one segment, natural gas and oil exploration and exploitation almost exclusively
within the continental United States and Canada.

The consolidated financial
statements contain the accounts of the Company after eliminating all significant intercompany balances and transactions. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position
(FSP) No. FAS 106-2, “Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.” This FSP provides guidance on the accounting for the effects of the Medicare Prescription
Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) for employers that sponsor postretirement health care plans that provide prescription drug benefits. This FSP also requires those employers to provide certain disclosures regarding the effect
of the federal subsidy provided by the Act (the subsidy). This FSP supersedes FSP 106-1, “Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003” and is effective for the
first interim period beginning after June 15, 2004. The Company’s current accumulated projected benefit obligation and net periodic postretirement benefit cost does not reflect any amount associated with the subsidy. Furthermore, in 2004, the
Company amended its postretirement benefit plan to exclude prescription drug benefits for participants age 65 and older effective January 1, 2006. The adoption of this FSP is not expected to impact the Company’s operating results, financial
position or cash flows.

In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 151, “Inventory Costs - an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4” in an effort to unite the United States accounting standards for inventories with International Accounting Standards leading to
consistent application of certain accounting requirements. FAS 151 addresses accounting for abnormal amounts of freight, handling costs, idle facility expense and spoilage (wasted material) and requires that these costs be recognized as current
period expenses. Previously, these costs had to be categorized as “so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges.” In addition, allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion must be based on the normal
capacity of the production facilities. FAS 151 will be effective for fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of this statement is not expected to impact the Company’s operating results, financial position or cash flows.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 153 “Exchanges of Nonmonetary
Assets – an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29.” This statement requires that nonmonetary exchanges must be recorded at fair value and the appropriate gain or loss must be recognized so long as the fair value is determinable and the
transaction has commercial substance. According to this statement, companies can no longer use the “similar productive assets” concept to account for nonmonetary exchanges at book value with no gain or loss being recognized. FAS 153 will
be effective for fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of this statement may impact the Company’s operating results, financial position or cash flows in future periods if such a nonmonetary exchange occurs.

- 57 -


In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment.” SFAS 123R revises SFAS 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”, and focuses on accounting for share-based payments for services by employer to employee. The statement requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other equity-based
compensation at the grant date. The statement does not require a certain type of valuation model and either a binomial or Black-Scholes model may be used. The provisions of SFAS 123R are effective for financial statements for fiscal periods ending
after June 15, 2005. The Company is currently evaluating the method of adoption and the impact on the Company’s operating results. Future cash flows of the Company will not be impacted by the adoption of this standard. See “Stock Based
Compensation” below for further information.

In February 2005, the FASB
released for public comment proposed Staff Position FAS 19-a “Accounting for Suspended Well Costs.” This proposed staff position would amend FASB Statement No. 19 “Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing
Companies” and provides guidance about exploratory well costs to companies who use the successful efforts method of accounting. The proposed position states that exploratory well costs should continue to be capitalized if: 1) a sufficient
quantity of reserves are discovered in the well to justify its completion as a producing well and 2) sufficient progress is made in assessing the reserves and the well’s economic and operating feasibility. If the exploratory well costs do not
meet both of these criteria, these costs should be expensed, net of any salvage value. Additional disclosures are required to provide information about management’s evaluation of capitalized exploratory well costs. In addition, the Staff
Position requires the disclosure of: 1) net changes from period to period of capitalized exploratory well costs for wells that are pending the determination of proved reserves, 2) the amount of exploratory well costs that have been capitalized for a
period greater than one year after the completion of drilling and 3) an aging of exploratory well costs suspended for greater than one year with the number of wells it related to. Further, the disclosures should describe the activities undertaken to
evaluate the reserves and the projects, the information still required to classify the associated reserves as proved and the estimated timing for completing the evaluation. Although this Staff Position is not final and has not been adopted by the
company, the company has included the additional disclosures in Note 2. Comments on this proposed FSP are expected by March 7, 2005.

Pipeline Imbalances

Natural gas gathering and pipeline operations normally include imbalance arrangements with the pipeline. The volumes of natural gas due to or from the Company under imbalance arrangements are recorded at actual
selling or purchase prices, as the case may be, and are adjusted monthly to reflect market changes. The net value of the natural gas imbalance is included in inventory in the consolidated balance sheet.

Properties and Equipment

The Company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing
activities. Under this method, acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred. Exploration costs, including geological and geophysical costs, the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory
dry hole drilling costs, are expensed. Development costs, including the costs to drill and equip development wells, and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized.

Exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when incurred pending the determination of whether
a well has found proved reserves. A determination of whether a well has found proved reserves is made shortly after drilling is completed. The determination is based on a process which relies on interpretations of available geologic, geophysic, and
engineering data. If a well is determined to be successful, the capitalized drilling costs will be reclassified as part of the cost of the well. If a well is determined to be unsuccessful, the capitalized drilling costs will be charged to expense in
the period the determination is made. If an exploratory well requires a major capital expenditure before production can begin, the cost of drilling the exploratory well will continue to be carried as an asset pending determination of whether proved
reserves have been found only as long as: i) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well if the required capital expenditure is made and ii) drilling of the additional exploratory wells is under
way or firmly planned for the near future. If drilling in the area is not under way or firmly planned, or if the well has not found a commercially producible quantity of reserves, the exploratory well is assumed to be impaired, and its costs are
charged to expense.

- 58 -


In the absence of a determination as to whether the reserves that have been found can be classified as proved, the costs
of drilling such an exploratory well is not carried as an asset for more than one year following completion of drilling. If, after that year has passed, a determination that proved reserves exist cannot be made, the well is assumed to be impaired,
and its costs are charged to expense.

The impairment of unamortized capital
costs is measured at a lease level and is reduced to fair value if it is determined that the sum of expected future net cash flows is less than the net book value. The Company determines if an impairment has occurred through either adverse changes
or as a result of the annual review of all fields. In 2003, the Company recorded impairments related to the loss of a reversionary interest in its Kurten field and a field in the East region. These impairments totaled $93.8 million. During 2004, the
Company recorded total impairments of $3.5 million. During 2002, the Company recorded total impairments of $2.7 million.

Development costs of proved oil and gas properties, including estimated dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of estimated salvage values and acquisition
costs, are depreciated and depleted on a field basis by the units-of-production method using proved developed and proved reserves, respectively. The costs of unproved oil and gas properties are generally combined and amortized over a period that is
based on the average holding period for such properties and the Company’s experience of successful drilling. Properties related to gathering and pipeline systems and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method based on estimated
useful lives ranging from 10 to 25 years. Certain other assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis.

Costs of retired, sold or abandoned properties that make up a part of an amortization base (partial field) are charged to accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization if the units-of-production rate is not
significantly affected. Accordingly, a gain or loss, if any, is recognized only when a group of proved properties (entire field) that make up the amortization base has been retired, abandoned or sold.

Revenue Recognition and Gas Imbalances

The Company applies the sales method of accounting for natural gas revenue. Under this
method, revenues are recognized based on the actual volume of natural gas sold to purchasers. Natural gas production operations may include joint owners who take more or less than the production volumes entitled to them on certain properties.
Production volume is monitored to minimize these natural gas imbalances. A natural gas imbalance liability is recorded at the actual price realized upon the gas sale in accounts payable in the consolidated balance sheet if the Company’s excess
takes of natural gas exceed its estimated remaining proved developed reserves for these properties. See Note 3 for the Company’s wellhead gas imbalances.

Brokered Natural Gas Margin

The revenues and expenses related to brokering natural gas are reported gross as part of Operating Revenues and Operating Expenses. The Company realizes brokered margin
as a result of buying and selling natural gas in back-to-back transactions. The Company realized $9.2 million, $9.7 million, and $5.7 million of brokered natural gas margin in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities
are recorded for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
the tax rate in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to turn around. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the year of the enacted rate change. A valuation
allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized.

- 59 -


Natural Gas Measurement

The Company records estimated amounts for natural gas revenues and natural gas purchase costs based on volumetric calculations under its natural gas sales and purchase
contracts. Variances or imbalances resulting from such calculations are inherent in natural gas sales, production, operation, measurement, and administration. Management does not believe that differences between actual and estimated natural gas
revenues or purchase costs attributable to the unresolved variances or imbalances are material.

Accounts Payable

This account may
include credit balances from outstanding checks in zero balance cash accounts. The credit balance included in accounts payable was $2.7 million at December 31, 2003, which is reflected as an increase in short-term borrowings in financing activities
in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. There was no credit balance from outstanding checks in zero balance cash accounts included in accounts payable at December 31, 2004 as sufficient cash was available for offset.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts for receivables that the Company
feels may be uncollectible based on the specific identification basis. The allowance for doubtful accounts, which is netted against the accounts receivable line on the balance sheet was $5.3 million and $5.4 million, respectively, as of December 31,
2004 and 2003.

Risk Management Activities

From time to time, the Company enters into derivative contracts, such as natural gas and
crude oil price swaps or costless price collars, as a hedging strategy to manage commodity price risk associated with its inventories, production or other contractual commitments. All hedge transactions are subject to the Company’s risk
management policy which does not permit trading activities. Gains or losses on these hedging activities are generally recognized over the period that its inventories, production or other underlying commitment is hedged as an offset to the specific
hedged item. Cash flows related to any recognized gains or losses associated with these hedges are reported as cash flows from operations. If a hedge is terminated prior to expected maturity, gains or losses are deferred and included in income in
the same period that the underlying production or other contractual commitment is delivered. Unrealized gains or losses associated with any derivative contract not considered a hedge would be recognized currently in the results of operations.

When the designated item associated with a derivative instrument matures, is
sold, extinguished or terminated, derivative gains or losses are recognized as part of the gain or loss on the sale or settlement of the underlying item. For example, in the case of natural gas price hedges, the gain or loss is reflected in natural
gas revenue. When a derivative instrument is associated with an anticipated transaction that is no longer expected to occur or if the hedge is no longer effective, the gain or loss on the derivative is recognized currently in the results of
operations to the extent the market value changes in the derivative have not been offset by the effects of the price changes on the hedged item since the inception of the hedge. See Note 11, Financial Instruments, for further discussion.

Stock Based Compensation

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with the intrinsic value
based method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” Under the intrinsic value based method, compensation cost is the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the stock at
grant date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock.

SFAS
123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”, as amended by SFAS 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and Disclosure”, outlines a fair value based method of accounting for stock options or similar
equity instruments.

- 60 -


The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS 123 to stock-based employee compensation.

The fair value of stock options
included in the pro forma results for each of the three years is not necessarily indicative of future effects on net income and earnings per share.

The assumptions used in the fair value method calculation as well as additional stock based compensation information are disclosed in the following table.

(1)

Compensation expense is defined as expense related to the vesting of stock grants, net of tax. Compensation expense in 2002 also includes $1.7 million related to the acceleration of stock awards due to the retirement of an
executive. Compensation expense in 2004 also includes $2.0 million related to performance shares.

(2)

Calculated using the Black-Scholes fair value based method.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company
considers all highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At December 31, 2004, and 2003, the cash and cash equivalents are primarily concentrated in one financial institution. The
Company periodically assesses the financial condition of these institutions and believes that any possible credit risk is minimal.

- 61 -


Environmental Matters

Environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized, as appropriate, depending on their future economic benefit. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition
caused by past operations, and that do not have future economic benefit are expensed. Liabilities related to future costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when environmental assessments and/or remediation activities are probable and the costs
can be reasonably estimated. Any insurance recoveries are recorded as assets when received.

Use of Estimates

In preparing
financial statements, the Company follows generally accepted accounting principles. These principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

- 62 -


2. Properties and Equipment

Properties and equipment are comprised of the following:

As of December 31, 2004, the Company
has included disclosures that would be required by the pending FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) FAS 19-a, “Accounting for Suspended Well Costs.” The Company evaluated all existing capitalized exploratory well costs under the
provisions of the pending FSP. The following table reflects the net changes in capitalized exploratory well costs during 2004, 2003 and 2002.

(In thousands)

The following table provides an aging
of capitalized exploratory well costs based on the date the drilling was completed and the number of wells for which exploratory well costs have been capitalized for a period greater than one year since the completion of drilling:

There were no capitalized exploratory
well costs at December 31, 2003 and 2002 for wells that have completed drilling without the ability to determine the existence of proved reserves.

- 63 -


At December 31, 2004, the Company had 3 wells that had completed drilling and a determination of whether proved reserves
existed could not be made. One well is in the Rocky Mountain area and reached total depth in November 2004. It cannot be completed due to the Bureau of Land Management stipulation which prohibits activity until the summer of 2005. Two wells are in
Canada and reached completed drilling in October and December 2004. These wells are awaiting completion or sidetracking which is anticipated to commence by May 2005.

During 2004, the Company recorded an impairment of $3.5 million. The impairment was recorded on a two-well field in south Louisiana and was
due to production performance issues related to water encroachment. This impairment charge was recorded due to the capitalized cost of the field exceeding the future undiscounted cash flows. This charge is reflected in the quarterly results and was
measured based on discounted cash flows utilizing a discount rate appropriate for risks associated with the related field.

As part of the 2001 Cody acquisition, we acquired an interest in certain oil and gas properties in the Kurten field, as general partner of a partnership and as an
operator. We had approximately a 25% interest in the field, including a one percent interest in the partnership. Under the partnership agreement, we had the right to a reversionary working interest that would bring our ultimate interest to 50% upon
the limited partner reaching payout. Based on the addition of this reversionary interest, and because the field has over a 40-year reserve life, approximately $91 million was allocated to this field under purchase accounting at the time of the
acquisition. Additionally, the limited partner had the sole option to trigger a liquidation of the partnership.

Effective February 13, 2003, liquidation of the partnership commenced at the election of the limited partner. The limited partner was a financial entity and not an
industry operator. Their decision to liquidate was based upon their perception that the value of their investment in the partnership had increased due to an increase in underlying commodity prices, primarily oil, since their investment in 1999. We
proceeded with the liquidation to avoid having a minority interest in a non-operated water flood field for which the new operator was not designated at the time of liquidation. In connection with the liquidation, an appraisal was required to be
obtained to allocate the interest in the partnership assets. Additionally, the Company was required to test the field for recoverability in accordance with SFAS 144. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement and based on the appraised value
of the partnership assets it was not possible for us to obtain the reversionary interest as part of the liquidation. Due to the impact of the loss of the reversionary interest on future estimated net cash flows of the Kurten field, the limited
partner’s decision and our decision to proceed with the liquidation, an impairment review was performed which required an after-tax impairment charge in the first quarter of 2003 of $54.4 million. This impairment charge is reflected in the 2003
Statement of Operations as an operating expense but did not impact our cash flows.

During 2003 the Company divested of certain non-strategic assets. These assets include properties in Pennsylvania that were sold for $16.1 million, and resulted in a gain of $6.9 million. Additionally, the Company divested of a water
treatment facility in the amount of $3.4 million, which resulted in a gain of $2.5 million.

In 2002, the Company recorded impairments of $2.7 million. Included in this impairment amount were impairments on four small fields, three of which were in the Gulf Coast and one in the Rocky Mountains. For each of
these fields, the capitalized cost exceeded the future undiscounted cash flows. In addition, a pipeline in the Eastern region was written down to fair market value.

4. Inventories

Inventories are comprised of the following:

Natural gas and oil in storage is
valued at average cost. Tubular goods and well equipment is valued at historical cost. All inventory balances are carried at the lower of cost or market.

5. Debt and Credit Agreements

7.19% Notes

In November 1997, the Company issued an aggregate principal amount of $100 million of its 12-year 7.19% Notes (7.19% Notes) to a group of six institutional investors in a private placement offering. The 7.19% Notes
require five annual $20 million principal payments starting in November 2005. The Company may prepay all or any portion of the indebtedness on any date with a prepayment penalty. The 7.19% Notes contain restrictions on the merger of the Company or
any subsidiary with a third party other than under certain limited conditions. There are also various other restrictive covenants customarily found in such debt instruments. These covenants include a required asset coverage ratio (present value of
proved reserves to debt and other liabilities) that must be at least 1.5 to 1.0, and a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 2.8 to 1.0.

7.33% Weighted Average Fixed Rate Notes

To partially fund the cash portion of the acquisition of Cody Company in August 2001, the
Company issued $170 million of Notes to a group of seven institutional investors in a private placement transaction in July 2001. Prior to the determination of the Note’s interest rates, the Company entered into a treasury lock in order to
reduce the risk of rising interest rates. Interest rates rose during the pricing period, resulting in a $0.7 million gain that will be amortized over the life of the Notes, and thereby reducing the effective interest rate by 5.5 basis points. All of
the Notes have bullet maturities and were issued in three separate tranches as follows:

The Notes were issued under the same
Note Purchase Agreement as the 7.19% Notes.

Revolving Credit Agreement

On December 10, 2004, the Company amended its Revolving Credit Agreement
(Credit Facility) with a group of nine banks. The Credit Facility at year end was $250 million. It can be expanded up to $350 million, either with the existing banks or new banks. This Credit Facility is unsecured. The term of the Credit Facility
expires in December 2009. The available credit line is subject to adjustment from time to time on the basis of the projected present value (as determined by the banks’ petroleum engineer) of estimated future net cash flows from certain proved
oil and gas reserves and other assets of the Company. While the Company does not expect a reduction in the available credit line, in the event that it is adjusted below the outstanding level of borrowings, the Company has a period of six months to
reduce its outstanding debt to the adjusted credit line available with a requirement to provide additional borrowing base assets or pay down one-sixth of the excess during each of the six months.

- 66 -


Interest rates under the Credit Facility are based on Euro-Dollars (LIBOR) or Base Rate (Prime) indications, plus a
margin. These associated margins increase if the total indebtedness is 50% or greater, greater than 75% or greater than 90% of the Company’s debt limit of $530 million, which can be expanded up to $630 million, as shown below.

The Company’s effective interest
rates for the Credit Facility in the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002 were 4.2%, 1.9%, and 3.4%, respectively. The Credit Facility provides for a commitment fee on the unused available balance at an annual rate of one-quarter of 1%. The
Credit Facility also contains various customary restrictions, which include the following:

(a)

Maintenance of a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 2.8 to 1.0.

(b)

Prohibition on the merger or sale of all, or substantially all, of the Company’s or any subsidiary’s assets to a third party, except under certain limited conditions.

The Company was in compliance with all covenants at December 31,
2004 and 2003 and during the years then ended.

6. Employee Benefit Plans

Pension Plan

The Company has a non-contributory, defined benefit pension plan for all full-time
employees. Plan benefits are based primarily on years of service and salary level near retirement. Plan assets are mainly fixed income investments and equity securities. The Company complies with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)
of 1974 and Internal Revenue Code limitations when funding the plan. The measurement date used to measure pension benefit amounts is December 31, 2004.

The Company has a non-qualified equalization plan to ensure payments to certain executive officers of amounts to which they are already entitled under the provisions of
the pension plan, but which are subject to limitations imposed by federal tax laws. This plan is unfunded.

Net periodic pension cost of the Company during the last three years is comprised of the following:

- 67 -


The following table illustrates the
funded status of the Company’s pension plans at December 31:

The change in the combined projected
benefit obligation of the Company’s qualified and non-qualified pension plans during the last three years is explained as follows:

The change in the combined plan assets
at fair value of the Company’s qualified and non-qualified pension plans during the last three years is explained as follows:

- 68 -


The reconciliation of the combined funded status of the Company’s qualified and non-qualified pension plans at the
end of the last three years is explained as follows:

Assumptions used to determine
projected postretirement benefit obligations and pension costs are as follows:

(1)

Represents the year end rates used to determine the projected benefit obligation. To compute pension cost in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, the beginning of year
discount rates of 6.25%, 6.50% and 7.25%, were used.

The
long-term expected rate of return used in 2004 is eight percent. The Company establishes the long-term expected rate of return by developing a forward looking long-term expected rate of return assumption for each asset class, taking into account
factors such as the expected real return for the specific asset class and inflation.

Estimated future benefit payments under the Company’s qualified and non-qualified pension plans are expected to be paid as follows:

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the
non-qualified pension plan did not have plan assets. The plan assets of the Company’s qualified pension plan at December 31, 2004 and 2003, by asset category are as follows:

(1)

Primarily consists of cash and cash equivalents.

- 69 -


The Company’s investment strategy for benefit plan assets is to invest in funds to maximize the return over the
long-term, subject to an appropriate level of risk. Additionally, the objective is for each class of investments to outperform its representative benchmark over the long term.

The funding levels of the pension plans are in compliance with standards set by applicable law or regulation. In 2004 the Company did not
have any required minimum funding obligations; however, it chose to fund $2 million into the plan. In 2005 the Company does not have any required minimum funding obligations. Currently, management has not determined if a discretionary funding will
be made in 2005.

Savings Investment Plan

The Company has a Savings Investment Plan (SIP) which is a defined contribution plan. The
Company matches a portion of employees’ contributions in cash. Participation in the SIP is voluntary and all regular employees of the Company are eligible to participate. The Company charged to expense plan contributions of $1.4 million, $1.4
million, and $1.3 million in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. The Company matches employee contributions dollar-for-dollar on the first 6% of an employee’s pretax earnings. The Company’s Common Stock is an investment option within the
SIP.

Deferred Compensation Plan

In 1998, the Company established a Deferred Compensation Plan. This plan is available to
officers of the Company and acts as a supplement to the Savings Investment Plan. The Company matches a portion of the employee’s contribution and those assets are invested in instruments selected by the employee. Unlike the SIP, the Deferred
Compensation Plan does not have dollar limits on tax deferred contributions. However, the assets of this plan are held in a rabbi trust and are subject to additional risk of loss in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company. At December
31, 2004, the balance in the Deferred Compensation Plan’s rabbi trust was $4.2 million.

The employee participants guide the diversification of trust assets. The trust assets are invested in mutual funds that cover the investment spectrum from equity to money market. These mutual funds are publicly quoted
and reported at market value. No shares of the Company’s stock are held by the trust. Settlement payments are made to participants in cash, either in a lump sum or in periodic installments. The market value of the trust assets is recorded on
the Company’s balance sheet as a component of Other Assets and the corresponding liability is recorded as a component of Other Liabilities.

There is no impact on earnings or earnings per share from the changes in market value of the deferred compensation plan assets for two reasons. First, the changes in
market value of the trust assets are offset completely by changes in the value of the liability, which represents trust assets belonging to plan participants. Second, no shares of the Company’s stock are held in the trust.

The Company charged to expense plan contributions of less than $20,000 in each year
presented.

Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions

In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company provides certain health care and life
insurance benefits for retired employees, including their spouses, eligible dependents and surviving spouses (retirees). These benefits are commonly called postretirement benefits. Most employees become eligible for these benefits if they meet
certain age and service requirements at retirement. The Company was providing postretirement benefits to 251 retirees and their dependants at the end of 2004 and 244 retirees and their dependants at the end of 2003. The measurement date used to
measure postretirement benefits other than pensions is December 31, 2004.

- 70 -


When the Company adopted SFAS 106, “Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pension”,
in 1992, it began amortizing the $16.9 million accumulated postretirement benefit, known as the Transition Obligation, over a period of 20 years, or $0.8 million per year which is included in the annual expense of the plan. Included in the
amortization benefit of the unrecognized transition obligation amount below are the effects of plan amendments during 1996, 2000 and 2004. The remaining unamortized balance is $4.6 million which will be amortized over the next seven years.

Postretirement benefit costs recognized during the last three years are as
follows:

The health care cost trend rate used
to measure the expected cost from 2000 to 2003 for medical benefits to retirees was 8%. Provisions of the plan should prevent significant future increases in employer cost after 2000. During the year ended December 31, 2004, the plan was amended and
the limit, or cap, on the employer subsidy for medical and prescription drug coverage provided to participants age 65 and older was removed. In addition, certain other modifications to the plan were made to limit prescription drug coverage (for
participants not age 65 and older) and increase the plan deductibles and reimbursements by retirees. The company subsidy for all retiree medical and prescription drug benefits for all other participants, beginning January 1, 2006, is limited to an
aggregate annual amount not to exceed $648,000. This limit will increase by 3.5% annually thereafter.

The health care cost trend rate used at December 31, 2004 was 10%. The rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline (the ultimate trend rate) is 5% as of December 31, 2004. The year that this ultimate trend
rate will be reached is 2009.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a
significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:

The change in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation during the last three years is presented as follows:

Estimated future benefit payments are
expected to be paid as follows:

On December 8, 2003, the Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) was signed into law. The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a
benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to certain Medicare benefits. In accordance with FSP No. FAS 106-2, “Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of
2003”, any measures of the accumulated plan benefit obligation or net periodic postretirement benefit cost in the financial statements or accompanying notes do not reflect the effects of the Act on the Company’s plan. As the Company has
amended the postretirement benefit plan to exclude prescription drug benefits to participants age 65 and older effective January 1, 2006, management believes this FSP will not have an impact on operating results, financial position or cash flows of
the Company.

7. Income Taxes

Income tax expense (benefit) is summarized as follows:

Total income taxes were different than
the amounts computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate as follows:

(1)

Other, Net includes credit adjustments of $1.6 million related to the recognition of benefit for federal statutory depletion
in excess of basis, $0.9 million related to the recognition of benefit for state statutory depletion in excess of basis, and other permanent items.

(2)

Other, Net includes credit adjustments of $0.8 million related to the recognition of benefit for a state statutory depletion
in excess of basis and $0.5 million related to the recognition of a benefit for a state net operating loss.

(3)

Other, Net includes credit adjustments totaling $0.8 million to deferred taxes as a result of a reduction to the state
effective tax rate, $0.8 million to deferred taxes as a result of basis adjustments related to the Cody acquisition, and other permanent items.

The tax effects of temporary differences that resulted in significant portions of the deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets as of
December 31 were as follows:

- 73 -


As of December 31, 2004, the Company had a net operating loss carryforward of $39.5 million for state income tax
reporting purposes, the majority of which will expire between 2011 and 2024 and none available for regular federal income tax purposes. It is expected that these deferred tax benefits will be utilized prior to their expiration.

8. Commitments and Contingencies

Lease Commitments

The Company leases certain transportation vehicles, warehouse facilities, office space, and machinery and equipment under cancelable and
non-cancelable leases. The lease for the Company’s office in Houston runs for approximately five more years. Most of the Company’s leases expire within five years and may be renewed. Rent expense under such arrangements totaled $8.7
million, $8.5 million, and $8.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

Future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable leases in effect at December 31, 2004 are as follows:

Contingencies

The Company is a defendant in various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of our
business. All known liabilities are fully accrued based on management’s best estimate of the potential loss. While the outcome and impact on the Company cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the resolution of these
proceedings through settlement or adverse judgment will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position. Operating results and cash flow, however, could be significantly impacted in the reporting periods in
which such matters are resolved.

Wyoming Royalty Litigation

In June 2000, the Company was sued by two overriding royalty owners
in Wyoming state court for unspecified damages. The plaintiffs requested class certification and alleged that the Company had improperly deducted costs of production from royalty payments to the plaintiffs and other similarly situated persons.
Additionally, the suit claimed that the Company had failed to properly inform the plaintiffs and other similarly situated persons of the deductions taken from royalties. At a mediation held in April 2003, the plaintiffs in this case claimed total
damages of $9.5 million plus attorney fees. The Company settled the case for a total of $2.25 million and the State District Court Judge entered his order approving the settlement in the fourth quarter of 2003. The class included all private fee
royalty and overriding royalty owners of the Company in the State of Wyoming except those in the suit discussed below and one owner who opted out of the settlement. It also includes provisions for the method of valuation of gas for royalty payment
purposes going forward and for reporting of royalty payments, which should prevent further litigation of these issues by the class members.

In January 2002, 13 overriding royalty owners sued the Company in Wyoming federal district court. The plaintiffs in the federal case have made the same general claims
pertaining to deductions from their overriding royalty as the plaintiffs in the Wyoming state court case but have not asked for class certification.

- 74 -


The federal district court judge certified two questions of state law for decision by the Wyoming State Supreme Court,
which recently answered both questions. The Wyoming Supreme Court ruled that certain deductions taken by the Company from the plaintiffs were not proper and that the statutes of limitations advanced by the Company are discovery statutes and
accordingly do not begin to run until the plaintiffs knew, or had reason to know, of the violation. The Company believes it has properly reported to the plaintiffs, and that if it did not, the plaintiffs knew or should have known the reporting was
improper and the nature of the deductions, thus triggering the statute of limitations. The Company still intends to raise defenses to the alleged failure to report claims. There is also a dispute as to how the interest should be calculated.

The federal judge refused to certify a question relating to the issue of the
proper calculation of damages for failure to provide certain information required by statute on overriding royalty owner check stubs that had been decided adversely to our position in a state district court letter decision in a separate case. After
the federal judge’s refusal to certify this issue, the plaintiffs reduced the damages they were claiming. Based upon recent communication from the plaintiffs they are now claiming $26.2 million in total damages which consists of $20.3 million
for alleged violations of the check stub reporting statute and $5.9 million for all other damages.

In the opinion of our outside counsel, Brown, Drew & Massey, LLP, the likelihood of the plaintiffs recovering $20.3 million for the check stub reporting statute is remote. However, a reserve that management
believes is adequate to provide for the check stub reporting statute and all other damages has been established based on management’s estimate at this time of the probable outcome of this case.

West Virginia Royalty Litigation

In December 2001, the Company was sued by two royalty owners in West Virginia state court
for an unspecified amount of damages. The plaintiffs have requested class certification under the West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure and allege that the Company failed to pay royalty based upon the wholesale market value of the gas produced,
that it had taken improper deductions from the royalty and failed to properly inform the plaintiffs and other similarly situated persons of deductions taken from the royalty. The plaintiffs have also claimed that they are entitled to a 1/8th royalty
share of the gas sales contract settlement that the Company reached with Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation in the 1995 Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation bankruptcy proceeding.

Discovery and pleadings necessary to place the class certification issue before the state court have been ongoing. A hearing on the
plaintiffs’ motion for class certification was held on October 20, 2003, and proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law were submitted to the court on December 5, 2003. A status conference was held with the court and the court advised it
intends to issue a ruling on the class certification motion. The court was expected to rule by December 2004, and we are still awaiting a decision. Discovery is proceeding on the claims pending the ruling on the class certification motion. Discovery
is to be completed by April 1, 2005, and the trial is currently scheduled for August 15, 2005. If a class is certified it is expected this trial date will be continued to a later date.

The investigation into this claim continues and it is in the discovery phase. The Company is vigorously defending the case. It has a reserve
that management believes is adequate based on its estimate of the probable outcome of this case.

Texas Title Litigation

On January 6, 2003, the Company was served with Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Original Petition in Romeo Longoria, et al. v. Exxon Mobil
Corporation, et al. in the 79th Judicial District Court of Brooks County, Texas. Plaintiffs filed their First Supplemental Original Petition on March 17, 2004 and their Second Supplemental Petition on November 12, 2004. The significant change in the
second Supplemental Petition is that plaintiffs appear to limit their claim to the mineral estate, rather than making claims to both the surface and mineral estate. The plaintiffs allege that they are the rightful owners of a one-half undivided
mineral interest in and to certain lands in Brooks County, Texas. As Cody Energy, LLC, the Company acquired certain leases and wells from Wynn-Crosby 1996, Ltd. in 1997 and 1998 and the Company subsequently acquired a 320 acre lease from Hector and
Gloria Lopez in 2001. The plaintiffs allege that they are entitled to be declared the rightful owners of an undivided interest in minerals and all improvements on the lands on which the Company acquired these leases. The plaintiffs also assert
claims for trespass to try title, action to remove a cloud on the title, failure to properly account for royalty, fraud, trespass, conversion, all for unspecified actual and exemplary damages. The original trial date of May 19, 2003 was cancelled
and a new trial date has not been set. The Company has not had the opportunity to conduct discovery in this matter. The Company estimates that production revenue from this field since its predecessor, Cody Energy, LLC, acquired title and since the
Company acquired its lease is approximately $14.9 million. The carrying value of this property is approximately $34 million. Co-defendants Shell Oil Company and Shell Western E&P filed a motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal of
plaintiffs’ causes of action on multiple grounds. The original plaintiffs’ attorneys asked permission from the Court to withdraw from the representation. The Court granted that request, and new attorneys for some, but not all of the
plaintiffs have recently entered the case. The motion for summary judgment was reset and a hearing was held in December of 2003. The Company joined in the motion. After a second hearing, the Court denied the motion for summary judgment. The
defendants have moved to add parties whose title interests are being challenged by the plaintiffs, and who are therefore necessary to the case, or in the alternative, abate the proceeding until the plaintiffs join all parties whose interests may be
affected by plaintiffs’ claims.

Although the investigation into this
claim is in its early stages, the Company intends to vigorously defend the case. Should the Company receive an adverse ruling in this case, an impairment review would be assessed to ensure the carrying value of the property is recoverable.
Management cannot currently determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or range of any potential loss should the outcome be unfavorable. Accordingly, there has been no reserve established for this matter.

Raymondville Area

In April 2004, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Cody Energy, LLC, filed suit in
Willacy County, Texas against certain of its co-working interest owners in the Raymondville Area, located in Kenedy and Willacy Counties. In early 2003, Cody had proposed a new prospect to certain of these co-working interest owners located within
jointly owned oil and gas leases. Some of the co-working interest owners elected to participate and some did not. The initial well was successful and subsequent wells have been drilled to exploit the discovery made in the first well.

In December 2003, certain of the co-working interest owners who elected not to participate in
the initial well notified Cody that they believed that they had the right to participate in subsequent wells. Cody contends that, under the terms of the agreements between the parties, the co-working interest owners that elected not to participate
in the initial well in the prospect were required to assign their interest in the proposed prospect to those who elected to participate. Alternatively, Cody contends that such owners lost their right to participate in subsequent wells within a 1,200
foot radius of the initial well.

The defendants have filed a counter claim
against the Company and one of the defendants has filed a lien against Cody’s interest in the leases in the Raymondville Area. Cody contends that this lien is improper and has sought damages for its filing. Cody is vigorously prosecuting this
case which is in its early stage of discovery. No trial date has been set by the court.

- 76 -


Certain of the defendants filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment contending that they did not have adequate notice
of the prospect proposal. Cody is contesting this Motion. In addition, in late December 2004, Cody filed a Motion for Final Summary Judgment asking the court to find that, under the terms of the agreements, Cody and the participating working
interest owners are entitled to an assignment of the interests of the co-working interest owners who elected not to participate in the prospect. No hearing date has been set by the court.

Management cannot currently determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or range of any potential loss should the outcome be
unfavorable. Accordingly, there has been no reserve established for this matter.

Commitment and Contingency Reserves

The Company has
established reserves for certain legal proceedings. The establishment of a reserve involves an estimation process that includes the advice of legal counsel and subjective judgment of management. While management believes these reserves to be
adequate, it is reasonably possible that the Company could incur approximately $11.1 million of additional loss with respect to those matters in which reserves have been established. Future changes in the facts and circumstances could result in the
actual liability exceeding the estimated ranges of loss and amounts accrued.

While the outcome and impact on the Company cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the resolution of these proceedings through settlement or adverse judgment will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated
financial position of the Company. Operating results and cash flow, however, could be significantly impacted in the reporting periods in which such matters are resolved.

9. Cash Flow Information

Cash paid for interest and income taxes is as follows:

The Company recorded benefits of $2.6
million, $1.0 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, for tax deductions taken due to employee stock option exercises and restricted stock grant vesting.

10. Capital Stock

Incentive Plans

On April 29, 2004, the 2004 Incentive Plan was approved by the shareholders. Under the 2004 Incentive Plan, incentive and non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation
rights (SARs), stock awards, cash awards and performance awards may be granted to key employees, consultants and officers of the Company. Non-employee directors of the Company may be granted discretionary awards under the 2004 Incentive Plan
consisting of stock options or stock awards, in addition to the automatic award of an option to purchase 10,000 shares of Common Stock on the date the non-employee directors first join the board of directors. A total of 1,700,000 shares of Common
Stock may be issued under the 2004 Incentive Plan. In addition, shares remaining available for award under the 1994 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the Second Amended and Restated 1994 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan (herein “Prior
Plans”) were subsumed into the 2004 Incentive Plan (228,398 shares on April 29, 2004). Under the 2004 Incentive Plan, no more than 600,000 shares may be used for stock awards that are not subject to the achievement of performance based goals,
and no more than 1,000,000 shares may be issued pursuant to incentive stock options. Awards outstanding under the Prior Plans will remain outstanding in accordance with their original terms and conditions.

- 77 -


During 2004, the Board of Directors granted a series of 168,500 performance share awards to certain executives and key
employees of the Company. These awards are earned based on the comparative performance of the Company’s Common Stock measured against sixteen other companies in the Company’s peer group over a three year vesting period ending on December
31, 2006. Depending on the Company’s performance, employees may earn up to 100% of the award in Common Stock, and an additional 100% of the award in cash. The performance shares qualify for variable accounting, and accordingly, are recorded at
their fair value with compensation expense recognized over the performance period.

During 2004, the Company granted 7,000 restricted stock units to various Company Directors. These units immediately vest and will be paid out whenever the Director ceases to be a Director of the Company. For all restricted stock units, the

Dividend Restrictions

The Board of Directors of the Company determines the amount of future cash dividends, if any, to be declared and paid on the Common Stock depending on, among other
things, the Company’s financial condition, funds from operations, the level of its capital and exploration expenditures, and its future business prospects. None of the note or credit agreements in place have a restricted payment provision.

Treasury Stock

In August 1998, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to two
million shares of outstanding Common Stock at market prices. The timing and amount of these stock purchases are determined at the discretion of management. The Company may use the repurchased shares to fund stock compensation programs presently in
existence, or for other corporate purposes. During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company repurchased 405,100 shares for a total cost of approximately $15.6 million. The repurchased shares are held as treasury stock. Since the authorization
date, the Company has repurchased 707,700 shares, or 35% of the total shares authorized for repurchase, for a total cost of approximately $20 million. In 2004, the stock repurchase plan was funded from cash flow from operations. No treasury shares
have been delivered or sold by the Company subsequent to the repurchase.

Purchase Rights

On January 21, 1991, the Board of Directors
adopted the Preferred Stock Purchase Rights Plan and declared a dividend distribution of one right for each outstanding share of Common Stock. On December 8, 2000, the rights agreement for the plan was amended and restated to extend the term of the
plan to 2010 and to make other changes. Each right becomes exercisable, at a price of $55, when any person or group has acquired or made a tender or exchange offer for beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the Company’s outstanding Common
Stock. Each right entitles the holder, other than the acquiring person or group, to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (Junior Preferred Stock). After a person or group acquires beneficial
ownership of 15% of the Common Stock, each right entitles the holder to purchase Common Stock or other property having a market value (as defined in the plan) of twice the exercise price of the right. An exception to this triggering event applies in
the case of a tender or exchange offer for all outstanding shares of Common Stock determined to be fair and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders by a majority of the independent directors. Under certain circumstances, the Board
of Directors may opt to exchange one share of Common Stock for each exercisable right. If there is a 15% holder and the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination in which it is not the survivor, or 50% or more of the
Company’s assets or earning power are sold or transferred, each right entitles the holder to purchase common stock of the acquiring company with a market value (as defined in the plan) equal to twice the exercise price of each right. At
December 31, 2004 there were no shares of Junior Preferred Stock issued or outstanding.

The rights expire on January 21, 2010, and may be redeemed by the Company for $0.01 per right at any time before a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15% of the Common Stock.

11. Financial Instruments

The estimated fair value of financial instruments is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged currently between willing
parties. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value. The Company uses available marketing data and valuation methodologies to
estimate the fair value of debt. This disclosure is presented in accordance with SFAS 107, “Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments” and does not impact the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

Long-Term Debt

The fair value of long-term debt is
the estimated cost to acquire the debt, including a premium or discount for the difference between the issue rate and the year end market rate. The fair value of the 7.19% Notes, the 7.26% Notes, the 7.36% Notes and the 7.46% Notes is based on
interest rates currently available to the Company. The Credit Facility approximates fair value because this instrument bears interest at rates based on current market rates.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity

The Company periodically enters into derivative commodity instruments to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production. At December
31, 2004, the Company had 15 cash flow hedges open: 7 natural gas price collar arrangements, one crude oil collar arrangement and 7 natural gas price swap arrangements. Additionally, the Company had two crude oil financial instruments open at
December 31, 2004, that did not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133. At December 31, 2004, a $28.8 million ($17.8 million net of tax) unrealized loss was recorded to Other Comprehensive Income, along with a $38.4 million derivative liability
and a $2.9 million derivative receivable. The change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges that is effective is initially recorded to Other Comprehensive Income. The ineffective portion, if any, of the change in the fair value of
derivatives designated as hedges, and the changes in fair value of all other derivatives is recorded currently in earnings as a component of Natural Gas Production and Crude Oil and Condensate revenue, as appropriate.

The following table summarizes the realized and unrealized impact of derivative activity
reflected in the respective line item in Operating Revenues.

Assuming no change in commodity
prices, after December 31, 2004 the Company would reclassify to earnings, over the next 12 months, $17.8 million in after-tax expenditures associated with commodity derivatives. This reclassification represents the net liability associated with open
positions currently not reflected in earnings at December 31, 2004 related to anticipated 2005 production.

- 80 -


Hedges on Production - Swaps

From time to time, the Company enters into natural gas and crude oil swap agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with
a portion of its production. These derivatives are not held for trading purposes. Under these price swaps, the Company receives a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas and crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a
market-based index, such as the NYMEX gas and crude oil futures. Under the Company’s Revolving Credit Agreement, the aggregate level of commodity hedging must not exceed 100% of the anticipated future equivalent production during the period
covered by these cash flow hedges. During 2004, natural gas price swaps covered 29,617 Mmcf, or 41% of the Company’s gas production, fixing the sales price of this gas at an average of $5.04 per Mcf.

At December 31, 2004, the Company had open natural gas price swap contracts covering its 2005
production as follows:

From time to time the Company enters
into natural gas and crude oil derivative arrangements that do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133. These financial instruments are recorded at fair value at the balance sheet date. At December 31, 2004, the Company had two open crude
oil swap arrangements with an unrealized net loss of $5.5 million recognized in Operating Revenues.

- 81 -


Hedges on Production - Options

From time to time, the Company enters into natural gas and crude oil collar agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated
with a portion of its production. These cash flow hedges are not held for trading purposes. Under the collar arrangements, if the index price rises above the ceiling price, the Company pays the counterparty. If the index falls below the floor price,
the counterparty pays the Company. During 2004, natural gas price collars covered 22,954 Mmcf of the Company’s gas production, or 32% of the Company’s gas production with a weighted average floor of $4.78 per Mcf and a weighted average
ceiling of $6.06 per Mcf.

At December 31, 2004, the Company had open natural
gas price collar contracts covering its 2005 production as follows:

At December 31, 2004, we had one open
crude oil price collar contract covering our 2005 production as follows:

The Company is exposed to market risk
on these open contracts, to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and oil. However, the market risk exposure on these hedged contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity that is
hedged.

Credit Risk

Although notional contract amounts are used to express the volume of natural gas price
agreements, the amounts that can be subject to credit risk in the event of non-performance by third parties are substantially smaller. The Company does not anticipate any material impact on its financial results due to non-performance by the third
parties.

In 2004, approximately 11% of the Company’s total sales were
made to one customer. In 2003 and 2002, approximately 11% and 14%, respectively, of our total sales were made to one customer. In 2002, this customer operated certain properties in which we have interests in the Gulf Coast and purchased all of the
production from these wells. This customer would resell the natural gas and oil to third parties with whom we would deal directly if the customer either ceased to exist or stopped buying our portion of the production.

12. Adoption of SFAS 143, “

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations”

Effective January 1, 2003 the Company adopted SFAS 143, “Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations.” SFAS 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset
retirement cost is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. Subsequently, the asset retirement cost is allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method over the assets useful life. The adoption of SFAS 143
resulted in an increase of total liabilities because additional retirement obligations are required to be recognized, an increase in the recognized cost of assets because the retirement costs are added to the carrying amount of the long-lived asset
and an increase in operating expense because of the accretion of the retirement obligation and additional depreciation and depletion. The majority of the asset retirement obligations recorded by the Company relate to the plugging and abandonment of
oil and gas wells. However, liabilities will also be recorded for meter stations, pipelines, processing plants and compressors. At December 31, 2004 there are no assets legally restricted for purposes of settling asset retirement obligations. The
Company recorded a net-of-tax charge for the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle loss, in January of 2003, of approximately $6.8 million ($11.0 million before tax) and recorded a retirement obligation of approximately $35.2 million.
There will be no impact on the Company’s cash flows as a result of adopting SFAS 143.

Additional retirement obligations increase the liability associated with new oil and gas wells and other facilities as these obligations are incurred. Accretion expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $1.7
million. Accretion expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $2.1 million.

The following table reflects the changes of the asset retirement obligations during the current period.

If SFAS 143 had been adopted on
January 1, 2002, pro forma net income would have been approximately $15.1 million, pro forma basic earnings per share would have been $0.48 and pro forma diluted earnings per share would have been $0.47. These pro forma figures are unaudited.

13. Section 29 Tax Credits

Other revenue includes income generated from the monetization of the value of Section 29 tax
credits (monetized credits) from most of the Company’s qualifying East and Rocky Mountains properties. The tax credit wells were repurchased in December 2002 and no tax credits were generated in 2003 or 2004 as the credits expired in 2002.
Revenue from these monetized credits was $2.0 million in 2002. The production, revenues, expenses and proved reserves for these properties was reported by the Company as Other Revenue until the credits were repurchased in December 2002. In this
repurchase transaction, the Company acquired 26 Bcfe for $7 million, or $0.27 per Mcfe. The effective date of the repurchase was December 31, 2002.

- 83 -


14. Earnings per Common Share

Basic earnings per common share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income (the numerator) by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for the period (the denominator). Diluted EPS is similarly calculated using the treasury stock method except that the denominator is increased to reflect the potential dilution that could occur if outstanding stock options and stock
awards outstanding at the end of the applicable period were exercised for common stock.

The following is a calculation of basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002:

15. Subsequent Event-Stock Split

On February 28, 2005, the Company announced that the Board of Directors
had declared a 3-for-2 split on the Company’s Common Stock in the form of a stock distribution. The stock dividend will be distributed on March 31, 2005 to shareholders of record on March 18, 2005. In lieu of issuing fractional shares, the
Company will pay cash based on the closing price of the Common stock on the record date. The pro forma effect on the December 31, 2004 balance sheet is to reduce Additional Paid-in-Capital by $1.6 million and increase Common Stock by $1.6 million.
Common shares outstanding, giving retroactive effect to the stock split at December 31, 2004 and 2003 would have been 48.6 million and 48.4 million, respectively. Pro forma earnings per share, giving retrospective effect to the stock split is as
follows:

SUPPLEMENTAL OIL AND GAS INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)

Oil and Gas Reserves

Users of this information should be aware that the process of estimating quantities of “proved” and “proved developed” natural gas and crude oil
reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result
of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. As a result, revisions to existing reserve
estimates may occur from time to time. Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible, the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various
reservoirs make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in the financial statement disclosures.

Proved reserves represent estimated quantities of natural gas, crude oil and condensate that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be
recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions in effect when the estimates were made.

Proved developed reserves are proved reserves expected to be recovered through wells and equipment in place and under operating methods used when the estimates were made.

Estimates of proved and proved developed reserves at December 31, 2004, 2003,
and 2002 were based on studies performed by the Company’s petroleum engineering staff. The estimates were reviewed by Miller and Lents, Ltd., who indicated in their letter dated February 7, 2005, that based on their investigation and subject to
the limitations described in their letter, they believe the results of those estimates and projections were reasonable in the aggregate.

No major discovery or other favorable or unfavorable event after December 31, 2004, is believed to have caused a material change in the estimates of proved or proved
developed reserves as of that date.

The following table illustrates the
Company’s net proved reserves, including changes, and proved developed reserves for the periods indicated, as estimated by the Company’s engineering staff.

Capitalized Costs Relating to Oil
and Gas Producing Activities

The following table illustrates the total
amount of capitalized costs relating to natural gas and crude oil producing activities and the total amount of related accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization.

Costs Incurred in Oil and Gas
Property Acquisition, Exploration and Development Activities

Costs
incurred in property acquisition, exploration and development activities were as follows:

(1)

Includes administrative exploration costs of $11,354, $10,582, and $8,942 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

Historical Results of Operations from Oil and Gas Producing Activities

The results of operations for the Company’s oil and gas producing activities were as
follows:

(1)

Includes administrative exploration costs of $11,354, $10,582, and $8,942 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows
Relating to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves

The following information has
been developed utilizing SFAS 69,

“Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities”

, procedures and based on natural gas and crude oil reserve and production volumes estimated by the Company’s engineering staff. It can be
used for some comparisons, but should not be the only method used to evaluate the Company or its performance. Further, the information in the following table may not represent realistic assessments of future cash flows, nor should the Standardized
Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows be viewed as representative of the current value of the Company.

The Company believes that the following factors should be taken into account when reviewing the following information:

•

Future costs and selling prices will probably differ from those required to be used in these calculations.

•

Due to future market conditions and governmental regulations, actual rates of production in future years may vary significantly from the rate of production assumed in the
calculations.

•

Selection of a 10% discount rate is arbitrary and may not be a reasonable measure of the relative risk that is part of realizing future net oil and gas revenues.

•

Future net revenues may be subject to different rates of income taxation.

Under the Standardized Measure, future cash inflows were estimated by applying year end oil and gas prices to the estimated future production of year end proved reserves.

The average prices related to proved reserves at December 31, 2004, 2003, and
2002 for natural gas ($ per Mcf) were $6.26, $5.96, and $4.41, respectively, and for oil ($ per Bbl) were $41.24, $30.94, and $30.39, respectively. Future cash inflows were reduced by estimated future development and production costs based on year
end costs to arrive at net cash flow before tax. Future income tax expense was computed by applying year end statutory tax rates to future pretax net cash flows, less the tax basis of the properties involved. SFAS 69 requires the use of a 10%
discount rate.

Management does not use only the following information when
making investment and operating decisions. These decisions are based on a number of factors, including estimates of probable as well as proved reserves, and varying price and cost assumptions considered more representative of a range of anticipated
economic conditions.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Conclusion
Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

As of the end of December 31, 2004, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including
the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (the “Exchange Act”). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective, in all material respects, with respect to
the recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms, of information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act.

There were no significant changes in the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially effect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The management of Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation’s management assessed the effectiveness
of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment we have concluded that, as of December 31, 2004, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation’s independent registered public accounting firm has
audited management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 as stated in their report which appears herein. This report appears on page 50.
