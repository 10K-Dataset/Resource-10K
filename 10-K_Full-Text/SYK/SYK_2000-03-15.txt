ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

GENERAL

Stryker Corporation and its subsidiaries (the "Company" or "Stryker") develop, manufacture and market specialty surgical and medical products, including orthopaedic implants, bone cement, trauma systems used in bone repair, powered surgical
instruments, endoscopic systems, craniomaxillofacial fixation devices, specialty surgical equipment used in neurosurgery and patient care and handling equipment for the global market and provide outpatient physical and occupational rehabilitation services
in the Unite

In November 1999, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of InfoMedix Communications Corporation (now known as Stryker Communications Corporation).  Stryker Communications Corporation develops, builds and sells video communications
hardware and software that enables telecommunication of surgical images for medical education.

On December 4, 1998, the Company acquired Howmedica, the orthopaedic division of Pfizer Inc.  Howmedica develops, manufactures and markets a wide range of specialty medical products utilized in the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders.  Howmedica's
products include hip and knee implants for primary and revision surgery, bone cement, trauma systems used in bone repair, craniomaxillofacial fixation devices and specialty surgical equipment used in neurosurgery.

In November 1998, the Company purchased the manufacturing rights and facilities for its OP-1 bone growth device from Creative BioMolecules, Inc.

In August 1993, the Company purchased 20% of the outstanding common stock of Matsumoto Medical Instruments, Inc. ("Matsumoto"), Osaka, Japan.  Matsumoto is one of the largest distributors of medical devices in Japan.  In August 1994, the Company
purchased an additional 31% of Matsumoto's outstanding common stock, thereby increasing its direct ownership in Matsumoto to 51%.  The results of operations for Matsumoto were consolidated with Stryker beginning in August 1994.  Subsequently, Stryker has
purchase

In September 1996, the Company purchased 100% of the outstanding common stock of Osteo Holding AG and subsidiaries ("Osteo"), Selzach, Switzerland.  Osteo designs and manufacturers trauma products and reconstructive orthopaedic devices.

The Company's subsidiary, Physiotherapy Associates, Inc., has also purchased a number of physical therapy clinic operations during each of the last five years.

PRODUCT SALES

The Company segregates its operations into two reportable segments: Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  The Orthopaedic Implants segment sells orthopaedic reconstructive products such as hip, knee, shoulder and spinal implants and
trauma-related products.  The MedSurg Equipment segment sells powered surgical instruments, endoscopic systems, medical video imaging equipment, patient care and handling systems and craniomaxillofacial fixation devices.  Other includes Physical Therapy
Services and co

The above sales amounts include sales of Howmedica beginning December 5, 1998.  Additional financial information regarding the Company's operating segments and geographic areas under the caption "Note 11 - Segment and Geographic Data" on
pages 58 through 60 of the 1999 Annual Report is incorporated herein by reference.

Approximately 80% of the Company's sales in 1999 and approximately two-thirds of the Company's sales in 1998 and 1997 consisted of products with short lives, such as implants (while implants have a long useful life to the patient, they have a one-time
use to the hospital), trauma-related products, disposables and expendable tools and parts, and service revenues, such as service and repair charges and physical therapy revenues.  The balance of sales in each of the years was of products that could be

The Company's backlog of firm orders is not considered material to an understanding of its business.

Orthopaedic Implants

Orthopaedic Implants are designed and manufactured by Howmedica Osteonics, Stryker Trauma and Stryker Spine and consist of such products as hip, knee, shoulder and spinal implants, associated implant instruments, trauma-related products and bone
cement.  Artificial joints are made of cobalt chrome, titanium alloys, ceramics or ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene and are implanted in patients whose natural joints have been damaged by arthritis, osteoporosis, other diseases or injury.

Hip Implants

The Company is now a global leader in sales of hip implants.  Under the Howmedica Osteonics brand name, the Company offers a variety of hip systems for the global reconstructive market.  The Partnership Hip System, Secur-Fit Hip System, Omnifit Hip
System and Restoration Hip System represent comprehensive systems of hip implants and associated instruments designed to provide physicians with reliable results and reduce operating time for primary and revision procedures.  The Exeter Total Hip System
is bas

In 1998, the Company released Crossfire, a highly cross-linked polyethylene designed to reduce wear.  In laboratory testing, this product has indicated a significant wear reduction over conventional polyethylene.  By the end of 1999, one quarter of the
Company's acetabular inserts were lined with Crossfire with an increased proportion expected in 2000 as Crossfire is applied to more hip systems.

In late 1990, Stryker became the first company to receive clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to commercially release for sale in the U.S. a hip implant with hydroxylapatite (HA) surface treatment.  HA is a naturally occurring
calcium phosphate material that demonstrates a high level of biocompatibility due to its resemblance to human bone.  The Company's clinical global experience with HA-coated hip stems now extends over thirteen years and their reported clinical performance

The Company continues to monitor the patients enrolled in its investigational study of contemporary ceramic-on-ceramic bearing surfaces.  Enrollment for this study was completed in 1998.  In international markets, the Company has released the Trident
Acetabular Shell.  This product allows the surgeon to insert either a ceramic insert or polyethylene insert into the same acetabular component.  Trident's two independent locking mechanisms provide maximum security for each bearing surface and increase
the s

In 1999, the Company launched the Restoration T-3 and Restoration PS Hip Systems, which provide surgeons hip stems to address the complicated situations encountered in hip revision procedures.  Also in 1999, the Company launched the EON hip system.
This brand is an evolution of the 20- year clinical history of the Omnifit cemented stem.  The EON Stem is designed with neck offset options and a reduced geometry providing the patient with increased range of motion and further reducing the chance of
post-op

The Company enters 2000 with 40 years of clinical history on Simplex P bone cement, 30 years of clinical history with the Exeter Hip System, 20 years of clinical history with the Omnifit cemented stem and 10 years of clinical history with the Omnifit
HA stem.  Long-term clinical results are an important factor in the Company's ability to market hip implants.

Knee Implants

Under the Howmedica Osteonics brand name the Company offers four major knee systems, the Duracon, Kinemax, Interax and Scorpio systems, as well as products that serve specific regional needs. Introduced in 1991 and utilized in over 360,000 procedures
world wide, the Duracon system combines high levels of joint conformity throughout the range of motion and consistent anatomic tracking.  The Duracon TS that was introduced in 1999 also offers a complete product line from the early intervention
unicondylar i

Other Reconstructive Products

The Company markets other reconstructive products, principally shoulder and elbow implants and related instruments.  The Osteonics Total Shoulder System was initially marketed in 1996.  The unique design of the humeral head allows the surgeon to
adjust tension of the supporting tissues while maximizing range of motion.  The shoulder instruments offer the surgeon increased visibility and accessibility into this tightly confined joint space.  In 1999, the Company released the Solar BiPolar
Shoulder.  T

Trauma

The Company markets its trauma implants under the Stryker Trauma brand name. Trauma products are used primarily in the fixation of fractures resulting from sudden injury. Trauma products consist of internal fixation devices marketed under such names as
Alta, Grosse & Kempf, Gamma, Omega and Asnis as well as external fixation devices marketed under such brands as Apex, Hoffmann and Monotube Triax.

The Company's internal fixation product portfolio includes a variety of systems incorporating screws, plates, intramedullary nails and trochanteric fixation devices. Stryker offers both a titanium system, the Alta for plating and nailing, as well as
stainless steel systems. The Alta system is mainly marketed in the United States and in Japan. The stainless steel systems include the ACP plates and the Maconor plating system primarily sold in France and a full range of intramedullary nails led by the
Gross

The Company's external fixation products include the Hoffmann II modular fixation system, the Monotube Triax monolateral system, the Monticelli-Spinelli circular fixator and a full range of Apex fixation pins. The Hoffmann II system for tibia or femur
fractures and the smaller Hoffmann II Compact for upper extremities include a spring-loaded snap-fit mechanism that allows the connection of rods or pins providing for easy assembly of each device, simple reduction procedures and stable fixation. Monotube

Spinal Implants

Spinal implants are systems comprised of plates, rods, and screws and are often used in conjunction with bone grafts to relieve back pain. Through Stryker Spine, the Company designs and manufactures spinal implant systems for use by physicians in the
treatment of degenerative spinal diseases and the stabilization of the spine in trauma cases.   In 1999, the Company launched the Xia Spinal System, which has become one of the fastest-growing rod and screw systems in the United States.  The Xia Spinal
Syste

Bone Cement

Simplex bone cement, a material used to secure cemented implants to bone, was first approved for domestic orthopaedic use in 1971 and is the most widely used bone cement in the world.  The Company manufactures several variations of Simplex Bone
Cement to meet specific patient needs.  Simplex P has the longest clinical history of any bone cement and over 250 clinical studies have been published.  Another formulation incorporating antibiotics, Simplex AKZ, is marketed outside the United States.

MedSurg Equipment

MedSurg Equipment products include powered surgical instruments, endoscopic systems, medical video imaging equipment, patient care and handling systems and craniomaxillofacial fixation devices.  These products are designed and manufactured by Stryker
Instruments, Stryker Endoscopy, Stryker Leibinger and Stryker Medical.

Stryker Instruments

Stryker Instruments products include a broad line of powered surgical instruments that are used by physicians for drilling, burring, rasping or cutting bone, wiring or pinning bone fractures and preparing hip or knee surfaces for the placement of
artificial hip or knee joints. Stryker Instruments also manufactures an array of different cutting accessories and other attachments for use by orthopaedic physicians. Stryker Instruments System 4 Heavy-Duty Battery-Powered Instruments provide an
ergonomic and v

Stryker Instruments also produces products that are utilized in conjunction with joint replacement surgery.  The Advanced Cement Mixing System, used to mix bone cement, greatly reduces the risk that air bubbles will weaken the long-term bond between
the implant and surrounding bone. SurgiLav Plus is a disposable, self-contained pulsed lavage system that is used by physicians to cleanse the surgical site during total joint arthroplasty. The CBC II System is a post-operative wound drainage and blood
reinfu

Stryker Endoscopy

Stryker Endoscopy products include medical video cameras, light sources, arthroscopes, laparoscopes, powered surgical instruments and disposable suction/irrigation devices. Stryker Endoscopy has established a position of technology leadership in
the production of video cameras for use in rigid endoscopic procedures.  In 1999, Stryker launched its sixth generation 3-chip video camera featuring a digital zoom that the surgeon can control from the camera head.  Also launched in 1999 was the SDC PRO
Digi

Stryker Endoscopy also manufactures a disposable suction irrigation device that allows the surgeon to irrigate tissue, remove fluid through a 5 millimeter or 10 millimeter portal and cauterize tissue. The product is self-contained, eliminating the need
for any additional equipment within the operating room. The Y-Tube provides a working channel for standard, 5 millimeter laparoscopic instruments while simultaneously allowing for suction and irrigation from the same port.

Stryker Leibinger

Stryker Leibinger manufactures plates, screws and instruments for craniomaxillofacial fixation. In January 2000, the Company launched the Delta System of screws and plates made of a resorbable polymer.  This innovative material dissolves after
providing strong fixation, eliminating the need for later explantation surgery.  Stryker Leibinger also develops and markets software and hardware for image-guided surgery.  The new Stryker Navigation System utilizes wireless technology to give surgeons a

Stryker Leibinger also markets BoneSource, a patented bone substitute material based on an exclusive license from the American Dental Association Health Foundation. BoneSource is self-setting, sculptable and effective in filling bone defects as a
result of its ability to form a paste in seconds and harden quickly. In 1996, BoneSource received FDA clearance for use in treating cranial defects, contiguous cuts and burr holes. In 1997, BoneSource also received FDA clearance for facial augmentation,
which ex

The Stryker Instruments, Stryker Endoscopy and Stryker Leibinger product portfolios all include micro-powered tools and instruments that are used in orthopaedics, craniomaxillofacial surgery, functional endoscopic sinus surgery, neurosurgery, spinal
surgery and plastic surgery. The Total Performance System (TPS), released in 1996, is a universal surgical system that can be utilized within several medical specialties. The TPS Universal Drill and TPS Burs are designed for use by spine surgeons and
neurosur

Stryker Medical

Stryker Medical is the market leader in specialty stretcher products, offering some 30 different types of stretchers customized to fit the needs of acute care and specialty surgical care facilities.  Stryker Medical produces beds which are also
designed to fit the unique needs of specialty departments within the acute care environment.  The Secure medical/surgical bed addresses the changing needs of an aging population.  The Secure bed is lower to the ground and has siderails for patient safety.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

Most of the Company's products and product improvements have been developed internally.  In addition, the Company maintains close working relationships with physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist in product research
and development.  New and improved products play a critical role in the Company's sales growth.  The Company continues to place emphasis on the development of proprietary products and product improvements to complement and expand its existing product
lines.

Total expenditures for product research, development and engineering were $105.2 million in 1999, $61.0 million in 1998 and $56.9 million in 1997.  The foregoing do not include expenditures related to the Howmedica business prior to December 5, 1998.
The Company's research, development and engineering expenses represent the continued development of the Company's OP-1 Bone Growth Device discussed below and the Company-wide focus on new product developments.  The Company also continues the development

In 1991, the Company received FDA approval to begin human clinical trials of its OP-1 Bone Growth Device ("OP-1 Implant"), which was developed in collaboration with Creative BioMolecules, Inc. ("Creative") as part of a long-term research
program funded by Stryker since 1985.  This device is composed of recombinant human osteogenic protein-1 (OP-1) and a bioresorbable collagen matrix.  OP-1 is naturally present in the human body and directs a cascade of cellular events that result in bone
gr

The Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application for the OP-1 Implant was filed and accepted by the FDA in June 1999.  The Company is presently preparing a response to a deficiency letter received from the FDA regarding the PMA that focuses on the
radiographic findings and certain other clinical data.  Upon receipt of the Company's response, the FDA staff must make a determination whether to submit the PMA application to a panel of industry and medical experts who would review it and make a
recommendation t

The surgical procedures for several pilot human clinical trials in Europe in cases involving trauma, spine, and oral/maxillofacial indications were completed in 1996 and a fresh fracture trial was initiated in Canada in 1997.  A pilot study of
periodontal defects was initiated in the United States in 1998.  In 1999, the Company began to enroll patients for the first United States investigational device exemption (IDE) study for OP-1 in a spine indication.

Stryker owns the patents on its osteogenic protein technology and has exclusive worldwide rights under those patents to develop, market and sell OP-1 for treatment, repair or replacement of bone and joint tissue.  Creative has an exclusive license to
the technology for use in other applications.  Stryker and Creative are obligated to pay royalties to the other on its sales of OP-l based products.  On February 14, 2000, Creative entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Ontogeny, Inc. and

The purchase of the manufacturing rights, facilities and process development effort for the Company's OP-1 bone growth device in November 1998 ended the research and development agreements Stryker had with Creative since 1985.

During 1998, the Company entered into an exclusive collaboration agreement with the Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation (MTF) to develop combination OP-1 and allograft products.  Combinations of OP-1 and allograft may have added clinical value in
indications such as spine fusions in the future.

MARKETING

Most of the Company's products are marketed in the United States directly to more than 5,000 hospitals, and to doctors and other health care facilities, by approximately 1,400 sales and marketing personnel.  Stryker maintains separate and dedicated
sales forces for each of its principal product lines to provide focus and a high level of expertise to each medical specialty served.

Approximately 69% of the Company's domestic revenues in 1999 were accounted for by sales to hospital cooperative buying groups and other large national accounts and 1% by sales to the Veterans Administration and other hospitals operated by the Federal
government.

International sales accounted for 42% of total revenues in 1999.  The Company's products are sold in over 100 foreign countries, through more than 710 local dealers, whose efforts are coordinated by approximately 1,380 sales and marketing personnel and
through direct sales efforts.  Stryker distributes its products through sales subsidiaries and branches with offices located in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Mexico, The Netherlands,

The Company's business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of orthopaedic implant surgeries is lower during the summer months.

COMPETITION

The Company is one of four leading competitors in the U.S. market for orthopaedic reconstructive products, the others being J&J DePuy Orthopedics (a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson), Zimmer, USA Inc. (a subsidiary of Bristol-Myers, Squibb,
Inc.) and Biomet, Inc. While competition abroad varies from area to area, the Company believes it is also a leading factor in the international markets, with these same companies being its principal competitors.

In the trauma market, Stryker is one of four market leaders with the principal competitors being Synthes-Stratec, Smith & Nephew Richards (a division of Smith & Nephew PLC) and Zimmer (a subusidiary of Bristol-Myers, Squibb, Inc.).

In the international market for spinal implants, the Company is one of the four market leaders with the principal competitors being Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Inc. (a subsidiary of Medtronic, Inc.), DePuy AcroMed (a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson)
and Synthes-Stratec.  The Company entered the U.S. market for spinal implants during 1995 and faces competition from these and other companies.

In the powered surgical instruments market, Stryker is one of the three market leaders, with the principal domestic competitors being Linvatec, Inc. (a subsidiary of Conmed Corporation) and Midas-Rex, Inc. (a subsidiary of Medtronic, Inc.).  These
companies are also competitors in the international markets, along with Aesculap-Werke AG, a large European manufacturer.

In the arthroscopy market, the Company considers itself to be one of the three market leaders, with the principal competitors being Smith & Nephew Endoscopy (a division of Smith & Nephew PLC) and Linvatec, Inc. (a subsidiary of Conmed
Corporation).  In the laparoscopic imaging products market, the Company considers itself to be one of the four market leaders, with the principal competitors being Karl Storz GmbH & Co. (a German company), Circon Corporation (a subsidiary of Maxxim
Medical Inc.)

The Company's primary competitor in the hospital bed market is Hill-Rom (a division of Hillenbrand Industries).  In the specialty stretcher market, the primary competitors are Hausted, Inc. (a subsidiary of Steris Corporation), Hill-Rom and Midmark
Corporation.  In the ambulance cot market, Ferno-Washington is the primary competitor.

In the outpatient physical and occupational rehabilitation market, the Company's primary competitors are physician-owned independent practices and hospital-based services, in addition to other national rehabilitation companies, including HealthSouth
Corporation and NovaCare Rehabilitation (a division of Select Medical Corporation).

The Company believes that several companies are engaged in the research and development of morphogenic proteins for the repair of hard and soft tissues that would compete with the Company's OP-1 Implant, including Genetics Institute, Inc. (a subsidiary
of American Home Products Corporation), which has begun human clinical trials of a recombinant bone morphogenetic protein for repair of orthopaedic and other skeletal defects.  A number of other companies currently provide various other therapies, includin

The principal factors that the Company believes differentiate its products in these highly competitive markets and enable it to compete effectively are innovative products, reliability, service and reputation.  The Company is not able to predict the
effect that continuing efforts to reduce health care expenses generally and hospital costs in particular will have on the future sales of its products or its competitive position.  (See "Regulation and Product Quality.")  The Company believes that its

MANUFACTURING AND SOURCES OF SUPPLY

The Company's manufacturing processes consist primarily of precision machining, metal fabrication and assembly operations and the forging and investment casting of cobalt chrome and finishing of cobalt chrome and titanium.  Approximately 9% of the
Company's cost of sales in 1999 (before additional nonrecurring cost of sales of $198.2 million for inventory sold in 1999 that was stepped-up to fair value in connection with the acquisition of Howmedica) represented finished products that were purchased

While the Company relies on single sources for certain purchased materials and services, it believes alternate sources are available if needed.  The Company has not experienced any significant difficulty in the past in obtaining the materials necessary
to meet its production schedules.

Products manufactured by the Company's Medical Division are generally assembled to order, while other products are stocked in inventory.

REGULATION AND PRODUCT QUALITY

The Medical Device Amendments of 1976 to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990, and regulations issued or proposed thereunder, provide for regulation by the FDA of the design and manufacture of medical devices,
including most of the Company's products.

The FDA's "Good Manufacturing Practices" and "Quality System" regulations set forth standards for the Company's product design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of the Company's
facilities by the FDA.  There are also certain requirements of state, local and foreign governments that must be complied with in the manufacturing and marketing of the Company's products.  The Company believes that the manufacturing and quality control
procedures

Most of the Company's new products fall into FDA classifications that require notification of and review by the FDA before marketing (submitted as a 510(k)). The Company's OP-1 Implant requires extensive clinical testing, consisting of safety and
efficacy studies, followed by a PMA application (see "Product Development").

Stryker also is subject to the laws that govern the manufacture and distribution of medical devices of each country in which the Company manufactures or sells products.  The member states of the European Union ("EU") have adopted the European
Medical Device Directives, which create a single set of medical device regulations for all EU member countries.  These regulations require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in EU member countries to obtain Community
European ("CE"

Government agencies and legislative bodies in the United States and other countries are considering various proposals designed to hold down increases in health care costs.  It is impossible to predict at this time the long-term impact of such cost
containment measures on the Company's future business.

EMPLOYEES

At December 31, 1999, the Company had 10,925 employees worldwide, including 4,297 involved in manufacturing, warehousing and distribution operations, 2,805 in marketing and sales, 491 in research, development and engineering, 949 providing physical,
occupational and speech therapy and the balance in general management and administration.  Approximately 1,300 employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.  Labor agreements covering approximately 620 domestic employees expire in August 2002
and
pproximately 680 international employees expire in September 2000 and December 2000.  The Company believes that its employee relations are satisfactory.

1999 COMPARED WITH 1998

Stryker Corporation's net sales increased 91% in 1999 to $2,103.7 million from $1,103.2 million in 1998.  Net sales increased $854.5 million, or 77%, as a result of the Howmedica acquisition.  Net sales also grew by 9% as a result of
increased unit volume; 3% related to higher selling prices from the conversion of distributors to direct sales; 2% as a result of other acquired businesses; and 1% due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These increases were partially offset by
a 1%

Net sales on a pro forma basis increased 10% in 1999 compared with 1998.  Increased unit volume generated a 7% sales increase.  Net sales also increased 2% related to the conversion of certain portions of the Company's distribution networks to
direct sales, and 1% from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

The Company's domestic sales increased 69% (12% on a pro forma basis) in 1999 compared with 1998.  The domestic sales gain is a result of the Howmedica acquisition and higher shipments of orthopaedic implants, powered surgical instruments,
endoscopic equipment and increased revenue from physical therapy services.  U.S. sales of Howmedica products in 1999 were $413.9 million, representing an increase of 6% over sales for the prior year.  Excluding a $17.1 million sales credit in the prior

Cost of sales represented 47.0% of sales compared with 42.8% in 1998.  The higher cost of sales percentage in 1999 resulted from $198.2 million of additional nonrecurring cost of sales for inventory sold in 1999 that was stepped-up to fair value in
connection with the acquisition of Howmedica, compared with $7.8 million of inventory step-up included in 1998 cost of sales.  Excluding the nonrecurring cost of sales charges for inventory step-up, cost of sales would have declined to 37.6% in 1999 compar

Research, development and engineering expenses increased 72% in 1999 and represented 5.0% of sales in 1999 compared with 5.5% in 1998.  The increase in research, development and engineering spending in 1999 results from the acquisition of Howmedica
and from the 1998 purchase of the manufacturing rights and facilities for OP-1.  New product introductions in 1999 included Crossfire Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene for hip implants, the SecureFit Plus Hip Restoration System, the Duracon Total Stabilizer

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 116% in 1999 and represented 38.4% of sales in 1999 compared with 33.9% in 1998.  The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses is the result of the acquisition of Howmedica, and
the increase as a percent of sales reflects the higher mix of Orthopaedic Implant sales, which cost more to sell than the Company's other products.

The Company recognized nonrecurring acquisition-related charges in continuing operations of $18.9 million in 1999 and $116.3 million in 1998. The 1999 charged included $14.2 million to reorganize Stryker's Japanese distribution operation in order
to accommodate the integration with Howmedica and to discontinue the distribution of ophthalmology products in Japan. The $14.2 million charge included $11.6 million of severance-related costs and $2.6 million to cover costs associated with the
discontinuanc

The completion dates of the two significant acquired in-process research projects, which were in development by Howmedica at the time of the acquisition, are progressing according to plan.  These projects relate to the development of a new spinal
technology to be used in the treatment of spinal disorders and the development of an improved polyethylene to be used in hip and knee implants.   The estimated future revenues associated with the spinal project have not changed.  The timing of estimated
futu

Interest expense increased to $122.6 million in 1999 from $12.2 million in 1998 due to the borrowing of approximately $1,500.0 million to fund the Howmedica acquisition.  The increase in intangibles amortization to $33.9 million in 1999 from $7.6
million in 1998 relates primarily to the Howmedica acquisition.  Other income declined to $4.8 million in 1999 from $16.5 million in the prior year due to lower interest income.

The effective tax rate for 1999 was 34.9% compared with a 34% effective tax rate in 1998.  The increase in the rate from 1998 to 1999 is attributable to the mix of operating results among the tax jurisdictions.  Net earnings were $19.4 million
(basic and diluted net earnings per share of $.20) compared with $60.0 million (basic net earnings per share of $.62 and diluted net earnings per share of $.61) in 1998, a decrease of 68%.  Excluding nonrecurring charges in both years, net earnings in
1999 incr

1998 COMPARED WITH 1997

Stryker Corporation's net sales increased 13% in 1998, to $1,103.2 million, from $980.1 million in 1997.  Increased unit volume generated a 10% sales increase.  Net sales also increased $42.8 million, or 4%, as a result of the
acquisition of Howmedica, which was acquired on December 4, 1998; 3% as a result of other acquired businesses; and 1% related to higher selling prices from the conversion of Osteonics' domestic distributors to direct sales.  These increases were partially
offset b

The Company's domestic sales increased 15% in 1998 compared with 1997.  The leading domestic sales gains came from strong shipments of endoscopic equipment, powered surgical instruments, orthopaedic implants, hospital beds and stretchers and
increased revenue from physical therapy services.  Increased domestic sales from the acquisition of Howmedica were largely offset by fourth quarter sales credits for inventory returns relating to the conversion of the remaining Osteonics independent
distributors

Sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 9% for the year.  The sales gains for the year resulted from incremental sales from the acquisition of Howmedica and higher shipments of hips in the United States and spinal, trauma and knee products
worldwide.  These Orthopaedic Implants sales increases were partially offset by sales credits of $17.1 million for inventory returns in connection with the conversion of the Osteonics domestic distributors, the unfavorable impact of foreign currency
translation and

Cost of sales represented 42.8% of sales compared with 40.6% in 1997.  The higher cost of sales percentage in 1998 resulted from changes in sales mix and the general weakness in foreign currencies, which increased the cost of U.S.-dollar-based
inventory purchases for the Company's international operations.  The cost of sales percentage also increased due to the inventory returns associated with the sales credits related to the Osteonics distributor conversions and as a result of $7.8 million in
addit

Research, development and engineering expenses increased 7% as the Company spent $61.0 million on product development in 1998 compared with $56.9 million in 1997.  Research, development and engineering expenses declined as a percentage of sales,
partially as a result of the acquisition of Howmedica.  In addition, the Company spent less on its continuing development of the OP-1 bone growth device at Stryker Biotech.  This decrease was offset by greater spending on new product development in the
remain
ducts in 1998 included the Secur-Fit Plus hip stem, Scorpio

CR Knee Implant, the InterPulse System, System 4 (the next generation battery powered instrument system), the Quantum 5000 lightsource, the Hermes video control system and the EZ-Pro ambulance cot.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 12% in 1998 as a result of incremental expenses associated with the acquisition of Howmedica and an increase in selling expenses, although such expenses grew at a slower rate than the increase
in sales.  Selling, general and administrative expenses declined to 33.9% of sales in 1998 from 34.1% in 1997.

There were several significant nonrecurring, acquisition-related items included in continuing operations in 1998.  The Company charged $83.3 million to operations in the fourth quarter for purchased research and development, $78.4 million related
to the valuation of in-process research and development projects acquired in the Howmedica purchase and $4.9 million related to the purchase of tangible research and development assets having no alternative future use in connection with the acquisition of
th

The purchased research and development of $78.4 million for the Howmedica acquisition was determined based on an independent valuation of Howmedica's research and development projects using information and assumptions provided by management.  Among the
in-process projects included in the valuation, two are considered significant.  These projects relate to the development of a new spinal technology to be used in the treatment of spinal disorders and the development of an improved polyethylene to be used i

During the fourth quarter of 1998, the Company reduced the effective tax rate for the year to 34% from 35%, thereby reducing income tax expense by $0.6 million.  The reduction in the effective tax rate for the year from the 35.8% rate used in 1997
was the result of increased participation in a U.S. employment-related tax incentive program, a reduction in tax assessed on funds repatriated from Puerto Rico and a more favorable mix of operating results among tax jurisdictions, which were offset in
part

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The Company's working capital at December 31, 1999 decreased $225.4 million to $440.8 million from $666.2 million at December 31, 1998.  The working capital decrease is primarily due to the charge-off of $198.2 million in inventory step-up
associated with the Howmedica acquisition to cost of sales during 1999.  The working capital decrease also results from the use of cash and the sale of $97.0 million of certain domestic accounts receivable under a one-year securitization facility
established in Nov

The Company generated cash of $284.0 million from operations in 1999 compared with $154.5 million in 1998.  The generation of cash in 1999 is the result of strong cash earnings (net earnings plus noncash adjustments) plus $112.7 million in proceeds
from the accounts receivable securitization program.  These increases were partially offset by the increase in accounts receivable and deferred charges, the payments of $102.5 million attributable to acquisition-related and restructuring charges and acquis

In November 1999 the Company established a one-year securitization facility under which certain domestic accounts receivables are sold on an ongoing basis to a special-purpose subsidiary which in turn may sell up to $130.0 million interest in such
receivables to a third party.  The accounts receivable securitization facility was established to reduce the Company's overall cost of borrowing.  The Company initially received $112.7 million of proceeds under the securitization program and used the

On June 4, 1999, the Company's $1,650.0 million credit facility was amended to lower the net borrowing cost by an average of 50 basis points, or approximately $7.0 million per year, on current borrowings.

The Company had $83.5 million in cash and marketable debt securities at December 31, 1999.  The Company also had outstanding borrowings totaling $1,287.4 million at that date.  Current maturities of long-term debt at December 31, 1999 are $106.3
million and will increase to $122.2 million in 2001 and $158.7 million in 2002.  The Company believes its cash on hand as well as anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund future operating and capital requirements, payment of a

OTHER MATTERS

The Company finalized its plan to integrate Howmedica and Stryker in 1999.  As the integration plan evolved and was implemented during 1999, the Company made certain adjustments to the purchase liabilities recorded in the preliminary purchase price
allocation.  These adjustments resulted in net increases of $13.1 million to goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition.  The additional purchase liabilities recorded in connection with the acquisition of Howmedica totaled $126.5 million.  At Dec

YEAR 2000

The information provided below constitutes a "Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure" for purposes of the Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act.

The Company completed its Year 2000 (Y2K) project in the fourth quarter of 1999.  The Company experienced no significant Y2K problems with its information technology systems, noninformation technology systems, key third parties or its products.  The
total incremental cost for the Y2K project was approximately $8.8 million, of which $6.7 million was incurred in 1999.  All costs were expensed as incurred and were funded through operating cash flows.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company manufactures its products in the United States, France, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, Canada and Puerto Rico and distributes its products throughout the world.  As a result, the Company's financial results could be significantly
affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets.  The Company's operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen and European
currencies,

The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies, thereby limiting risk to the Company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange
rates. The principal transactions hedged were intercompany purchases of manufactured products and intercompany payables.  The periods of the forward foreign exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the hedged transactions with realized gains and
losse

At December 31, 1999, the Company had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts to purchase $31.1 million and sell $47.3 million of various currencies (principally U.S. dollars) with maturities principally ranging from 30 to 180 days.  At
December 31, 1998, the Company also had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts to purchase $79.7 million and sell $92.3 million of various currencies (principally U.S. dollars) with maturities ranging from 30 to 180 days.

The estimated fair value of foreign currency contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end spot rates.  At December 31, 1999 and 1998, the difference between fair values and contract amounts was not material.  A hypothetical
10% change in exchange rates for these currencies would change the 1999 fair value by approximately $7.0 million and the 1998 fair value by $19.0 million.

The Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its borrowings.  The Company manages its interest rate risk on its borrowings through interest rate swap agreements, which have fixed the base rate on $800.0 million of
the $1,260.8 million of variable borrowings outstanding at December 31, 1999.  If market interest rates for similar borrowings average 1% more in 2000 than they did in 1999, the Company's interest expense, after considering the effects of its interest

(in millions, except per share amounts)

1.  	SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BUSINESS: Stryker Corporation develops, manufactures and markets specialty surgical and medical products that are sold primarily to hospitals throughout the world and provides outpatient physical therapy services in the United States.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries after elimination of all significant intercompany accounts and transactions.

REVENUE RECOGNITION: Revenue is recognized on the sale of products and services when the related goods have been shipped or services have been rendered.

USE OF ESTIMATES: The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires Company management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION: The financial statements of the Company's international affiliates are translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates for balance sheets and average exchange rates for statements of earnings and cash flows.
Unrealized translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) in stockholders' equity.  Transaction gains and losses, such as those resulting from the settlement of foreign currency receivables or payables, are included in
net earnings.

CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS: Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased.  Investments include marketable debt securities classified as current assets and marketable equity securities and
other investments classified in other assets.  Other investments consist of mutual funds that are acquired to offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements.

The Company's investments are stated at fair value based on quoted market prices. Adjustments to fair value of the equity and debt securities, which are classified as available-for-sale, are recorded as increases or decreases, net of income taxes
within accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) in stockholders' equity.  Adjustments to other investments, which are classified as trading, are recorded in operating expenses. Interest, dividends and realized gains and losses on the sale of such
securities are included in other expense (income).

INVENTORIES: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.  Cost for approximately 90% (94% in 1998) of inventories is determined using the lower of first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost or market.  Cost for certain domestic inventories is
determined using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) cost method.  The FIFO cost for all inventories approximates replacement cost.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT: Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by the straight-line or declining-balance methods over the estimated useful lives of 3 to 30 years for buildings and improvements and 3 to 10 years
for machinery and equipment.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS: Goodwill and other intangible assets represent the excess of purchase price over fair value of tangible net assets of acquired businesses.  Goodwill is amortized on a straight-line basis over 10 to 40 years
(weighted average life of 29 years).  Developed technology is amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years.  Other intangible assets, consisting primarily of customer base (which reflects expected continued customer patronage), trademarks, trade names
and assembled work force, are amortized on a straight-line basis over 5 to 35 years (weighted average life of 23 years).

The carrying amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets are reviewed if facts and circumstances suggest they may be impaired.  If the review indicates that the carrying amount of any intangible asset will not be recoverable, as determined using an
undiscounted cash flow analysis, the carrying amount of the goodwill or other intangible asset is reduced by the estimated shortfall of cash flows to fair value.

DEFERRED CHARGES: Deferred charges represent the net book value of loaner instruments for surgical implants provided to customers by the Company.  These instruments are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from one to three years.
Amortization expense of instruments is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

DEFERRED LOAN COSTS: Deferred loan costs of $29.1 associated with the Company's Senior Secured Credit Facilities are being amortized over the terms of the related debt using the effective-interest method and are classified in other assets.
Amortization expenses for these deferred loans costs are included in interest expense and were $7.4 for 1999 and $0.4 for 1998.

INCOME TAXES: The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method.  Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are
measured using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.  Deferred tax expense represents the change in net deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage the economic impact of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.  The Company enters into interest rate swaps and foreign currency
forward contracts to manage these economic risks.

Interest rate differentials to be paid or received as a result of interest rate swaps are accrued and recognized as an adjustment of interest expense related to the designated debt.  Foreign currency forward contracts used to hedge intercompany
financial activity are carried off balance sheet with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of the hedged transactions.

STOCK OPTIONS: The Company follows Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" in accounting for its employee stock options.  Under APB 25, no compensation expense is recognized because
the exercise price of the Company's employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant.

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME: The components of accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) are as follows:

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT YET ADOPTED: In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities."  Statement No. 133 requires the Company to
record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.  Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not meet the criteria to be treated as a hedge under Statement No. 133 are to be included in earnings.   For derivatives that do meet the hedge
criteria,

RESTATEMENT OF 1998 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: On January 27, 2000, the Company announced a restatement of its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 1998 to reduce acquisition-related charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 1998.  The 1998
acquisition-related charges had previously included $31.0 in reserves for the conversion of certain foreign distributors to direct sales where contractual terms had not been reached as of December 31, 1998.  The Company has reversed this reserve as of
Decem

The Company had initially anticipated converting one of the foreign distributors to direct sales at a potential cost of $30.0.  However, as of January 27, 2000 (the date the 1998 financial statement restatement was announced), the Company no longer
expects to negotiate termination of that distributor agreement.  This decision was made as a result of changes in the Company's management in late 1999 and consequent changes in the integration plan with respect to that distributor.

RECLASSIFICATIONS: Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the presentation used in 1999.

2.  	FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following is a summary of the Company's investments:

Gross realized gains on sales of the Company's investments totaled $2.5, $2.6 and $0.1 in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively, and gross realized losses total $0.1, $1.1 and $0.8 in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. At December 31, 1999, 100% of the
Company's investments in debt securities mature within one year.

Interest income, which is included in other income, totaled $4.2 in 1999, $16.5 in 1998 and $15.0 in 1997.

The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies, thereby limiting risk to the Company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange
rates.  The principal transactions hedged by the Company are the intercompany purchases of manufactured products and intercompany payables.  The periods of the forward foreign exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the hedge transactions, with
realized

At December 31, 1999, the Company had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts to purchase $31.1 and sell $47.3 of various currencies (principally U.S. dollars) with maturities principally ranging from 30 to 180 days.  At December 31, 1998, the
Company also had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts to purchase $79.7 and sell $92.3 of various currencies (principally U.S. dollars) with maturities ranging from 30 to 180 days.  The estimated fair value of foreign currency contracts
represents

The Company manages its interest rate risk on its borrowings through the purchase of interest rate swap agreements, which have fixed the base rate on $800.0 of the $1,260.8 of variable borrowings outstanding at December 31, 1999.  Under the agreements,
the Company has fixed the base rate on an $800.0 notional amount of the U.S.
- -dollar-denominated borrowings at an average rate of 5.7%.  The interest rate swaps mature over various terms ranging from September 2000 through December 2004.  The fair value of

3.  	INVENTORIES

Inventories are summarized as follows

:

Inventories at December 31, 1998 reflect a step-up of $213.2 to fair value in connection with the acquisition of Howmedica (see Note 4).

4.  	BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS

In November 1999, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of InfoMedix Communications Corporation (now known as Stryker Communications Corporation, which develops, builds and sells video communications hardware and software that
enables telecommunication of surgical images for medical education) for cash of $1.2 and 0.2 shares of Stryker common stock ($9.4 value).  The use of Stryker common stock represents a noncash investing activity that  is not reflected in the Consolidated
Statement

In April 1999, the Company acquired the portion of the Japanese distributor of Leibinger products associated with the distribution of such products for cash of approximately $2.7.  The entire purchase price was allocated to tangible assets acquired.

On December 4, 1998, the Company acquired Howmedica, the orthopaedic division of Pfizer Inc., for $1,650.0 in cash.  Howmedica develops, manufactures and markets a wide range of specialty medical products utilized in the treatment of musculoskeletal
disorders.  Howmedica products include hip and knee implants for primary and revision surgery, bone cement, trauma systems used in bone repair, craniomaxillofacial fixation devices and specialty surgical equipment used in neurosurgery. The acquisition was
fun

The acquisition of Howmedica was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.  The results of operations for Howmedica are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements beginning December 5, 1998. The purchase price of $1,650.0
in cash plus an estimate for a contractually required adjustment, based on the increase in Howmedica's working capital since December 31, 1997, and liabilities assumed, was preliminarily allocated in December 1998 to the assets acquired, based on their
esti

Based on the final purchase price allocation, goodwill of $488.7 was recorded by the Company in connection with the acquisition.  Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price and purchase liabilities over the fair value of net identifiable
tangible and intangible assets acquired.  Approximately $488.3 of the purchase price was allocated to identifiable intangible assets, including purchased research and development of $78.4, developed technology of $227.0, customer base of $141.8 and
trademarks a

The purchased research and development of $78.4 for the Howmedica acquisition was determined based on an independent valuation of Howmedica's research and development projects using information and assumptions provided by management.  Among the
in-process projects included in the valuation, two are considered significant.  These projects relate to the development of a new spinal technology to be used in the treatment of spinal disorders and the development of an improved polyethylene to be used
in hip an

In connection with the final purchase price allocation, Howmedica inventories were stepped-up $207.5 to fair value.  This step-up has been charged off as additional nonrecurring cost of sales as the acquired inventory was sold.  Cost of sales for 1999
and for the fourth quarter of 1998 were increased as a result of the step-up.  These increases in cost of sales reduced pretax earnings for 1999 by $198.2 ($128.8 net of tax) and 1998 fourth quarter pretax earnings by $7.8 ($5.2 net of tax).  At December

Immediately after the acquisition was consummated, management of the Company began to implement an integration plan to combine Stryker and Howmedica.  In conjunction with the integration plan, the Company has recorded additional purchase liabilities of
$126.5 ($80.5 net of related tax benefits), which were included in the final acquisition cost allocation.  The Company also incurred $37.7 in costs and charges related to the acquisition that were charged to operations during 1999 and 1998 (see Note 5).

During 1999, the Company finalized its purchase price allocation to reflect additional purchase liabilities relating to the Company's integration activities as the restructuring was implemented, as shown in the table below.  The related increases and
decreases in these additional purchase liabilities resulted in corresponding changes to goodwill associated with the acquisition of Howmedica.

The additional purchase liabilities include $84.2 for severance and related costs for Howmedica employees, $26.3 for the cost to convert Howmedica's distribution network to direct sales and $16.0 for the cost associated with Howmedica facility closures
and contractual obligations.  The severance and related costs are provided for workforce reductions covering approximately 1,250 Howmedica employees in the areas of general management, marketing, research and development, general administration and product

Many of the activities for which additional purchase liabilities are recorded were completed during 1999.  These activities include the conversion of Howmedica's distribution network to direct sales  and planned workforce reductions covering
approximately 980 Howmedica employees.   The remaining workforce reductions are expected to be completed by the third quarter of 2000.  Payments of distributor conversion obligations and severance and related costs are expected to be completed in the
first half of 20

The following table provides a rollforward from December 4, 1998 (the date of acquisition) to December 31, 1999 of the additional purchase liabilities recorded in connection with the acquisition of Howmedica:

The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents the combined results of operations of Stryker and Howmedica as if the acquisition had occurred as of January 1, 1997, after giving effect to certain adjustments, including amortization of
goodwill and intangible assets, increased interest expense on debt related to the acquisition, reduced interest income from cash utilized to complete the acquisition and the related tax effects.  The pro forma financial information does not necessarily ref

The pro forma financial information presented above does not include nonrecurring charges for purchased research and development, the sale of inventory stepped-up to fair value at the date of acquisition and integration activities.  These items are
included in the actual results of operations for 1998.  The pro forma financial information includes pretax costs of approximately $31.7 for 1998 and $27.0 for 1997, representing an allocation of certain Pfizer corporate and division overhead costs to
Howmedic

In November 1998, the Company purchased the manufacturing rights, facilities and product on-hand for its OP-1 bone growth device from Creative BioMolecules, Inc., for approximately $19.3 in cash.  In addition, the purchase agreement provided for
increases in royalty payments associated with potential future OP-1 sales.  The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method.  In connection with the acquisition, $4.9 of the purchase price paid for tangible research and development assets that
have no

During 1998, the Company's Osteonics Corp. subsidiary purchased four of its independent distributors at a cost of approximately $19.7.  The entire purchase price was allocated to tangible assets acquired.

During 1998 and 1997, the Company acquired additional shares of outstanding common stock of Matsumoto Medical Instruments, Inc., its Japanese distributor, thereby increasing its direct ownership to 83% at December 31, 1998 (75% at December 31, 1997).
During 1998, additional shares were acquired for cash of $3.3 and 0.1 shares of Stryker common stock ($3.8 value).  During 1997, additional shares of Matsumoto were purchased for cash of $28.6.  Each acquisition of additional shares was accounted for
using

The Company's Physiotherapy Associates, Inc. subsidiary has purchased a number of physical therapy clinic operations.  The aggregate purchase price of these clinics in 1999, 1998 and 1997 was approximately $2.2, $2.6 and $5.6, respectively.  Intangible
assets acquired, principally employment contracts and goodwill, are being amortized over periods ranging from 1 to 15 years.

For all of the above acquisitions other than that of Howmedica, pro forma consolidated results would not differ significantly from reported results.

5. 	ACQUISITION-RELATED AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

In 1999 and 1998, the Company recorded acquisition-related and restructuring pretax charges consisting of the following items:

The acquisition-related charges include $26.5 ($4.7 in 1999 and $21.8 in 1998) for the reorganization of Stryker's distribution channels to accommodate the integration of the Howmedica sales force.  The reorganization of Stryker's distribution channels
encompasses the conversion of all remaining Osteonics distributors in the United States and certain distributors in Europe and the Pacific to direct sales in the form of branches or agents.  These conversions provide the Company greater control over its di
conversions is based on contractual terms.

The $21.8 acquisition-related charge in 1998 included $14.0 related to the buyback of inventory from U.S. distributors being converted to direct sales.  The inventory was repurchased at its original selling price of $17.1 and was returned to inventory
at its manufactured cost of $3.1, resulting in the reversal of gross profit on the original sale totaling $14.0.  The 1998 expensed transaction costs represent costs associated with the acquisitions of Howmedica and of the manufacturing rights, facilities
a

The 1999 restructuring charges of $14.2 relate to the reorganization of Stryker's Japanese distribution operation to accommodate the integration with Howmedica and to discontinue the distribution of ophthalmology products in Japan.  The charge
includes $11.6 to cover severance-related costs for approximately 110 employees and $2.6 for costs associated with the discontinuance of the ophthalmology product line.  Planned workforce reductions covering approximately 80 employees have been completed.
 The

The Company has not utilized $2.7 of reserves related to distributor reorganizations that were charged to operations in 1996.  The delay in the use of these reserves occurred because the distributor is located in a country where Howmedica has a direct
sales operation.  The Company has not yet been able to complete the purchase of the Howmedica assets in this country because of the lengthy regulatory approval process there.  Regulatory approval is anticipated in late 2000, and the Company anticipates

The following table provides a rollforward of remaining liabilities associated with acquisition-related, restructuring and special pretax charges recorded by the Company in 1999,1998 and 1996:

6.  	BORROWINGS AND OTHER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS

Long-term debt is as follows:

In December 1998, the Company entered into $1,650.0 of Senior Secured Credit Facilities in conjunction with the acquisition of Howmedica (see Note 4).  The facilities provide for $1,150.0 in term loans, a six-year $250.0 U.S. revolving credit facility
and a six-year $250.0 reducing multicurrency facility.

The term loans consist of three tranches.  Tranche A provides for a six-year $575.0 term loan, Tranche B for  a seven-year $290.0 term loan and Tranche C for an eight-year $285.0 term loan.  The term loans bear interest at a base rate, as defined, plus
an applicable margin ranging from 1.25% to 3.00%, depending on the leverage ratio of the Company.  The six-year $250.0 U.S. revolving credit facility bears interest at a base rate, as defined, plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.25% to 2.25%, dependin

The Company has fixed the base rate on an $800.0 notional amount of the U.S.-dollar-denominated borrowings at an average rate of 5.7% using interest rate swaps (see Note 2).

Borrowings under the credit facilities are guaranteed by certain of the Company's subsidiaries and are fully secured by a substantial portion of the assets of the Company and such subsidiaries.  The credit agreement requires the Company to comply with
certain financial and other covenants and places certain limitations on the amount of increases in dividend payments.

In November 1999, the Company established a one-year accounts receivables securitization facility pursuant to which certain subsidiaries of the Company sell on an ongoing basis all of their domestic receivables to Stryker Funding Corporation, a wholly
owned special-purpose subsidiary of the Company, which in turn may sell up to an aggregate of $130.0 undivided percentage ownership interests in such receivables to a multiseller commercial paper conduit administered by a bank.  Creditors of Stryker
Funding

In December 1999, a $112.7 undivided ownership interest in accounts receivables was sold by Stryker Funding Corporation.  The proceeds were paid by Stryker Funding Corporation to the originating subsidiaries as part of the purchase price for the
receivables purchased from them and were ultimately used by the Company to reduce long-term debt.  The sale by Stryker Funding Corporation is reflected in the balance sheet as a reduction of accounts receivable.  The amount of the undivided interest in
receivable

In December 1999, the Company entered into a financing arrangement which provides for the sale of future foreign currency revenues.  As of December 31, 1999, the Company had committed to borrowings during 2000 in the cumulative principal amount of
approximately $31.0.  No borrowings were outstanding under this arrangement at December 31,1999.

Maturities of debt for the four years succeeding 2000 are: 2001 - $122.2; 2002 - $158.7; 2003 - $197.2; and 2004 - $232.9.

The carrying amounts of the Company's long-term debt approximate their fair values, based on the Company's current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing agreements' quoted rates.

Interest paid on debt was $126.1 in 1999, $12.2 in 1998 and $4.1 in 1997 and approximates interest expense.

7.  	CAPITAL STOCK

The Company has key employee and director stock option plans under which options are granted at a price not less than fair market value at the date of grant.  The options are granted for periods of up to 10 years and become exercisable in varying
installments.  A summary of stock option activity follows:

Shares reserved for future grants were 7.8 and 9.2 at December 31, 1999, and 1998, respectively.

Exercise prices for options outstanding as of December 31, 1999, ranged from $7.32 to $48.56.  A summary of shares exercisable follows:

The Company follows APB Opinion No. 25 in accounting for its stock option plans.  Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for options issued under Company stock option plans.  Had compensation
cost for the Company's stock-based compensation plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under those plans consistent with the method of FASB Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," the
Compan

The weighted average per share fair value of options granted during 1999, 1998 and 1997, estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, was $23.35, $15.74 and $11.49, respectively.  The fair value of options granted is
estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions:

The Company has 0.5 authorized shares of $1 par value preferred stock, none of which are outstanding.

8.  	EARNINGS PER SHARE

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net earnings per share:

9.  	RETIREMENT PLANS

Certain of the Company's subsidiaries have defined benefit plans covering some or all of their employees.  A summary of the information related to all of the Company's defined benefit plans is as follows:

At December 31, 1999, defined benefit plans with plan assets in excess of benefit obligations had plan assets totaling $56.5 and benefit obligations totaling $48.6, and defined benefit plans with benefit obligations in excess of plan assets had plan
assets totaling $4.4 and benefit obligations totaling $19.0.

Retirement plan expense under the Company's profit sharing and defined contribution retirement plans totaled $28.9 in 1999, $14.3 in 1998 and $11.2 in 1997.  A portion of the Company's retirement plan expenses was funded with Stryker common stock
totaling $2.0 in 1999, $1.7 in 1998 and $1.5 in 1997.  The use of Stryker common stock represents a non-cash investing activity that is not reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

10.  	INCOME TAXES

Earnings before income taxes consist of the following:

The components of the provision for income taxes follow:

A reconciliation of the U.S. statutory income tax rate to the Company's effective tax rate follows:

The large percentage fluctuations shown in the 1999 reconciliation are caused by the low base of pretax earnings used in the computation.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.  The tax effect of significant temporary
differences, which comprise the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities, is as follows:

Net operating loss carryforwards totaling approximately $83.8 at December 31, 1999 are available to reduce future taxable earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries.  A significant portion of these carryforwards may be carried forward indefinitely.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows

:

No provision has been made for U.S. federal and state income taxes or foreign taxes that may result from future remittances of the undistributed earnings ($222.5 at December 31, 1999) of foreign subsidiaries because it is expected that such earnings
will be reinvested overseas indefinitely.  Determination of the amount of any unrecognized deferred income tax liability on these unremitted earnings is not practicable.

Total income taxes paid were $69.4 in 1999, $56.2 in 1998 and $87.5 in 1997.

11. 	SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

The Company segregates its operations into two reportable business segments: Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The Orthopaedic Implants segment sells orthopaedic reconstructive products such as hip, knee, shoulder and spinal implants and
trauma-related products. The MedSurg Equipment segment sells powered surgical instruments, endoscopic systems, medical video imaging equipment and patient care and handling systems.  Other includes Physical Therapy Services and corporate administration,
interes

The Company's reportable segments are business units that offer different products and services and are managed separately because each business requires different manufacturing, technology and marketing strategies.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. The Company evaluates performance based on net earnings of each segment. Identifiable assets are those assets used exclusively in
the operations of each business segment or that are allocated when used jointly. Corporate assets are principally cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and property, plant and equipment.

Sales and other financial information by business segment follows:

The Company's area of operations outside of the United States, Japan and Europe principally includes the Pacific, Canada, Latin America and the Middle East.  Geographic information follows:

Gains (losses) on foreign currency transactions, which are included in other expense (income), totaled $1.0, ($2.1) and $0.3 in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

12.  	LEASES

The Company leases various manufacturing and office facilities and equipment under operating leases.  Future minimum lease commitments under these leases are as follows

:

Rent expense totaled $42.3 in 1999, $32.7 in 1998 and $26.3 in 1997.

In December 1999 the Company entered into a five-year lease for a new office, manufacturing and distribution facility to be built in the United States.  The estimated $70.0 cost of the facility will be funded by the lessor.  Payments under the lease,
which will commence in 2002, will be based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.25% to 2.25% applied to the estimated cost of the facility.  The Company has an option to renew the lease for an additional five-year period subject to certain
condi
e lease term the Company does not purchase the property, the Company guarantees a residual value to the lessor of up to the lessor's net investment in the property.

13.  	CONTINGENCIES

The Company is involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the normal course of business.  The Company does not anticipate material losses as a result of these actions beyond amounts already provided in the accompanying financial statements.
