BUSINESS.

GENERAL

Stryker
Corporation (the Company or Stryker) is one of the world's leading medical
technology companies with the most broadly based range of products in
orthopaedics and a significant presence in other medical specialties.  Stryker
works with respected medical professionals to help people lead more active and
more satisfying lives.  The Company's products include implants used in joint
replacement, trauma, craniomaxillofacial and spinal surgeries; biologics;
surgical, neurologic, ear, nose & throat and interventional pain equipment;
endoscopic, surgical navigation, communications and digital imaging systems; as
well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment.  Stryker was
incorporated in Michigan in 1946 as the successor company to a business founded
in 1941 by Dr. Homer H. Stryker, a leading orthopaedic surgeon and the inventor
of several orthopaedic products.

Stryker's
filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including its annual
report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form
8-K, are accessible free of charge at www.stryker.com within the
"Investor - SEC Filings & Ownership Reports" link.

In 2007 the Company completed the sale of its outpatient physical
therapy business, Physiotherapy Associates, for $150 million in cash less
certain indebtedness.  Physiotherapy Associates' operating results are reported
as discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.

PRODUCT SALES

The
Company segregates its operations into two reportable business segments:
Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  The Orthopaedic Implants segment
sells orthopaedic reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma,
craniomaxillofacial and spinal implant systems; bone cement; and the bone
growth factor

OP-1.  The MedSurg Equipment segment sells surgical equipment; surgical
navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as
well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment.  The following

areas can be found under the captions "Results of Operations" on
pages 30 through 37 and "Note 13 - Segment and Geographic Data" on
pages 67 through 69 of this report.

Approximately
70% of the Company's sales in 2008 and 2007 and 71% in 2006 consisted of
products with short lives, such as reconstructive, trauma, craniomaxillofacial
and spinal implant systems (while implants have a long useful life to the
patient, they have a one-time use to the hospital); disposables and expendable
tools; and parts and service revenues, including service and repair charges. 
The balance of sales in each of the years came from products that could be
considered capital equipment, having useful lives in excess of one year.

The
Company's backlog of firm orders is not considered material to an understanding
of its business.

Orthopaedic Implants

Orthopaedic
Implants are designed and manufactured by Stryker Orthopaedics, Stryker
Osteosynthesis, Stryker Spine and Stryker Biotech and consist of such products
as implants used in joint replacement, trauma, craniomaxillofacial and spinal
surgeries; bone cement; and the bone growth factor OP-1.  Artificial joints are
made of cobalt chromium, titanium alloys, ceramics or ultrahigh molecular
weight polyethylene and are implanted in patients whose natural joints have
been damaged by arthritis, osteoporosis, other diseases or injury.  The
Company's OP-1 bone growth factor, which induces the formation of new bone when
implanted into bone, is composed of recombinant human OP-1 and a bioresorbable
collagen matrix.

Minimally Invasive Surgery

Many
of Stryker's technologically advanced reconstructive implants are suited to
minimally invasive surgery (MIS) procedures that are intended to reduce
soft-tissue damage and pain while hastening return to function.  The Company
supports surgeons with technology, procedural development and specialized
instrumentation as they develop new MIS techniques.  In order to facilitate
emerging procedural approaches, the Company has also developed instrumentation
for MIS total joint procedures.  The Company's surgical navigation systems are
frequently used in MIS procedures to improve the accuracy of measurements and
to position the implant.

The
Company's Triathlon Total Knee Minimally Invasive Instrumentation is designed
to complement the unique, minimally invasive total knee procedure pioneered by
a leading orthopaedic surgeon.  The Triathlon Partial Knee Resurfacing (PKR)
unicompartmental knee system and the Avon Patellofemoral Joint are resurfacing,
bone-conserving designs that are used to treat disease isolated to one
compartment of the knee.  These pre-total knee treatment options can also
be implanted using minimally invasive techniques.

Stryker
Osteosynthesis has a market leadership position in the Intramedullary (IM) Hip
Screw market due to the minimally invasive nature of the Gamma Nail, which can
be implanted through a smaller incision than other competing products. In
addition, surgeons are testing the use of the Company's surgical navigation
systems for this procedure as well as in surgery for pelvic fractures.

Orthobiologics

Stryker participates in the fast-growing field of
orthobiologics with products that combine both natural and synthetic
technologies.  The Company's innovative product portfolio includes such
products as OP-1, a proprietary, recombinant version of a signaling protein
with multiple tissue regeneration properties; TissueMend, a single-layer
acellular collagen matrix that is easy to handle and delivers both unrivaled
strength and documented remodeling capability; HydroSet, the next generation in
bone substitute technology, which is injectible, sculptable and fast setting;
BoneSource BVF, an effective osteoconductive bone substitute with excellent
biocompatibility and mechanical stability; and BoneSave, a granules-based
alternative to conventional bone grafting.

Hip Implant Systems

Through
Stryker Orthopaedics, the Company offers a variety of hip implant systems for
the global reconstructive market including primary (or first-time) and revision
(to repair or enhance a previous replacement) hip systems as well as less
invasive hip systems.

In
2007 the Company began selling the Cormet Hip Resurfacing System in the United States pursuant to an exclusive 10-year marketing and distribution agreement with
Corin Group PLC.  In 2006 the Company began the launch of the MITCH TRH System
in certain international markets.  These products represent a less invasive, joint
preserving hip resurfacing option for younger patients with the potential for
enhanced stability and range of motion.  In hip resurfacing procedures, very
little bone is removed from the femoral head, the femoral neck is preserved and
the femoral canal is spared.  MIS approaches combined with hip resurfacing
products and related surgical instrumentation offer the promise of less soft
tissue trauma, reduced pain and improved recovery times.

The
Company offers a comprehensive system of cementless stems, cemented stems and
acetabular cups for each of its primary hip implant technologies, including
ABG, Partnership, Secur-Fit, Omnifit, Accolade, Exeter and Trident hip systems.
These systems, along with associated surgical instrumentation, are designed to
provide personalized solutions based on the patient's unique anatomy while
streamlining the implant procedure to improve surgical efficiencies.  Each of
these systems includes a portfolio of primary stem options based on multiple
fixation philosophies including anatomic, fit/fill, taper wedge and
double-tapered designs.  In addition, acetabular systems including the Trident
and ABG Acetabular systems provide a variety of options for achieving initial
and long term fixation.  In 2008 the Company introduced the Tritanium Primary acetabular
system.  This system provides an advanced fixation technology offering a pure
titanium matrix designed to improve bone ingrowth.

Following
the clinical success of its Crossfire technology, a highly crosslinked
polyethylene designed to reduce wear, Stryker introduced X3 polyethylene.  X3
polyethylene is the Company's next-generation highly crosslinked polyethylene,
which features a higher level of strength and wear reduction in both hip and
knee replacements.   Building on the strength of the X3 product offering, the
Company introduced Low Friction Ion Treatment (LFIT) and Delta Anatomic Femoral
Heads with X3 polyethylene liners.  These bearing combinations represent an advancement
in hip-bearing technology that in combination are anatomically sized for more
natural hip performance while offering even greater options to reduce wear and
potentially increase implant longevity. The Company received premarket approval
(PMA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2003 for its
ceramic-on-ceramic hip replacement system, the Trident Ceramic Acetabular
Insert, for patients in the United States.  Stryker Orthopaedics has
successfully launched the Trident ceramic insert in the United States, Europe, Australia and Canada.  The Trident insert is wear resistant, and it is
protected and strengthened by a patented titanium sleeve.

The
Company offers a number of products designed to meet the needs of revision hip
procedures including Restoration, Restoration Modular, Trident Tritanium
Revision, and Dall-Miles each of which provides surgeons with the options
necessary to address revision surgery challenges.  The Restoration Modular
Revision Hip System offers surgeons performing revision surgeries flexibility
in treating complex hip stem revisions and restoring patient biomechanics.  The
Restoration Modular Revision Hip System also takes advantage of Stryker's long
clinical history with hydroxylapatite (HA), a naturally occurring calcium
phosphate material that demonstrates a high level of biocompatibility due to
its resemblance to bone, by incorporating PureFix HA coating on many
components.  The Restoration Modular Revision Hip System enhances the Company's
existing Restoration HA and Restoration plasma spray (PS) monolithic revision
systems.  The Restoration System is complemented by the Trident Tritanium
Acetabular Cup, a biologically inspired, commercially pure titanium ingrowth
surface designed to provide solid initial fixation and promote bone ingrowth. 
Coupled with the availability of the Dall-Miles System for trochanteric
reattachment and cerclage fixation, Stryker's revision portfolio offers
comprehensive solutions to address challenges encountered in revision surgery.

- - 7 -

Stryker
was the first company to receive clearance from the FDA to commercially release
for sale in the United States a hip implant with HA surface treatment.  The
Company's global clinical experience with HA-coated hip stems now extends over
20 years, and reported clinical performance continues to equal or exceed that
of comparable hip stems reported in the scientific literature.

The
Company's CentPillar Hip System offers an increased range of motion and a
minimally invasive technique preferred by Japanese surgeons for their
patients.  In 2007 the Company introduced CentPillar TMZF to the Japanese
market.  This is the first product introduced in Japan that utilizes Stryker's
patented TMZF material along with the Company's PureFix HA.  The TMZF material
allows for implant stiffness more closely matched to a patient's own bone to
enhance fixation.

The
Company entered 2009 with more than 30 years of clinical history with the
Exeter Hip System, more than 20 years of clinical history with the Omnifit
cemented stem and more than 20 years of clinical history with the Omnifit HA
stem.  Long-term clinical results are an important factor in the Company's
ability to market hip implants.

Knee Implant Systems

Knee
replacement surgery is a procedure typically intended to replace damaged
articular bone surfaces in the knee joint, most often due to arthritis. The
components used most frequently are a femoral component, a tibial tray, a tibial
bearing insert, and a patella bearing.  Knee replacement surgeries also include
primary procedures and revision procedures.  Primary procedures tend to focus
more on the knee's articular surfaces, whereas revision procedures can include
simple replacement of one or more previously implanted devices, implantation of
different devices to accommodate certain instabilities in the joint or larger
reconstruction of the joint in severe cases.

The
Company offers three major knee implant systems: Triathlon, Scorpio, and Global
Modular Replacement System (GMRS) systems.   These implant systems were
complemented in 2008 with the introduction of the Triathlon PKR
unicompartmental knee system and the continued rollout of the Triathlon Total
Stabilizer (TS) revision knee system and the Company's X3 advanced bearing
technology for both Triathlon and Scorpio.  The Triathlon PKR unicompartmental
knee system was designed to resurface specific areas of the knee while leaving
other healthy areas intact.  It combines simple, efficient surgical
instrumentation specifically designed for minimally invasive surgery with the single
radius articular design and X3 advanced bearing material.

The
Triathlon Knee System represents the Company's evolutionary design that has
been developed to more closely reproduce natural knee motion and is designed to
provide mobility with stability through more than 150 degrees of flexion.  Triathlon
is based on the clinical track record of Stryker's predecessor designs and
leverages the unique single radius design philosophy to enhance post-operative
recovery and optimize patient performance. The Triathlon system of implants
provides the surgeon with options to treat a wide range of knee diseases. In
2008 Stryker continued the launch of Triathlon in Europe and Canada and began its release in the Japanese market.

The
Triathlon Primary Knee system gives surgeons versatile instrumentation options
that provide both accuracy and efficiency in a minimally-invasive approach as
well as options for treating varying degrees of instability in the knee.  In
2007 the Company introduced the Triathlon condylar stabilizing (CS) version
designed to provide extra stability where the posterior cruciate ligament is
either weak or missing.  The Triathlon cruciate-retaining (CR) version allows
for retention of a functioning posterior cruciate ligament.  The Triathlon posteriorly
stabilized (PS) version provides a mechanical substitution for the posterior
cruciate ligament, for an even greater degree of stability. The instrumentation
for Triathlon is designed to improve operating room efficiency through a
streamlined, integrated system providing options and flexibility to meet
surgeons' varying preferences and multiple surgical techniques.  In 2007
Stryker introduced the Precision instrument kit, specifically designed to increase
surgical efficiencies through a sterile-packed disposable set of instruments,
complimenting the existing Triathlon kits.

In
2007 the Company released the Triathlon TS revision knee system consisting of a
comprehensive line of implants and instrumentation. Triathlon TS is designed to
provide the surgeon options to deal with varying

- 8 -

degrees of instability and
bone loss in the knee, caused by either severe disease or revision of previous
implants. It is also designed to provide the patient the ability to achieve the
performance of a primary knee replacement in a revision application, again
leveraging Stryker's single radius design philosophy. Triathlon TS can be used
with the X3 tibial insert, making it the only revision knee system on the
market that offers a highly cross-linked bearing material.

The
Scorpio knee implant system is based on the Company's design philosophy of a single
articular radius based on the epicondylar axis of the knee.  This patented
approach addresses significant clinical issues, such as improved patient rehabilitation
and mid-flexion stability, through an increase in the patella-femoral moment
arm and a unique single anterior-posterior radius.  The Scorpio system provides
a wide range of options for the surgeon and patient in treatment of knee
arthritis and stability.  The Scorpio NRG provides an evolution in kinematic
benefits, including increased rotational allowance and an articulating design
enabling deeper flexion.  In 2007 the Scorpio NRG with X3 advanced bearing
technology was launched.  This new version of the Scorpio NRG is designed to
lower wear rates compared with standard inserts.  The Scorpio System is
supported by the X-Celerate instrumentation
system, which was designed to provide intraoperative flexibility and precision
as well as a simple, cost-effective approach to total knee replacement
surgery.  Additionally, the Scorpio TS knee revision system provides surgeons
the ability to address greater degrees of instability and bone loss in both
primary and revision knee scenarios.

The
GMRS knee implant system offers a comprehensive solution for severe bone loss
in oncology, trauma and revision surgery patients.  GMRS has tibial and femoral
components, including a total femur, and a modular rotating hinge knee.  The
system utilizes both titanium and cobalt chrome alloys for strength and
lightness of weight, together with the superior flexibility of the hinge.  The
MRS, the predecessor to the GMRS, was the first modular segmental replacement
system when it was introduced in 1988.  These system components have maintained
a leadership position in this market segment since their introduction.

Other Joint Replacement
Products

The Company markets other joint replacement products,
principally shoulder and elbow implants and related instruments, under the
Stryker brand name.  The Solar Total Shoulder System was designed to address
the most common arthritic disorders affecting the shoulder such as rheumatoid
arthritis, osteoarthritis, posttraumatic arthritis and avascular necrosis.  In
most cases of disease involving both the humeral head and the glenoid cavity
with an intact rotator cuff, optimal pain relief and function may be achieved
with total shoulder arthroplasty.  In cases of cuff arthropathy, the Solar
Bipolar, which incorporates the patented bipolar locking mechanism that is also
used in the Company's hip implants, was designed to fill the joint space and
provide two articulating surfaces for better joint mechanics and pain relief.  In 2007 the Company introduced
the ReUnion Shoulder fracture system of implants and instrumentation.  The
ReUnion System utilizes an innovative trial system to simplify the
reconstruction of the shoulder during fracture surgery.  The ReUnion's low profile body and fenestration enable
the surgeon to use a variety of suture techniques and enhances healing.   The Solar Total Elbow complements
products offered for upper extremity procedures.  The semiconstrained design
and modular components address varying types of patient anatomy.

Bone
Cement

Simplex bone cement, a material used in cemented joint
replacements, is the most widely used bone cement in the world.  The Company
manufactures and provides several variations of Simplex bone cement to meet
specific patient and clinical needs including non-antibiotic and antibiotic versions.
 For improved operating room efficiency, a faster setting version of Simplex
called SpeedSet was introduced in recent years.  SpeedSet demonstrates
statistical equivalency to Simplex for its well regarded mechanical properties
such as fatigue, compressive, tensile, and shear strength.  Simplex has 50
years of clinical history, the longest of any bone cement, with more than 400
published clinical papers.

Trauma Implant Systems

Through Stryker Osteosynthesis, the Company
develops, manufactures and markets its trauma extremities and deformities
systems.  These systems, including nailing, plating, hip fracture, external
fixation systems and bone substitutes, are used primarily in deformity
corrections and in the fixation of fractures resulting from sudden injury.
These products consist of internal fixation devices marketed under such names
as Gamma, Omega, Asnis, AxSOS, VariAx, HydroSet, BixCut, T2 and S2, along with
external fixation devices marketed under the Apex, Hoffmann II, TenXor and
Monotube Triax names.

The Company's internal fixation product
portfolio includes a full array of IM nails, hip fracture devices and
plates and screws in both titanium and stainless steel.  These products
complement the total hip and knee replacement offerings mentioned above by
offering a restorative option in addition to total joint replacement.

To address the hip trauma and fracture
segment, the Company markets several products, including the IM nail portfolio,
led by the T2 Nailing System; the Gamma Nail, a unique IM nail for trochanteric
fractures; the Omega hip screw system; the Asnis Cannulated Screw System; and
the Hansson pin system, providing a complete offering of surgical solutions for
the hip trauma patient.  These hip fracture systems offer orthopaedic surgeons
multiple options depending on their preferences and patient needs.

The T2 Nailing System includes femoral and
tibial components with a common instrumentation platform for accuracy and ease
of use.  The Company has also recently introduced the T2 Ankle Arthrodesis Nail
to provide the option for tibiotalocalcaneal fusion with a retrograde IM nail to
repair limited soft tissue damage in the ankle area.  Building on the success
of the T2 titanium nail system, the Company introduced the stainless steel S2
tibial and femoral nails.  The Gamma3 is based on 20 years of Gamma Nail
experience and is the third generation of IM short and long Gamma fixation
nails.  The Gamma3 System is designed to facilitate minimally invasive surgery (MIS)
and reduce surgery time through the use of newly designed implants and
instrumentation.  The Asnis Cannulated Screw System can help simplify the
operative procedure through features that allow surgeons to place, insert and
remove locking screws easily. This system was recently expanded to include
smaller diameters of 2.0mm and 3.0mm for foot surgery to complement the VariAx
foot and ankle plating system.

In 2007 the Company introduced the Omega3 Compression
Hip Screw System, a unique and innovative product that reflects Stryker's
extensive experience in the treatment of hip fractures of the proximal femur. 
The Omega3 system offers surgeons a wide choice of low-profile hip plates plus
the option to lock screws with diverging fixation.  The Omega3 allows surgeons
to decide preoperatively or even intraoperatively to add axial stabilizing
screws to lock the hip plate to the femoral shaft.  Axial stability with 5.0mm
locking inserts and corresponding locking screws allows for increased
stability.  This may be advantageous for early mobilization and when the bone
density or bone quality is limited.

To
address the knee trauma segment, Stryker offers the Hoffmann II Modular Fixation System, the T2 SCN
Nailing System and the SPS and AXSOS plating solutions.  The Hoffmann II
knee-bridging frame is used to stabilize injuries to the knee until definitive
treatment with a plate or nail occurs or reconstruction takes place.  In
addition, Stryker offers the T2 SCN Nail, which can be used for the treatment
of supracondylar femur fractures just above the knee joint. This nail can also
be used for periprosthetic fracture fixation for traumatic fractures in
patients who have already had a joint replacement.

Stryker
has several product lines for extremity trauma.  The Universal Distal Radius System complements the stainless steel
Numelock II with a titanium option in distal radius plates and screws. The
Universal Distal Radius System offers a wide array of precontoured,
variable-sized plates for volar, distal and column approaches and both open
reduction and internal fixation techniques.  In 2008 the Company extended its
VariAx technology to both hand and foot applications.  Both systems offer a
comprehensive plating system to treat multiple small bone fractures.  The
second-generation VariAx Universal Distal Radius System, which is thinner than
the original and features polyaxial locking, was launched in 2006.  The AXSOS
Locking Plate System, also introduced in 2006, is designed to treat metaphyseal
and diaphyseal fractures with low-profile anatomically contoured plates, a
unique screw design and a simple instrument platform.

- - 10 -

The Company's external fixation products
also include the Hoffmann II Compact and MicroFix, the Monotube Triax
monolateral system, the TenXor circular fixation system for complex fractures
and a complete range of pins and wires for attaching the devices to fractured
bones. The Hoffmann II Compact for upper extremity fractures includes a
patented snap-fit mechanism that makes it easy for surgeons to construct the
fixation device to fit the patient and align the fractured bones.  It also has a
full selection of lightweight radiolucent connection bars that allow for quick
intraoperative fracture repair. The Monotube Triax System is available in three
sizes and includes an adjustable feature that enables surgeons not only to stabilize
fractures but also to lengthen the bone in cases where bone has been removed
due to damage.  The TenXor hybrid frame enables surgeons to treat complex
fractures around the joints with both pins and long transfixing wires.  This
attribute is especially useful for patients with multipart fractures near the
ankle and knee.  The system features advanced composite materials and is
compatible with the Hoffmann II snap-fit connection devices.

Spinal Implant Systems

Through
Stryker Spine, the Company develops, manufactures and markets spinal implant
products including cervical, thoracolumbar and interbody systems used in spine
injury, deformity and degenerative therapies.  Spinal implant products include
plates, rods, screws, connectors, spacers and cages, along with proprietary
implant instrumentation.

In
2008 the Company introduced the Radius Thoracolumbar Spinal Implant System. 
The Radius system provides a non-threaded wedgelock locking mechanism designed
to reduce the potential for false locking and cross-threading and to increase
the speed, ease and reliability of connecting rods to screws.  Also in 2008,
the Company launched Xia III, the next generation of its thoracolumbar spinal
implant system and THOR, its anterior lumbar plating system that incorporates a
proprietary screw locking technology.  In 2007 the Company introduced the
Mantis minimally invasive access system for posterior instrumented spinal
fusion and the Reflex Zero Profile anterior cervical plating system.  In 2006
the Company introduced the VLIFT vertebral body replacement system consisting
of a preassembled, cylindrically shaped titanium cage with a distractible or
retractable center.  The hollow core of the cage allows for packing bone
graft.  Also in 2006 Stryker launched the AVS AS and AL Spacers which are used
as vertebral body support devices in anterior procedures.  Other product lines
include the OASYS fixation system that serves the posterior cervical fusion
market, the Reflex Hybrid anterior cervical plate and the AVS PL and TL vertebral spacer systems.

Craniomaxillofacial
Implant Systems

Through
Stryker Osteosynthesis, the Company develops, manufactures and markets plating

maxiollofacial and plastic surgery. The instruments are handmade in Germany and provide surgeons with optimal instrumentation for all of their surgical
procedures. Four unique sets are available for specific specialties including
facial fracture, plastic, oral and neurosurgery. Surgeons also have the option
of customizing their own sets to satisfy surgeon preference.

OP-1/BMP-7

Stryker's
therapeutic product, OP-1 Implant, is composed of recombinant human OP-1 and a
bioresorbable collagen matrix.  OP-1 is a natural protein that the human body
makes to induce bone formation. In preclinical studies, OP-1 induced the
formation of new bone when implanted into bony defect sites.  Clinical studies
for bone formation have been performed in two challenging clinical indications,
nonunion fractures of long bones and posterolateral spine fusions.

Based
on clinical data from a large, controlled human study, Stryker received
approval for a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) from the FDA in 2001 for the
use of OP-1 Implant as an alternative to autograft in recalcitrant long-bone
nonunions where use of autograft is not feasible and alternative treatments
have failed.  An HDE, as defined by the FDA, is for a product intended to
benefit patients by treating or diagnosing a disease or condition that affects
fewer than 4,000 individuals per year in the United States.  The Company
received market approvals from regulators in Europe and in Australia during
2001 as well as in Canada during 2002 for the indication of nonunion fractures of
the tibia that failed prior autograft treatment or when autograft treatment is
not feasible; for the treatment of long-bone nonunions secondary to trauma for
the purpose of initiating new bone formation; or for the clinical indication of
long-bone nonunions, respectively.  In the United States, Stryker received a
further HDE in 2004 for revision posterolateral spine fusion following the
completion of a pilot clinical study that indicated possible benefit of a new
formulation of OP-1 known as OP-1 Putty.

Stryker
is committed to the further development of OP-1 as an alternative to iliac
crest bone graft for patients requiring spinal fusion using a variety of
surgical techniques.  Spinal fusion is used to stabilize the spine and improve
patient outcomes postoperatively.  The Company conducted a multicenter pivotal
trial in the United States and Canada using OP-1 Putty in posterolateral lumbar
spine fusion in the setting of degenerative spondylolisthesis.  In 2003 the
Company completed enrollment in this trial, and the final 2-year follow-up
evaluation was completed at the end of 2005.  The results were analyzed and
submitted to the FDA in 2006 as part of a PMA application for the use of OP-1
Putty in posterolateral lumbar spine fusion surgeries.  The primary end points
of the trial included a combination of clinical success, as measured by the
Oswestry Disability Index, neurological events, device-related serious adverse
events and retreatment, as well as radiological success, as measured by the
presence of bone, angulation and translation.  Based on the results of one of
the components of the primary end points from the trial, and subsequent to the
filing of the PMA, the Company decided to collect additional prospective
clinical and radiographic data.  In 2008 the additional data was filed with the
FDA for review and the Company was informed by the FDA that the PMA submission,
including the additional prospective data, will be reviewed by the FDA
Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Devices Panel on March 31, 2009.  Stryker also
filed a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) with the European Medicines
Evaluation Agency (EMEA) for the posterolateral lumbar spine fusion indication
in 2006.  In 2008 the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use in Europe recommended this indication for approval.

In 2006
Stryker filed an investigational device exemption (IDE) application with the
FDA to start a pilot clinical study in transforaminal lumbar interbody fusions
using OP-1 Putty.  The IDE was approved and patient recruitment was completed in
2008.

Stryker
is also interested in exploring the cartilage regeneration properties of OP-1
and has successfully completed preclinical studies showing that OP-1 can
stimulate new cartilage formation and increase disc height in animal models of
degenerative disc disease.  In 2005 Stryker filed its first Investigational New
Drug (IND) application with the FDA to treat degenerative disc disease with a
new injectable form of OP-1 in a dose-ranging study in humans.  In 2008 the
Company completed enrollment in this dose-ranging clinical safety study for the
first time use of BMP-7 to regenerate cartilage tissue.

- 12 -

In
2006 Stryker filed an IND application with the FDA to treat osteoarthritis in
the knee with the injectable form of OP-1.  Following FDA concurrence in 2007, the
Company proceeded with patient enrollment in the clinical study which was
completed in 2008.

In
2006 the Company introduced the Stryker Precision Oscillating Tip Saw.  In
contrast to standard surgical saws with oscillating blades, this innovative saw
has a stationary blade shaft with an oscillating tip.  This feature gives
surgeons the opportunity for greater accuracy while simplifying cuts and
reducing the potential for soft tissue damage and facilitating less invasive
procedures.  This saw represents an advance in procedural simplification,
offering customers the potential for time and cost savings by reducing the
number of steps in the surgical process.

In
2006 the System 6 heavy duty, large-bone power system was released.  This
next-generation system, which includes several new attachments, is more
powerful and has a longer battery life than its predecessor.  The System 6
Rotary Handpieces provide more options to surgeons by allowing both high-speed
drilling and high-torque reaming in one handpiece.  System 6 Heavy Duty Saws
provide increased torque for a faster and more efficient cut.

In
2006 the Company launched the Silverglide Non-Stick bipolar forceps.  These forceps
rapidly diffuse heat, which eliminates localized sticking of tissue to the
instrument and thus reduces bleeding in neurosurgery procedures.

- - 13 -

The
Maestro drill represents Stryker's line of micro powered instruments for spine,
neurology and ENT applications.  Employing the pneumatic technology that is the
preference of many surgeons in these specialties, the Maestro drill leverages

System represents Stryker's leading product for waste management in the
operating room.  The self-contained device, first introduced in 2000 and
consistently improved, collects and disposes of fluid and smoke waste from
surgical procedures, minimizing the need for operator intervention and
therefore the risk of exposure to these waste products.  In 2008 Stryker
introduced the Neptune 2 Waste Management platform.  This next-generation
system allows for increased fluid collection capacity while enhancing end user
system preferences based on surgical procedures.

Through
Stryker Instruments, the Company offers SpinePlex, a variation of its surgical
Simplex bone cement for applications in the treatment of vertebral compression
fractures.  In 2006 the Company introduced the Discmonitor Discography System,
a disposable device used to inject fluid into the intervertebral disc nucleus
during discography procedures.  This system features a digital display and
allows physicians to save key data points for each disc.  Stryker's
radiofrequency generator system for chronic pain management, originally
introduced in 2004, was enhanced in 2006 with improved user interfaces, a
simplified operating system and the expansion of the cannula and electrode
offerings, including the industry's first monopolar nitinol electrode. Stryker
also offers the Dekompressor, a
single-use disposable device indicated for the percutaneous removal of disc
nucleus material, which offers an early, less invasive approach to mitigating

along with Stryker's offerings in percutaneous cement delivery, discography and
radiofrequency denervation, allows Stryker to focus on the interventional spine
marketplace.

Surgical Navigation Systems

Through
Stryker Instruments, the Company offers a broad line of surgical navigation
systems that give surgeons in several specialties the ability to use electronic
imaging to see more clearly, better align instruments and more accurately track
where the instruments are relative to a patient's anatomy during surgical
procedures.  In 2006 Stryker released two navigation applications for the joint
replacement and craniomaxillofacial implant markets.  The eNdtrac ASM software
and instrumentation give orthopaedic surgeons the option of navigating their
cuts while eliminating the need to place additional pins in the femur and tibia
outside of the surgical incision.  The iNtellect software packages provide
neurologic and ENT surgeons with enhanced graphics, a significantly

- - 14 -

simplified
image import process, customizable procedure-specific workflows and
user-friendly advanced tools for comprehensive planning and navigation.

To
further serve the reconstructive and spine implant markets, the Company offers
the OrthoLock Anchoring System, which allows for less invasive procedures and
provides surgeons a choice of two- or three-pin tracker anchoring.  In 2008 the
Company released ORTHOMAP 1.3 software, its third generation of hip implant
navigation software.  This technology uses patient table motion and easily
accessible landmarks to remove the need for complicated pelvic registration.  ORTHOMAP
1.3 software also contains a complete database of Stryker hip implant systems
that the surgeon may utilize intraoperatively to assist in sizing and
positioning.   In 2007 the Company introduced i

N

finitus Resurfacing 1.0
software designed to assist the surgeon with navigated guide wire placement
during hip implant procedures.

To
assist in imaged based orthopaedic procedures including surgical oncology,
Stryker offers ORTHOMAP 3D 1.0 software.  This software platform utilizes
single or multiple image data sets allowing the surgeon to pre-plan resections,
facilitate a more MIS bone sparing procedure and gather necessary information
intraoperatively such as leg length and component rotation.

In
2007 the Company released precisioN Knee 4.0 software to serve the knee implant
market.  This new software system represents an upgrade from earlier offerings
and is designed to further simplify the procedure via reactive workflow by
leveraging Stryker's Smart instrumentation and camera technology.  This unique
technology promotes greater surgical efficiency because the software
automatically reacts to a surgeon's individualized procedural workflow and
instrument position in space.  The precisioN Knee 4.0 software also houses an
integrated implant database with all of Stryker's knee implant offerings, which
automatically sizes and positions the component for the surgeon.  The Company
also offers unicondylar navigation software for surgeons that only need to
repair one side of a damaged, arthritic knee.

In
craniomaxillofacial navigation, Stryker offers iNtellect Cranial and iNtellect
ENT software.  Both iNtellect packages are enhancements released in 2007 and
are based on the original Neuro 2.0 and ENT 2.0 software packages.  These
packages provide surgeons the option of utilizing the Company's Mask technology
to register the patient without traditional fiducial markers and increases
surgical efficiency by significantly reducing intraoperative patient
registration time.

In
2008 the Company released SpineMap3D 1.0 software, its next generation product
offering for spine navigation.  SpineMap3D 1.0 software supports complex spine
procedures, such as multiple-level scoliosis repair and less invasive cases,

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

Most
of the Company's products and product improvements have been developed
internally.  The Company maintains close working relationships with physicians
and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist in product
research and development.  New and improved products play a critical role in
the Company's sales growth.  The Company continues to place emphasis on the
development of proprietary products and product improvements to complement and
expand its existing product lines.  The Company has a decentralized research
and development focus, with manufacturing locations responsible for new product
development and product improvements.  Research, development and engineering personnel
at the various manufacturing locations maintain relationships with staff at distribution
locations and with customers to understand changes in the market and product
needs.

Total
expenditures for product research, development and engineering were $367.8
million in 2008, $375.3 million in 2007 and $324.6 million in 2006.  Research,
development and engineering expenses represented 5.5% of sales in 2008,
compared with 6.3% in 2007 and 2006. As anticipated, the spending level in 2008
decreased as the Company implemented a more normalized level of spending for
these costs compared to prior periods as well as the Company's focus of
research and development resources on compliance initiatives, which has slowed
down some research and development projects and reduced outside contractor
spending on certain projects. Recent new product introductions in the
Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment segments are more fully described
under the caption "Product Sales" on pages 5 through 17 of this
report.

In
addition to internally developed products, the Company invests in technologies
developed by third parties that have the potential to expand the markets in
which the Company operates.  In 2006 the Company acquired Sightline
Technologies Ltd. (Sightline), to enhance the Company's presence in the
gastrointestinal and

- 17 -

other markets within its MedSurg Equipment segment. 
Unanticipated issues have arisen that continue to delay the regulatory approval
and commercialization efforts of new products associated with the technologies
acquired in the Sightline acquisition.  During 2008 the Company substantially
reduced the development efforts associated with these products, as more fully
described in "Note 6 - Restructuring Charges" on page 58 of this report. 
However, the Company believes that the technology acquired in the Sightline acquisition may
result in the introduction of new products and additional sales in future
periods.

In
2005 the Company acquired PlasmaSol Corp. (PlasmaSol), a developer of a
technology that should allow Stryker to provide sterilization equipment for use
with certain of its MedSurg Equipment products.  In 2004 the Company acquired SpineCore, Inc. (SpineCore), a developer
of artificial lumbar and cervical discs.  The Company believes that the
technologies acquired in each of the PlasmaSol
and SpineCore acquisitions will result in
the introduction of new products.  However, unanticipated issues may arise that
could further delay or terminate a product's development prior to regulatory
approval or commercialization.  As of
December 31, 2008, the Company had not encountered significant issues and
expects completion of the development and initial U.S. commercialization of the
FlexiCore lumbar artificial disc, the CerviCore cervical artificial disc and
the sterilization technology following receipt of all required regulatory
approvals.

In
2006 the Company opened a new facility to support product development
activities across its manufacturing divisions.  Located near Delhi, India, the facility provides software and mechanical engineering resources for divisional research &
development teams to accelerate new product innovation and facilitates the
development and testing of Stryker's internal systems.

through 69 of this report.

The
Company's business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of
orthopaedic implant surgeries is lower during the summer months.

COMPETITION

The
Company is one of five leading competitors in the United States for orthopaedic
reconstructive products.  The four other leading competitors are DePuy
Orthopaedics, Inc. (a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson), Zimmer Holdings,
Inc., Biomet, Inc., and Smith & Nephew plc.  While competition abroad
varies from area to area, the Company believes it is also a leading player in
the international markets with these same companies as its principal
competitors.

- 18 -

In the trauma
implant segment, Stryker is one of five leaders competing principally with
Synthes, Inc., Smith & Nephew Orthopaedics (a division of Smith &
Nephew plc), Zimmer Holdings, Inc., and DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc.

In
the spinal implant segment, the Company is one of five leaders, competing
principally with Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Inc. (a subsidiary of Medtronic,
Inc.), DePuy Spine, Inc. (a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson), Synthes, Inc.,
and Zimmer Holdings, Inc.

In
the craniomaxillofacial implant segment, Stryker is one of four leaders, competing
 principally with  Synthes, Inc., Biomet Microfixation, LLC (a subsidiary of
Biomet, Inc.), and KLS Martin L.P.

Several
companies are engaged in the research and development of products for the
repair of hard and soft tissues that, if approved, would compete with the
Company's OP-1 product.  Medtronic Sofamor Danek has received FDA approval for
its recombinant bone morphogenetic protein ("rhBMP-2") for certain
spine, trauma and orthopaedic indications, including the treatment of acute,
open fractures of the tibial shaft and spinal fusion surgeries.  A number of
companies currently provide various other therapies, including allografts, bone
fillers and electrical stimulation devices for the treatment, repair or
replacement of bone and joint tissue.  The Company believes that its OP-1
product, which is approved for limited trauma and spine indications in certain
markets and is currently in clinical trials for other indications, will
ultimately compete with these products and with traditional therapies, such as
autograft and allograft.

In
the surgical equipment segment, Stryker is one of three leaders, competing
principally with Medtronic, Inc., and Conmed Linvatec, Inc. (a subsidiary of Conmed Corporation).  These companies
are also competitors in the international segments, along with Aesculap-Werke
AG (a division of B. Braun Melsungen AG), a large European manufacturer.

In
the surgical navigation segment, Stryker is one of six principal competitors,
including Medtronic Surgical Navigation Technologies (a division of Medtronic,
Inc.), BrainLAB Inc. (a subsidiary of BrainLAB AG), Aesculap AG & Co. KG (a division of B. Braun Melsungen
AG), Radionics, Inc. (a subsidiary of Integra LifeSciences Corporation), and GE
Medical Systems Navigation and Visualization, Inc. (a subsidiary of General
Electric Company).

In
the arthroscopy segment, the Company is one of four leaders, together with the
principal competitors Smith & Nephew Endoscopy (a division of Smith &
Nephew plc), Conmed Linvatec, Inc., and Arthrex, Inc.  In the laparoscopic
imaging products segment, the Company is one of three leaders, together with
the principal competitors, Karl Storz GmbH & Co. (a German company) and
Olympus Optical Co. Ltd. (a Japanese company).

The
Company's primary competitor in the patient handling segment is Hill-Rom Holdings,
Inc.  In the specialty stretcher segment, the primary competitors are Hausted,
Inc. (a subsidiary of Steris Corporation),
Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc., and Midmark Hospital Products Group (a subsidiary of
Ohio Medical Instrument Company, Inc.).  In the emergency medical services
segment, Ferno-Washington, Inc. is the Company's principal competitor.

The principal
factors that the Company believes differentiate it in the highly competitive
market segments in which it operates and enable it to compete effectively are
innovation, reliability, service and reputation.  The Company believes that its
competitive position in the future will depend to a large degree on its ability
to develop new products and make improvements to existing products.  While the
Company does not consider patents a major factor in its overall competitive
success, patents and trademarks are significant to the extent that a product or
an attribute of a product represents a unique design or process.  Patent
protection of such products restricts competitors from duplicating these unique
designs and features.  Stryker seeks to obtain patent protection on its
products whenever possible.  The Company currently owns approximately 1,010 United States patents and 1,450 international patents.

MANUFACTURING AND SOURCES OF SUPPLY

The
Company's manufacturing processes consist primarily of precision machining,
metal fabrication and assembly operations; the forging and investment casting
of cobalt chrome; and the finishing of cobalt chrome and titanium.  In
addition, the Company is the sole manufacturer of its OP-1 product. 
Approximately 12% of the Company's cost of sales in 2008 represented finished
products that were purchased complete from outside suppliers.  The Company also
purchases parts and components, such as forgings, castings, gears, bearings,
casters and electrical components, and uses outside sources for certain
finishing operations, such as plating, hardening and coating of machined components
and sterilization of certain products.  The principal raw materials used by the
Company are stainless steel, aluminum, cobalt chrome and titanium alloys.  In
all, purchased parts and components from outside sources were approximately 50%
of the total cost of sales in 2008.

While
the Company relies on single sources for certain purchased materials and
services, it believes alternate sources are available if needed.  The Company
has not experienced any significant difficulty in the past in obtaining the
materials necessary to meet its production schedules.

Substantially
all products manufactured by the Company are stocked in inventory, while
certain products manufactured within the Company's MedSurg Equipment segment
are assembled to order.

REGULATION

AND PRODUCT QUALITY

The
Medical Device Amendments of 1976 to the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act
and the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990, together with regulations issued or
proposed thereunder, provide for regulation by the FDA of the design, manufacture
and marketing of medical devices, including most of the Company's products.

The FDA's
Quality System regulations set forth standards for the Company's product design
and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records and
provide for inspections of the Company's facilities by the FDA.  There are also
certain requirements of state, local and foreign governments that must be
complied with in the manufacturing and marketing of the Company's products.

In 2008 the Company received a warning letter from the FDA related to quality
systems and compliance issues at its OP-1 implant manufacturing facility in Hopkinton, Massachusetts. In 2007 the Company received two warning letters from the
FDA regarding compliance with certain quality system specifications at its
reconstructive implant manufacturing facilities: one letter for its facility in
 Cork, Ireland and another for its facility in Mahwah, New Jersey.  The Company
takes these matters very seriously and has been fully cooperating with the FDA
to address their observations.

Most
of the Company's new products fall into FDA classifications that require
notification of and review by the FDA before marketing, submitted as a 510(k). 
The Company's FlexiCore and CerviCore artificial disc products and OP-1
products require extensive clinical testing, consisting of safety and efficacy
studies, followed by PMA applications for specific surgical indications.

Stryker also is
subject to the laws that govern the manufacture and distribution of medical
devices of each country in which the Company manufactures or sells products. 
The member states of the European Union (EU) have adopted the European Medical
Device Directives, which create a single set of medical device regulations for
all EU member countries.  These regulations require companies that wish to
manufacture and distribute medical devices in EU member countries to obtain CE
Marking for their products.  Stryker has authorization to apply the CE Marking to
substantially all of its products.

The Company's OP-1 product has been
considered a drug under the regulations for Europe, Australia and Japan.

Initiatives
sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector to
limit the growth of healthcare expenses generally and hospital costs in
particular, including price regulation and competitive pricing, are ongoing in
markets where the Company does business.  It is not possible to predict at this
time the long-term impact of such cost-containment measures on the Company's
future business.

EMPLOYEES

At
December 31, 2008, the Company had 17,594 employees worldwide, including 7,321
involved in manufacturing, warehousing and distribution operations; 6,664 in
sales and marketing; 1,570 in research, development and engineering; and the
balance in general management and administration.  Certain international
employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are updated
annually.  The Company believes that its employee relations are satisfactory.

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE
REGISTRANT

Information
regarding the executive officers of the Company appears under the caption
"Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance" on pages
74 through 75 of this report.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS.

The
following information contains specific risks that could potentially impact the
Company's business, financial condition or operating results.  The Company may
be subject to additional risks that are not currently known to the Company or
those which the Company deems immaterial that may also impact its business
operations.

The
Company's inability to maintain adequate working relationships with healthcare
professionals could have a negative impact on the Company's future operating
results.

The
Company maintains close working relationships with respected physicians and
medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist in product research
and development.  The Company continues to place emphasis on the
development of proprietary products and product improvements to complement and
expand its existing product lines.  If the Company is unable to maintain
these good relationships, its ability to market and sell new and improved
products could decrease, and future operating results could be unfavorably
affected.

The Company's inability
to continue to hire and retain key employees could have a negative impact on
the Company's future operating results.

The talent and
drive of the Company's employees are key factors in the success of its
business.  The Company's sales, technical and other key personnel play an
integral role in the development, marketing and selling of new and existing
products.  If the Company is unable to recruit, hire, develop and retain a
talented, competitive work force, it may not be able to meet its strategic
business objectives.

Stricter pricing
guidelines for the Orthopaedic Implants industry could have a negative impact
on the Company's future operating results.

Initiatives
sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector to
limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation and
competitive pricing, are ongoing in markets where the Company does business. 
The Company could experience a negative impact on its operating results due to
increased pricing pressure in the United States, Japan and certain other
markets.  Governments, hospitals and other third party payers could reduce the
amount of approved reimbursements for the Company's Orthopaedic Implants
products.  Reductions in reimbursement levels or coverage, or other
cost-containment measures could unfavorably affect the Company's future
operating results.

- 21 -

The Company's operating
results could be negatively impacted by changes in its excess and obsolete
inventory reserves.

The Company
maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the
potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current
carrying costs. The markets in which the Company operates are highly
competitive, and new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an
ongoing basis.  Such marketplace changes may cause some of the Company's
products to become obsolete.  The Company makes estimates regarding the future
recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for
excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience, expiration of
sterilization dates and expected future trends.  If actual product life cycles,
product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable
than projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required,
which could unfavorably affect future operating results.

The Company's operating results could be negatively
impacted if it is unable to capitalize on research and development spending.

The Company has
spent a significant amount of time and resources on research and development
projects in order to develop and validate new and innovative products.  The
Company believes these projects will result in the commercialization of new
products and will create additional future sales.  However, factors including
regulatory delays, safety concerns or patent disputes could delay the
introduction or marketing of new products.  Additionally, unanticipated issues
may arise in connection with current and future clinical studies that could
delay or terminate a product's development prior to regulatory approval.  The
Company may experience an unfavorable impact on its operating results if it is
unable to capitalize on those efforts by attaining the proper FDA approval or to
successfully market new products.

The Company's operating
results could be negatively impacted by future changes in the allocation of
income to each of the income tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates.

The Company operates in
multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States.  Accordingly, management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each
of these jurisdictions.  Income tax audits associated with the allocation of
this income and other complex issues, including inventory transfer pricing and
cost sharing and product royalty arrangements, may require an extended period
of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the
income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different income tax
rates.  Because income tax adjustments in certain jurisdictions can be
significant, the Company's future operating results could be negatively
impacted by settlements of these matters.

The Company's operating
results could be negatively impacted by future product liability claims,
unfavorable court decisions, regulatory compliance or legal settlements.

The Company is a
defendant in various proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the
normal course of business, including product liability and other matters.  Such
matters are subject to many uncertainties, and outcomes are not predictable
with assurance.  To partially mitigate losses arising from unfavorable outcomes
in such matters, the Company purchases third-party insurance coverage subject
to certain deductibles and loss limitations.  While the Company believes its
current insurance coverage is adequate to mitigate losses arising from such
matters, its future operating results may be unfavorably impacted by any settlement
payments or losses beyond the amounts of insurance carried.  Likewise, the
Company may incur significant legal expenses regardless of whether it is found
to be liable.  In addition, such product liability matters may negatively
impact the Company's ability to obtain cost-effective third-party insurance
coverage in future periods.

In
2008 the Company and certain current and former employees received subpoenas
from the U.S. Department of Justice Office, Criminal Division, of the United
States Attorney in Massachusetts requesting documents related to (i) false
Institutional Review Board approvals; (ii) the amount of sales of OP-1 under
one of the Company's Humanitarian Device Exemptions; and (iii) the off-label
promotion of Calstrux in combination with OP-1.  The Company is in the
process of responding to the U.S. Department of Justice regarding this matter.

- 22

In 2008
the Company received a warning letter from the FDA related to quality systems and compliance issues at its
OP-1 implant manufacturing facility in Hopkinton, Massachusetts.  In
2007 the Company received two warning letters from the FDA regarding compliance
with certain quality system specifications at its reconstructive implant
manufacturing facilities: one letter for its facility in Cork, Ireland and another for its facility in Mahwah, New Jersey.  The Company takes these matters very
seriously and has been fully cooperating with the FDA to address their
observations.

In
2007 the Company announced that it reached a resolution with the U.S. Attorney's
office for the District of New Jersey in connection with a previously announced
investigation relating to "any and all consulting contracts, professional
service agreements, or remuneration agreements between Stryker Corporation and
any orthopedic surgeon, orthopedic surgeon in training, or medical school
graduate using or considering the surgical use of hip or knee joint
replacement/reconstruction products manufactured or sold by Stryker
Corporation."  The resolution is in the form of a non-prosecution
agreement for an 18-month period ending on March 27, 2009.  During the
term of the agreement, the Company's Orthopaedics subsidiary is subject to
oversight by a federal monitor, as appointed by the U.S. Attorney, regarding
compliance with certain standards and procedures in connection with the
retention and payment of orthopaedic surgeon consultants related to
reconstructive products and the provision of certain benefits to such surgeons.
 Subsequent to entering into the non-prosecution agreement, the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (HHS)
issued a civil subpoena to the Company in seeking to determine whether the
Company violated various laws by paying consulting fees and providing other
things of value to orthopedic surgeons and healthcare and educational
institutions as inducements to use Stryker's orthopedic medical devices in
procedures paid for in whole or in part by Medicare.  The Company produced
numerous documents and other materials to HHS in response to the subpoena and
had been working with HHS to attempt to narrow the scope of the requested
production.  In 2008 the U.S. Department of Justice and the HHS sought
judicial enforcement of the subpoena and a court agreed to enforce it in
January 2009.  At the same time, the U.S. District Court for the District
of New Jersey dismissed the Company's complaint which had asked the court to
quash the subpoena and sought other appropriate relief on the grounds that the
subpoena was overbroad and oppressive.

In 2007 the Company disclosed that
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission made an informal inquiry of the
Company regarding possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in
connection with the sale of medical devices in certain foreign countries.
Subsequently, in 2008, the Company received a subpoena from the U.S. Department
of Justice, Criminal Division, requesting certain documents for the period
since January 1, 2000 in connection with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission inquiry.  The Company is fully cooperating with the U.S. Department
of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regarding these
matters.

As a
result of these investigations, the Company's future operating results could be
negatively impacted by the resolution of these matters.

The Company's operating
results could be negatively impacted by economic, political or other
developments in countries in which the Company does business.

The
Company distributes its products throughout the world.  As a result, the
Company's future operating results could be negatively impacted by unstable
economic, political and social conditions, including but not limited to
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, political instability, or
changes in the interpretation or creation of laws and regulations in each of
the countries where the Company conducts business, including the United States.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

The
Company is involved in various proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in
the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor
and intellectual property, and other matters that are more fully described in "Note
15 - Contingencies" on pages 69 through 70 of this report.  The potential
future outcomes of these matters are outside of management's control and will
generally not be known for prolonged periods of time.  In certain of the legal
proceedings, the claimants seek damages, as well as other compensatory relief,
which could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements.  In
legal matters for which management has sufficient information to reasonably
estimate the Company's future obligations, a liability representing
management's best estimate of the probable cost for the resolution of these
legal matters is recorded.  The estimates are based on consultation with legal
counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies.  The Company
does not anticipate material losses as a result of these proceedings beyond
amounts already provided in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

Throughout this discussion, references are made
to the following financial measures:  "constant currency," "adjusted net
earnings from continuing operations," "adjusted basic net earnings per share
from continuing operations" and "adjusted diluted net earnings per share from
continuing operations."  These financial measures are an alternative
representation of Stryker Corporation's (the Company or Stryker) past and potential
future operational performance and do not replace the presentation of the
Company's reported financial results under U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP). The Company has provided these supplemental non-GAAP
financial measures because they provide meaningful information regarding the
Company's results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods
presented.  Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the
operating results of its business segments, for analyzing potential future
business trends in connection with its budget process and bases certain annual
bonus plans on these non-GAAP financial measures.  In order to measure the
Company's sales performance on a constant currency basis, it is necessary to remove
the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which affects the
comparability and trend of sales.  Constant currency results are calculated by
translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency
exchange rates.  In order to measure earnings performance on a consistent and
comparable basis, the Company excludes the restructuring charges recorded in
2008, the intangible asset impairment charge recorded in 2007 and the purchased
in-process research and development charge recorded in 2006, each of which

Executive Level Overview

Stryker
is one of the world's leading medical technology companies with the most
broadly based range of products in orthopaedics and a significant presence in
other medical specialties.  Stryker works with respected medical professionals
to help people lead more active and more satisfying lives.  The Company's
products include implants used in joint replacement, trauma,
craniomaxillofacial and spinal surgeries; biologics; surgical, neurologic, ear,
nose & throat and interventional pain equipment; endoscopic, surgical
navigation, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient
handling and emergency medical equipment.

Domestic
sales accounted for 64% of total revenues in 2008.  Most of the Company's
products are marketed directly to doctors, hospitals and other healthcare
facilities by approximately 3,900 sales and marketing personnel in the United States.  Stryker primarily maintains separate and dedicated sales forces for each of
its principal product lines to provide focus and a high level of expertise to
each medical specialty served.

International
sales accounted for 36% of total revenues in 2008.  The Company's products are
sold in more than 100 countries through Company-owned sales subsidiaries and
branches as well as third-party dealers and distributors.

The
Company's business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of
orthopaedic implant surgeries is lower during the summer months.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, the general
economic slowdown in the United States resulted in a significant and rapid
contraction in hospital capital budgets that depressed demand for certain
MedSurg Equipment products.  The unprecedented weakening of the economy caused
the Company's hospital customers to reduce capital purchases to a degree not
previously experienced in prior recessionary periods.

During 2008 the Company repurchased 17.4 million
shares of common stock in the open market at a cost of $1,000.0 million
pursuant to the repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of
Directors.  Shares repurchased under the share repurchase programs are
available for general corporate purposes, including offsetting dilution
associated with stock option and other equity-based employee benefit plans.

In
2008 the Company decided to simplify the structure of its Japanese distribution
business and to substantially reduce development efforts associated with the
product technologies acquired from Sightline Technologies Ltd. (Sightline).  In 2006 the
Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Sightline, a private,
development-stage company, for an upfront payment of $50.0 million in cash plus
certain transaction costs and the assumption of certain liabilities.  Terms of
the transaction also included milestone payments of up to an additional $90.0
million upon the achievement of certain operational and financial targets
related to Sightline's products.  Unanticipated
issues have arisen that continue to delay the regulatory approval and
commercialization efforts of new products associated with the product
technologies acquired in the Sightline acquisition.   However, the Company
believes that the technologies acquired in the Sightline acquisition may
result in the introduction of new products and additional sales in future
periods.  Additional details, including the financial statement
impact resulting from these restructurings and the acquisition of Sightline,
are included in

Results of Operations.

In 2008 the Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting
Standard Board (FASB) Statement
No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements,

for financial assets and liabilities
measured on a recurring basis. This Statement applies to all financial assets
and financial liabilities that are being measured and reported on a fair value
basis, establishes a framework for measuring fair value of assets and
liabilities and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  There was
no impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of the adoption
of this Statement.  The additional
disclosure requirements regarding fair value measurements are included in Note 2
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In 2008 the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Statement No. 159,

The Fair Value
Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.

This Statement
allows companies the option to measure eligible financial instruments at fair
value. Such election, which may be applied on an instrument by instrument
basis, is typically irrevocable once elected.  The Company has elected to apply
the fair value option to its Auction Rate Securities Rights agreement, as more
fully described in

In 2007 the Company sold its outpatient physical therapy business,
Physiotherapy Associates, for $150.0 million in cash less certain indebtedness. 
Physiotherapy Associates' operating results are reported as discontinued
operations for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.  Additional details,
including the financial statement impact resulting from this divestiture, are
included in

.

In 2007 the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation
No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

.  This Interpretation clarifies the accounting for
income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold an income tax
position is required to meet before being recognized in the Company's
Consolidated Financial Statements.  The Interpretation also provides guidance
for the measurement and classification of income tax positions, interest and
penalties, and requires additional disclosure on an annual basis.  Additional details, including the financial statement
impact resulting from this adoption, are included in

Outlook for 2009

The
Company continues to face depressed demand for certain MedSurg Equipment
products due to the general economic slowdown.  In addition, the Company
anticipates that a slowdown in elective procedures for certain of its
Orthopaedic Implants products may occur.  The Company projects that diluted
net earnings per share for 2009 will be in the range of $3.12 to $3.22, an
increase of 10% to 14% over adjusted diluted net earnings per share from
continuing operations of $2.83 in 2008. The financial forecast for 2009
anticipates a constant currency net sales increase in the range of 6% to 9%. 
If foreign currency exchange rates hold near January 31, 2009 levels, the
Company anticipates an unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately 4.0% to
4.5% in the first quarter of 2009 and an unfavorable impact on net sales of
approximately 3.5% to 4.5% for the full year of 2009.

2008 Compared with 2007

The Company's net sales increased
12% in 2008 to $6,718.2 million from $6,000.5 million in 2007.  Net sales grew by 11% as a result of increased unit
volume and changes in product mix and by 1% due to favorable changes in foreign
currency exchange rates.

The Company's domestic sales were $4,282.2 million for
2008, representing an increase of 11%, as a result of higher shipments of
Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. International sales were $2,436.0
million for 2008, representing an increase of 13%. The impact of foreign currency
comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $84.7 million for 2008. On a constant currency basis,
international sales increased 9% in 2008 as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and
MedSurg Equipment.

- 31 -

Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic
Implants were $3,967.5 million for 2008, representing an increase of 11%. On a
constant currency basis, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 9% in 2008 as
a result of higher shipments of reconstructive, trauma, spinal and
craniomaxillofacial implant systems and bone cement.

Hip
Implant Systems:

Sales of hip
implant systems increased 3% in 2008 (1% on a constant currency basis). In the United States, sales growth was driven by increased sales of the Cormet Hip Resurfacing product
and sales growth in X3 Polyethylene and Accolade cementless hip products,
partially offset by declines in other hip systems.

Sales growth in
several hip systems, including Accolade, X3 Polyethylene and ABG II, in Europe
and Secur-Fit in Japan and the Pacific region also contributed to the Company's
constant currency sales growth in 2008.

Knee
Implant Systems:

Sales of knee
implant systems increased 14% in 2008 (13% on a constant currency basis) due to
strong sales growth in the Triathlon Knee System in the United States, Europe,
Canada and the Pacific region and solid sales growth in the Scorpio Knee System
in Japan and the Latin America region.

Trauma
Implant Systems:

Sales of trauma
implant systems increased 18% in 2008 (14% on a constant currency basis) as a
result of strong worldwide sales growth in the Gamma3 Hip Fracture System and
the SPS Calcaneal Foot Plating System and strong sales growth in the Company's
T2 Nailing System in the United States, Canada and the Pacific region.  Strong
sales growth in the HydroSet injectable bone substitute product in the United States and the Pacific region also contributed to the Company's constant currency
sales growth in 2008.

Spinal
Implant Systems:

Sales of spinal
implant systems increased 19% in 2008 (18% on a constant currency basis).  The
increase was driven by strong worldwide sales growth of thoracolumbar implant
systems, interbody devices and cervical implants.

Craniomaxillofacial
Implant Systems:

Sales of craniomaxillofacial
implant systems increased 16% in 2008 (15% on a constant currency basis)
primarily due to strong sales growth of products for neurological indications
and craniomaxillofacial implants and the HydroSet injectable bone substitute
product in the United States and the Pacific region.

Worldwide
sales of MedSurg Equipment were $2,750.7 million for 2008, representing an
increase of 14%. On a constant currency basis, sales of MedSurg Equipment
increased 13% in 2008 as a result of higher shipments of surgical equipment and
surgical navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging
systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment.

Surgical
Equipment and Surgical Navigation Systems:

Sales of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems increased
17% in  2008 (15% on a constant currency basis) due to strong worldwide sales
growth in powered surgical and operating room equipment as well as solid sales
growth in interventional pain products in the United States and the Pacific
region.

Endoscopic, Communications and Digital Imaging Systems:

Sales
of endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems increased 9% in 2008
(8% on a constant currency basis) as a result of strong worldwide sales growth
in arthroscopy and general surgery as well as strong international sales growth
of medical video imaging equipment, led by the 1188 HD camera and complimentary
products, partially offset by lower sales of medical video imaging equipment in
the United States. Strong sales growth in communication products, led by the SwitchPoint
Infinity 2, in the United States and Canada also contributed to the Company's
constant currency sales growth.

Patient Handling and Emergency Medical Equipment:

Sales of
patient handling and emergency medical equipment increased 18% in 2008 (17% on
a constant currency basis) due to strong sales growth of hospital bed products
in the United States and the Latin America region and stretchers and emergency
medical equipment in the United States and Europe.

- - 32 -

Cost of sales represented 31.7% of sales in 2008 compared
with 31.1% in 2007.  The increase in the cost of sales percentage is primarily due to
increased compliance initiative spending and higher commodity and freight
costs.

Research, development and
engineering expenses represented 5.5% of sales in 2008 compared with 6.3% in
2007. As anticipated, the spending level in 2008 decreased by 2%
to $367.8 million as the Company implemented a more normalized level of
spending for these costs compared to prior periods as well as the Company's
focus of research and development resources on compliance initiatives, which
has slowed down some research and development projects and reduced outside
contractor spending on certain projects.  New product introductions in 2008
for the Orthopaedic Implants segment included the Tritanium Primary Hip System;
the Triathlon TS Revision Knee System; the Triathlon Partial Knee Resurfacing
System; the Asnis Screw System; the VariAx Hand and Foot Trauma Systems; and
the Xia III Thoracolumbar Spinal System.  Within
the MedSurg Equipment segment, new product introductions in 2008 included the S3
Med/Surg Hospital Bed and the Neptune 2 Waste Management System.

Selling, general and administrative expenses
increased 10% in 2008 and represented 39.1% of sales compared with 39.9% in
2007. The decrease in
selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2008 is
due to tight control of discretionary spending in the second half of 2008
partially offset by increases in sales-related costs and costs associated with
compliance activities.

In  2008 the Company recorded 
$34.9 million ($21.7 million net of income taxes) in restructuring charges
related to the decisions to simplify the structure of the Company's Japanese
distribution business and to substantially reduce development efforts
associated with Sightline product technologies acquired in 2006. In 2007 the
Company recorded a $19.8 million charge ($12.7 million net of income taxes) to
write off patents associated with intervertebral body fusion cage products. 
The impairment followed a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) decision to
downgrade certain intervertebral body fusion products to class II devices,
along with a weak market for sales of these specific products.  As a result,
the Company performed a discounted cash flow analysis over the remaining life
of the patented technologies and determined that the charge was required.

Interest
and marketable securities income, which is included in other income (expense),
increased to $97.7 million in 2008 from $85.5 million in 2007 primarily as a
result of increased average cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities
balances in 2008 compared to 2007. Interest expense, which is included
in other income (expense), increased to $30.5 million in 2008 from $22.2
million in 2007, primarily as a result of interest expense associated with
unresolved income tax positions.

The Company's effective income tax rate on
earnings from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 was
27.4% compared to an effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31,
2007 of 28.0%. The
effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 reflects the impact of the restructuring charges of
$21.7 million (net of $13.2 million income tax benefits). The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31,
2007 reflects the
impact of the intangible asset impairment charge of $12.7 million (net of $7.1
million income tax benefit).  In addition to these factors, the Company's reported effective income
tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily as a result of manufacturing in lower income tax
jurisdictions.

Net earnings from continuing operations
increased 16% in 2008
to $1,147.8 million
from $986.7 million in 2007.  Basic net earnings per share
from continuing operations increased 17% in 2008 to $2.81 from $2.41 in 2007,
and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 17% in
2008 to $2.78 from $2.37 in 2007.

Excluding
the impact of the restructuring charges recorded in 2008 and the charge to
reflect the intangible asset impairment in 2007, adjusted net earnings from
continuing operations increased 17% in 2008 to $1,169.5 million from $999.4
million in 2007.  Adjusted basic net earnings per share from continuing
operations increased 18% in 2008 to $2.87 from $2.44 in 2007, and adjusted
diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 18% in 2008
to $2.83 from $2.40 in 2007.

2007 Compared with 2006

The Company's net sales increased
17% in 2007 to $6,000.5 million from $5,147.2 million in 2006.  Net sales grew by 14% as a result of increased unit
volume and changes in product mix and by 3% due to favorable changes in foreign
currency exchange rates.

The Company's domestic sales were $3,850.3 million for
2007, representing an increase of 17% as a result of higher shipments of
Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  International sales were $2,150.2
million for 2007, representing an increase of 16%.  The impact of foreign currency
comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $131.5 million for 2007.  On a constant currency basis,
international sales increased 9% in 2007 as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and
MedSurg Equipment.

Worldwide
sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $3,587.3 million for 2007, representing an
increase of 15%.  On a constant currency basis, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased
12% in 2007 as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive, trauma, spinal
and craniomaxillofacial implant systems; bone cement; and the bone growth
factor OP-1.

- 34 -

Hip
Implant Systems:

Sales of hip
implant systems increased 9% in 2007 (6% on a constant currency basis). In the United States, sales growth was driven by sales of X3 polyethylene and Accolade cementless
hip products, partially offset by declines in other hip systems.

Solid
sales growth in the Exeter, Trident, X3 polyethylene and Accolade hip products
in Europe, the Pacific region and the Latin America region also contributed to
the Company's constant currency sales growth for 2007.

Knee
Implant Systems:

Sales of knee
implant systems increased 16% in 2007 (13% on a constant currency basis) due to
strong sales growth in the Triathlon Knee System in the United States, Europe,
Canada and the Pacific region and solid sales growth in the Scorpio Knee System
in Europe, the Pacific region and the Latin America region.

Trauma
Implant Systems:

Sales of trauma
implant systems increased 19% in 2007 (15% on a constant currency basis) as a
result of strong sales growth in the Gamma3 Hip Fracture System in the United
States, Europe, Canada and the Pacific region as well as solid sales growth in
the Company's T2 Nailing System in the United States and Europe, partially
offset by a sales decline in Japan as a result of government-imposed price
cuts.

Spinal
Implant Systems:

Sales of spinal
implant systems increased 25% in 2007 (23% on a constant currency basis).  The
increase was driven by strong worldwide sales growth of thoracolumbar implant
systems, interbody devices and cervical implants.

Craniomaxillofacial
Implant Systems:

Sales of
craniomaxillofacial implant systems increased 17% in 2007 (14% on a constant
currency basis) primarily due to strong sales growth of products for
neurological indications and craniomaxillofacial implants in the United States, Europe and the Pacific region.

Worldwide
sales of MedSurg Equipment were $2,413.2 million for 2007, representing an
increase of 19%.  On a constant currency basis, sales of MedSurg Equipment
increased 17% in 2007 as a result of higher shipments of surgical equipment;
surgical navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging
systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment.

Surgical
Equipment and Surgical Navigation Systems:

Sales of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems increased
20% in 2007 (17% on a constant currency basis) due to strong sales growth in
powered surgical and operating room equipment in the United States, Europe and
the Pacific region.  Solid sales growth in interventional pain products in Europe also contributed to the Company's constant currency sales growth.

Endoscopic, Communications and Digital Imaging Systems:

Sales
of endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems increased 21% in 2007
(19% on a constant currency basis) as a result of strong worldwide sales growth
of medical video imaging equipment led by the 1188 HD Camera and complementary
products such as the X8000 Lightsource and Vision Elect Monitor.  Strong sales
growth in arthroscopy and communication products in the United States, Europe and the Pacific region also contributed to the Company's constant currency
sales growth.

Patient Handling and Emergency Medical Equipment:

Sales of
patient handling and emergency medical equipment increased 16% in 2007 (15% on
a constant currency basis) due to strong sales growth of stretchers and
emergency medical equipment in the United States and Europe.  In addition,
constant currency sales growth was aided by strong sales growth in hospital
beds in the United States as well as strong sales growth in maternity beds in
the United States, Canada, Europe and the Latin America region.

Cost of sales represented 31.1% of sales in 2007 compared
with 31.4% in 2006.  The cost of sales percentage in 2007 was favorably
impacted by efficiencies gained within manufacturing plants and product
distribution channels.

- - 35 -

Research, development and
engineering expenses represented 6.3% of sales for both 2007 and 2006. These expenses increased 16% in 2007 to $375.3 million.  The higher
spending level was the result of the Company's continued focus on new product
development for anticipated future product launches and continued investments
in new technologies.  New product introductions in 2007 for the Orthopaedic
Implants segment included the condylar stabilizing (CS) ultra-congruent insert
for the Triathlon Knee System; the Scorpio NRG with X3 advanced bearing
technology; and the Omega3 Compression Hip Screw System.  Within the MedSurg Equipment segment, new product
introductions in 2007 included InTouch, a high-acuity care bed; the SDC Ultra,
an all-in-one medical imaging information management system; the CORE Sumex
drill, designed for use in ENT procedures; and the 45L PneumoSure insufflator.

Selling, general and administrative expenses
increased 17% in 2007 and represented 39.9% of sales compared with 39.8% in
2006.  The slight increase
in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2007 was
due to higher sales-related costs, primarily compensation and increased
regulatory compliance-related costs, partially offset by decreases in insurance
costs and slower growth in discretionary spending.

As previously described, in 2007
the Company recorded a $19.8 million charge ($12.7 million net of income taxes)
to write off patents associated with intervertebral body fusion cage products.

The
purchased in-process research and development charge of $52.7 million recorded
in 2006 related to the acquisition of Sightline.  At the date of the
acquisition, the flexible endoscope technologies acquired had not yet reached
technological feasibility.  The upfront payment of $50.0 million, plus certain
transaction costs and the assumption of certain liabilities, was allocated to
assets acquired, purchased in-process research and development and liabilities
assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition.  The amount written off as purchased in-process
research and development was not deductible for income tax purposes in the United States.

Interest
and marketable securities income, which is included in other income (expense),
increased to $85.5 million in 2007 from $41.4 million in 2006 primarily as a
result of increased cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities
balances in 2007 compared to 2006. Interest expense, which is included
in other income (expense), increased to $22.2 million in 2007 from $9.5 million
in 2006, primarily as a result of interest expense associated with unresolved
income tax positions.

The Company's effective income tax rate on
earnings from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 was
28.0% compared to an effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31,
2006 of 29.5%. The
effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflects the impact of the intangible asset
impairment charge of $12.7 million (net of $7.1 million income tax benefit). 
The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflects the
impact of the nondeductibility for income tax purposes of the purchased
in-process research and development charge associated with the acquisition of
Sightline. In addition
to these factors, the Company's reported effective income tax rates for the
years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily as a result of manufacturing in lower income tax
jurisdictions.

Upon adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 48, the Company
recognized an increase in the interest expense accrual associated with
unresolved income tax positions, which was accounted for by reducing the
January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings by $7.6 million (net of income
taxes).  In addition, the Company reclassified $179.2 million from the
current income taxes liability to noncurrent liabilities to match the
anticipated timing of future income tax payments.

Net earnings from continuing
operations increased
28% in 2007 to $986.7
million from $771.4 million in 2006. 
Basic net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 27% in 2007
to $2.41 from $1.90 in 2006, and diluted net earnings per share from continuing
operations increased 27% in 2007 to $2.37 from $1.87 in 2006.

- - 36 -

Excluding
the impact of the charges to reflect the intangible asset impairment in 2007
and to write off purchased in-process research and development recorded in
2006, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased 21% in 2007 to
$999.4 million from $824.1 million in 2006.  Adjusted basic net earnings per
share from continuing operations increased 20% in 2007 to $2.44 from $2.03 in
2006, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations
increased 20% in 2007 to $2.40 from $2.00 in 2006.

The sale of Physiotherapy Associates resulted in a gain on
sale of discontinued operations of $25.7 million (net of income taxes), or
$0.06 per diluted share in 2007. Net earnings from discontinued operations for
the year ended December 31, 2007 were $5.0 million, or $0.01 per diluted share
and net earnings from discontinued operations were $6.3 million, or $0.02 per
diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Net
earnings increased 31% in 2007 to $1,017.4 million from $777.7 million in 2006.
Basic net earnings per share increased 30% in 2007 to $2.48 from $1.91 in 2006,
and diluted net earnings per share increased 29% in 2007 to $2.44 from $1.89 in
2006.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company's
working capital at December 31, 2008 decreased $54.7 million to $3,517.2
million from $3,571.9 million at December 31, 2007. The decrease in working
capital resulted from the use of cash to complete the $1,000.0 million share
repurchase programs partially offset by increases in accounts receivable,
inventories and prepaid expenses. The decrease in working capital is also due to the reclassification of certain marketable
securities from current assets to non-current assets within the Consolidated
Balance Sheet at December 31, 2008, as more fully described below.  Accounts
receivable days sales outstanding was 59 days at December 31, 2008 and 56 days
at December 31, 2007.   Days sales in inventory increased by 18 days to 155
days at December 31, 2008 from 137 days at December 31, 2007 in support of recent
and future anticipated product launches.

- 37 -

The Company
generated cash of $1,175.9 million from operations in 2008 compared with
$1,028.3 million in 2007.  The increase in cash from operations in 2008 is
primarily due to increased earnings partially offset by increased inventory
levels.

In 2008 the Company used
cash of $155.2 million for capital expenditures, including $33.2 million for
facility expansions. In addition, the Company used cash of $135.6 million for the payment of dividends and
$1,000.0 million of cash to repurchase 17.4 million shares of common stock.  The Company also purchased and sold marketable
securities, which are classified as available-for-sale investments in
accordance with the provisions of FASB Statement No. 115,

Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,

and related
interpretations.

The Company had
$701.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1,494.5 million in current
marketable securities at December 31, 2008.  The Company had outstanding borrowings
totaling $20.5 million at that date, all of which were classified as current
obligations.  The Company believes its cash on hand and marketable securities,
as well as anticipated cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to fund
future operating capital requirements; future manufacturing facility
construction and other capital expenditures; future business and product line
acquisitions to supplement its current product offerings; loaner
instrumentation for surgical implants in support of new product launches;
required debt repayments and the payment of dividends.

Should additional
funds be required, the Company had $1,079.4 million of additional borrowing
capacity available under all of its existing credit facilities, including the
Company's $1,000.0 million 5-year nonamortizing, revolving Unsecured Credit
Facility that expires in November 2010.  In addition, the Company had the
entire $100.0 million accounts receivable securitization facility available at
December 31, 2008.

The
Company's additional borrowing capacity, along with the expected expiration
period of the commitments, is summarized as follows (in millions):

The Company reviews declines in the fair value of its
investments classified as available-for-sale for impairment in accordance with
SFAS No. 115 in order to determine whether the decline in fair value is an
other-than-temporary impairment.  Other-than-temporary impairments of
available-for-sale marketable securities are recorded in earnings.  The primary
factors considered by the Company to recognize declines in the fair value of
its investments as other-than-temporary impairments are the intent and ability
of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time
sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, the length of
time and the extent to which the market value of the investment has been less
than cost and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer
based on publicly available financial information.

Beginning in February 2008, liquidity issues in the global
credit markets resulted in the failure of auctions for all of the auction-rate
securities (ARS) investments held by the Company, as the amount of securities
submitted for sale in those auctions exceeded the amount of purchase bids.  To
date the Company has collected all interest receivable on outstanding ARS when
due and expects to continue to do so in the future.  Due to current market
conditions the ARS investments have continued to experience failed auctions.
These failed auctions result in a lack of liquidity in the securities but do
not affect the underlying collateral of the securities. The Company does not
anticipate that the lack of liquidity in its ARS, even for an extended period
of time, will affect its ability to finance its operations, including its
expansion programs and planned capital expenditures. The Company continues to
monitor efforts by the financial markets to find alternative means for
restoring the liquidity of these investments. These investments will be
classified as non-current assets until liquidity is restored in the market.

- - 38 -

As of December 31, 2008, the Company held $166.8
million, at par value, of ARS investments.  In 2008
the Company entered into an ARS Rights agreement (Rights) with UBS Financial
Services Inc. (UBS), one of its investment providers, whereby the Company
received the right to sell its ARS at par value to UBS at any time during the
period June 30, 2010 through July 2, 2012.  These Rights are
nontransferable securities registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission.  As a result of accepting the Rights, the Company has released
UBS and its employees/agents from all claims except claims for consequential
damages directly or indirectly relating to UBS's marketing and sale of ARS and
agreed not to serve as a class representative or receive benefits under any
class action settlement or investor fund.

The Company elected to measure the value of the Rights
under the fair value option of FASB Statement No. 159, and recorded a gain of
$28.0 million in other income (expense), and a corresponding non-current
asset.  Simultaneously, the Company transferred its ARS investments, at their
fair value of $138.8 million, from available-for-sale to trading marketable
securities. As a result of this transfer, the Company recognized a loss of
$28.0 million in other income (expense), reflecting a reversal of the related
temporary valuation allowance that was previously recorded within accumulated
other comprehensive gain (loss) in shareholders' equity. The Company anticipates
that any future changes in the fair value of the Rights will be offset by the
changes in the fair value of the related ARS, both of which will be adjusted to
their estimated fair value on an ongoing basis.

The Company's
future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than 1
year, including agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of
business, are summarized as follows (in millions):

As
further described in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of
December 31, 2008, the Company's defined benefit pension plans are in an
underfunded status of $101.6 million. Due to the rules affecting tax-deductible
contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are offered and the
impact of future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and the potential
for changes in legislation in the United States and other foreign
jurisdictions, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the future
periods, beyond 2009, in which contributions to fund defined benefit pension
plans will be made.  As further described in Note 12 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a
liability for unresolved income tax positions of $277.1 million. Due to
uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits, the
Company is not able to reasonably estimate the amount or the future periods in
which income tax payments to settle these unresolved income tax positions will
be made.

Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates

The preparation
of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements and accompanying notes.  Management evaluates these estimates and
assumptions on an ongoing basis. Estimates are based on historical experience,
when available, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are
not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

- 39 -

Management
believes that, of its significant accounting policies (see Note 1 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements), an understanding of the following critical
accounting policies is important in obtaining an overall understanding of the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The
Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in
the collection of accounts receivable.  The Company makes estimates regarding
the future ability of its customers to make required payments based on
historical credit experience and expected future trends.  If actual customer financial
conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional accounts
receivable write offs may be necessary, which could unfavorably affect future
operating results.

Inventory Reserves

The
Company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the
potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current
carrying costs.  The markets in which the Company operates are highly
competitive and new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing
basis.  Such marketplace changes may cause some of the Company's products to
become obsolete.  The Company makes estimates regarding the future
recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for
excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience, expiration of
sterilization dates and expected future trends.  If actual product life cycles,
product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable
than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required,
which could unfavorably affect future operating results.

Income Taxes

The Company operates in multiple income tax jurisdictions both
inside and outside the United States.  Accordingly, management must determine
the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions.  Income
tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex
issues, including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing and product
royalty arrangements, may require an extended period of time to resolve and may
result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are
required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates.  Because income
tax adjustments in certain jurisdictions can be significant, the Company
records accruals representing management's best estimate of the probable
resolution of these matters.  To the extent additional information becomes
available, such accruals are adjusted to reflect the revised estimated probable
outcome.

Other Matters

The Company
distributes its products throughout the world.  As a result, the Company's
financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as weak
economic conditions or changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  The
Company's operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates
among the U.S. dollar, European currencies, in particular the euro and the
British pound, the Japanese yen, the Australian dollar and the Canadian
dollar.  When the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the dollar
value of sales denominated in foreign currencies increases.  When the U.S.
dollar strengthens, the opposite situation occurs. The Company manufactures its
products in the United States, France, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, Canada and Puerto Rico and incurs the costs to manufacture in the applicable local
currencies.  This worldwide deployment of factories serves to partially
mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the Company's cost of
sales.

The Company enters into forward currency exchange
contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions
denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting risk to the Company
that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates.  These nonfunctional
currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables
arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products.  The periods of
the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the
exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the
measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the

- 40 -

nonfunctional
currencies.  All forward currency exchange
contracts are recorded at their fair value each period, with resulting gains
(losses) included in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of
Earnings.

At
December 31, 2008, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange
contracts to purchase $412.5 million and sell $288.4 million of various
currencies (principally U.S. dollars and euros) with maturities ranging from 2 to 110 days. 
At December 31, 2007, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange
contracts to purchase $427.9 million and sell $257.7 million of various
currencies (principally U.S. dollars and euros) with maturities ranging from 4
to 101 days.  The estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts
represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end spot rates as adjusted
by current forward points.  A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currencies
relative to the U.S. dollar would change the December 31, 2008 fair value by
approximately $20.7 million.  The Company is exposed to credit loss in the
event of nonperformance by counterparties on its outstanding forward currency
exchange contracts but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the
counterparties.

The Company has certain investments in net assets in
international locations that are not hedged.  These investments are subject to
translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
For the year ended December 31, 2008, the weakening of foreign currencies
relative to the U.S. dollar decreased the value of these investments in net
assets, and the related foreign currency translation adjustment gain in
shareholders' equity, by $68.6 million to $203.7 million from $272.3 million at
December 31, 2007.

The
Company is partially self-insured for product liability claims and utilizes a
wholly owned captive insurance company in the United States to manage its
self-insured retention limits.  The captive insurance company provides
insurance reserves for estimated liabilities for product claims incurred but
not reported based on actuarially determined liabilities.  The actuarial
valuations are based on historical information along with certain assumptions
about future events.

In
2008 the Company and certain current and former employees received subpoenas
from the U.S. Department of Justice Office, Criminal Division, of the United
States Attorney in Massachusetts requesting documents related to (i) false
Institutional Review Board approvals; (ii) the amount of sales of OP-1 under
one of the Company's Humanitarian Device Exemptions; and (iii) the off-label
promotion of Calstrux in combination with OP-1.  The Company is in the
process of responding to the U.S. Department of Justice regarding this matter.

In 2008 the Company
received a warning letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) related to quality systems and compliance
issues at its OP-1 implant manufacturing facility in Hopkinton, Massachusetts.  In 2007 the Company received two warning letters from the FDA
regarding compliance with certain quality system specifications at its
reconstructive implant manufacturing facilities: one letter for its facility in
 Cork, Ireland and another for its facility in Mahwah, New Jersey.  The Company
takes these matters very seriously and has been fully cooperating with the FDA
to address their observations.

In
2007 the Company announced that it reached a resolution with the U.S.
Attorney's office for the District of New Jersey in connection with a
previously announced investigation relating to "any and all consulting
contracts, professional service agreements, or remuneration agreements between
Stryker Corporation and any orthopedic surgeon, orthopedic surgeon in training,
or medical school graduate using or considering the surgical use of hip or knee
joint replacement/reconstruction products manufactured or sold by Stryker
Corporation."  The resolution is in the form of a non-prosecution
agreement for an 18-month period ending on March 27, 2009.  During the
term of the agreement, the Company's Orthopaedics subsidiary is subject to
oversight by a federal monitor, as appointed by the U.S. Attorney, regarding compliance
with certain standards and procedures in connection with the retention and
payment of orthopaedic surgeon consultants related to reconstructive products
and the provision of certain benefits to such surgeons.  Subsequent to
entering into the non-prosecution agreement, the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services, Office of Inspector General (HHS) issued a civil subpoena to
the Company in seeking to determine whether the Company violated various laws
by paying consulting fees and providing other things of value to orthopedic
surgeons and healthcare and educational institutions as inducements to use
Stryker's orthopedic medical devices in procedures paid for in whole or in part
by Medicare.  The Company produced numerous documents and other materials
to HHS in response to the subpoena and had been working with HHS to attempt to
narrow the scope of the requested production.  In 2008

- 41 -

the U.S. Department
of Justice and HHS sought judicial enforcement of the subpoena and a court
agreed to enforce it in January 2009.  At the same time, the U.S. District
Court for the District of New Jersey dismissed the Company's complaint which
had asked the court to quash the subpoena and sought other appropriate relief
on the grounds that the subpoena was overbroad and oppressive.

In 2007 the Company disclosed that
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission made an informal inquiry of the
Company regarding possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in
connection with the sale of medical devices in certain foreign countries.
Subsequently, in 2008, the Company received a subpoena from the U.S. Department
of Justice, Criminal Division, requesting certain documents for the period
since January 1, 2000 in connection with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
inquiry.  The Company is fully cooperating with the U.S. Department of Justice
and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regarding these matters.

In 2006 the Company announced that it received
a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, requesting
documents for the period since January 2001 regarding possible violations of
federal criminal law, including possible violation of the antitrust laws,
relating to the manufacture and sale of orthopaedic implant devices.  In 2008
the Company was advised by the U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division,
that the Department had closed its grand jury investigation of antitrust and
related offenses in the orthopaedic implants industry.

FINANCIAL
  STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Board of Directors and
Shareholders of Stryker Corporation

:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Stryker
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008.  Our audits also
included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a).  These
financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Stryker Corporation
and subsidiaries at December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the consolidated results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.  Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule,
when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As
discussed in Note 1, in 2007 Stryker Corporation changed its method of
accounting for unresolved tax positions in connection with the required
adoption of Financial Interpretation No. 48.

We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), Stryker Corporation's internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 12, 2009
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Stryker Corporation and Subsidiaries

December 31, 2008

NOTE 1

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Business

: Stryker Corporation (the Company or
Stryker) is one of the world's leading medical technology companies with the
most broadly based range of products in orthopaedics and a significant presence
in other medical specialties.  Stryker works with respected medical
professionals to help people lead more active and more satisfying lives.  The
Company's products include implants used in joint replacement, trauma,
craniomaxillofacial and spinal surgeries; biologics; surgical, neurologic, ear,
nose & throat and interventional pain equipment; endoscopic, surgical
navigation, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient
handling and emergency medical equipment.

Principles of
Consolidation

: The Consolidated
Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries
after elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions.

Use of Estimates

: The preparation of these Consolidated Financial
Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
(GAAP), requires Company management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and
accompanying notes.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

: A significant portion of the Company's Orthopaedic
Implants revenue is generated from consigned inventory maintained at hospitals
or with field representatives.  The Company retains title to all inventory held
on consignment at hospitals or with field locations until the Company receives
appropriate notification that the product has been used or implanted at which
time revenue is recognized. The Company records revenue from MedSurg Equipment
product sales when title and risk of ownership have been transferred to the
customer, which is typically upon shipment to the customer. The Company records
estimated sales returns, discounts and other applicable adjustments as a
reduction of net sales in the same period revenue is recognized.

Shipping and Handling of
Products

: Amounts billed to customers
for shipping and handling of products are included in net sales.  Costs
incurred related to shipping and handling of products are included in cost of
sales.

Foreign Currency
Translation

: The functional
currencies for substantially all of the Company's international affiliates are
their local currencies.  Accordingly, the financial statements of these
international affiliates are translated into U.S. dollars using current
exchange rates for balance sheets and average exchange rates for statements of
earnings and cash flows.  Unrealized translation adjustments are included in
accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) in shareholders' equity. 
Transaction gains and losses, such as those resulting from the settlement of
nonfunctional currency receivables or payables, are included in net earnings.

Financial Instruments

: The Company's financial instruments consist of cash,
cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, other
investments, accounts payable, debt and foreign currency exchange contracts.
The Company's estimates of fair value for financial instruments, other than
marketable securities, approximate their carrying amounts as of December 31,
2008 and 2007.

The Company
adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) Statement No. 157,

Fair Value
Measurements,

for financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring
basis on January 1, 2008. This Statement applies to all financial assets and
financial liabilities that are being measured and reported on a fair value
basis, establishes a framework for measuring fair value of assets and
liabilities and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  There was
no impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of the adoption
of this Statement.  The additional
disclosure requirements regarding fair value measurements are included in Note
2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

- 48 -

The Company
adopted the provisions of FASB
Statement No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities,

on January 1, 2008.  This Statement allows companies the
option to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value. Such election,
which may be applied on an instrument by instrument basis, is typically
irrevocable once elected.  The Company has elected to apply the fair value
option to its Auction Rate Securities (ARS) Rights agreement, as more fully
described in Note 2 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Cash
equivalents are highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or
less when purchased.  Marketable securities consist of marketable debt
securities and certificates of deposit and mutual funds.  Mutual funds  are
acquired to offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred
compensation arrangements and are expected to be used to settle these
liabilities.  Pursuant to the Company's investment policy, all individual
marketable security investments must have a minimum credit quality of single A
(per Standard & Poor's) or A2 (per Moody's Corporation) at the time of
acquisition, while the overall portfolio of marketable securities must maintain
a minimum average credit quality of double A (per Standard & Poor's) or Aa
(per Moody's Corporation).  In the event of a rating downgrade below the
minimum credit quality subsequent to purchase, the marketable security
investment is evaluated to determine the appropriate action to take to minimize
the overall risk to the Company's marketable security investment portfolio.  As
of December 31, 2008, approximately 1% of the Company's investments in
marketable securities had a credit quality rating of less than single A (per Standard
& Poor's).

The
Company follows the provisions of
FASB Statement No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities

, and related interpretations, in accounting for its
marketable securities, which are classified as available-for-sale and trading
securities. This Statement requires the
Company to recognize all marketable securities on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets at fair value.  The Company's marketable securities are stated at
fair value based on quoted market prices.  Adjustments to the fair value of
marketable securities that are classified as available-for-sale are recorded as
increases or decreases, net of income taxes, within accumulated other
comprehensive gain (loss) in shareholders' equity and adjustments to the fair value
of marketable securities that are classified as trading are recorded in
earnings.  The amortized cost of marketable debt securities is adjusted for
amortization of premiums and discounts to maturity computed under the effective
interest method. Such amortization is included in other income (expense) along
with interest and realized gains and losses.  The cost of securities sold is
determined by the specific identification method.

The Company reviews
declines in the fair value of its investments classified as available-for-sale
for impairment in accordance with Statement No. 115 in order to determine
whether the decline in fair value is an other-than-temporary impairment. 
Other-than-temporary impairments of available-for-sale marketable securities are
recorded in earnings.  The primary factors considered by the Company to
recognize declines in the fair value of its investments as other-than-temporary
impairments are the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment
in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated
recovery in market value, the length of time and the extent to which the market
value of the investment has been less than cost and the financial condition and
near-term prospects of the issuer based on publicly available financial
information.

The
Company follows the provisions of FASB Statement No. 133,

Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

, as amended by Statements No.
137 and No. 138, which requires the Company to recognize all derivatives on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The
Company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact
of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional
currencies, thereby limiting risk to the Company that would otherwise result
from changes in exchange rates.  These nonfunctional currency exposures
principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from
intercompany purchases of manufactured products.  The periods of the forward
currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed
transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and
recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies.  All forward currency exchange contracts are
recorded at their fair value each period, with resulting gains (losses)
included in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

- 49 -

Accounts Receivable

:  Accounts receivable consists of trade and other
miscellaneous receivables.  The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful
accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable.  The
Company makes estimates regarding the future ability of its customers to make
required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future
trends.  Accounts receivable are written off when all reasonable collection
efforts are exhausted.

Accounts Receivable
Securitization

: The Company has an
accounts receivable securitization facility pursuant to which certain subsidiaries
of the Company sell, on an ongoing basis, all of their domestic accounts
receivable to Stryker Funding Corporation (SFC), a wholly owned special-purpose
subsidiary of the Company, which in turn may sell, without recourse, up to an
aggregate of a $100.0 million undivided percentage ownership interest in such
receivables to bank-administered multiseller commercial paper conduits. 
Creditors of SFC have a claim to its assets before any equity becomes available
to the Company.

There
were no amounts of undivided percentage ownership interests in accounts
receivable sold by SFC under the facility as of December 31, 2008 and 2007. 
Accounts receivable sold would be reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet
as reductions of accounts receivable.

Inventories

: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or
market.  Cost for approximately 84% of inventories is determined using the
first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method.  Cost for certain domestic inventories
is determined using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) cost method.  The FIFO cost
for all inventories approximates replacement cost.

The
Company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the
potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current
carrying costs.  The markets in which the Company operates are highly
competitive, and new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an
ongoing basis.  Such marketplace changes may cause some of the Company's
products to become obsolete.  The Company makes estimates regarding the future
recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for
excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience, expiration of
sterilization dates and expected future trends.

Property, Plant and
Equipment

: Property, plant and
equipment is stated at cost.  Depreciation is computed by either the
straight-line or declining-balance method over the estimated useful lives of 3
to 30 years for buildings and improvements and 3 to 10 years for machinery and
equipment.

Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets:

Goodwill
represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of tangible net assets
of acquired businesses after amounts allocated to other intangible assets. 
Other intangible assets include developed technology, which is amortized on a
straight-line basis over 20 years, customer relationships (which reflect
expected continued customer patronage), trademarks and patents, which are
amortized on a straight-line basis over 4 to 40 years (weighted-average life of
15 years for other intangible assets).

Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets Impairment Tests:

FASB Statement No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

, requires companies to test
goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis.  The Company performs the
annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year using a discounted
cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made
regarding market conditions and the Company's future profitability.  The
Company also performs impairment tests of goodwill and other intangible and
long-lived assets during interim periods upon the occurrence of certain events
or changes in circumstance, as defined in FASB Statements No. 142 and No. 144,

Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

.

Loaner Instrumentation

: Loaner instrumentation represents the net book value
of loaner instruments for surgical implants provided to customers by the
Company.  Loaner instrumentation is amortized on a straight-line basis over a
3-year period.  Amortization expense for loaner instrumentation is included in
selling, general and administrative expenses.

Stock Options:

At
December 31, 2008,

the Company had key employee and director stock option
plans, which are described more fully in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.  The Company measures the cost of employee stock options based
on the grant-date fair value and recognizes that cost over the period during
which a recipient is required to provide services in exchange for the options,
typically the vesting period. The weighted-

- 50 -

average fair value per share of options granted during 2008,
2007 and 2006, estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model, was $19.87, $21.90 and $17.16, respectively.  The fair value of
options granted was estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions:




Risk-free interest rate

3.2%

4.8%

4.6%

Expected dividend yield

0.5%

0.5%

0.2%

Expected stock price volatility

22.7%

24.2%

24.8%

Expected option life

6.7 years

6.7 years

7.0 years

The risk-free
interest rate for periods within the expected life of options granted is based
on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.  Expected
stock price volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company's
stock.  The expected option life, representing the period of time that options
granted are expected to be outstanding, is based on historical option exercise
and employee termination data.  The Company recognizes the cost of stock
options using the straight-line method over their vesting periods.

Income Taxes

: The Company accounts for income taxes using the
liability method.  Under this method, deferred income tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and
income tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted
income tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected
to reverse.  Deferred income tax credit represents the change in net deferred
income tax assets and liabilities during the year.

The Company operates in multiple income tax jurisdictions both
inside and outside the United States, and income tax authorities in these
jurisdictions regularly perform audits of the Company's income tax filings. 
Accordingly, management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to
each of these jurisdictions based on current interpretations of complex income
tax regulations.  Income tax audits associated with the allocation of this
income and other complex issues, including inventory transfer pricing and cost
sharing and product royalty arrangements, may require an extended period of
time to resolve and may result in significant income tax adjustments if changes
to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different
income tax rates.

The Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

, on January 1, 2007.  This Interpretation clarified the accounting for
income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold an income tax
position is required to meet before being recognized in the Company's
Consolidated Financial Statements.  The Interpretation also provided guidance
for the measurement and classification of income tax positions, interest
expense and penalties, and requires additional disclosure on an annual basis.  Upon
adoption, the Company recognized an increase in the interest expense accrual
associated with unresolved income tax positions, which was accounted for by
reducing the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings by $7.6 million (net
of income taxes).  Subsequent to the adoption, interest expense and
penalties incurred associated with unresolved income tax positions continue to
be included in other income (expense).  In addition, upon adoption of the
interpretation, the Company reclassified $179.2 million from the current income
taxes liability to noncurrent liabilities to match the anticipated timing of
future income tax payments.

Legal and Other
Contingencies:

The Company is
involved in various proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal
course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor and
intellectual property, and other matters that are more fully described in Note
15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  The potential future outcomes of
these matters are outside of management's control and will generally not be
known for prolonged periods of time.  In certain of the legal proceedings, the
claimants seek damages, as well as other compensatory relief, which could
result in the payment of significant claims and settlements.  In legal matters
for which management has sufficient information to reasonably estimate the
Company's future obligations, a liability representing management's best
estimate of the probable cost for the resolution of these legal matters is
recorded.  The estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel, previous
settlement experience and settlement strategies.  The Company does not
anticipate material losses as a result of these proceedings beyond amounts
already provided in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.

including the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.  The
Statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring goodwill
acquired in a business combination and required disclosures to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of
the business combination.  This Statement is effective prospectively, except
for certain retrospective adjustments to income tax balances, for the Company
beginning on January 1, 2009.  The Company has not yet determined the impact
the adoption of this Statement will have on the financial position of the
Company but does not anticipate a material impact.

In 2007 the FASB issued
Statement No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements

,

an amendment of ARB No. 51.

This Statement
significantly changes the financial accounting and reporting of noncontrolling
(or minority) interests of a subsidiary in consolidated financial statements.
This Statement is effective prospectively for the Company beginning on January 1, 2009. The Company has not yet determined the impact the adoption of this
Statement will have on the financial position of the Company but does not
anticipate a material impact.

In 2008 the FASB issued
Statement No. 161,

Disclosures about
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.

This Statement requires enhanced disclosures about
derivative instruments and hedging activities to enable investors to better
understand a company's use of derivative instruments and their effect on a
company's financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This
Statement is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2009.

Reclassifications:

Certain prior year amounts have
been reclassified to conform with the presentation used in 2008. In 2008 the
Company changed its business segment reporting to include the financial results
of certain products within its Orthopaedic Implants segment rather than within
its MedSurg Equipment segment. Additional details are included in Note 13 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

NOTE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company
adopted the provisions of FASB Statement
No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements,

for financial assets and liabilities
measured at fair value on a recurring basis. This Statement requires fair value
measurements be classified and disclosed in one of the following three
categories:

Level 1:   Financial instruments with unadjusted, quoted prices
listed on active market exchanges.

Level 2:   Financial instruments lacking unadjusted, quoted
prices from active market exchanges, including over-the-counter traded financial
instruments.  The prices for the financial instruments are determined using
prices for recently traded financial instruments with similar

- 52 -

underlying
terms as well as directly or indirectly observable inputs, such as interest
rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals.

Level 3:   Financial instruments that are not actively traded on
a market exchange.  This category includes situations where there is
little, if any, market activity for the financial instrument.  The prices
are determined using significant unobservable inputs or valuation
techniques.

The Company's marketable
securities include investments in auction-rate securities (ARS), the majority
of which are triple A rated (per Standard & Poor's) and collateralized by
student loans guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Education.  The interest
rates of these ARS investments are reset through an auction process, most
commonly at intervals of 7, 28 and 35 days.  The auction process is designed to
provide a means by which these securities can be bought and sold and has
historically provided a liquid market.

Beginning in February 2008, liquidity issues in the
global credit markets resulted in the failure of auctions for all of the ARS
investments held by the Company, as the amount of securities submitted for sale
in those auctions exceeded the amount of purchase bids.  To date the Company
has collected all interest receivable on outstanding ARS when due and expects
to continue to do so in the future. While the auction failures will limit the
Company's ability to liquidate these investments, the Company believes that the
ARS failures will have no impact on its ability to fund ongoing operations and
growth initiatives.  The Company continues to
monitor efforts by the financial markets to find alternative means for
restoring the liquidity of these investments. These investments will be
classified as non-current assets until liquidity is restored in the market.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company held $166.8
million, at par value, of ARS investments. In 2008
the Company entered into an ARS Rights agreement (Rights) with UBS Financial
Services Inc. (UBS), one of its investment providers, whereby the Company
received the right to sell its ARS at par value to UBS at any time during the
period from June 30, 2010 through July 2, 2012.  These Rights are
nontransferable securities registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission.  As a result of accepting the Rights, the Company has released
UBS and its employees/agents from all claims except claims for consequential
damages directly or indirectly relating to UBS's marketing and sale of ARS and
agreed not to serve as a class representative or receive benefits under any
class action settlement or investor fund.

The Company elected to measure the value of the Rights
under the fair value option of FASB Statement No. 159, and recorded a gain of
$28.0 million in other income (expense), and a corresponding non-current asset
within the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  Simultaneously, the Company transferred
the ARS investments, at their fair value of $138.8 million, from
available-for-sale to trading marketable securities.  As a result of this
transfer, the Company recognized a loss of $28.0 million in other income
(expense), reflecting a reversal of the related temporary valuation allowance
that was previously recorded within accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss)
in shareholders' equity. The Company anticipates that any future changes in the
fair value of the Rights will be offset by the changes in the fair value of the
related ARS, both of which will be adjusted to their estimated fair value on an
ongoing basis.

As a
result of the illiquidity in the market for ARS investments, the Company has
estimated the fair value of its ARS and ARS Rights using a Level 3 valuation
methodology.  The Company's Level 3 valuations of its ARS and ARS Rights are
based on the income approach, specifically, discounted cash flow analyses which
utilize significant inputs based on the Company's estimates and assumptions.
The discounted cash flow analyses included the following assumptions at
December 31, 2008: current coupon rates, expected maturity dates, and current
discount rates. The current coupon rates reflect the maximum rate per the ARS,
specifically the 91 day U.S. Treasury bill trailing average over the prior one-year
period plus 120 basis points. The expected maturity dates reflect an assumption
of the future liquidity, specifically that markets will normalize in five years
to allow ARS issuers to access markets to obtain alternative sources of
financing, restructure or call bonds. The discount rates reflect a base rate, a
credit spread and an illiquidity premium. The base rate corresponds to the
3-month Libor, which is also the base rate that matches the credit spread.  The
credit spread is consistent with triple A rated investments collateralized by
student loans that are guaranteed by the U.S. Government under the Federal
Family Education Loan Program.  The illiquidity premium estimate is a proxy
for additional return required in holding illiquid assets.  The Company's
valuation was supported by a broker pricing valuation that incorporates

- - 53 -

transaction
details, such as contractual terms, maturity, timing and anticipated amounts of
future cash flows, as well as assumptions about liquidity and credit valuation
adjustments by marketplace participants at December 31, 2008. These adjustments
are subject to future changes as the underlying market conditions and
marketplace sources change.

As
of December 31, 2008, approximately 1% of the Company's investments in marketable
securities were held in triple A rated (per Standard & Poor's) asset backed
debt securities, of which the majority related to investments in automobile
loans.  At December 31, 2008, the Company had no investments in marketable
securities that were exposed to a risk of loss related to the subprime mortgage
securities market.

Interest
and marketable securities income, which is included in other income (expense),
totaled $97.7 million in 2008, $85.5 million in 2007 and $41.4 million in 2006.

At December 31, 2008, the Company had outstanding
forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $412.5 million and sell $288.4
million of various currencies (principally U.S. dollars and euros) with
maturities ranging from 2 to 110 days.  At December 31, 2007, the Company had
outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $427.9 million and
sell $257.7 million of various currencies (principally U.S. dollars and euros)
with maturities ranging from 4 to 101 days.   The estimated fair value
of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the
contracts at month-end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points and is
recorded as a component of accrued expenses and other liabilities in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.  At December 31, 2008, the Company is exposed to
credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on its outstanding
forward currency exchange contracts but does not anticipate nonperformance by
any of the counterparties.

ACQUISITIONS

In
2006 the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Sightline
Technologies Ltd. (Sightline), a private, development-stage company, for an
upfront payment of $50.0 million in cash plus certain transaction costs and the
assumption of certain liabilities.  Sightline, a developer of flexible
endoscopes, was acquired to enhance the Company's presence in the
gastrointestinal and other markets within its MedSurg Equipment segment.  The
purchase price was allocated to assets acquired, purchased in-process research
and development and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at
the date of acquisition. The amount of the purchase price allocated to
purchased in-process research and development resulted in a charge of $52.7
million, or $0.13 per diluted share, against the Company's 2006 operating
results.  At the date of the acquisition, the flexible endoscope technologies
acquired had not yet reached technological feasibility.  The amount written off
as purchased in-process research and development was not deductible for income
tax purposes in the United States.  Terms of the transaction also included
potential milestone payments of up to an additional $90.0 million upon the
achievement of certain operational and financial targets related to Sightline's
products.  The potential milestone payments are expected to be capitalized at
their fair values as intangible assets at the time of payment.

Unanticipated
issues have arisen that continue to delay the regulatory approval and
commercialization efforts of new products associated with the technology
acquired in the Sightline acquisition.  During 2008 the Company substantially
reduced the development efforts associated with these products, as more fully
described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  However, the
Company believes that the technology acquired in the Sightline acquisition may
result in the introduction of new products and additional sales in future
periods.

In
2005 the Company acquired, by merger, all of the outstanding stock of PlasmaSol
Corp. (PlasmaSol), a private, development-stage company.  PlasmaSol is a
developer of a technology that should allow Stryker to provide sterilization
equipment for use with certain of its MedSurg Equipment products. The cost of
the transaction totaled $17.5 million including an upfront payment in cash plus
the assumption of certain liabilities. The purchase price was allocated to
assets acquired, primarily deferred income tax assets associated with acquired
net operating losses and purchased in-process research and development based on
their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition.

In
2004 the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of SpineCore, Inc.
(SpineCore), a developer of artificial lumbar and cervical discs for an upfront
payment of $120.0 million in cash plus certain transaction costs. Terms of the
transaction also include potential milestone and royalty payments of up to an
additional $240.0 million upon commercialization of SpineCore's products in the
  United States.  The potential milestone payments are expected to be
capitalized at their fair values as intangible assets at the time of payment. 
Current products under development include the FlexiCore lumbar artificial disc
and the CerviCore cervical artificial disc.

- - 57 -

The
Company believes that the technologies acquired in each of the PlasmaSol and SpineCore acquisitions will result in the introduction of new products and
additional future sales.  However, unanticipated issues may arise that could further
delay or terminate a product's development prior to regulatory approval or
commercialization, which could have an unfavorable impact on the Company's
operating results. As of December 31,
2008, the Company had not encountered significant issues and expects completion
of the development and initial U.S. commercialization of the FlexiCore lumbar
artificial disc, the CerviCore cervical artificial disc and the sterilization
technology following receipt of all required regulatory approvals.

NOTE 5

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In
2007 the Company sold its outpatient physical therapy business, Physiotherapy
Associates, for $150.0 million in cash less certain indebtedness. The sale of
Physiotherapy Associates allowed the Company to focus its efforts on the
medical technology market.  The sale of Physiotherapy Associates resulted in a
gain of $25.7 million (net of $15.0 million income tax expense), or $0.06 per
diluted share.  Net sales from discontinued operations for the years ended
December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $107.4 million and $258.4 million,
respectively.  Net earnings from discontinued operations for the years ended
December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $5.0 million and $6.3 million, respectively.

NOTE 6

RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

In 2008 the
Company recorded restructuring charges consisting of the following items (in
millions):

Asset impairment charges

$22.3

Severance and related costs

$34.9

The
restructuring charges recorded in 2008 relate to the Company's decisions to
simplify the structure of its Japanese distribution business and to
substantially reduce development efforts associated with Sightline product
technologies acquired in 2006. The $22.3 million asset impairment charges
represent the excess of net book value over fair market value for assets to be
disposed of by sale, primarily related to sales offices and warehousing and
distribution facilities in Japan. The $8.5 million charge represents
employment-related severance costs for 84 employees. The Company expects the
asset disposals to be completed and final severance payments to be made in
2009.

In 2007 the Company recorded a
$19.8 million charge ($12.7 million net of income taxes) to write off patents
associated with intervertebral body fusion cage products.  The impairment
followed a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) decision to downgrade
certain intervertebral body fusion products to class II devices, along with a
weak market for sales of these specific products.  As a result, the Company
performed a discounted cash flow analysis over the remaining life of the
patented technologies and determined the charge to recognize an intangible
asset impairment was required.

NOTE

DEBT

The
Company had current debt outstanding under various debt instruments totaling
$20.5 million and $16.8 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

The
Company also has a $1,000.0 million Unsecured Credit Facility. The facility,
which expires in November 2010, includes a senior 5-year nonamortizing,
revolving credit agreement with a maximum amount of $1,000.0 million.  The
Company may increase the credit facility maximum limit in $100.0 million
increments up to an additional $500.0 million upon acceptance by the existing
lender group or additional lenders.  No amounts were outstanding under the
Unsecured Credit Facility as of December 31, 2008 and 2007.

- - 59 -

The
Unsecured Credit Facility requires a facility fee ranging from 0.04% to 0.15%
on the aggregate commitment of the credit facility, depending on the Company's
debt rating.  The credit facility includes a $500.0 million multicurrency
sublimit, under which yen and euro can be borrowed; a $100.0 million swing line
sublimit; and a $100.0 million letter of credit sublimit.  The credit facility
bears interest at a base rate, as defined, plus an applicable margin ranging
from 0.12% to 0.475%, depending on the Company's debt rating.

During
2008 the weighted-average interest rate, excluding required fees, for all
borrowings was 5.7%.  The Unsecured Credit Facility requires the Company to
comply with certain financial and other covenants.  The Company was in
compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2008.  In addition to the
Unsecured Credit Facility, the Company has lines of credit, issued by various
financial institutions, available to fund the Company's day-to-day operating
needs.  At December 31, 2008, the Company had $1,079.4 million of additional
borrowing capacity available under all of its existing credit facilities.

The
carrying amounts of the Company's debt approximate their fair values, based on
the quoted interest rates for similar types and amounts of borrowing
agreements.

Interest
paid on debt, including required fees, was $5.7 million in 2008, $6.5 million
in 2007 and $6.3 million in 2006; and approximates amounts reflected in
interest expense, which is included in other income (expense).

NOTE

CAPITAL
STOCK

During
2008 the Company repurchased 17.4 million shares of common stock in the open
market at a cost of $1,000.0 million pursuant to the repurchase programs authorized
by the Company's Board of Directors. Shares repurchased under the share
repurchase programs are available for general corporate purposes, including
offsetting dilution associated with stock option and other equity-based
employee benefit plans

.

The
Company has 0.5 million authorized shares of $1 par value preferred stock, none
of which is outstanding.

The
Company has key employee and director stock option plans under which options
are granted at an exercise price not less than the fair market value of the
underlying common stock at the date of grant.  The options are granted for
periods of up to 10 years and become exercisable in varying installments.  A

The estimated net actuarial loss for the defined
benefit pension plans to be recognized from accumulated other comprehensive
gain (loss) into net periodic benefit cost in the year ended December 31, 2009,
is $2.3 million.  The Company estimates that an immaterial amount of
amortization of prior service cost and transition amount for the defined
benefit pension plans will be recognized from accumulated other comprehensive
gain (loss) into net periodic benefit cost in the year ended December 31, 2009.

The Company has assumed an average long-term expected
return on defined benefit plan assets of 5.5% as of December 31, 2008.  The
expected return is determined by applying the target allocation in each asset
category of plan investments to the anticipated return for each asset category
based on historical and projected returns.

The
weighted-average allocation of plan assets by asset category is as follows:

December 31



Equity securities

50%

The investment strategy for the Company's defined
benefit pension plans is both to meet the liabilities of the plans as they fall
due and to maximize the return on invested assets within appropriate risk
tolerances.  Reflected below are target investment allocation ranges for the
plans at December 31, 2008:

portion of the Company's retirement plan expense was funded with Stryker common
stock totaling $9.3 million in 2008, $8.4 million in 2007 and $7.0 million in
2006.  The use of Stryker common stock represents a noncash operating activity
that is not reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  The amount
of Stryker common stock held by the Company's defined contribution retirement
plans totaled $58.8 million (approximately 1.5 million shares) and $108.2
million (approximately 1.4 million shares) as of December 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.  The value of Stryker common stock as a percentage of total
defined contribution retirement plan assets was 11% and 15% as of December 31,
2008 and 2007, respectively.

NOTE

INCOME TAXES

At December 31, 2008, income tax authorities in several income tax
jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States were conducting routine
audits of the Company's income tax returns filed in prior years.  These
audits are generally designed to determine if individual income tax authorities
are in agreement with the Company's interpretations of complex income tax
regulations regarding the allocation of income to the various income tax
jurisdictions.   With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to
audits by income tax authorities for tax years prior to 2001. Income tax years
subsequent to 2000 are open to examination in many of the income tax jurisdictions
in which the Company operates.

Deferred
income taxes reflect the net income tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.  Valuation allowances
are recorded to reduce deferred income tax assets when it is more likely than
not that an income tax benefit will not be realized.  The income tax effects of
significant temporary differences, which comprise the Company's deferred income
tax assets and liabilities, are as follows (in millions):

certain domestic and foreign subsidiaries.

No
provision has been made for U. S. federal and state income taxes or foreign
income taxes that may result from future remittances of the undistributed
earnings ($3,092.4 million at December 31, 2008) of foreign subsidiaries
because it is expected that such earnings will be reinvested overseas
indefinitely.  Determination of the amount of any unrecognized deferred income
tax liability on these unremitted earnings is not practicable.

Total
income taxes paid, net of refunds received, were $478.5 million in 2008, $411.6

The Company's income tax expense could be reduced by $241.6
million and $204.9 million at December 31,
2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively, upon favorable resolution of these unresolved income tax positions.  Interest
expense and penalties included in other income (expense) were $17.8 million for
the year ended December 31, 2008.  Accrued interest and penalties included in
accrued expenses and other liabilities were $52.6 and $34.8 million at December
31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively.

It
is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will
significantly change due to one
or more of the following events in the next twelve months: expiring statutes,
audit activity, tax payments, competent authority proceedings related to
transfer pricing, or final decisions in matters that are the subject of
controversy in various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate, including cost
sharing and product royalty arrangements.  Such
changes in unrecognized tax benefits may result in significant tax
adjustments.  The Company is not able to reasonably estimate the amount or the
future periods in which changes in unrecognized tax benefits will be required.

NOTE 13

SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

The
Company segregates its operations into two reportable business segments:
Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  The Orthopaedic Implants segment
sells orthopaedic reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma,
craniomaxillofacial and spinal implant systems; bone cement; and the bone
growth factor
OP-1.  The MedSurg Equipment segment sells surgical equipment; surgical
navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as
well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment.  The Other category
includes corporate administration, interest expense, interest and marketable
securities income and share-based compensation, which includes compensation
related to both employee and director stock option and restricted stock grants.

Effective
January 1, 2008, the Company changed its business segment reporting to include
the financial results of certain products within its Orthopaedic Implants
segment rather than within its MedSurg Equipment segment.  The Company believes
these products are better aggregated with its other Orthopaedic Implants
products based on similarities in manufacturing and marketing practices and
customer base.

The
Company's reportable segments are business units that offer different products
and services and are managed separately because each business requires different
manufacturing, technology and marketing strategies.  The accounting
policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of
significant accounting policies in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. The Company measures the financial results of its reportable
segments using an internal performance measure that excludes the restructuring
charges recorded in 2008, the intangible asset impairment charge recorded in
2007 and the purchased in-process research and

- - 67 -

development charge
recorded in 2006. Identifiable assets are those assets used exclusively in the
operations of each business segment or
allocated when used jointly. Corporate assets are principally cash and cash
equivalents; marketable securities; property, plant and equipment; and, in
2006, assets of discontinued operations.

CONTINGENCIES

In
2008 the Company and certain current and former employees received subpoenas
from the U.S. Department of Justice Office, Criminal Division, of the United
States Attorney in Massachusetts requesting documents related to (i) false
Institutional Review Board approvals; (ii) the amount of sales of OP-1 under
one of the Company's Humanitarian Device Exemptions; and (iii) the off-label
promotion of Calstrux in combination with OP-1.  The Company is in the
process of responding to the U.S. Department of Justice regarding this matter.

- - 69 -

In 2008 the Company
received a warning letter from the FDA related
to quality systems and compliance issues at its OP-1 implant manufacturing
facility in Hopkinton, Massachusetts.  In 2007 the Company received two
warning letters from the FDA regarding compliance with certain quality system
specifications at its reconstructive implant manufacturing facilities: one
letter for its facility in Cork, Ireland and another for its facility in Mahwah, New Jersey.  The Company takes these matters very seriously and has been fully
cooperating with the FDA to address their observations.

In
2007 the Company announced that it reached a resolution with the U.S.
Attorney's office for the District of New Jersey in connection with a
previously announced investigation relating to "any and all consulting
contracts, professional service agreements, or remuneration agreements between
Stryker Corporation and any orthopedic surgeon, orthopedic surgeon in training,
or medical school graduate using or considering the surgical use of hip or knee
joint replacement/reconstruction products manufactured or sold by Stryker
Corporation."  The resolution is in the form of a non-prosecution
agreement for an 18-month period ending on March 27, 2009.  During the
term of the agreement, the Company's Orthopaedics subsidiary is subject to
oversight by a federal monitor, as appointed by the U.S. Attorney, regarding
compliance with certain standards and procedures in connection with the
retention and payment of orthopaedic surgeon consultants related to
reconstructive products and the provision of certain benefits to such surgeons.
 Subsequent to entering into the non-prosecution agreement, the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (HHS)
issued a civil subpoena to the Company in seeking to determine whether the
Company violated various laws by paying consulting fees and providing other
things of value to orthopedic surgeons and healthcare and educational
institutions as inducements to use Stryker's orthopedic medical devices in
procedures paid for in whole or in part by Medicare.  The Company produced
numerous documents and other materials to HHS in response to the subpoena and
had been working with HHS to attempt to narrow the scope of the requested
production.  In 2008 the U.S. Department of Justice and the HHS sought
judicial enforcement of the subpoena and a court agreed to enforce it in
January 2009.  At the same time, the U.S. District Court for the District
of New Jersey dismissed the Company's complaint which had asked the court to
quash the subpoena and sought other appropriate relief on the grounds that the
subpoena was overbroad and oppressive.

In 2007 the Company disclosed that
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission made an informal inquiry of the
Company regarding possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in
connection with the sale of medical devices in certain foreign countries.
Subsequently, in 2008, the Company received a subpoena from the U.S. Department
of Justice, Criminal Division, requesting certain documents for the period
since January 1, 2000 in connection with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission inquiry.  The Company is fully cooperating with the U.S. Department
of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regarding these
matters.

In 2006 the Company announced that it received a subpoena
from the U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, requesting documents
for the period since January 2001 regarding possible violations of federal
criminal law, including possible violation of the antitrust laws, relating to
the manufacture and sale of orthopaedic implant devices.  In 2008 the Company
was advised by the U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, that the
Department had closed its grand jury investigation of antitrust and related
offenses in the orthopaedic implants industry.

Pursuant
to certain of the Company's credit and lease agreements, the Company has
provided financial guarantees to third parties in the form of indemnification
provisions.  These provisions indemnify the third parties for costs, including
but not limited to adverse judgments in lawsuits and the imposition of
additional income taxes due to either a change in the tax law or an adverse
interpretation of the tax law.  The terms of the guarantees are equal to the
terms of the related credit or lease agreements.  The Company is not able to
calculate the maximum potential amount of future payments it could be required
to make under these guarantees, as any potential payment is dependent on the
occurrence of future unknown events (e.g., changes in U.S. or foreign tax laws).

evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and
procedures as of December 31, 2008 was carried out under the supervision and
with the participation of the Company's management, including the President and
Chief Executive Officer, the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and the
Vice President, Finance (the "Certifying Officers").  Based on that evaluation,
the Certifying Officers concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting -

There was no change to the Company's internal control
over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2008 that
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Management's
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting -

The management of Stryker Corporation is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f).  Stryker
Corporation's internal control system was designed to provide reasonable
assurance to the Company's management and Board of Directors regarding the
preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.

Stryker
Corporation's management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008.  In making this
assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission in

Internal Control - Integrated
Framework

.  Based on that assessment, management believes that, as of
December 31, 2008, the Company's internal control over financial reporting is
effective.

Stryker
Corporation's independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young
LLP, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company's
internal control over financial reporting.  This report appears on the
following page.

Other
Matters

- The Company is in the
process of implementing new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems at
certain of its divisions.  An ERP system is a fully-integrated set of programs
and databases that incorporate order processing, production planning and
scheduling, purchasing, accounts receivable and inventory management and
accounting.  The Company's European, Middle East, Africa division continues to transition
to its new ERP system.  In connection with this ERP system implementation, the
Company will update its internal controls over financial reporting, as
necessary, to accommodate modifications to its business processes and
accounting procedures.  The Company does not believe that this ERP system
implementation will have an adverse effect on the Company's internal control
over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER
FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Stryker Corporation

:

We have audited Stryker
Corporation and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Stryker
Corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying
Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company's internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2008, based on

the COSO criteria

.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of
Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the
related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders' equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008 of
Stryker Corporation, and our report dated February 12, 2009 expressed an
unqualified opinion thereon.
