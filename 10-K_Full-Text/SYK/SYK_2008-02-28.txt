PART I

ITEM
  1.

BUSINESS

GENERAL

Stryker
Corporation (the Company or Stryker) is one of the world's leading medical
technology companies with the most broadly based range of products in
orthopaedics and a significant presence in other medical specialties.  Stryker
works with respected medical professionals to help people lead more active and
more satisfying lives.  The Company's products include implants used in joint
replacement, trauma, spinal and craniomaxillofacial surgeries; biologics;
surgical, neurologic, ear, nose & throat and interventional pain equipment;
endoscopic, surgical navigation, communications and digital imaging systems; as
well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment.  Stryker was
incorporated in Michigan in 1946 as the successor company to a business founded
in 1941 by Dr. Homer H. Stryker, a leading orthopaedic surgeon and the inventor
of several orthopaedic products.

Stryker's
filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including
its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current
reports on Form 8-K, are accessible free of charge at www.stryker.com within
the "Investors-SEC Filings & Ownership Reports" link.

In 2007 the Company completed the sale of its outpatient physical
therapy business, Physiotherapy Associates, to Water Street Healthcare
Partners, for $150 million in cash less certain indebtedness.  Physiotherapy
Associates' operating results are reported as discontinued operations for all
periods presented.

In
2006 the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Sightline
Technologies Ltd. (Sightline), a private, development-stage company. The
acquisition of Sightline, a developer of flexible endoscopes, is expected to
enhance the Company's presence in the gastrointestinal and other markets within
its MedSurg Equipment segment.

In
2005 the Company completed the repatriation of $722 million of foreign earnings
under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act (the Act).  The Act
provided a temporary incentive for United States companies to repatriate
accumulated income earned in foreign jurisdictions at a reduced income tax
cost.  The repatriated funds were invested pursuant to an approved Domestic
Reinvestment Plan that conformed to the Act.

In 2005
the Company acquired, by merger, all of the outstanding stock of PlasmaSol
Corp. (PlasmaSol).  PlasmaSol has developed a technology that should allow
Stryker to provide sterilization equipment for use with certain of its MedSurg
Equipment products.

In 2005
the Company acquired eTrauma.com Corp. (eTrauma).  The acquisition expanded the
Company's endoscopic and digital imaging equipment product offerings within its
MedSurg Equipment segment by adding eTrauma's proprietary Picture Archival and
Communications Systems (PACS) image management and viewing software.

PRODUCT SALES

The
Company segregates its operations into two reportable business segments:
Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  The Orthopaedic Implants segment
sells orthopaedic reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma, spinal and
craniomaxillofacial implant systems; bone cement; and the bone growth factor
OP-1.  The MedSurg Equipment segment sells surgical equipment; surgical
navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as
well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment.  The Other category
includes corporate administration, interest expense and interest and marketable
securities income.  The following amounts (in millions) and percentages
represent domestic/international and business segment net sales during each of
the three years ended December 31:

Note 12 -
Segment and Geographic Data

" on
pages


through 66 of this report.

Approximately
70% of the Company's sales in 2007, 71% in 2006 and 72% in 2005 consisted of
products with short lives, such as reconstructive, trauma, spinal and
craniomaxillofacial implant systems (while implants have a long useful life to
the patient, they have a one-time use to the hospital); disposables and
expendable tools; and parts and service revenues, including service and repair
charges.  The balance of sales in each of the years came from products that
could be considered capital equipment, having useful lives in excess of one
year.

The
Company's backlog of firm orders is not considered material to an understanding
of its business.

Orthopaedic Implants

Orthopaedic
Implants are designed and manufactured by Stryker Orthopaedics, Stryker
Osteosynthesis, Stryker Spine and Stryker Biotech and consist of such products
as implants used in joint replacement, trauma, craniomaxillofacial and spinal
surgeries; bone cement; and the bone growth factor OP-1.  Artificial joints are
made of cobalt chromium, titanium alloys, ceramics or ultrahigh molecular
weight polyethylene and are implanted in patients whose natural joints have
been damaged by arthritis, osteoporosis, other diseases or injury.  The
Company's OP-1 bone growth factor, which induces the formation of new bone when
implanted into bone, is composed of recombinant human OP-1 and a bioresorbable
collagen matrix.

Minimally Invasive Surgery

Many
of Stryker's technologically advanced reconstructive implants are suited to
minimally invasive surgery (MIS) procedures that are intended to reduce
soft-tissue damage and pain while hastening return to function.  The
Company supports surgeons with technology, procedural development and
specialized instrumentation as they develop new MIS techniques.

- 6 -

In
order to facilitate emerging procedural approaches, the Company has also
developed instrumentation for MIS total joint procedures.  The Company's
surgical navigation systems are frequently used in MIS procedures to improve
the accuracy of measurements and to position the implant.

Stryker
Osteosynthesis has a market leadership position in the Intramedullary (IM) Hip
Screw market due to the minimally invasive nature of the Gamma Nail, which can
be implanted through a smaller incision than other competing products. In
addition, surgeons are testing the use of the Company's surgical navigation
systems for this procedure as well as in surgery for pelvic fractures.

The
Company's Triathlon Total Knee Minimally Invasive Instrumentation is designed
to complement the unique, minimally invasive total knee procedure pioneered by
a leading orthopaedic surgeon.

The
EIUS Unicondylar Knee and the Avon Patellofemoral Joint are resurfacing,
bone-conserving designs that are used to treat disease isolated to one
compartment of the knee.  These pre-total knee treatment options can also be
implanted using minimally invasive techniques.

Orthobiologics

Stryker strives to be an innovator and leader in the
fast-growing field of orthobiologics with products that combine both natural
and synthetic technologies.  The Company's innovative product portfolio
includes such products as OP-1, a proprietary, recombinant version of a signaling
protein with multiple tissue regeneration properties; TissueMend, a
single-layer acellular collagen matrix that is easy to handle and delivers both
unrivaled strength and documented remodeling capability; Hydroset, the next
generation in bone substitute technology, which is injectible, sculptable and
fast setting; BoneSource BVF, an effective osteoconductive bone substitute with
excellent biocompatibility and mechanical stability; and BoneSave, a
granules-based alternative to conventional bone grafting.

Hip Implant Systems

Through
Stryker Orthopaedics, the Company offers a variety of hip implant systems for
the global reconstructive market.  The ABG Hip System, Partnership Hip System,
Secur-Fit Hip System, Omnifit Hip System, Accolade Hip System and Restoration
Hip System are all comprehensive systems of hip implants and associated
instrumentation designed to provide physicians and patients with reliable
results and to reduce operating time for primary and revision procedures.  The
Exeter Total Hip System is based on a collarless, highly polished,
double-tapered femoral design that reduces shear stresses and increases
compression at the cement/bone interface.  During 2004, the Company began
transitioning to its new Restoration Modular Revision Hip System in the United States, Europe, Australia and Canada.  This system offers surgeons performing revision
surgeries flexibility in treating complex hip stem revisions and restoring
patient biomechanics.  The Restoration Modular Revision Hip System also takes
advantage of Stryker's long clinical history with hydroxylapatite (HA), a
naturally occurring calcium phosphate material that demonstrates a high level of
biocompatibility due to its resemblance to bone, by incorporating PureFix HA
coating on many components.  The Restoration Modular Revision Hip System
complements the Company's existing Restoration HA and Restoration plasma spray
(PS) monolithic revision systems.

In
2007 the Company began selling the Cormet Hip Resurfacing System in the United States pursuant to an exclusive 10-year marketing and distribution agreement with
Corin Group PLC.  In 2006 the Company began the initial launch of another hip
resurfacing product in certain international markets.  These products represent
a less invasive option for younger patients with the potential for enhanced
stability and range of motion.  In hip resurfacing procedures, very little bone
is removed from the femoral head, the femoral neck is preserved and the femoral
canal is spared.

Following
the clinical success of its Crossfire technology, a highly crosslinked
polyethylene designed to reduce wear, Stryker launched X3 polyethylene in
2005.  X3 polyethylene is the Company's next-generation highly crosslinked
polyethylene, which features a higher level of strength and wear reduction in
both hip and knee replacements.

- 7 -

In 2006
the Company received clearance from the FDA for its advanced bearing system, Low
Friction Ion Treatment (LFIT) Anatomic Femoral Heads with X3 polyethylene
liners.  This represents a significant advancement in hip-bearing technology through
the combination of Stryker's LFIT technology and X3 advanced bearing technology. 
The femoral heads are anatomically sized for more natural hip performance.  In
2007 the Company further expanded its anatomic femoral head offerings with the
introduction of the Delta Ceramic Anatomic head for even greater options to
reduce wear and potentially increase implant longevity.

Stryker
was the first company to receive clearance from the FDA to commercially release
for sale in the United States a hip implant with HA surface treatment.  The
Company's global clinical experience with HA-coated hip stems now extends over 20
years, and reported clinical performance continues to equal or exceed that of
comparable hip stems reported in the scientific literature.

The Company's
CentPillar Hip System provide lines of products that offer an increased range
of motion and a minimally invasive technique preferred by Japanese surgeons for
their patients.  In 2007 the Company introduced CentPillar TMZF to the Japanese
market.  This is the first product introduced in Japan that utilizes Stryker's
patented TMZF material along with the Company's PureFix HA.  The TMZF material
allows for implant stiffness more closely matched to a patient's own bone to
enhance fixation.

The
Company received premarket approval (PMA) from the FDA in 2003 for its
ceramic-on-ceramic hip replacement system, the Trident Ceramic Acetabular
Insert, for patients in the United States.  Stryker Orthopaedics has successfully
launched the Trident ceramic insert in the United States, Europe, Australia and Canada.  The Trident insert is wear resistant, and it is protected and strengthened by
a patented titanium sleeve.  In 2006 the Company launched the Trident Tritanium
Acetabular Shell which contains a highly porous surface that closely resembles
the structure of trabecular bone.  This shell is designed for revision surgery
and contains multiple screw holes to achieve bone fixation and initial
stability.

The
Company entered 2008 with more than 30 years of clinical history with the
Exeter Hip System, more than 20 years of clinical history with the Omnifit
cemented stem and more than 20 years of clinical history with the Omnifit HA
stem.  Long-term clinical results are an important factor in the Company's
ability to market hip implants.

Knee Implant Systems

The
Company offers five major knee implant systems under the Stryker brand name: 
the Duracon, EIUS, Global Modular Replacement System (GMRS), Scorpio and
Triathlon systems.  During 2007 the Triathlon system surpassed 200,000 implantations
worldwide and was complemented with the introduction of the Triathlon TS
System.  The DuraconTS and ScorpioTS Revision systems and Modular Rotating
Hinge complete the product line offerings with implants for complex revision
procedures.

The
Triathlon Knee System represents the Company's evolutionary design that has
been developed to more closely reproduce natural knee motion and is designed to
provide mobility with stability through more than 150 degrees of flexion.  The
state-of-the-art Triathlon Knee instrumentation is designed to improve
operating room efficiency through a streamlined, integrated system providing
options and flexibility to meet surgeons' varying preferences and multiple
surgical techniques.  In 2007 Stryker introduced the condylar stabilizing (CS)
ultra-congruent insert for the Triathlon Knee System.  The Triathlon CS insert
is a high-performance insert designed to provide patients with more natural
motion and the potential for greater implant longevity.  In 2006 the Company
introduced X3 advanced bearing technology as well as anterior referencing
instruments for use with the Triathlon Knee System.  In 2005 the Company
launched a posteriorly stabilized (PS) version of the Triathlon knee following
the launch of the cruciate-retaining (CR) version in 2004.  In 2005 the Company
continued its launch of the Triathlon Knee System on a worldwide basis
throughout the United States and Europe and into Canada and the Pacific
region.

- 8 -

The
GMRS is a global product that offers a comprehensive solution for severe bone
loss in oncology, trauma and revision surgery patients.  GMRS has tibial and
femoral components, including a total femur, and a modular rotating hinge
knee.  The system employs both titanium and cobalt chrome alloys for strength
and lightness of weight, together with the superior flexibility of the hinge. 
The MRS, the predecessor to the GMRS, was the first modular segmental
replacement system when it was introduced in 1988.  These system components
have maintained a leadership position in this market segment since their
introduction.

The
Scorpio knee implant design is based on the epicondylar axis of the knee.  This
patented approach addresses significant clinical issues, such as improved
patient rehabilitation and midflexion stability, through an increase in the
patella-femoral moment arm and a single anterior-posterior radius.  In 2006,
the Scorpio HA CR and Scorpio HA PS versions were launched.  The Scorpio HA CR
product is designed to minimize polyethylene wear and the Scorpio HA PS product
features a minimally invasive open box design and maximized stability.  The
Scorpio Plus Mobile Bearing tibial component was launched in markets outside
the United States in 2001, and a clinical trial is in progress in the United States.  This addition to the Scorpio line provides a competitive entry into the
growing, mobile-bearing market segment.  The Scorpio NRG, originally launched
in Japan, was introduced in Europe and the Pacific region in 2005 and in the United States in 2006.  Scorpio NRG provides additional kinematic benefits over
ScorpioFlex, including increased rotational allowance, an articulating design
for deeper flexion and greater extension allowance without impingement.  In
2007 the Scorpio NRG with X3 advanced bearing technology was launched.  This
new version of the Scorpio NRG is designed to lower wear rates compared with standard
inserts.  The ScorpioFlex, which is available for both posterior
cruciate-retaining and cruciate-substituting indications, is specifically
designed for patients who have the ability and motivation to return to
high-flexion activities such as gardening and golfing. The Scorpio System is
supported by the Passport instrumentation system, which was designed to provide
intraoperative flexibility and precision as well as a simple, cost-effective
approach to total knee replacement surgery.

The
EIUS Unicondylar Knee replacement system is designed for the minimally invasive
knee surgery market segment.  This system marries bone-sparing femoral and
tibial implants with sophisticated instrumentation and a surgical technique
aimed at reducing rehabilitation time for patients.

Other Joint Replacement
Products

The Company markets other joint
replacement products, principally shoulder and elbow implants and related
instruments, under the Stryker brand name.  The Solar Total Shoulder System
provides a unique design for the humeral head that allows surgeons to adjust
tension of the supporting tissues while maximizing range of motion.  The
shoulder instruments offer surgeons increased visibility and access to this
tightly confined joint space.  The Solar BiPolar Shoulder provides surgeons
with additional options for addressing rotator cuff arthropathy arthritis of
the shoulder and incorporates the patented bipolar locking mechanism that is
also used in the Company's hip implants.  The Solar Shoulder product line gives
surgeons increased intraoperative flexibility to restore the patient's shoulder
kinematics.  In 2007 the Company introduced the ReUnion Shoulder fracture
system of implants and instrumentation.  The ReUnion System utilizes an
innovative trial system to simplify the reconstruction of the shoulder during
fracture surgery.  The Solar Total Elbow complements products offered for upper
extremity procedures.  The semiconstrained design and modular components
address varying types of patient anatomy.

Bone
Cement

Simplex bone cement, a material used to secure
cemented implants to bone, was first approved for orthopaedic use in the United States in 1971 and is the most widely used bone cement in the world.  The Company
manufactures and provides several variations of Simplex bone cement to meet
specific patient needs.  Simplex has nearly 50 years of clinical history, the
longest of any bone cement, with more than 400 published clinical papers.

- 9 -

Trauma Implant Systems

Through Stryker Osteosynthesis, the Company
develops, manufactures and markets its trauma extremities and deformities
systems.  These systems, including nailing, plating, hip fracture, external
fixation systems and bone substitutes, are used primarily in deformity
corrections and in the fixation of fractures resulting from sudden injury.
These products consist of internal fixation devices marketed under such names
as Gamma, Omega, Asnis, AxSOS, Variax, Hydroset, BixCut T2 and S2, along with
external fixation devices marketed under the Apex, Hoffmann II, TenXor and
Monotube Triax names.

The Company's internal fixation product
portfolio includes a full array of IM nails, hip fracture devices and
plates and screws in both titanium and stainless steel.  These products
complement the total hip and knee replacement offerings mentioned above by
offering a restorative option in addition to total joint replacement.

To address the hip trauma and fracture
segment, the Company markets several products, including the IM nail portfolio,
led by the T2 Nailing System; the Gamma Nail, a unique IM nail for trochanteric
fractures; the Omega hip screw system; the Asnis Cannulated Screw System; and
the Hansson pin system, providing a complete offering of surgical solutions for
the hip trauma patient.  These hip fracture systems offer orthopaedic surgeons
multiple options depending on their preferences and patient needs.

The T2 Nailing System includes femoral and
tibial components with a common instrument platform for accuracy and ease of
use.  The Company has also recently introduced the T2 Ankle Arthrodesis Nail to
provide the option for tibiotalocalcaneal fusion with a retrograde IM nail to
repair limited soft tissue damage in the ankle area, early weight bearing and
compression of the subtalar and tibiotalar joints.  Building on the success of
the T2 titanium nail system, the Company introduced the stainless steel S2
tibial and femoral nails.  The Gamma3 is based on 20 years of Gamma Nail
experience and is the third generation of IM short and long Gamma fixation
nails.  The Gamma3 System is designed to facilitate minimally invasive surgery  (MIS)
and reduce surgery time through the use of newly designed implants and instrumentation. 
The Asnis Cannulated Screw System can help simplify the operative procedure
through features that allow surgeons to place, insert and remove locking screws
easily. This system was recently expanded to include smaller diameters of 2.0mm
and 3.0mm for foot surgery to complement the Variax foot and ankle plating
system.

In 2007 the Company introduced the Omega 3 Compression
Hip Screw System, a unique and innovative product that reflects Stryker's
extensive experience in the treatment of hip fractures of the proximal femur. 
The Omega 3 system offers the surgeon a wide choice of low-profile hip plates
plus the option to lock screws with diverging fixation.  The Omega 3 allows the
surgeon to decide preoperatively or even intraoperatively to add axial stable
screws to lock the hip plate to the femoral shaft.  Axial stability with 5.0mm
locking inserts and corresponding locking screws allows for increased
stability.  This may be advantageous for early mobilization and when the bone
density or bone quality is limited.

To
address the knee trauma segment, Stryker offers the Hoffman II Modular Fixation System, the T2 SCN
Nailing System and the SPS and AxSOS plating solutions.  The Hoffman II
knee-bridging frame is used to stabilize injuries to the knee until definitive
treatment with a plate or nail occurs or reconstruction takes place.  In
addition, Stryker offers the T2 SCN Nail, which can be used for definitive
treatment of supracondylar femur fractures just above the knee joint. This nail
can also be used for periprosthetic fracture fixation for traumatic fractures
in patients who have already had a joint replacement.

Stryker
has several product lines for upper extremity trauma.  The Universal Distal Radius System complements the
stainless steel Numelock II with a titanium option in distal radius plates and
screws. The Universal Distal Radius System offers a wide array of precontoured,
variable-sized plates for volar, distal and column approaches and both open
reduction and internal fixation techniques.  In 2006 the Company launched, on a
limited basis, the second-generation VariAx Universal Distal Radius System, which
is thinner than the original and features polyaxial locking.  The AxSOS Locking
Plate System, also introduced in 2006, is designed to treat metaphyseal and
diaphyseal fractures with low-profile anatomically contoured plates, a unique
screw design and a simple instrument platform.

- 10 -

The Company's external fixation products
also include the Hoffmann II Compact and MicroFix, the Monotube Triax
monolateral system, the TenXor circular fixation system for complex fractures
and a complete range of pins and wires for attaching the devices to fractured
bones. The Hoffmann II Compact for upper extremity fractures includes a
patented snap-fit mechanism that makes it easy for surgeons to construct the
fixation device to fit the patient and align the fractured bones.  It also has a
full selection of lightweight radiolucent connection bars that allow for quick
intraoperative fracture repair. The Monotube Triax System is available in three
sizes and includes an adjustable feature that enables surgeons not only to stabilize
fractures but also to lengthen the bone in cases where bone has been removed
due to damage.  The TenXor hybrid frame enables surgeons to treat complex
fractures around the joints with both pins and long transfixing wires.  This
attribute is especially useful for patients with multipart fractures near the
ankle and knee.  The system features advanced composite materials and is
compatible with the Hoffman II snap-fit connection devices.

Spinal Implant Systems

Through
Stryker Spine, the Company develops, manufactures and markets spinal implant
products including cervical, thoracolumbar and interbody systems used in spine
injury, deformity and degenerative therapies.  Spinal implant products include
plates, rods, screws, connectors, spacers and cages, along with proprietary
implant instrumentation.

In
2007 the Company introduced the Mantis minimally invasive access system for
posterior instrumented spinal fusion and the Reflex Zero Profile anterior
cervical plating system.  In 2006 the Company introduced the VLIFT vertebral
body replacement system consisting of a preassembled, cylindrically shaped
titanium cage with a distractible or retractable center.  The hollow core of
the cage allows for packing bone graft.  Also in 2006, Stryker launched the AVS
AS and AL Spacers which are used as vertebral body support devices in anterior
procedures.  Other product lines include the Xia System, a top-loading pedicle
screw system that addresses both simple and complex spinal conditions, as well
as the OASYS fixation system that serves the posterior cervical fusion market.  Stryker
also offers the Reflex Hybrid anterior cervical plate and the AVS PL and TL
vertebral spacer systems.  The Reflex Hybrid features the ability to
utilize both fixed and variable-angle screws.

Craniomaxillofacial
Implant Systems

Through
Stryker Osteosynthesis, the Company develops, manufactures and markets plating
systems and related implants and products for craniomaxillofacial surgery.  In
2006 Stryker introduced HydroSet, a self-setting calcium phosphate bone
substitute that is indicated to fill certain bone voids or gaps of the skeletal
system.  Also in 2006, the Company launched DuraMatrix, a second-generation
dura substitute technology, which is a conformable and resorbable membrane
matrix engineered from highly purified type I collagen.  In 2005 the Company
extended its Universal Fixation System for craniomaxillofacial surgery with the
addition of a facial trauma module.

OP-1 Implant/BMP-7

More than two
decades ago, Stryker saw the potential that orthobiologic products held for
orthopaedics in an aging world and began a long-term investment in OP-1, initially
focused on the bone growth properties of OP-1.  OP-1 was originally discovered
by Creative BioMolecules, Inc. (a company that subsequently merged into Curis,
Inc.), with which Stryker funded a long-term development collaboration with a
vision to develop the first molecules to stimulate tissue regeneration.
Stryker's first therapeutic product, OP-1 Implant, is composed of recombinant
human OP-1 and a bioresorbable collagen matrix.  OP-1 is a natural protein that
the human body makes to induce bone formation. In preclinical studies, OP-1
induced the formation of new bone when implanted into bony defect sites.
Stryker was the first company to enter clinical studies with a bone morphogenic
protein, BMP-7 (or OP-1). Studies have been performed in two challenging
clinical indications: first, in nonunion fractures of long bones, and second,
in posterolateral spine fusions.

- 11 -

Based
on clinical data from a large, controlled human study, Stryker received
approval for a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) from the FDA  in 2001 for
the use of OP-1 Implant as an alternative to autograft in recalcitrant
long-bone nonunions where use of autograft is not feasible and alternative
treatments have failed.  An HDE, as defined by the FDA, is for a product
intended to benefit patients by treating or diagnosing a disease or condition
that affects fewer than 4,000 individuals per year in the United States.  As of December 31, 2007, Stryker had more than 600 hospital Institutional Review
Board (IRB) approvals for OP-1 Implant in patients in the United States under this HDE.

The
Company has received market approvals from regulators in Europe and in Australia
during 2001 as well as in Canada during 2002 for the indication of nonunion
fractures of the tibia that failed prior autograft treatment or when autograft
treatment is not feasible; for the treatment of long-bone nonunions secondary
to trauma for the purpose of initiating new bone formation; or for the clinical
indication of long-bone nonunions, respectively.

In
the United States, Stryker received a further HDE in 2004 for revision
posterolateral spine fusion following the completion of a pilot clinical study
that indicated possible benefit of a new formulation of OP-1 known as OP-1
Putty.  As of December 31, 2007, Stryker had approximately 700 hospital IRB
approvals for OP-1 Putty in the United States under this HDE.

Stryker
is committed to the further development of OP-1 as an alternative to iliac
crest bone graft for patients requiring spinal fusion using a variety of
surgical techniques.  Spinal fusion is used to stabilize the spine and improve
patient outcomes postoperatively.  The Company conducted a multicenter pivotal
trial in the United States and Canada using OP-1 Putty in posterolateral lumbar
spine fusion in the setting of degenerative spondylolisthesis.  In 2003 the
Company completed enrollment in this trial, and the final 2-year follow-up
evaluation of the 297 enrolled patients was completed at the end of 2005.  The results
were analyzed and submitted to the FDA in 2006 as part of a PMA application for
the use of OP-1 Putty in posterolateral lumbar spine fusion surgeries.  The PMA
is currently under review by the FDA.  The Company continues to believe in the eventual
approval of OP-1 for spinal fusion in the United States, though nearer-term
timing cannot be predicted.  Stryker also filed a Marketing Authorization
Application (MAA) with the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA) for the posterolateral
lumbar spine fusion indication in 2006.  This application is currently under
consideration.

In 2006
Stryker filed an investigational device exemption (IDE) application with the
FDA to start a clinical study in transforaminal lumbar interbody fusions using
OP-1 Putty.  The IDE was approved and patient recruitment was nearly completed in
2007.  The Company has also begun planning a pivotal study for open tibial
fractures.

Stryker
is also interested in exploring the cartilage regeneration properties of OP-1
and has successfully completed preclinical studies showing that OP-1 can
stimulate new cartilage formation and increase disc height in animal models of
degenerative disc disease.  In 2005 Stryker filed its first Investigational New
Drug (IND) application with the FDA to treat degenerative disc disease with a
new injectable form of OP-1 in a dose-ranging study in humans.  During 2007 and
2006, Stryker recruited patients into the dose-ranging clinical safety study
for the first time use of BMP-7 to regenerate cartilage tissue.

In
2006 Stryker filed an IND application with the FDA to treat osteoarthritis in
the knee with the injectable form of OP-1. Following FDA concurrence in 2007, the
Company proceeded with patient enrollment in the clinical study.

Saw are designed for use by sports physicians and plastic surgeons.  The Elite
attachment line with a proprietary extendable bur system and Saber Drill for ENT surgery further extend the TPS System into spine, neurosurgery and ENT applications.  The TPS
System also powers Stryker Endoscopy Shaver Systems.

Surgical Equipment

Through
Stryker Instruments, the Company offers a broad line of surgical, neurologic,
ENT and interventional spine equipment that is used in surgical specialties for
drilling, burring, rasping or cutting bone in small-bone orthopaedics,
neurosurgical, spine and ENT procedures; wiring or pinning bone fractures; and
preparing hip or knee surfaces for the placement of artificial implants. 
Stryker Instruments also manufactures an array of different attachments and
cutting accessories for use by orthopaedic, neurologic and small-bone
specialists.

In
2007 Stryker introduced the CORE Sumex drill, designed for use in ENT
procedures, to further leverage the Company's Consolidated Operating Room
Equipment (CORE) platform.  The Sumex drill utilizes electronic torque feedback
to increase RPM's when the drill is engaged in more demanding tasks.  In
addition, the Sumex drill incorporates a tapered front end to allow for better
surgeon line of sight.

In
2006 the Company introduced the Stryker Precision Oscillating Tip Saw.  In
contrast to standard surgical saws with oscillating blades, this innovative saw
has a stationary blade shaft with an oscillating tip.  This feature gives surgeons
the opportunity for greater accuracy while simplifying cuts and reducing the
potential for soft tissue damage.  This saw represents an advance in procedural
simplification, offering customers the potential for time and cost savings by
reducing the number of steps in the surgical process.

In
2006 the System 6 heavy duty, large-bone power system was released.  This
next-generation system, which  includes several new attachments, is more powerful
and has a longer battery life than its predecessor.  The System 6 Rotary
Handpieces provide more options to surgeons by allowing both high-speed
drilling and high-torque reaming in one handpiece.  System 6 Heavy Duty Saws
provide increased torque for a faster and more efficient cut.

In
2006 the Company launched the Silverglide Non-Stick bipolar forceps.  These
forceps rapidly diffuse heat, which eliminates localized sticking of tissue to
the instrument and thus reduces bleeding in neurosurgery procedures.

The
introduction of the Maestro drill in 2005 expanded Stryker's line of micro
powered instruments for spine, neurology and ENT applications.  Employing the
pneumatic technology that is the preference of many surgeons in these
specialties, the Maestro drill leverages the Company's TPS and CORE platforms
by using the same cutting attachments.  The CORE platform console is a
technological advancement on the precision and versatility offered by the TPS
console platform and offers integrated irrigation, multihandpiece functionality
and a standardized user interface.

Stryker
Instruments also produces products that are utilized in conjunction with joint
replacement surgery.  These products include the Revolution Cement Mixing
System, designed to provide one solution for mixing all surgical cements, in
addition to offering mixing efficacy, safety and ease of use; the Interpulse, a
disposable, self-

- - 13 -

contained pulsed lavage system used by physicians to cleanse
the surgical site during total joint arthroplasty; and the ConstaVac CBC II Blood Conservation System, a postoperative wound drainage and blood reinfusion device that
enables joint replacement patients to receive their own blood rather than donor
blood.

In
2005 the Company advanced its postsurgical technology with the introduction of
the Block Aid PainPump System.  This one product provides site-specific pain
management and also features a reprogrammable pump that is ideal for continuous
nerve blocks.  The Company also markets the PainPump2, a disposable system that
offers electronically controlled flow rates of pain medication directly to the
surgical site to help manage a patient's postoperative discomfort. This
innovative design allows the physician to program the pump and provides a
patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) option, previously unavailable to the market
in a disposable pump.

To
promote safety for patients and medical staff, Stryker works closely with
hospitals and other healthcare organizations to develop a broad product
portfolio.  In 2005 Stryker introduced its next-generation Steri-shield T5
Personal Protection System, which advances its market-leading helmet, hood and
gown to help protect operating room personnel from infection, cross-contamination
and harmful microorganisms.  This system employs advanced user-cooling features
and provides the option for integrated communication and lighting systems.  The
Neptune Waste Management System represents Stryker's leading product for waste
management in the operating room.  The self-contained device, first introduced
in 2000 and consistently improved, collects and disposes of fluid and smoke
waste from surgical procedures, minimizing the need for operator intervention
and therefore the risk of exposure to these waste products.  In 2007 Stryker
introduced the Neptune 2 Waste Management platform.  This next-generation
system allows for increased fluid collection capacity while enhancing end user
system preferences based on surgical procedures.

Through
Stryker Instruments, the Company offers SpinePlex, a variation of its surgical
Simplex bone cement for applications in the treatment of vertebral compression
fractures.  In 2006 the Company introduced the Discmonitor Discography System,
a disposable device used to inject fluid into the intervertebral disc nucleus
during discography procedures.  This system features a digital display and
allows physicians to save key data points for each disc.  Stryker's
radiofrequency generator system for chronic pain management, originally
introduced in 2004, was enhanced in 2006 with improved user interfaces, a
simplified operating system and the expansion of the cannula and electrode
offerings, including the industry's first monopolar nitinol electrode. Stryker
also offers the Dekompressor, a
single-use disposable device indicated for the percutaneous removal of disc
nucleus material, which offers an early, less invasive approach to mitigating
back and leg pain associated with contained lumbar herniations.  This product,
along with Stryker's offerings in percutaneous cement delivery, discography and
radiofrequency denervation, allows Stryker to focus on the interventional spine
marketplace.

Surgical Navigation
Systems

Through
Stryker Instruments, the Company offers a broad line of surgical navigation
systems that give surgeons in several specialties the ability to use electronic
imaging to see more clearly, better align instruments better and more accurately
track where the instruments are relative to a patient's anatomy during surgical
procedures.  In 2006 Stryker released two groundbreaking navigation
applications for the joint replacement and craniomaxillofacial implant
markets.  The eNdtrac ASM software and instrumentation give orthopaedic
surgeons the option of navigating their cuts while eliminating the need to
place additional pins in the femur and tibia outside of the surgical incision. 
The iNtellect software packages provide neurologic and ENT surgeons with enhanced
graphics, a significantly simplified image import process, customizable
procedure-specific workflows and user-friendly advanced tools for comprehensive
planning and navigation.

During
2005 the Company launched a number of new products across multiple surgical
specialties to better serve the surgical navigation marketplace.  For the knee
implant market, eNact Knee 3.1 software was introduced, further simplifying the
procedure via reactive workflow by leveraging Stryker's Smart Instrumentation
and Camera technology.  This unique technology promotes greater surgical
efficiency because the software automatically reacts to a surgeon's
individualized procedural workflow.  To serve the implant instrumentation
market, the Company introduced the OrthoLock Anchoring System, which allows for
less invasive procedures and provides surgeons a choice of two- or three-pin
tracker anchoring.  Stryker also released two major advancements in its Neuro
portfolio, Neuro 2.0 software and the Shunt Placement Tool.  Neuro 2.0
provides

- 14 -

surgeons the option of utilizing the Company's Mask technology to register the
patient without traditional fiducial markers and increases surgical efficiency
by significantly reducing intraoperative patient registration time.  In spine navigation,
Spine 1.2 software was released for support of complex spine procedures, such
as multiple-level scoliosis repair, requiring intraoperative 3D CT data.  Also
in 2005, a portable laptop navigation system was introduced; it has a smaller
footprint in the surgical suite, is easily portable, is cost efficient and
offers the functionality and technological advantages of Stryker's System II
Cart.

The
Company also offers the Navigation System II Cart and Camera as well as Hip 2.0,
Uni-knee and Knee 3.0 for use with the Stryker Navigation System.  All of these
product offerings are imageless platforms incorporating more intuitive hardware
and software functions that result in greater ease of use, less invasive
procedures and reduced surgical time.

high-definition (HD) camera systems, allow the physician to view internal
anatomy with a high degree of clarity.

In
2007 the Company launched the Stryker Digital Capture (SDC) Ultra, an
all-in-one medical imaging information management system allowing for patient
scheduling, video capture and storage, DVD burning and more.  The SDC Ultra
archives surgical images and videos on its 250-gigabyte internal hard drive. 
This system also allows for the recording of all surgical footage in
high-definition video.  Through dual-channel input support, the SDC Ultra can
capture images and video independently on two separate video channels, in
synchronized mode or in picture-in-picture format.

Also
in 2007 Stryker introduced the 45L PneumoSure insufflator which provides
exceptional performance with enhanced safety and reliability.  This new
insufflator is designed to handle the needs of today's dynamic surgical
environment and includes two additional modes for bariatric and vessel
harvesting.  The 45L PneumoSure insufflator offers real-time pressure sensing
for increased accuracy during a procedure.  Its ability to maintain
pneumoperitoneum under the most extreme conditions, coupled with a fully integrated
color touch screen, allows for increased ease of use.

In
2006 the Company introduced the 1188 HD Camera, the next generation of Stryker
3-Chip HD Cameras.  The 1188 HD offers superior picture quality, enhanced
clarity and more intuitive user controls.  This product provides surgical teams

Camera, the Company also introduced complementary products, such as the X8000
Lightsource and Vision Elect Monitor, that feature improvements over earlier
offerings.  In 2004 Stryker introduced the first HD medical video 3-chip
camera, the 1088 HD.  To accommodate the recording of HD images, the Company
introduced the SDC HD digital documentation system. 
Another milestone was the introduction of best-in-class scope technology with
the U-500 FlexVision flexible ureteroscope.  Also in 2004 Stryker launched its
Formula shaver system, which is small, light and equipped with radio frequency
identification (RFID), facilitating communication between the blade and console.

In
2006 Stryker launched the Infinity II Communication Platform, featuring an
intuitive customer interface and an open architecture.  This second-generation
model allows customers to run multiple PC

- - 15 -

applications from a single touch
screen and to route HD digital signals through the industry's first digital
video-imaging (DVI) board.

In
2005 the Company acquired eTrauma, which expanded the Company's digital imaging
equipment product offerings by adding eTrauma's proprietary PACS image
management and viewing software.  The PACS software was complemented by the
2005 launch of OrthoPad, Stryker's electronic medical records software.  In
2006 Stryker launched Office PACS 3.4, which provides seamless integration
between the clinic and the operating room.

Patient Handling and
Emergency Medical Equipment

Stryker
Medical is a leader in the stretcher products segment, offering a wide variety
of stretchers customized to fit the needs of acute care and specialty surgical
care facilities.  In 2006 Stryker Medical introduced the ACS Stretcher, a value

provides customers with three different mobility options to suit their
transportation needs: a fifth wheel for enhanced steering, Big Wheel technology
for increased maneuverability and the self-propelled Zoom technology.  All
three mobility options provide a safe and comfortable surface for patients
while reducing the risk of back injury for hospital staff.

Stryker
Medical also develops and manufactures beds and accessories that are designed
to meet the unique needs of specialty departments within the acute care
environment.  In 2007 the Company introduced the InTouch, the first high-acuity
care bed to combine advanced technology, intuitive operation and BackSmart
ergonomics to the benefit of both patients and caregivers.  The revolutionary
touch screen interface provides the caregiver with new insights into patient
metrics.  Protocol reminders such as patient turn schedules are customizable to
encourage best practices that have been proven to help improve patient
outcomes.  In 2005 Stryker introduced the XPRT nonintegrated sleep surface with
low air loss, percussion and rotational functions to aid in the prevention and
treatment of certain skin ulcers and pulmonary care.  Stryker also offers the
LD304 birthing bed, which features a removable foot section with the unique
Lock-Rite System, and the Go Bed II medical/surgical bed, which features low
bed-height for safe patient ingress and exit.  The Go Bed II also offers the
optional Chaperone center-of-gravity bed-exit system with Zone Control to help

design with an advanced electronic/hydraulic lift system that enables emergency
medical professionals to effortlessly raise and lower the cot with the press of
a button, which helps prevent caregiver back injuries.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

Most
of the Company's products and product improvements have been developed
internally.  The Company maintains close working relationships with physicians
and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist in product
research and development.  New and improved products play a critical role in
the Company's sales growth.  The Company continues to place emphasis on the
development of proprietary

- 16 -

products and product improvements to complement and
expand its existing product lines.  The Company has a decentralized research
and development focus, with manufacturing locations responsible for new product
development and product improvements.  Research, development and engineering personnel
at the various manufacturing locations maintain relationships with staff at distribution
locations and with customers to understand changes in the market and product
needs.

Total
expenditures for product research, development and engineering were $375.3
million in 2007, $324.6 million in 2006 and $284.7 million in 2005.  Research,
development and engineering expenses represented 6.3% of sales in 2007,
compared with 6.3% in 2006 and 6.2% in 2005.   The higher spending level is the
result of the Company's continued focus on new product development for
anticipated future product launches and continued investments in new
technologies.  Recent new product introductions in the Orthopaedic Implants and
MedSurg Equipment segments are more fully described under the caption "

Product Sales

" on pages


through 16 of this report.

In
addition to internally developed products, the Company invests in technologies
developed by third parties that have the potential to expand the markets in
which the Company operates.  Certain of these investments result in charges for
purchased in-process research and development.  The purchased in-process
research and development charges of $52.7 million recorded in 2006 and $15.9
million recorded in 2005 relate to the acquisitions of Sightline and PlasmaSol,
respectively.  At the dates of these acquisitions, the technologies acquired
from Sightline, a developer of flexible endoscopes, and PlasmaSol, a developer
of sterilization equipment, had not yet reached technological feasibility.

In 2004 the Company acquired SpineCore, a developer of
artificial lumbar and cervical discs.  Current products under development
include the FlexiCore lumbar artificial disc and the CerviCore cervical
artificial disc.  FlexiCore is currently involved in a U.S. clinical study under an approved IDE granted by the FDA.  Following completion of enrollment in
the clinical study during 2005, a 2-year patient follow-up is ongoing.  A PMA
application for the FlexiCore disc was submitted in 2007.  In 2007 Stryker completed
enrollment in a U.S. clinical trial of the CerviCore disc replacement product. 
Submission of a PMA application utilizing the resulting data from this study is
anticipated in 2009.  The Company anticipates receiving CE Marking approval in Europe for the CerviCore disc in 2008.

The
Company believes that the technologies acquired in the Sightline, PlasmaSol and
SpineCore acquisitions will result in the introduction of new products and
additional future sales. However, factors including regulatory delays, safety
concerns or patent disputes could delay the introduction or marketing of these
potential new products.  Additionally, unanticipated issues may arise that
could delay or terminate a product's development prior to regulatory approval
or commercialization, which could have an unfavorable impact on the Company's
operating results. As of December 31,
2007, the Company must refine certain product specifications highlighted during
customer preference trials and validate manufacturing
processes in order to achieve its plan for initial commercialization of the
flexible endoscope technologies in 2008.  As
of December 31, 2007, the Company had not encountered significant issues and
expects completion of the development and initial commercialization of the spinal disc implant technologies beginning in 2008 and the sterilization technology in 2010.

In
2006 the Company opened a new facility to support product development
activities across its manufacturing divisions.  Located near Delhi, India, the facility will provide software and mechanical engineering resources for divisional Research
& Development teams to accelerate new product innovation and it facilitates
the development and testing of Stryker's internal systems.  Over time, the
facility will also support local markets in Asia to expand the Company's
presence in that region.

The
Company's business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of
orthopaedic implant surgeries is lower during the summer months.

COMPETITION

The
Company is one of five leading competitors in the United States for orthopaedic
reconstructive products.  The four other leading competitors are DePuy
Orthopaedics, Inc. (a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson), Zimmer Holdings,
Inc., Biomet, Inc., and Smith & Nephew plc.  While competition abroad
varies from area to area, the Company believes it is also a leading player in
the international markets with these same companies as its principal
competitors.

In the trauma
implant segment, Stryker is one of five leaders competing principally with
Synthes, Inc., Smith & Nephew Orthopaedics (a division of Smith &
Nephew plc), Zimmer Holdings, Inc., and DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc.

In
the spinal implant segment, the Company is one of five leaders, competing
principally with Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Inc. (a subsidiary of Medtronic, Inc.),
DePuy Spine, Inc. (a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson), Synthes, Inc., and
Zimmer Holdings, Inc.

In
the craniomaxillofacial implant segment, Stryker is one of four leaders, competing
 principally with  Synthes, Inc., Walter Lorenz Surgical, Inc. (a subsidiary of
Biomet, Inc.), and KLS Martin L.P.

Several
companies are engaged in the research and development of products for the
repair of hard and soft tissues that, if approved, would compete with the
Company's OP-1 product.  Medtronic Sofamor Danek has received FDA approval for
its recombinant bone morphogenetic protein ("rhBMP-2") for certain
spine, trauma and orthopaedic indications, including the treatment of acute,
open fractures of the tibial shaft and spinal fusion surgeries.  A number of
companies currently provide various other therapies, including allografts, bone
fillers and electrical stimulation devices for the treatment, repair or
replacement of bone and joint tissue.  The Company believes that its OP-1 product,
which is approved for limited trauma and spine indications in certain markets
and is currently in clinical trials for other indications, will ultimately
compete with these products and with traditional therapies, such as autograft
and allograft.

In
the surgical equipment segment, Stryker is one of three leaders, competing
principally with Medtronic Midas Rex, Inc. (a subsidiary of Medtronic, Inc.),
and Linvatec, Inc. (a subsidiary of Conmed
Corporation).  These companies are also competitors in the international
segments, along with Aesculap-Werke AG (a division of B. Braun Melsungen AG), a
large European manufacturer.

In
the surgical navigation segment, Stryker is one of six principal competitors,
including Medtronic Surgical Navigation Technologies (a division of Medtronic,
Inc.), BrainLAB Inc. (a subsidiary of BrainLAB AG), Aesculap AG & Co. KG (a division of B. Braun Melsungen
AG), Radionics, Inc. (a subsidiary of Tyco

- 18 -

International Ltd.), and GE Medical
Systems Navigation and Visualization, Inc. (a subsidiary of General Electric
Company).

In
the arthroscopy segment, the Company is one of four leaders, together with the
principal competitors Smith & Nephew Endoscopy (a division of Smith &
Nephew plc), Linvatec, Inc., and Arthrex, Inc.  In the laparoscopic imaging
products segment, the Company is one of three leaders, together with the
principal competitors, Karl Storz GmbH & Co. (a German company) and Olympus
Optical Co. Ltd. (a Japanese company).

The
Company's primary competitor in the patient handling segment is Hill-Rom
Company, Inc. (a division of Hillenbrand Industries, Inc.).  In the specialty
stretcher segment, the primary competitors are Hausted, Inc. (a subsidiary of Steris Corporation), Hill-Rom Company,
Inc., and Midmark Hospital Products Group (a subsidiary of Ohio Medical
Instrument Company, Inc.).  In the emergency medical services segment,
Ferno-Washington, Inc., is the Company's principal competitor.

The principal
factors that the Company believes differentiate it in the highly competitive
market segments in which it operates and enable it to compete effectively are
innovation, reliability, service and reputation.  The Company believes that its
competitive position in the future will depend to a large degree on its ability
to develop new products and make improvements to existing products.  While the
Company does not consider patents a major factor in its overall competitive
success, patents and trademarks are significant to the extent that a product or
an attribute of a product represents a unique design or process.  Patent 
protection of such products restricts competitors from duplicating these unique
designs and features.  Stryker seeks to obtain patent protection on its
products whenever possible.  The Company currently owns approximately 1,020 United States patents and 1,320 international patents.

MANUFACTURING AND SOURCES OF SUPPLY

The
Company's manufacturing processes consist primarily of precision machining,
metal fabrication and assembly operations; the forging and investment casting
of cobalt chrome; and the finishing of cobalt chrome and titanium.  In
addition, the Company is the sole manufacturer of its OP-1 product. 
Approximately 12% of the Company's cost of sales in 2007 represented finished
products that were purchased complete from outside suppliers.  The Company also
purchases parts and components, such as forgings, castings, gears, bearings,
casters and electrical components, and uses outside sources for certain
finishing operations, such as plating, hardening and coating of machined
components and sterilization of certain products.  The principal raw materials
used by the Company are stainless steel, aluminum, cobalt chrome and titanium
alloys.  In all, purchased parts and components from outside sources were
approximately 51% of the total cost of sales in 2007.

While
the Company relies on single sources for certain purchased materials and
services, it believes alternate sources are available if needed.  The Company
has not experienced any significant difficulty in the past in obtaining the
materials necessary to meet its production schedules.

Substantially
all products manufactured by the Company are stocked in inventory, while
certain products manufactured within the Company's MedSurg Equipment segment
are assembled to order.

REGULATION AND PRODUCT QUALITY

The
Medical Device Amendments of 1976 to the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act
and the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990, together with regulations issued or
proposed thereunder, provide for regulation by the FDA of the design,
manufacture and marketing of medical devices, including most of the Company's
products.

The FDA's
Quality System regulations set forth standards for the Company's product design
and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records and
provide for inspections of the Company's facilities by the FDA.  There are also
certain requirements of state, local and foreign governments that must be complied with
in the manufacturing and marketing of the Company's products.

- 19 -

In
2007 the Company received two warning letters from the FDA regarding compliance
with certain quality system specifications at its reconstructive implant
manufacturing facilities: one letter for its facility in Cork, Ireland and
another for its facility in Mahwah, New Jersey.  The Company
takes these matters very seriously and has been fully cooperating with the FDA
to address their observations.

Most
of the Company's new products fall into FDA classifications that require notification
of and review by the FDA before marketing, submitted as a 510(k).  The
Company's FlexiCore and CerviCore artificial disc products and OP-1 products
require extensive clinical testing, consisting of safety and efficacy studies,
followed by PMA applications for specific surgical indications.

Stryker also is
subject to the laws that govern the manufacture and distribution of medical
devices of each country in which the Company manufactures or sells products. 
The member states of the European Union (EU) have adopted the European Medical
Device Directives, which create a single set of medical device regulations for
all EU member countries.  These regulations require companies that wish to
manufacture and distribute medical devices in EU member countries to obtain CE
Marking for their products.  Stryker has authorization to apply the CE Marking to
substantially all of its products.  The Company's OP-1 product has been
considered a drug under the regulations for Europe, Australia and Japan.

Initiatives
sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector to
limit the growth of healthcare expenses generally and hospital costs in
particular, including price regulation and competitive pricing, are ongoing in
markets where the Company does business.  It is not possible to predict at this
time the long-term impact of such cost-containment measures on the Company's
future business.

EMPLOYEES

At
December 31, 2007, the Company had 16,026 employees worldwide, including 6,643
involved in manufacturing, warehousing and distribution operations; 6,138 in
sales and marketing; 1,424 in research, development and engineering; and the
balance in general management and administration.  Certain international
employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are updated
annually.  The Company believes that its employee relations are satisfactory.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

The
following information contains specific risks that could potentially impact the
Company's business, financial condition or operating results.  The Company may
be subject to additional risks that are not currently known to the Company or
those which the Company deems immaterial that may also impact its business
operations.

The
Company's inability to maintain adequate working relationships with healthcare
professionals could have a negative impact on the Company's future operating
results.

The
Company maintains close working relationships with respected physicians and
medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist in product research
and development.  The Company continues to place emphasis on the
development of proprietary products and product improvements to complement and
expand its existing product lines.  If the Company is unable to maintain
these good relationships, its ability to market and sell new and improved
products could decrease, and future operating results could be unfavorably
affected.

The Company's inability
to continue to hire and retain key employees could have a negative impact on
the Company's future operating results.

The talent and
drive of the Company's employees are key factors in the success of its
business.  The Company's sales, technical and other key personnel play an
integral role in the development, marketing and selling of new and existing
products.  If the Company is unable to recruit, hire, develop and retain a
talented, competitive work force, it may not be able to meet its strategic
business objectives.

Stricter pricing
guidelines for the Orthopaedic Implants industry could have a negative impact
on the Company's future operating results.

Initiatives
sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector to
limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation and
competitive pricing, are ongoing in markets where the Company does business. 
The Company could experience a negative impact on its operating results due to
increased pricing pressure in the United States, Japan and certain other
markets.  Governments, hospitals and other third party payers could reduce the
amount of approved reimbursements for the Company's Orthopaedic Implant
products.  Reductions in reimbursement levels or coverage, or other
cost-containment measures could unfavorably affect the Company's future
operating results.

The Company's operating
results could be negatively impacted by changes in its excess and obsolete
inventory reserves.

The Company
maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the
potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current
carrying costs. The markets in which the Company operates are highly
competitive, and new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an
ongoing basis.  Such marketplace changes may cause some of the Company's
products to become obsolete.  The Company makes estimates regarding the future
recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for
excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience, expiration of
sterilization dates and expected future trends.  If actual product life cycles,
product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable
than projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required,
which could unfavorably affect future operating results.

The Company's operating
results could be negatively impacted if it is unable to capitalize on research
and development spending.

The Company has
spent a significant amount of time and resources on research and development
projects in order to develop and validate new and innovative products.  The
Company believes these projects will result in the manufacturing of new
products and will create additional future sales.  However, factors including
regulatory

- - 21 -

delays, safety concerns or patent disputes could delay the
introduction or marketing of new products.  Additionally, unanticipated issues
may arise in connection with current and future clinical studies, including
those for additional OP-1 applications and the FlexiCore and CerviCore spinal
implant products, that could delay or terminate a product's development prior
to regulatory approval.  The Company may experience an unfavorable impact on
its operating results if it is unable to capitalize on those efforts by
attaining the proper FDA approval or to successfully market these and other new
products, including the Sightline flexible endoscope products and the PlasmaSol
sterilization products.

The Company's operating
results could be negatively impacted by future product liability claims,
unfavorable court decisions, regulatory compliance or legal settlements.

The Company is a
defendant in various proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the
normal course of business, including product liability and other matters.  Such
matters are subject to many uncertainties, and outcomes are not predictable
with assurance.  To partially mitigate losses arising from unfavorable outcomes
in such matters, the Company purchases third-party insurance coverage subject
to certain deductibles and loss limitations.  While the Company believes its
current insurance coverage is adequate to mitigate losses arising from such
matters, its future operating results may be unfavorably impacted by any
settlement payments or losses beyond the amounts of insurance carried. 
Likewise, the Company may incur significant legal expenses regardless of
whether it is found to be liable.  In addition, such product liability
settlements may negatively impact the Company's ability to obtain
cost-effective third-party insurance coverage in future periods.

In 2007 the Company disclosed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has made an informal inquiry of the Company
regarding possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in
connection with the sale of medical devices in certain foreign countries. Subsequently,
in 2008, the Company received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice,
Criminal Division, requesting certain documents for the period January 1, 2000
through the present in connection with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission inquiry.  In 2006 the Company announced that it received a subpoena
from the U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, requesting documents
for the period January 2001 through the present regarding possible violations
of federal criminal law, including possible violation of the antitrust laws,
relating to the manufacture and sale of orthopaedic implant devices.  Stryker
is fully cooperating with the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission regarding these matters.

In 2007 the
Company reached a resolution with the U.S. Attorney's office for the District
of New Jersey in connection with a previously announced investigation relating
to "any and all consulting contracts,
professional service agreements, or remuneration agreements between Stryker
Corporation and any orthopedic surgeon, orthopedic surgeon in training, or
medical school graduate using or considering the surgical use of hip or knee
joint replacement/reconstruction products manufactured or sold by Stryker
Corporation."  The resolution is in the form of a non-prosecution
agreement for an 18-month period. During the term of the agreement, the
Company's Orthopaedics subsidiary is subject to oversight by a federal monitor,
as appointed by the U.S. Attorney, regarding compliance with certain standards
and procedures in connection with the retention and payment of orthopaedic
surgeon consultants related to reconstructive products and the provision of
certain benefits to such surgeons.

In 2007 the Company received two warning letters from the FDA regarding
compliance with certain quality system specifications at its reconstructive
implant manufacturing facilities: one letter for its facility in Cork, Ireland and
another for its facility in Mahwah, New Jersey.  The Company
takes these matters very seriously and has been fully cooperating with the FDA
to address their observations.

As a result of
these investigations, the Company's future operating results could be
negatively impacted by settlements of these matters.

The Company's operating
results could be negatively impacted by economic, political or other
developments in countries in which the Company does business.

Future operating
results could be negatively impacted by unstable economic, political and social
conditions, including but not limited to fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates, political instability, or

- 22 -

changes in the
interpretation or creation of laws and regulations in each of the countries where the Company
conducts business, including the United States.  Additionally, the Company
operates in multiple income tax jurisdictions and must determine the
appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions based on
current interpretations of complex income tax regulations.  Income tax audits
associated with the allocation of income and other complex issues may result in
significant income tax adjustments that could negatively impact the Company's
future operating results.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The
Company is involved in various proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in
the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor,
intellectual property and other matters which are more fully described in Note
14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  The potential future outcomes of these matters are outside of management's
complete control and will generally not be known for prolonged periods of
time.  In certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek damages, as well
as other compensatory relief, which could result in the payment of significant
claims and settlements.  In legal matters for which management has sufficient
information to reasonably estimate the Company's future obligations, a
liability representing management's best estimate of the probable cost for the
resolution of these legal matters is recorded.  The estimates are based on
consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement
strategies.  The Company does not anticipate material losses as a result of
these proceedings beyond amounts already provided in the accompanying
Consolidated Financial Statements.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Throughout this discussion, references are made
to the following financial measures:  "constant currency," "adjusted net
earnings from continuing operations," "adjusted basic net earnings per share
from continuing operations" and "adjusted diluted net earnings per share from
continuing operations."  These financial measures are an alternative
representation of Stryker Corporation's (the Company or Stryker) past and
potential future operational performance and do not replace the presentation of
the Company's reported financial results under U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP). The Company has provided these supplemental
non-GAAP financial measures because they provide meaningful information
regarding the Company's results on a consistent and comparable basis for the
periods presented.  Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for
reviewing the operating results of its business segments, for analyzing
potential future business trends in connection with its budget process and
bases certain annual bonus plans on these non-GAAP financial measures.  In
order to measure the Company's sales performance on a constant currency basis,
it is necessary to remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange
rates which affects the comparability and trend of sales.  Constant currency
results are calculated by translating current year results at prior year
average foreign currency exchange rates.  In order to measure earnings
performance on a consistent and comparable basis, the Company excludes the
intangible asset impairment charge recorded in 2007, the purchased in-process
research and development charges recorded in 2006 and 2005 and the additional
income taxes associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings recorded in
2005, each of which affects the comparability of operating results and the
trend of earnings.  Additional details regarding the nature, determination and
financial statement impact of these items are included in

Results of
Operations

.  In addition, the Company believes investors will utilize this
information to evaluate period-to-period results on a comparable basis and to
better understand potential future operating results.  The Company encourages
investors and other users of these financial statements to review its Consolidated
Financial Statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and not
to rely solely on any single financial measure.

Executive Level Overview

Stryker
is one of the world's leading medical technology companies with the most
broadly based range of products in orthopaedics and a significant presence in
other medical specialties.  Stryker works with respected medical professionals
to help people lead more active and more satisfying lives.  The Company's
products include implants used in joint replacement, trauma, spinal and
craniomaxillofacial surgeries; biologics; surgical, neurologic, ear, nose &
throat and interventional pain equipment; endoscopic, surgical navigation,
communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient handling and
emergency medical equipment.

The Company segregates its operations into two
reportable business segments: Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  The
Orthopaedic Implants segment sells orthopaedic reconstructive (hip, knee and
shoulder), trauma, spinal and craniomaxillofacial implant systems, bone cement
and the bone growth factor OP-1.  The MedSurg Equipment segment sells surgical
equipment; surgical navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital
imaging systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. 
The Other category includes corporate administration, interest expense and
interest and marketable securities income.

Domestic
sales accounted for 64% of total revenues in 2007.  Most of the Company's
products are marketed directly to doctors, hospitals and other healthcare
facilities by approximately 3,500 sales and marketing personnel in the United States.  Stryker primarily maintains separate and dedicated sales forces for each of
its principal product lines to provide focus and a high level of expertise to
each medical specialty served.

International
sales accounted for 36% of total revenues in 2007.  The Company's products are
sold in more than 100 countries through Company-owned sales subsidiaries and branches
as well as third-party dealers and distributors.

- 27 -

The
Company's business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of
orthopaedic implant surgeries is lower during the summer months.

In 2007 the Company
announced that it reached a resolution with the U.S. Attorney's office for the
District of New Jersey in connection with a previously announced investigation
relating to "any and all consulting contracts,
professional service agreements, or remuneration agreements between Stryker Corporation
and any orthopedic surgeon, orthopedic surgeon in training, or medical school
graduate using or considering the surgical use of hip or knee joint
replacement/reconstruction products manufactured or sold by Stryker
Corporation."  The resolution is in the form of a non-prosecution
agreement for an 18-month period. During the term of the agreement, the
Company's Orthopaedics subsidiary is subject to oversight by a federal monitor,
as appointed by the U.S. Attorney, regarding compliance with certain standards
and procedures in connection with the retention and payment of orthopaedic
surgeon consultants related to reconstructive products and the provision of
certain benefits to such surgeons.

In 2007 the Company sold its outpatient physical therapy business,
Physiotherapy Associates, to Water Street Healthcare Partners, for $150.0
million in cash less certain indebtedness.  Physiotherapy Associates' operating
results are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.  Additional
details, including the financial statement impact resulting from this
divestiture, are included in

Results of Operations

and

Other Matters

.

In 2007 the Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes

.  This
Interpretation clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the
minimum recognition threshold an income tax position is required to meet before
being recognized in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.  The
Interpretation also provides guidance for the measurement and classification of
income tax positions, interest and penalties, and requires additional
disclosure on an annual basis.  Additional details,
including the financial statement impact resulting from this adoption, are
included in

Results of Operations

.

In
2006 the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Sightline
Technologies Ltd. (Sightline), a private, development-stage company, for an
upfront payment of $50.0 million in cash plus certain transaction costs and the
assumption of certain liabilities.  Sightline has developed flexible endoscopes
that should improve insertion and sterilization during colonoscopy procedures. 
Terms of the transaction also include milestone payments of up to an additional
$90.0 million upon the achievement of certain operational and financial targets
related to Sightline's products, the first of which is expected to occur in
2008.  This acquisition is expected to enhance the Company's presence in the
gastrointestinal and other markets within its MedSurg Equipment segment.

In 2005 the Company acquired,
by merger, all of the outstanding stock of PlasmaSol Corp. (PlasmaSol). 
PlasmaSol has developed a technology that should allow Stryker to provide
sterilization equipment for use with certain of its MedSurg Equipment products. 
The cost of the transaction totaled $17.5 million, including an upfront cash
payment plus the assumption of certain liabilities.

In
2005 the Company acquired, by merger, all of the outstanding stock of
eTrauma.com Corp. (eTrauma) for $50.0 million in cash plus certain transaction
costs.  The acquisition expanded the Company's digital imaging equipment
product offerings within its MedSurg Equipment segment by adding eTrauma's
proprietary Picture Archive and Communications Systems (PACS) image management
and viewing software.

Sightline's, PlasmaSol's and eTrauma's operating results are included in the
Company's Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of the acquisitions
and did not materially impact the Company's operating results.  Pro forma
consolidated results of operations would not differ significantly as a result
of these acquisitions.  Additional details, including the financial statement
impacts resulting from these acquisitions, are included in

Results of
Operations.

- - 28 -

In
2005 the Company completed the repatriation of $722 million of foreign earnings
under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act (the Act).  The Act
provided a temporary incentive for U.S. companies to repatriate accumulated
income earned in foreign jurisdictions at a reduced income tax cost. 
Additional details, including the financial statement impact resulting from the
repatriation of funds, are included in

Results of Operations

.

Outlook for 2008

The
Company's outlook for 2008 continues to be optimistic regarding underlying
growth rates in orthopaedic procedures and sales growth in the Company's
broadly based range of products in orthopaedics and other medical specialties,
despite the potential for increased pricing pressure in certain markets.  The
Company projects that diluted net earnings per share for 2008 will approximate
$2.88, representing a 22% increase over diluted net earnings per share from
continuing operations of $2.37 for the year ended December 31, 2007.  Excluding the impact
of the charge to reflect the intangible asset impairment in 2007, as more fully
described in

Results of Operations

, the Company projects that diluted
net earnings per share for 2008 will increase 20% over adjusted diluted net
earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.40 for the year ended December
31, 2007.

The financial
forecast for 2008 includes a constant currency net sales increase in the range
of 11% to 13% as a result of growth in shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and
MedSurg Equipment.  If foreign currency exchange rates hold near December 31,
2007 levels, the Company anticipates a favorable impact on net sales of
approximately 2.5% to 3% in the first quarter of 2008 and a favorable impact on
net sales of approximately 1% to 1.5% for the full year of 2008.

2007 Compared with 2006

The Company's net sales increased
17% in 2007 to $6,000.5 million from $5,147.2 million in 2006.  Net sales grew by 14% as a result of increased unit
volume and changes in product mix and by 3% due to favorable changes in foreign
currency exchange rates.

The Company's domestic sales were $3,850.3 million for
2007, representing an increase of 17%, and international sales were $2,150.2
million for 2007, representing an increase of 16%, as a result of higher
shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  The impact of foreign currency
comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $131.5 million for 2007.  On a constant currency basis,
international sales increased 9% in 2007.

Worldwide
sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $3,570.7 million for 2007, representing an
increase of 15% as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive, trauma,
spinal and craniomaxillofacial implant systems; bone cement; and the bone
growth factor OP-1.  On a constant currency basis, sales of Orthopaedic
Implants increased 12% in 2007.

Hip
Implant Systems:

Sales of hip
implant systems increased 9% during the year (6% on a constant currency basis).
In the United States, sales growth was driven by sales of X3 polyethylene and
Accolade cementless hip products, partially offset by declines in other hip
systems.

Solid sales growth in the Exeter, Trident, X3 polyethylene and
Accolade hip products in Europe, the Pacific region and the Latin America
region also led to the Company's constant currency sales growth for 2007.

Knee
Implant Systems:

Sales of knee
implant systems increased 16% during the year (13% on a constant currency
basis) due to strong growth in the Triathlon Knee System in the United States, Europe, Canada and the Pacific region and solid growth in the Scorpio Knee System in
Europe, the Pacific region and the Latin America region.

- - 31 -

Trauma
Implant Systems:

Sales of trauma
implant systems increased 19% in 2007 (15% on a constant currency basis) as a
result of strong sales growth in the Gamma3 Hip Fracture System in the United
States, Europe, Canada and the Pacific region as well as solid sales growth in
the Company's T2 Nailing System in the United States and Europe, partially
offset by a sales decline in Japan as a result of government-imposed price
cuts.

Spinal
Implant Systems:

Sales of spinal
implant systems increased 25% in 2007 (23% on a constant currency basis). 
Sales growth for 2007 was driven by strong worldwide sales growth of
thoracolumbar implant systems, interbody devices and cervical implants.

Craniomaxillofacial
Implant Systems:

Sales of
craniomaxillofacial implant systems increased 17% in 2007 (14% on a constant
currency basis) primarily due to strong sales growth of products for
neurological indications and craniomaxillofacial implants in the United States, Europe and the Pacific region.

Worldwide
sales of MedSurg Equipment were $2,429.8 million for 2007, representing an
increase of 19% as a result of higher shipments of surgical equipment; surgical
navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as
well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment.  On a constant
currency basis, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 17% in 2007.

Surgical
Equipment and Surgical Navigation Systems:

Sales of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems increased
20% in  2007 (17% on a constant currency basis) due to strong sales growth in
powered surgical and operating room equipment in the United States, Europe and
the Pacific region.  Solid sales growth in interventional pain products in Europe also led to the Company's constant currency sales growth.

Endoscopic, Communications and Digital Imaging Systems:

Sales
of endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems increased 21% in 2007
(19% on a constant currency basis) as a result of strong worldwide sales growth
of medical video imaging equipment led by the 1188 HD Camera and complementary
products such as the X8000 Lightsource and Vision Elect Monitor.  Strong sales
growth in arthroscopy and communication products in the United States, Europe and the Pacific region also led to the Company's constant currency sales
growth.

Patient Handling and Emergency Medical Equipment:

Sales of
patient handling and emergency medical equipment increased 16% in 2007 (15% on
a constant currency basis) due to strong sales growth of stretchers and
emergency medical equipment in the United States and Europe.  In addition,
constant currency sales growth in 2007 was led by strong sales growth in
hospital beds in the United States as well as strong sales growth in maternity
beds in the United States, Canada, Europe and the Latin America region.

Cost of sales represented 31.1% of sales in 2007 compared
with 31.4% in 2006.  The cost of sales percentage in 2007 was favorably
impacted by efficiencies gained within manufacturing plants and product
distribution channels.

Research, development and engineering
expenses represented 6.3% of sales for both 2007 and 2006. These expenses increased 16% in 2007 to $375.3 million.  The higher
spending level is the result of the Company's continued focus on new product
development for anticipated future product launches and continued investments
in new technologies.  New product introductions in 2007 for the Orthopaedic
Implants segment included the condylar stabilizing (CS) ultra-congruent insert
for the Triathlon Knee System; the Scorpio NRG with X3 advanced bearing
technology; and the Omega 3 Compression Hip Screw System.  Within the MedSurg Equipment segment, new product
introductions in 2007 included InTouch, a high-acuity care bed; the SDC Ultra,
an all-in-one medical imaging information management system; the CORE Sumex drill,
designed for use in ENT procedures; and the 45L PneumoSure insufflator.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 17% in 2007
and represented 39.9% of sales compared with 39.8% in 2006.  The slight
increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales
in 2007 is due to higher sales-related costs, primarily compensation and
increased regulatory compliance-

related costs,
partially offset by decreases in insurance costs and slower growth in
discretionary spending.

In 2007 the Company recorded a
$19.8 million charge ($12.7 million net of income taxes) to write off patents
associated with intervertebral body fusion cage products.  The impairment
followed a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) decision to downgrade
certain intervertebral body fusion products to class II devices, along with a
weak market for sales of these specific products.  As a result, the Company
performed a discounted cash flow analysis over the remaining life of the
patented technologies and determined that the charge was required.

The
purchased in-process research and development charge of $52.7 million recorded
in 2006 relates to the acquisition of Sightline.  At the date of the
acquisition, the flexible endoscope technologies acquired had not yet reached
technological feasibility.  The upfront payment of $50.0 million, plus certain
transaction costs and the assumption of certain liabilities, was allocated to
assets acquired, purchased in-process research and development and liabilities
assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition.  The amount written off as purchased in-process
research and development was not deductible for income tax purposes in the United States.

The
Company believes that the technologies acquired in the Sightline acquisition
will result in the introduction of new products and additional future sales. 
However, unanticipated issues may arise that could delay or terminate a
product's development prior to commercialization, which could have an
unfavorable impact on the Company's operating results.  As of December 31,
2007, the Company must refine certain product specifications highlighted during
customer preference trials and validate manufacturing processes in order to
achieve its plan for initial commercialization of the flexible endoscope
technologies in 2008.

Interest
and marketable securities income, which is included in other income (expense),
increased to $85.5 million in 2007 from $41.4 million in 2006 primarily as a
result of increased cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities
balances in 2007 compared to 2006. Interest expense, which is included
in other income (expense), increased to $22.2 million in 2007 from $9.5 million
in 2006, primarily as a result of interest expense associated with unresolved
income tax positions.

The Company's effective income tax rate on
earnings from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 was
28.0% compared to an effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31,
2006 of 29.5%. The
effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflects the impact of the intangible asset
impairment charge of $12.7 million (net of $7.1 million income tax benefit). 
The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflects the
impact of the nondeductibility for income tax purposes of the purchased
in-process research and development charge associated with the acquisition of
Sightline. After
considering these factors, the Company's reported effective income tax rates
for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily as a result of manufacturing in lower income tax
international jurisdictions.

Upon adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 48, the Company
recognized an increase in the interest expense accrual associated with
unresolved income tax positions, which was accounted for by reducing the
January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings by $7.6 million (net of income
taxes).  In addition, the Company reclassified $179.2 million from the
current income taxes liability to noncurrent liabilities to match the
anticipated timing of future income tax payments.

Net earnings from continuing
operations increased
28% in 2007 to $986.7
million from $771.4 million in 2006. 
Basic net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 27% in 2007
to $2.41 from $1.90 in 2006, and diluted net earnings per share from continuing
operations increased 27% in 2007 to $2.37 from $1.87 in 2006.

Excluding the impacts of the charges to reflect the intangible asset
impairment in 2007 and to write off purchased in-process research and
development recorded in 2006, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations
increased 21% in 2007 to $999.4 million from $824.1 million in 2006. 
Adjusted basic net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 20%
in 2007 to $2.44 from $2.03 in 2006, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share
from continuing operations increased 20% in 2007 to $2.40 from $2.00 in 2006.

The sale of Physiotherapy Associates resulted in a gain on
sale of discontinued operations of $25.7 million (net of income taxes), or $.06
per diluted share in 2007.  Net earnings from discontinued operations for the
year ended December 31, 2007 were $5.0 million, or $.01 per diluted share,
compared to net earnings from discontinued operations of $6.3 million, or $.02
per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Net earnings increased 31% in 2007
to $1,017.4 million from $777.7 million in 2006. Basic net earnings per share
increased 30% in 2007 to $2.48 from $1.91 in 2006, and diluted net earnings per
share increased 29% in 2007 to $2.44 from $1.89 in 2006.

2006 Compared with 2005

The Company's net
sales increased 12% in 2006 to $5,147.2 million from $4,608.9 million in
2005.  Net sales grew by 11% as a result of increased unit volume and changes
in product mix and 1% as a result of higher selling prices.

Domestic sales were
$3,298.4 million for 2006, representing an increase of 14% as a result of
higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  International
sales were $1,848.8 million for 2006, representing an increase of 8% as a
result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  The
impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international
sales was unfavorable by $5.2 million for 2006.  On a constant currency basis,
international sales increased 9% in 2006.

- - 34 -

Worldwide
sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $3,110.1 million for 2006, representing an
increase of 9%, on both a reported and constant currency basis, as a result of
higher shipments of reconstructive, trauma, spinal and craniomaxillofacial implant
systems; bone cement; and the bone growth factor OP-1.

Hip
Implant Systems:

Sales of hip
implant systems increased 2% during the year on both a reported and constant
currency basis.  In the United States, sales growth was driven by sales of the
recently launched X3 polyethylene and increased sales in Accolade cementless
hip products and Restoration Modular Hip System revision hip products,
partially offset by declines in sales of other hip systems.  Solid growth in
the Trident Hip System, Accolade cementless hip products and Restoration
Modular Hip System revision hip products in Europe as well as solid growth in
Accolade cementless hip products and the Trident Hip System in the Pacific
region also contributed to the sales growth in hip implant systems.

Knee
Implant Systems:

Sales of knee
implant systems increased 12% during the year, on both a reported and constant
currency basis, due to strong growth in the Triathlon Knee System in the United
States, Europe and the Pacific region and solid growth in the Scorpio Knee
System in most international markets, partially offset by slower growth in
Japan as a result of government imposed price cuts.

Trauma
Implant Systems:

Sales of trauma
implant systems increased 13% during the year (14% on a constant currency
basis) due to strong worldwide sales growth in the Gamma3 Hip Fracture System
and strong sales growth in the T2 Nailing System in the United States and Europe, partially offset by slower growth in Japan as a result of the price cuts.

Spinal
Implant Systems:

Sales of spinal
implant systems increased 18% during the year, on both a reported and constant
currency basis, primarily due to strong worldwide sales growth of interbody
devices led by sales of the AVS vertebral spacer system as well as solid worldwide
sales growth in thoracolumbar products.

Craniomaxillofacial
Implant Systems:

Sales of
craniomaxillofacial implant systems increased 16% during the year, on both a
reported and constant currency basis, as a result of strong domestic sales
growth led by products for neurologic indications and craniomaxillofacial
implants.

Worldwide
sales of MedSurg Equipment were $2,037.1 million for 2006, representing an
increase of 16%, on both a reported and constant currency basis, as a result of
higher shipments of surgical equipment; surgical navigation systems;
endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient
handling and emergency medical equipment.

Surgical
Equipment and Surgical Navigation Systems:

Sales of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems increased
12% during the year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, due to
strong domestic sales growth in surgical navigation systems and operating room
equipment and solid domestic sales growth in interventional pain products. 
Strong sales growth in powered surgical instruments outside the United States also led to the Company's sales growth.

Endoscopic,
Communications and Digital Imaging Systems:

Sales of endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems increased
19% during the year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, as a
result of strong worldwide sales growth in medical video imaging equipment led
by the recently launched 1188 HD Camera and related accessories as well as
imaging and communications products.  Strong worldwide sales growth in general
surgery products also contributed to the Company's sales growth.

Patient
Handling and Emergency Medical Equipment:

Sales of patient handling and emergency medical equipment increased 18%
during the year (17% on a constant currency basis) due to strong sales growth
in hospital bed products in the United States, the Latin America region and
Canada, strong domestic sales growth in emergency medical equipment as well as
solid stretcher sales growth in Europe and the Latin America region.

- - 35 -

Cost
of sales represented 31.4% of sales in 2006 compared with 32.3% in 2005.  The
lower cost of sales percentage in 2006 is primarily due to lower excess and
obsolete inventory costs as a result of fewer comparative product introductions
during the year and reduced royalty costs related to the expiration of certain
royalty agreements partially offset by faster sales growth in the lower margin
MedSurg Equipment segment.

Research,
development and engineering expenses represented 6.3% of sales in 2006 compared
with 6.2% in 2005.  These expenses increased 14% in 2006 to $324.6 million. 
The higher spending level is the result of the Company's continued focus on new
product development for anticipated future product launches and continued
investments in new technologies.  New product introductions in 2006 for the
Orthopaedic Implants segment included the LFIT Anatomic Femoral Heads with X3
polyethylene liners, which address range of motion and dislocation potential, and the AVS AS
Spacer, which is used for anterior lumbar interbody fusion.  Within the MedSurg Equipment segment, new product
introductions in 2006 included the 1188
HD Camera and related accessories, the next generation of Stryker 3-Chip HD
Cameras, the System 6 heavy duty power system and the Stryker Precision
Oscillating Tip Saw, which features a stationary blade shaft with an
oscillating tip.

Selling,
general and administrative expenses increased 11% in 2006 and represented 39.8%
of sales compared with 39.9% in 2005.  The slight decrease in selling, general
and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in 2006 is due to
decreases in insurance costs and slower growth in discretionary spending,
partially offset by higher sales-related costs, primarily compensation, loaner
instrumentation amortization and sample expenses.

The
purchased in-process research and development charge of $52.7 million recorded
in 2006 relates to the acquisition of Sightline. The purchased in-process
research and development charge of $15.9 million recorded in 2005 relates to
the acquisition of PlasmaSol.  At the date of the PlasmaSol acquisition, the
sterilization technology acquired had not yet been approved for sale by the FDA
and, therefore, had not yet reached technological feasibility.  The purchase
price of $17.5 million was allocated to assets acquired, primarily for deferred
income tax assets associated with acquired net operating losses, and purchased
in-process research and development based on their fair value at the date of
acquisition.  The amounts written off as purchased in-process research and
development were not deductible for income tax purposes in the United States.

The
Company believes that the technologies acquired in both the Sightline and
PlasmaSol acquisitions will result in the introduction of new products and
additional future sales.  However, unanticipated issues may arise that could
delay or terminate a product's development prior to regulatory approval or
commercialization, which could have an unfavorable impact on the Company's
operating results.  As previously described, as of December 31, 2007, the
Company must refine certain product specifications highlighted during customer
preference trials and validate manufacturing processes in order to achieve its
plan for initial commercialization of the flexible endoscope technologies in
2008.  As of December 31, 2007, the Company had not encountered significant
issues and expects completion of the development and initial commercialization
of the sterilization technologies in 2010.

Interest and marketable securities income,
which is included in other income (expense), increased to $41.4 million in 2006
from $13.3 million in 2005, primarily as a result of increased cash and cash
equivalents and marketable securities balances in 2006 compared to 2005. 
Interest expense, which is included in other income (expense), increased to
$9.5 million in 2006 from $7.7 million in 2005, primarily as a result of
borrowings in Europe to complete the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005.

The Company's effective income tax rate on
earnings from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 was
29.5% as compared to an effective income tax rate for the year ended December
31, 2005 of 32.5%.  The effective income tax rate for the year ended December
31, 2006 reflects the impact of the nondeductibility for income tax purposes of
the purchased in-process research and development charge associated with the
acquisition of Sightline.  The effective income tax rate for the year ended
December 31, 2005 reflects the impact of the nondeductibility for income tax
purposes of the purchased in-process research and development charge associated
with the acquisition of PlasmaSol as well as the additional $27.4 million of
income taxes recorded as a result of the repatriation of foreign earnings. 
After considering these factors, the Company's reported effective income tax
rates for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 are lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily as a result of manufacturing in lower income tax
international jurisdictions.

Net earnings from continuing
operations increased 22% in 2006 to
$771.4 million from $632.5 million in 2005. 
Basic net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 21% in 2006
to $1.90 from $1.57 in 2005, and diluted net earnings per share from continuing
operations increased 21% in 2006 to $1.87
from $1.54 in 2005.

Excluding the impacts of the
charges to write off purchased in-process research and development in 2006 and
2005 and to recognize the income tax expense associated with the repatriation
of foreign earnings in 2005, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations
increased 22% in 2006 to $824.1 million from $675.8 million in 2005.  Adjusted
basic net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 22% in 2006
to $2.03 from $1.67 in 2005, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share from

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company's
working capital at December 31, 2007 increased $1,389.1 million to $3,571.9
million from $2,182.8 million at December 31, 2006.  The increase in working
capital resulted from growth in the Company's overall business, the proceeds
from the sale of Physiotherapy Associates and the use of cash earnings to fund
increases in accounts receivable, inventories and prepaid expenses.  Accounts
receivable days sales outstanding was 56 days at both December 31, 2007 and
2006 and days sales in inventory decreased one day to 137 days at December 31,
2007 from 138 days at December 31, 2006.

The Company
generated cash of $1,028.3 million from operations in 2007 compared with $867.3
million in 2006.  The increase in cash from operations in 2007 compared with
the prior year is primarily due to increased earnings partially offset by
growth in the working capital accounts, primarily accounts receivable and
inventories.

In 2007 the Company borrowed an additional $103.7 million and
used cash of $102.9 million for payments on borrowings. The Company also used cash of $187.7 million for
capital expenditures, including $14.3 million related to the implementation of
ERP systems at multiple manufacturing and distribution facilities; $13.9 million
for facility expansions; and $7.0 million to complete the construction of the Homer Stryker Center for education and clinical research in Mahwah, New Jersey. In addition,
the Company used $54.8 million for
acquisitions and $89.7 million for the payment of dividends. The Company also purchased and sold marketable
securities, which are classified as available-for-sale investments in
accordance with the provisions of FASB Statement No. 115,

Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

.

The Company had
$290.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2,120.3 million in marketable
securities at December 31, 2007.  The Company also had outstanding borrowings
totaling $16.8 million at that date, all of which were classified as current
obligations.  The Company believes its cash on hand and marketable securities,
as well as anticipated cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to fund
future operating capital requirements; future manufacturing facility
construction and other capital expenditures; future business and product line
acquisitions to supplement its current product offerings; loaner
instrumentation for surgical implants in support of new product launches;
required debt repayments and the payment of dividends.

As
of December 31, 2007, approximately 9% of the Company's investments in
available-for-sale securities were held in triple A rated (per Standard &
Poor's) asset-backed debt securities, of which the majority related to
investments in automobile loans.  At December 31, 2007, less than 1% of the
Company's investments in marketable securities were exposed to a risk of loss
related to the declining value of the subprime-mortgage securities market.

Should additional
funds be required, the Company had $1,047.3 million of additional borrowing
capacity available under all of its existing credit facilities, including the
Company's $1,000.0 million 5-year nonamortizing, revolving Unsecured Credit
Facility that expires in November 2010.  In addition, the Company had the entire
$200.0 million accounts receivable securitization facility available at
December 31, 2007.

The Company's
future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than 1
year, including agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of
business, are summarized as follows (in millions):

Due
to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits and
timing of employee retirements, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate
the future periods in which income tax payments to settle these unresolved
income tax positions or contributions to fund defined benefits plans will be
made.

Critical Accounting
Policies

The preparation
of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements and accompanying notes.  Management evaluates these estimates and
assumptions on an ongoing basis.  Estimates are based on historical experience,
when available, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are
not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Management
believes that of its significant accounting policies (see Note 1 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements), an understanding of the following critical
accounting policies is important in obtaining an overall understanding of the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The
Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in
the collection of accounts receivable.  The Company makes estimates regarding
the future ability of its customers to make required payments based on
historical credit experience and expected future trends.  If actual customer
financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management,
additional accounts receivable write offs may be necessary, which could
unfavorably affect future operating results.

Inventory Reserves

The
Company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the
potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current
carrying costs.  The markets in which the Company operates are highly
competitive and new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an
ongoing basis.  Such marketplace changes may cause some of the Company's
products to become obsolete.  The Company makes estimates regarding the future
recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for
excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience, expiration of
sterilization dates and expected future trends.  If actual product life cycles,
product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable
than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required,
which could unfavorably affect future operating results.

Income Taxes

The Company operates in multiple income tax jurisdictions both
inside and outside the United States.  Accordingly, management must determine
the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions.  Income
tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex
issues, including inventory transfer pricing and product royalty arrangements,
may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax
adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between
jurisdictions with different income tax rates.  Because income tax adjustments
in certain jurisdictions can be significant, the Company records accruals
representing management's best estimate of the probable resolution of these
matters.

- 39 -

To the extent additional information becomes available, such accruals
are adjusted to reflect the revised estimated probable outcome.

Other Matters

The Company
distributes its products throughout the world.  As a result, the Company's
financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in
foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign
markets.  The Company's operating results are primarily exposed to changes in
exchange rates among the U.S. dollar, the Japanese yen and European currencies,
in particular the euro and the British pound.  When the U.S. dollar weakens
against foreign currencies, the dollar value of sales denominated in foreign
currencies increases.  When the U.S. dollar strengthens, the opposite situation
occurs. The Company manufactures its products in the United States, France, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, Canada and Puerto Rico and incurs the costs to manufacture in
the applicable local currencies.  This worldwide deployment of factories serves
to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the
Company's cost of sales.

The Company enters into forward currency exchange
contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions
denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting risk to the Company
that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates.  These
nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables
and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products.  The
periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of
the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the
measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional
currencies.  All forward currency exchange
contracts are marked to market each period, with resulting gains (losses)
included in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of earnings.

At December 31, 2007, the Company had
outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $427.9 million and
sell $257.7 million of various currencies (principally U.S. dollars and euros)
with maturities ranging principally from 4 to 101 days.  At December 31, 2006,
the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase
$387.9 million and sell $227.0 million of various currencies (principally U.S.
dollars and euros) with maturities ranging principally from 7 to 180 days.  The
estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the
measurement of the contracts at month-end spot rates as adjusted by current
forward points.  A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currencies relative to
the U.S. dollar would change the December 31, 2007 fair value by approximately
$7.4 million.  The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance by counterparties on its outstanding forward currency exchange
contracts but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties.

The Company has certain investments in net assets in
international locations that are not hedged.  These investments are subject to
translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currencies.  For the
year ended December 31, 2007, the strengthening of foreign currencies relative
to the U.S. dollar increased the value of these investments in net assets, and
the related deferred gain in shareholders' equity, by $152.7 million to $272.3
million from $119.6 million at December 31, 2006.

The
Company is partially self-insured for product liability claims and utilizes a
wholly owned captive insurance company in the United States to manage its
self-insured retention limits.  The captive insurance company provides
insurance reserves for estimated liabilities for product claims incurred but
not reported based on actuarially determined liabilities.  The actuarial
valuations are based on historical information along with certain assumptions
about future events.

In 2003 the Company announced that it received
a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts in connection with a U.S. Department of Justice investigation of Physiotherapy
Associates' billing and coding practices. Under the
terms of the Physiotherapy sale agreement, Stryker retained responsibility for
certain cash damages to be paid in connection with this investigation.  The
Company's liability for such damages was fixed under the sale agreement, with
interest to be accrued through the date of payment, which occurred in 2007. 
Liabilities previously recorded by the Company were sufficient to cover these
obligations.

- 40
- -

In 2007 the Company disclosed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has made an informal inquiry of the Company
regarding possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in
connection with the sale of medical devices in certain foreign countries. Subsequently,
in 2008, the Company received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice,
Criminal Division, requesting certain documents for the period January 1, 2000
through the present in connection with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission inquiry.  In 2006 the Company announced that it received a subpoena
from the U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, requesting documents
for the period January 2001 through the present regarding possible violations
of federal criminal law, including possible violation of the antitrust laws,
relating to the manufacture and sale of orthopaedic implant devices.  The
Company is fully cooperating with the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission regarding these matters.

In 2007 the Company received two warning letters from the FDA regarding
compliance with certain quality system specifications at its reconstructive
implant manufacturing facilities: one letter for its facility in Cork, Ireland and
another for its facility in Mahwah, New Jersey.  The Company
takes these matters very seriously and has been fully cooperating with the FDA
to address their observations.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Board of Directors and
Shareholders of Stryker Corporation

:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Stryker
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007.  Our audits also
included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a).  These
financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Stryker Corporation
and subsidiaries at December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the consolidated results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.  Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule,
when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2007 Stryker
Corporation changed its method of accounting for unresolved tax positions in
connection with the required adoption of Financial Interpretation No. 48.  In
2006, Stryker Corporation also changed its methods of accounting for retirement
plans in connection with the required adoption of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 158.

We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), Stryker Corporation's internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 13, 2008
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Stryker Corporation and Subsidiaries

December 31, 2007

NOTE 1

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Business

: Stryker Corporation (the Company or
Stryker) is one of the world's leading medical technology companies with the
most broadly based range of products in orthopaedics and a significant presence
in other medical specialties.  Stryker works with respected medical
professionals to help people lead more active and more satisfying lives.  The
Company's products include implants used in joint replacement, trauma, spinal
and craniomaxillofacial surgeries; biologics; surgical, neurologic, ear, nose &
throat and interventional pain equipment; endoscopic, surgical navigation,
communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient handling and
emergency medical equipment.

Principles of
Consolidation

: The Consolidated
Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned
subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions.

Revenue Recognition

: A significant portion of the Company's Orthopaedic
Implants revenue is generated from consigned inventory maintained at hospitals
or with field representatives.  For these products, revenue is recognized at
the time the Company receives appropriate notification that the product has
been used or implanted.  The Company records revenue from MedSurg Equipment
product sales when title and risk of ownership have been transferred to the
customer, which is typically upon shipment to the customer. The Company records
estimated sales returns, discounts and other applicable adjustments as a
reduction of net sales in the same period revenue is recognized.

Shipping and Handling of
Products

: Amounts billed to customers
for shipping and handling of products are included in net sales.  Costs
incurred related to shipping and handling of products are included in cost of
sales.

Use of Estimates

: The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP),
requires Company management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying
notes.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currency
Translation

: The functional
currencies for substantially all of the Company's international affiliates are
their local currencies.  Accordingly, the financial statements of these
international affiliates are translated into U.S. dollars using current
exchange rates for balance sheets and average exchange rates for statements of
earnings and cash flows.  Unrealized translation adjustments are included in
accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) in shareholders' equity. 
Transaction gains and losses, such as those resulting from the settlement of
nonfunctional currency receivables or payables, are included in net earnings.

Financial Instruments

: The Company's financial instruments consist of cash,
cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable,
debt and foreign currency exchange contracts. The Company's estimates of fair
value approximate the carrying amounts for financial instruments as of December
31, 2007 and 2006.

Cash Equivalents,
Marketable Securities and Other Investments

: Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with a maturity of
three months or less when purchased.  Marketable securities consist of
marketable debt securities and certificates of deposit classified as
available-for-sale.  Other investments, included within other assets in the
consolidated balance sheets, consist of mutual funds, classified as trading,
that are acquired to offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred
compensation arrangements and are expected to be used to settle these
liabilities.

- 47 -

The
Company's marketable securities and other investments are stated at fair value
based on quoted market prices.  Adjustments to the fair value of marketable
securities and other investments that are classified as available-for-sale are
recorded as increases or decreases, net of income taxes, within accumulated
other comprehensive gain (loss) in shareholders' equity.  Adjustments to the
fair value of other investments that are classified as trading are recorded in
earnings as offsets to the related changes in liabilities under deferred
compensation arrangements.  The amortized cost of marketable debt securities
classified as available-for-sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums and
discounts to maturity computed under the effective interest method.  Such
amortization is included in other income (expense) along with interest and
realized gains and losses.  The cost of securities sold is determined by the
specific identification method.

Pursuant
to the Company's investment policy, all individual marketable security
investments must maintain a minimum credit quality of single A (per Standard &
Poor's) or A2 (per Moody's Corporation), while the overall portfolio of
marketable securities must maintain a minimum average credit quality of double
A (per Standard & Poor's) or Aa (per Moody's Corporation).

Accounts Receivable

:  Accounts receivable consists of trade and other
miscellaneous receivables.  The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful
accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable.  The
Company makes estimates regarding the future ability of its customers to make
required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future
trends.

Accounts Receivable
Securitization

: The Company has an
accounts receivable securitization facility pursuant to which certain
subsidiaries of the Company sell, on an ongoing basis, all of their domestic
accounts receivable to Stryker Funding Corporation (SFC), a wholly owned
special-purpose subsidiary of the Company, which in turn may sell, without
recourse, up to an aggregate of a $200.0 million undivided percentage ownership
interest in such receivables to bank-administered multiseller commercial paper
conduits.  Creditors of SFC have a claim to its assets before any equity
becomes available to the Company.

There
were no amounts of undivided percentage ownership interests in accounts
receivable sold by SFC under the facility as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. 
Accounts receivable sold would be reflected in the consolidated balance sheet
as reductions of accounts receivable in the period sold.  The amount of
receivables available to be sold is subject to change monthly, based on the
level of defined eligible receivables less defined customary reductions for
servicing, dilution and loss reserves.

Inventories

: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or
market.  Cost for approximately 84% of inventories is determined using the
first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method.  Cost for certain domestic inventories
is determined using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) cost method.  The FIFO cost
for all inventories approximates replacement cost.

The
Company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the
potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current
carrying costs.  The markets in which the Company operates are highly
competitive, and new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an
ongoing basis.  Such marketplace changes may cause some of the Company's
products to become obsolete.  The Company makes estimates regarding the future
recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for
excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience, expiration of
sterilization dates and expected future trends.

Property, Plant and
Equipment

: Property, plant and
equipment is stated at cost.  Depreciation is computed by either the
straight-line or declining-balance method over the estimated useful lives of 3
to 30 years for buildings and improvements and 3 to 10 years for machinery and
equipment.

Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets:

Goodwill
represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of tangible net assets
of acquired businesses after amounts allocated to other intangible assets. 
Other intangible assets include developed technology, which is amortized on a
straight-line basis over 20 years, customer relationships (which reflect
expected continued customer patronage), trademarks and patents, which are
amortized on a straight-line basis over 4 to 40 years (weighted-average life of
15 years for other intangible assets).

- 48 -

Goodwill and Long-Lived
Assets Impairment Tests:

Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 142,

Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets

, requires companies to test goodwill for possible
impairment on an annual basis.  The Company performs the annual impairment test
in the fourth quarter of each year using a discounted cash flow analysis that
requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions
and the Company's future profitability.  The Company also performs impairment
tests of goodwill and other intangible and long-lived assets during interim
periods upon the occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstance, as
defined in FASB Statements No. 142 and No. 144,

Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

.

Loaner Instrumentation

: Loaner instrumentation represents the net book value
of loaner instruments for surgical implants provided to customers by the
Company.  Loaner instrumentation is amortized on a straight-line basis over a
3-year period.  Amortization expense for loaner instrumentation is included in
selling, general and administrative expenses.

Stock Options:

At
December 31, 2007,

the Company had
key employee and director stock option plans, which are described more fully in
Note 8.  The Company measures the cost of employee stock options based on the
grant-date fair value and recognizes that cost over the period during which a
recipient is required to provide services in exchange for the options,
typically the vesting period. The weighted-average fair value per share of options
granted during 2007, 2006 and 2005, estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model, was $21.90, $17.16 and $17.45,
respectively.  The fair value of options granted was estimated using the
following weighted-average assumptions:

The risk-free
interest rate for periods within the expected life of options granted is based
on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.  Expected
stock price volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company's
stock.  The expected option life, representing the period of time that options
granted are expected to be outstanding, is based on historical option exercise
and employee termination data.  The Company recognizes the cost of stock
options using the straight-line method over their vesting periods.

Income Taxes

: The Company accounts for income taxes using the
liability method.  Under this method, deferred income tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and
income tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted
income tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected
to reverse.  Deferred income tax expense (credit) represents the change in net
deferred income tax assets and liabilities during the year.

The Company operates in multiple income tax jurisdictions both
inside and outside the United States, and income tax authorities in these
jurisdictions regularly perform audits of the Company's income tax filings. 
Accordingly, management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to
each of these jurisdictions based on current interpretations of complex income
tax regulations.  Income tax audits associated with the allocation of this
income and other complex issues, including inventory transfer pricing and
product royalty arrangements, may require an extended period of time to resolve
and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation
are required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates.

The Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

, on January 1, 2007.  This Interpretation clarified the accounting for
income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold an income tax
position is required to meet before being recognized in the Company's
Consolidated Financial Statements.  The Interpretation also provided guidance
for the measurement and classification of income tax positions, interest
expense and penalties, and requires additional disclosure on an annual basis.  Upon
adoption, the Company recognized an increase in the interest expense accrual
associated with unresolved income tax positions, which was accounted for by
reducing the January 1, 2007 balance of retained

- - 49 -

earnings by $7.6 million (net
of income taxes).  Subsequent to the adoption, interest expense and
penalties incurred associated with unresolved income tax positions will
continue to be included in other income (expense).  In addition, upon adoption
of the interpretation, the Company reclassified $179.2 million from the current
income taxes liability to noncurrent liabilities to match the anticipated
timing of future income tax payments.

Derivative Financial
Instruments

: The Company follows the provisions of FASB Statement No. 133,

Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

, as amended by Statements
No. 137 and No. 138, in accounting for its derivative financial instruments. 
The Statements require the Company to recognize all derivatives on the balance
sheet at fair value.  The Company uses derivative financial instruments to
manage the economic impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates.  The
Company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to manage these
economic risks.  These contracts are adjusted to fair value through earnings.

Legal
and Other Contingencies:

The Company
is involved in various proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the
normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor,
intellectual property and other matters which are more fully described in Note
14.  The potential future outcomes of these matters are outside of management's
complete control and will generally not be known for prolonged periods of
time.  In certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek damages, as well
as other compensatory relief, which could result in the payment of significant
claims and settlements.  In legal matters for which management has sufficient
information to reasonably estimate the Company's future obligations, a
liability representing management's best estimate of the probable cost for the
resolution of these legal matters is recorded.  The estimates are based on
consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement
strategies.  The Company does not anticipate material losses as a result of
these proceedings beyond amounts already provided in the accompanying
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Gain (Loss)

: The
components of accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) are as follows (in
millions):

Recently Issued Accounting
Standards

:  In 2006 the
FASB issued Statement No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

. This Statement
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value of assets
and liabilities and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  The
Company is subject to the provisions of this Statement beginning January 1,
2008. The Company has not yet determined the impact, if any, the adoption of
the Statement will have on the financial position of the Company but does not
anticipate a material impact.  However, the Company believes it will likely be
required to provide additional disclosures as part of future financial
statements, beginning with the first quarter of 2008.

In 2007 the
FASB issued Statement No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets
and Financial Liabilities

.  This Statement allows companies the option to
measure eligible financial instruments at fair value. Such election, which may
be applied on an instrument by instrument basis, is typically irrevocable once
elected.  The Company will adopt the Statement effective January 1, 2008, as
required, and anticipates it will not apply the fair value option to any of its
financial instruments.

In 2007 the FASB issued
Statement No. 141(R),

Business Combinations - a replacement of FASB
Statement No. 141.

This Statement significantly changes the principles and
requirements for how an acquisition is recognized and measured in a company's
financial statements including the identifiable assets acquired and the

- 50 -

liabilities
assumed.  The Statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring
goodwill acquired in a business combination and required disclosures to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of
the business combination.  This Statement is effective prospectively, except
for certain retrospective adjustments to deferred income tax balances, for the
Company beginning on January 1, 2009.  The Company has not yet determined the
impact, if any, the adoption of this Statement will have on the financial
position of the Company.

Reclassifications:

Certain prior year amounts have
been reclassified to conform with the presentation used in 2007.  The Company
has reclassified its Consolidated Financial Statements to reflect discontinued
operations.

NOTE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT

The
following is a summary of the Company's investments (in millions):

- 51 -

The net carrying value and estimated fair value of
available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2007, by contractual maturity,
are as follows (in millions):

As
of December 31, 2007, approximately 9% of the Company's investments in
available-for-sale securities were held in triple A rated (per Standard &
Poor's) asset-backed debt securities, of which the majority related to
investments in automobile loans.  At December 31, 2007, less than 1% of the
Company's investments in marketable securities were exposed to a risk of loss
related to the declining value of the subprime-mortgage securities market.

Interest
and marketable securities income, which is included in other income (expense),
totaled $85.5 million in 2007, $41.4 million in 2006 and $13.3 million in 2005.

The Company
enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of
currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies,
thereby limiting risk to the Company that would otherwise result from changes
in exchange rates.  These nonfunctional currency exposures relate principally
to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany
transactions, including purchases of manufactured products.  The periods of the
forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed
transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and
recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies.  All forward currency exchange contracts are marked
to market each period, with resulting gains and losses included in other income
(expense) in the consolidated statements of earnings to offset recognized gains
and losses on the exposed transactions.  The net realized gains and losses, as
a result of these transactions, were not material to the Company's results of
operations in 2007, 2006 or 2005.

At
December 31, 2007, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange
contracts to purchase $427.9 million and sell $257.7 million of various
currencies (principally U.S. dollars and euros) with maturities

- 52 -

ranging
principally from 4 to 101 days.  At
December 31, 2006, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts
to purchase $387.9 million and sell $227.0 million of various currencies
(principally U.S. dollars and euros) with maturities ranging principally from 7
to 180 days.  The estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts
represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end spot rates as adjusted
by current forward points and is recorded as a component of accrued expenses
and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.  At December 31,
2007, the Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by
counterparties on its outstanding forward currency exchange contracts but does
not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties.

NOTE

INVENTORIES

Inventories are summarized as
follows (in millions):

NOTE

ACQUISITIONS

In 2006 the Company acquired all of the outstanding
stock of Sightline Technologies Ltd. (Sightline), a private, development-stage
company, for an upfront payment of $50.0 million in cash plus certain
transaction costs and the assumption of certain liabilities.  The acquisition
of Sightline, a developer of flexible endoscopes, is expected to enhance the
Company's presence in the gastrointestinal and other markets within its MedSurg
Equipment segment.  Sightline's operating results are included in the Company's
Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of the acquisition and did not
materially impact the Company's operating results.  Pro forma consolidated
results of operations would not differ significantly as a result of the
Sightline acquisition.

The
purchase price was allocated to assets acquired, purchased in-process research
and development and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at
the date of acquisition.  The amount of the purchase price allocated to
purchased in-process research and development resulted in a charge of $52.7
million, or $.13 per diluted share, against the Company's 2006 operating
results.  At the date of the acquisition, the flexible endoscope technologies
acquired had not yet reached technological feasibility.  The amount written off
as purchased in-process research and development was not deductible for income
tax purposes in the United States.

Terms
of the transaction also include potential milestone payments of up to an
additional $90.0 million upon the achievement of certain operational and
financial targets related to Sightline's products, the first of which is
expected to occur in 2008.  The potential milestone payments are expected to be
capitalized at their fair values as intangible assets at the time of payment
and will be amortized over their remaining useful lives.

In
2005 the Company acquired, by merger, all of the outstanding stock of PlasmaSol
Corp. (PlasmaSol), a private, development-stage company.  PlasmaSol is a
developer of a technology that should allow Stryker to provide sterilization
equipment for use with certain of its MedSurg Equipment products.  The cost of
the transaction totaled $17.5 million including an upfront cash payment plus
the assumption of certain liabilities.  PlasmaSol's operating results are
included in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of
the acquisition and did not materially impact the Company's operating results.
Pro forma consolidated results of operations would not differ significantly as
a result of the PlasmaSol acquisition.

- 53 -

The
purchase price was allocated to assets acquired primarily for deferred income
tax assets associated with acquired net operating losses and purchased
in-process research and development based on their estimated fair value at the
date of acquisition.  The amount of the purchase price allocated to purchased
in-process research and development resulted in a charge of $15.9 million, or
$.04 per diluted share, against the Company's 2005 operating results.  At the date
of acquisition, the sterilization technology acquired had not yet been approved
for sale by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and, therefore, had not
yet reached technological feasibility.  The amount written off as purchased
in-process research and development was not deductible for income tax purposes
in the United States.

The
Company believes that the technologies acquired in both the Sightline and PlasmaSol acquisitions
will result in the introduction of new products and additional future sales. 
However, unanticipated issues may arise that could delay or terminate a
product's development prior to regulatory approval or commercialization, which
could have an unfavorable impact on the Company's operating results.  As of December 31, 2007, the Company must refine
certain product specifications highlighted during customer preference trials
and validate manufacturing processes in
order to achieve its plan for initial commercialization of the flexible
endoscope technologies in 2008.  As of
December 31, 2007, the Company had not encountered significant issues and
expects completion of the development and initial commercialization of the
sterilization technology in 2010.

In 2005 the Company acquired, by merger, all of the
outstanding stock of eTrauma.com Corp. (eTrauma) for $50.0 million in cash plus
certain transaction costs.  The acquisition expanded the Company's digital
imaging equipment product offerings within its MedSurg Equipment segment by
adding eTrauma's proprietary Picture Archive and Communications Systems image
management and viewing software.  The acquisition of eTrauma was accounted for
using the purchase method of accounting.  eTrauma's operating results are
included in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of
the acquisition and did not materially impact the Company's operating results. 
Pro forma consolidated results of operations would not differ significantly as
a result of the eTrauma acquisition.

The purchase
price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on
their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition.  Based on the purchase
price allocation, $22.0 million was allocated to identifiable intangibles, to
be amortized over their remaining lives of 5 to 8 years, and $30.2 million was
allocated to goodwill, which was not deductible for income tax purposes in the United States.  Immediately after the acquisition was
consummated, management of the Company began to implement an integration plan
to combine Stryker and eTrauma.  In conjunction with the integration plan, the
Company recorded additional purchase liabilities for severance and related
costs of $0.3 million, which were included in the purchase price allocation.

NOTE 5

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In
2007 the Company sold its outpatient physical therapy business, Physiotherapy
Associates, to Water Street Healthcare Partners, for $150.0 million in cash
less certain indebtedness . The sale of Physiotherapy allows the Company to
focus its efforts on the medical technology market.  The sale of Physiotherapy
resulted in a gain of $25.7 million (net of $15.0 million income tax expense),
or $.06 per diluted share.  Net sales from discontinued operations for the
years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $107.4 million, $258.4
million and $262.6 million, respectively.  Net earnings from discontinued
operations for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $5.0
million, $6.3 million and $11.1 million, respectively.

Under the terms of the sale agreement, the Company retained
responsibility for certain cash damages to be paid in connection with the
investigation of Physiotherapy Associates' billing and coding practices by the
U.S. Department of Justice announced in 2003.  The Company's liability for such
damages was fixed under the sale agreement, with interest expense to be accrued
through the date of payment, which occurred in 2007.  Liabilities previously
recorded by the Company were sufficient to cover these obligations.

In 2007 the Company recorded a
$19.8 million charge ($12.7 million net of income taxes) to write off patents
associated with intervertebral body fusion cage products.  The impairment
followed a FDA decision to downgrade certain intervertebral body fusion products
to class II devices, along with a weak market for sales of these specific
products.  As a result, the Company performed a discounted cash flow analysis
over the remaining life of the patented technologies and determined the charge
to recognize an intangible asset impairment was required.

NOTE

DEBT

The
Company had current debt outstanding under various debt instruments totaling
$16.8 million and $14.8 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The
Company also has a $1,000.0 million Unsecured Credit Facility.  The facility,
which expires in November 2010, includes a senior 5-year nonamortizing,
revolving credit agreement with a maximum amount of $1,000.0 million.  The
Company may increase the credit facility maximum limit in $100.0 million
increments up to an additional $500.0 million upon acceptance by the existing
lender group or additional lenders.  No amounts were outstanding under the
Unsecured Credit Facility as of December 31, 2007 and 2006.

The
Unsecured Credit Facility requires a facility fee ranging from 0.04% to 0.15%
on the aggregate commitment of the credit facility, depending on the Company's
debt rating.  The credit facility includes a $500.0 million multicurrency
sublimit, under which yen and euro can be borrowed; a $100.0 million swing line
sublimit; and a $100.0 million letter of credit sublimit.  The credit facility
bears interest at a base rate, as defined, plus an applicable margin ranging
from 0.12% to 0.475%, depending on the Company's debt rating.

During
2007 the weighted-average interest rate, excluding required fees, for all
borrowings made under the credit facility was 5.3%.  The Unsecured Credit
Facility requires the Company to comply with certain financial and other
covenants.  The Company was in compliance with all covenants at December 31,
2007.  In addition to the Unsecured Credit Facility, the Company has lines of
credit, issued by various financial institutions, available to fund the
Company's day-to-day operating needs.  At December 31, 2007, the Company had
$1,047.3 million of additional borrowing capacity available under all of its
existing credit facilities.

The
carrying amounts of the Company's long-term debt approximate their fair values,
based on the quoted interest rates for similar types and amounts of borrowing
agreements.

- 56 -

Interest
paid on debt, including required fees, was $6.5 million in 2007, $6.3 million
in 2006 and $8.1 million in 2005; and approximates amounts reflected in
interest expense, which is included in other income (expense).

NOTE

CAPITAL
STOCK

The
Company has 0.5 million authorized shares of $1 par value preferred stock, none
of which is outstanding.

The
Company has key employee and director stock option plans under which options
are granted at an exercise price not less than the fair market value of the
underlying common stock at the date of grant.  The options are granted for
periods of up to 10 years and become exercisable in varying installments.  A

The

prices, of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and
2005 was $160.1 million, $100.0 million and $100.5 million, respectively.
Shares reserved for future compensation grants of Stryker common stock were
22.9 million at December 31, 2007 and 25.9 million at December 31, 2006. 
Exercise prices for options outstanding as of December 31, 2007 ranged from
$8.42 to $64.94.  At December 31, 2007, there was $145.8 million of
unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options granted under
the stock option plans; that cost is expected to be recognized over the
following 7.2 years (weighted-average period of 1.8 years).

In
February 2008 the Company's Board of Directors authorized the Company to
purchase up to $750 million of its common stock. Purchases may be made from
time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or
otherwise. The manner, timing and amount of any purchases will be determined by
the Company's management based on evaluation of market conditions, stock price
and other factors and will be subject to regulatory conditions.

NET EARNINGS PER SHARE

The following table sets forth the computation of
basic and diluted net earnings per share (in millions, except per share
amounts):

Options
to purchase an average of 0.9 million, 4.5 million and 2.5 million shares of
common stock during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively, were outstanding but were not included in the computation of
diluted net earnings per share because the exercise prices of the options were
greater than the average market price of common shares for those periods.

RETIREMENT PLANS

Certain
of the Company's subsidiaries have both funded and unfunded defined benefit
pension plans covering some or all of their employees.  Substantially all of
the defined benefit pension plans have projected benefit obligations in excess
of plan assets and use a December 31 measurement date for the determination of
plan obligations and funded status of the plans.  A summary of the Company's

benefit obligation in excess of plan assets had projected benefit obligations,
accumulated benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets of $192.1
million, $175.2 million and $137.3 million, respectively, as of December 31,

The estimated net actuarial loss for the defined
benefit pension plans to be recognized from accumulated other comprehensive
gain (loss) into net periodic benefit cost in the year ended December 31, 2008,
is $0.3 million.  The Company estimates that an immaterial amount of
amortization of prior service cost and transition amount for the defined
benefit pension plans will be recognized from accumulated other comprehensive
gain (loss) into net periodic benefit cost in the year ended December 31, 2008.

The Company has assumed an average long-term expected
return on defined benefit plan assets of 5.8% as of December 31, 2007.  The
expected return is determined by applying the target allocation in each asset
category of plan investments to the anticipated return for each asset category
based on historical and projected returns.

The weighted-average allocation of plan assets by
asset category is as follows:

The investment strategy for the Company's defined
benefit pension plans is both to meet the liabilities of the plans as they fall
due and to maximize the return on invested assets within appropriate risk
tolerances.  Reflected below are target investment allocation ranges for the
plans at December 31, 2007:

The Company anticipates contributing approximately
$12.5 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2008.

$82.3 million in 2007, $67.3 million in 2006 and $59.7 million in 2005.  A
portion of the Company's retirement plan expenses was funded with Stryker common
stock totaling $8.4 million in 2007, $7.0 million in 2006 and $6.3 million in
2005.  The use of Stryker common stock represents a noncash operating
activity that is not reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows. 
The amount of Stryker common stock held by the Company's defined contribution
retirement plans totaled $108.2 million (approximately 1.4 million shares) and
$86.2 million (approximately 1.6 million shares) as of December 31, 2007 and
2006, respectively.  The value of Stryker common stock as a percentage of
total defined contribution retirement plan assets was 15% and 13% as of December
31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

NOTE

INCOME TAXES

In
2005 the Company's Board of Directors approved a plan to repatriate $722
million of foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation
Act (the Act), which was enacted by the United States to provide a temporary
incentive for U.S. companies to repatriate accumulated income earned in foreign
jurisdictions.  The repatriation plan was completed in 2005 and the Company
recorded a charge of $27.4 million, or $.07 per diluted share, to recognize the
income tax expense and related liability in the United States associated with
the repatriation.  The repatriated funds were invested pursuant to an approved
Domestic Reinvestment Plan that conformed to the Act.

At December 31, 2007, income tax authorities in several income tax
jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States were conducting routine
audits of the Company's income tax returns filed in prior years.  These
audits are generally designed to determine if individual income tax authorities
are in agreement with the Company's interpretations of complex income tax
regulations regarding the allocation of income to the various income tax
jurisdictions.   With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to
audits by income tax authorities for tax years prior to 2001. Income tax years
subsequent to 2000 are open to examination in many of the income tax
jurisdictions in which the Company operates.

Earnings from continuing operations before income
taxes consist of the following (in millions):

The
components of the provision for income taxes follow (in millions):

A
reconciliation of the U.S. statutory income tax rate to the Company's effective
income tax rate from continuing operations follows:

- 62 -

Deferred
income taxes reflect the net income tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.  Valuation allowances
are recorded to reduce deferred income tax assets when it is more likely than
not that an income tax benefit will not be realized.  The income tax effect of
significant temporary differences, which comprise the Company's deferred income
tax assets and liabilities, is as follows (in millions):

Net operating loss carryforwards totaling
approximately $61.6 million at December 31, 2007 are available to reduce future
taxable earnings of certain domestic and foreign subsidiaries.

No
provision has been made for U. S. federal and state income taxes or foreign
income taxes that may result from future remittances of the undistributed
earnings ($2,515.9 million at December 31, 2007) of foreign subsidiaries
because it is expected that such earnings will be reinvested overseas
indefinitely.  Determination of the amount of any unrecognized deferred income
tax liability on these unremitted earnings is not practicable.

Total
income taxes paid, net of refunds received, were $411.6 million in 2007, $325.6
million in 2006 and $247.8 million in 2005.

The Company's income tax expense could be reduced by $204.9
million and $168.8 million at December 31,
2007 and January 1, 2007, respectively, upon favorable resolution of these unresolved income tax positions.  Interest
expense and penalties included in other income (expense) was $13.1 million for
the year ended December 31, 2007.  Accrued interest and penalties included in accrued
expenses and other liabilities was $34.8 million at December 31, 2007.

The
Company does not expect significant increases or decreases in the amount of
unrecognized income tax benefits during the next twelve months.

NOTE

SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

The
Company segregates its operations into two reportable business segments:
Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  The Orthopaedic Implants segment
sells orthopaedic reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma, spinal and
craniomaxillofacial implant systems; bone cement; and the bone growth factor
OP-1.  The MedSurg Equipment segment sells surgical equipment; surgical
navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as
well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment.  The Other category
includes corporate administration, interest expense and interest and marketable
securities income.

The
Company's reportable segments are business units that offer different products
and services and are managed separately because each business requires
different manufacturing, technology and marketing strategies.  The accounting
policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of
significant accounting policies.  The Company
measures the financial results of its reportable segments using an internal
performance measure that excludes the intangible asset impairment charge
recorded in 2007, the purchased in-process research and development charges recorded
in 2006 and 2005, the additional income taxes on the repatriation of foreign
earnings recorded in 2005 as well as the effect of share-based compensation,
which includes compensation related to both employee and director stock option
plans. Identifiable assets are those assets
used exclusively in the operations of each business segment or allocated when
used jointly.  Corporate assets are principally cash and cash equivalents;
marketable securities; property, plant and equipment; and, in 2006 and 2005,
assets of discontinued operations.

NOTE 14

CONTINGENCIES

In 2007 the Company
announced that it reached a resolution with the U.S. Attorney's office for the
District of New Jersey in connection with a previously announced investigation
relating to "any and all consulting contracts,
professional service agreements, or remuneration agreements between Stryker
Corporation and any orthopedic surgeon, orthopedic surgeon in training, or
medical school graduate using or considering the surgical use of hip or knee
joint replacement/reconstruction products manufactured or sold by Stryker
Corporation."  The resolution is in the form of a non-prosecution
agreement for an 18-month period.  During the term of the agreement the
Company's Orthopaedics subsidiary is subject to oversight by a federal monitor,
as appointed by the U.S. Attorney, regarding compliance with certain standards
and procedures in connection with the retention and payment of orthopaedic
surgeon consultants related to reconstructive products and the provision of
certain benefits to such surgeons.

In 2007 the Company disclosed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has made an informal inquiry of the Company
regarding possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in
connection with the sale of medical devices in certain foreign countries. Subsequently,
in 2008, the Company received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice,
Criminal Division, requesting certain documents for the period January 1, 2000
through the present in connection with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission inquiry.  In 2006 the Company announced that it received a subpoena
from the U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, requesting documents
for the period January 2001 through the present regarding possible violations
of federal criminal law, including possible violation of the antitrust laws,
relating to the manufacture and sale of orthopaedic implant devices.  Stryker
is fully cooperating with the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission regarding these matters.

In 2007 the Company received two warning letters from the FDA regarding
compliance with certain quality system specifications at its reconstructive
implant manufacturing facilities: one letter for its facility in Cork, Ireland and
another for its facility in Mahwah, New Jersey.  The Company
takes these matters very seriously and has been fully cooperating with the FDA
to address their observations.

Pursuant
to certain of the Company's credit and lease agreements, the Company has
provided financial guarantees to third parties in the form of indemnification
provisions.  These provisions indemnify the third parties for costs, including
but not limited to adverse judgments in lawsuits and the imposition of
additional income taxes due to either a change in the tax law or an adverse
interpretation of the tax law.  The terms of the guarantees are equal to the
terms of the related credit or lease agreements.  The Company is not able to
calculate the maximum potential amount of future payments it could be required
to make under these guarantees, as any potential payment is dependent on the
occurrence of future unknown events (e.g., changes in U.S. or foreign tax laws).

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures -

An
evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and
procedures as of December 31, 2007 was carried out under the supervision and
with the participation of the Company's management, including the President and
Chief Executive Officer and the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (the
"Certifying Officers").  Based on that evaluation, the Certifying Officers
concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Changes in Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting -

There was no change to the Company's internal control over financial reporting
during the quarter ended December 31, 2007 that materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over
financial reporting.

Management's
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting -

The management of Stryker Corporation is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f).  Stryker
Corporation's internal control system was designed to provide reasonable
assurance to the Company's management and Board of Directors regarding the
preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.

Stryker
Corporation's management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007.  In making this
assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission in

Internal Control

--

Integrated
Framework

.  Based on that assessment, management believes that, as of
December 31, 2007, the Company's internal control over financial reporting is
effective.

Stryker
Corporation's independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young
LLP, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company's
internal control over financial reporting.  This report appears on the
following page.

Other
Matters

- The Company is in the
process of implementing new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems at
certain of its divisions.  An ERP system is a fully-integrated set of programs
and databases that incorporate order processing, production planning and scheduling,
purchasing, accounts receivable and inventory management and accounting.  The
Company's European, Middle East, Africa division began the transition to its
new ERP system in the third quarter of 2007.  In connection with this ERP
system implementation, the Company will update its internal controls over
financial reporting, as necessary, to accommodate modifications to its business
processes and accounting procedures.  The Company does not believe that this
ERP system implementation will have an adverse effect on the Company's internal
control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Stryker Corporation

:

We have audited Stryker
Corporation and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Stryker
Corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying
Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company's internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2007, based on

the COSO criteria

.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of
Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the
related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders' equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 of
Stryker Corporation, and our report dated February 13, 2008 expressed an
unqualified opinion thereon.
