PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

GENERAL

Stryker Corporation and its subsidiaries (the "Company" or "Stryker")
develop, manufacture and market specialty surgical and medical products,
including orthopaedic reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder) implants, trauma
systems used in bone repair, spinal implants, bone cement, the bone growth
factor osteogenic protein-1 ("OP-1"), powered surgical instruments, endoscopic
systems, hospital beds and stretchers, craniomaxillofacial implants and
image-guided surgical systems for the global market; the Company also provides
outpatient physical and occupational rehabilitative services in the United
States.  Stryker was incorporated in Michigan in 1946 as the successor
company to a business founded in 1941 by Dr. Homer H. Stryker, a leading
orthopaedic surgeon and the inventor of several orthopaedic products.

Stryker's filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission,
including its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q,
current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports are accessible free
of charge at www.strykercorp.com within the "For Investors" link.

In October 2002, the Company purchased the DEKOMPRESSOR product line from
Pain Concepts, Inc.  The DEKOMPRESSOR is a single-use disposable device
indicated for the percutaneous removal of disc nucleus material.

In July 2002, the Company acquired the Surgical Dynamics Inc. spinal implant
business ("SDI") from Tyco International Ltd.  The acquisition expands the
Company's spinal product line by adding interbody spinal cages for the United
States market as well as other thoracolumbar and cervical spinal fixation
devices.

In November 2001, the Company acquired the business of an independent Italian
distributor of certain of the Company's products.  The purchase
consolidates the distribution of substantially all of the Company's products in
Italy.

In August 2000, the Company completed the acquisition of Image Guided
Technologies, Inc. ("IGT") by merger.  IGT manufactured three-dimensional
optical measurement devices ("optical localizers") for anatomical image-display
workstations used by physicians to perform image-guided surgery.

The Company's Physiotherapy Associates, Inc. subsidiary has also purchased a
number of physical therapy clinic operations during each of the last three
years.

PRODUCT SALES

The Company segregates its operations into two reportable business segments:
Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  The Orthopaedic Implants
segment sells orthopaedic reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma and
spinal implants, bone cement and OP-1.  The MedSurg Equipment segment sells
powered surgical instruments, endoscopic systems, medical video imaging
equipment, hospital beds and stretchers, craniomaxillofacial implants and
image-guided surgical systems.  Other includes Physical Therapy Services
and corporate administration, interest expense and interest income.  The
following amounts ($000,000s) and percentages represent net sales by business
segment during each of the three years ended December 31:

Additional financial information regarding the Company's operating segments
and geographic areas can be found under the caption "Note 12 - Segment and
Geographic Data" on pages 51 through 53 of this report.

Approximately 79% of the Company's sales in 2002, approximately 76% of the
Company's sales in 2001 and approximately 80% of the Company's sales in 2000
consisted of products with short lives, such as implants (while implants have a
long useful life to the patient, they have a one-time use to the hospital),
trauma-related products, disposables and expendable tools and parts and service
revenues, such as service and repair charges and physical therapy
revenues.  The balance of sales in each of the years was of products that
could be considered capital equipment, having useful lives in excess of one
year.

The Company's backlog of firm orders is not considered material to an
understanding of its business.

Orthopaedic Implants

Orthopaedic Implants are designed and manufactured by Stryker Howmedica
Osteonics, Stryker Trauma, Stryker Spine and Stryker Biotech and consist of such
products as hip, knee, shoulder and spinal implants, associated implant
instrumentation, trauma-related products, bone cement and OP-1.  Artificial
joints are made of cobalt chromium, titanium alloys, ceramics or ultra-high
molecular weight polyethylene and are implanted in patients whose natural joints
have been damaged by arthritis, osteoporosis, other diseases or injury. 
The Company's OP-1 product is composed of recombinant human osteogenic protein-1
and a bioresorbable collagen matrix that induces the formation of new bone when
implanted into bone.

Hip Implants

Under the Stryker Howmedica Osteonics brand name, the Company offers a
variety of hip systems for the global reconstructive segment.  The ABG Hip
System, Partnership Hip System, Secur-Fit Hip System, Omnifit Hip System and
Restoration Hip System represent comprehensive systems of hip implants and
associated instrumentation designed to provide physicians and patients with
reliable results and to reduce operating time for primary and revision
procedures.  The Exeter Total Hip System is based on a unique, collarless,
highly polished, double-tapered femoral design that reduces shear stresses and
increases compression at the cement/bone interface.  The Taro Hip System
provides a line of products that offer an increased range of motion preferred by
Japanese surgeons for their patients.  By the end of 2002, approximately
80% of the Company's acetabular inserts utilized Crossfire technology, a highly
cross-linked polyethylene designed to reduce wear.  In laboratory testing,
this product indicates a significant reduction in wear over conventional
polyethylene.

On February 3, 2003, the Company received pre-market approval ("PMA") from
the United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") for its
ceramic-on-ceramic hip replacement, the Trident Ceramic Acetabular Insert, for
patients in the United States.  Prior to this approval, technologies used
for total hip replacement included conventional polyethylene-on-metal and
metal-on-metal articulations.  Laboratory testing involving both a first
generation ceramic insert and the improved Trident ceramic insert has
demonstrated significantly lower wear of these ceramic-on-ceramic bearings
versus conventional hip replacement systems.  Stryker Howmedica Osteonics
is planning the launch of the Trident ceramic insert in the United States in the
second quarter of 2003 following successful launches in Europe, Australia and
Canada in 2002.

In 2002, the Company launched the Trident Acetabular Cup system.  This
patented design allows for the use of polyethylene inserts as well as ceramic
inserts and positions the Company well for the launch of its ceramic acetabular
products in the United States in 2003.  Trident's two independent locking
mechanisms provide maximum security for each bearing surface and increase the
strength of the ceramic liner.  Also released in 2002 was the Accolade
C-Cemented stem.  This stem compliments the Accolade TMZF cementless stem
launched in 2001, incorporating many of the same innovative design features for
use with cemented stems and also utilizing the simple and efficient Accolade
instrumentation system.

In 2001, the Company introduced the Omnifit Super EON and Super Secur-Fit hip
systems for the Japanese market.  These systems capitalize on the Company's
long-term clinical history with the OmniFit type geometry but are modified to
offer increased range of motion for the Japanese market.  The Company also
released the Accolade Hip system to the global marketplace.  This system
incorporates a clinically successful geometry with a proprietary TMZF titanium
alloy, PureFix hydroxylapatite ("HA") and an innovative neck geometry to maximize
range of motion.

In 2000, the Company launched the Citation TMZF stem, which incorporates a
proprietary new titanium alloy that is more flexible and stronger than
traditional alloys.  With the increased flexibility and strength of TMZF
titanium alloy over traditional alloys, patients may experience reduced pain due
to the less rigid stem which bends with stress while improving overall implant
strength.

In late 1990, Stryker became the first company to receive clearance from the
FDA to commercially release for sale in the United States a hip implant with HA
surface treatment.  HA is a naturally occurring calcium phosphate material
that demonstrates a high level of biocompatibility due to its resemblance to
human bone.  The Company's global clinical experience with HA-coated hip
stems now extends over 13 years and reported clinical performance continues to
equal or exceed that of comparable hip stems reported in the scientific
literature.

The Company entered 2003 with more than 30 years of clinical history with the
Exeter Hip System, more than 20 years of clinical history with the Omnifit
cemented stem and 13 years of clinical history with the Omnifit HA stem. 
Long-term clinical results are an important factor in the Company's ability to
market hip implants.

Knee Implants

The Company offers five major knee systems under the Stryker Howmedica
Osteonics brand name:  the Duracon, Kinemax, Interax, MRS and Scorpio
systems.  Introduced in 1991 and utilized in more than 500,000 procedures
worldwide, the Duracon system combines high levels of joint conformity
throughout the range of motion and consistent anatomic tracking.  The
Duracon TS and Modular Rotating Hinge, which were introduced in 1999 and 2001,
respectively, completed the product line offering with implants for complex
revision procedures.

The Kinemax system is focused in markets outside the United States and offers
versatility through design principles based on the clinically successful Total Condylar and Kinematic Knee Systems.  Precision-designed Monogram
instruments provide a common instrument platform for the Duracon, Kinemax and
Interax knee systems. The ergonomic engineering of Monogram instruments
facilitates efficient use in the operating room, enabling the surgeon to choose
the instruments that represent his/her optimal surgical technique.  The MRS
system was the first Modular segmental replacement system and has maintained a
leadership role in this market segment since its introduction.

The Scorpio system was designed considering motion of the normal knee based
off of its epicondylar axis.  This patented approach addresses significant
clinical issues, such as improved patient rehabilitation and mid-flexion
stability, through an increase in the patella-femoral moment arm and a single
anterior-posterior radius.  The Scorpio TS Revision Knee System was
introduced in 2000 to extend the Company's Scorpio product line into the
fast-growing revision knee market segment.  The Scorpio Plus Mobile Bearing
tibial component was launched in markets outside the United States in 2001 and a
clinical trial in the United States is underway.  This addition to the
Scorpio line will provide a competitive entry into this growing market
segment.  The ScorpioFlex, which is available for both posterior cruciate
retaining and substituting indications, is specifically designed for patients
who have the ability and motivation to return to high flexion activities such as
gardening and golfing.  ScorpioFlex has enjoyed success in Japan, where it
is sold under the trade name Scorpio SuperFlex, and is now being sold in the
United States.  The Scorpio system is supported by the Passport
instrumentation system, which was designed to provide intraoperative flexibility
and precision as well as a simple, cost-effective approach to total knee
replacement surgery.  In 2000, the Company introduced the Xcellerate
instrument platform, which combines features from the Monogram and Passport
instrumentation and allows the surgeon to use the same basic instrument platform
for both Duracon and Scorpio knee implants.  The Stryker Navigation System
Knee Module was released in Europe in 2001 and in the United States in
2002.  This system provides the surgeon with sophisticated computer-aided
instrumentation that will improve accuracy in limb alignment and bone resection.

The EIUS Uni Knee replacement system, introduced in late 2001, is designed
for the quickly growing minimally invasive knee surgery market segment. 
The EIUS Uni Knee experienced strong sales in 2002 following its introduction in
2001.  This system marries bone-sparing femoral and tibial implants with
sophisticated instrumentation and a surgical technique aimed at reducing
rehabilitation time for patients.

Stryker Howmedica Osteonics is developing the technology and instrumentation
to support minimally invasive surgical procedures for total knee replacement. 
In 2002, the Company designed instrumentation for its Scorpio Knee System to
support a minimally invasive surgical technique.  A multicenter clinical
study on minimally invasive total knee arthroplasty was started in January 2003.

Other Reconstructive Products

The Company markets other reconstructive products under the Stryker Howmedica
Osteonics brand name, principally shoulder and elbow implants and related
instruments.  The Solar Total Shoulder System provides a unique design of
the humeral head which allows the surgeon to adjust tension of the supporting
tissues while maximizing range of motion.  The shoulder instruments offer
the surgeon increased visibility and access to this tightly confined joint
space.  The Solar BiPolar Shoulder provides the surgeon with additional
options to address arthritis of the shoulder and is designed with the patented
bipolar locking mechanism that is also used in the Company's hip implants. 
In 2000, the Company added offset heads to its Solar Shoulder product line,
giving the surgeon increased intraoperative flexibility to restore the patient's
shoulder kinematics.  The Solar Total Elbow complements products offered
for upper extremity procedures.  The semi-constrained design and modular
components address varying patient anatomy.

Trauma

The Company markets its trauma-related products under the Stryker Trauma
brand name. Trauma products are used primarily in the fixation of fractures
resulting from sudden injury. These products consist of internal fixation
devices marketed under such names as Gamma, Grosse & Kempf, Omega, Dall
Miles, Asnis and T2, as well as external fixation devices marketed under the
Apex, Hoffmann II and Monotube Triax names.

The Company's internal fixation product portfolio includes a full compliment
of intramedullary nails, hip fracture devices and plates and screws in both
titanium and stainless steel. The intramedullary ("IM") nail portfolio is led by
the new T2 nailing system, which was released in 2001. The T2 nailing system
enables a surgeon to implant an IM nail in either an antegrade or retrograde
fashion using the same implant and includes a single, standardized
instrumentation system. T2 nails are available for the tibia, femur and humerus.

To address the hip fracture segment, the Company markets several products
including the Gamma Nail (a unique IM nail for trochanteric
fractures), the Omega hip screw system, the Asnis Cannulated Screw System and the
Hansson pin system. The Asnis Cannulated Screw System can help simplify the
operative procedure through features that allow the surgeons to place, insert
and remove locking screws easily. These hip fracture systems offer orthopaedic
surgeons multiple options depending on their preferences and patient needs.

The Company's external fixation products include the Hoffmann II modular
fixation system, the Monotube Triax monolateral system, the Tenxor circular
fixation system for complex fractures and a complete range of pins and wires for
attaching the devices to fractured bones. The Hoffmann II system for lower
extremity fractures (pelvis, femur, tibia) and the smaller Hoffmann II Compact
for upper extremity fractures include a patented snap-fit mechanism that makes
it easy for the surgeon to construct the fixation device to fit the patient and
align the fractured bones.  Both the Hoffmann II and the Hoffmann II
Compact include a full selection of lightweight radiolucent connection bars that
allow for quick intraoperative fracture repair. The Triax system is available in
three different sizes and includes an adjustable feature that enables the
surgeon to not only stabilize fractures, but to lengthen the bone in cases where
bone has been removed due to damage.  The Tenxor hybrid frame enables a
surgeon to treat complex fractures around the joints with both pins and long
transfixing wires.  This attribute is especially useful for patients with
multipart fractures near the ankle and knee.  The system features advanced
composite materials and is compatible with the Hoffman II snap-fit connection
devices.

Spinal Implants

Spinal implant systems comprise plates, rods, screws, connectors, spacers,
cages and proprietary instrument and container systems.  Through Stryker
Spine, the Company develops, manufactures and markets spinal implant
systems.  Physicians use these systems in the treatment of degenerative,
tumor, trauma and deformity spinal diseases in the cervical and thoracolumbar
spine.  In 2002, the Company acquired SDI, adding the Ray Threaded Fusion
Cage interbody fusion cage system and SR90 thoracolumbar system to the global
product portfolio.  Also in 2002, the Company introduced enhanced versions
of the Xia Titanium system, Reflex system and Diapason system.  
Introduced in 2002, the new Bonecraft system is designed to aid surgeons in
shaping and cutting allograft bone.  In 2001, the Company launched the
Reflex, Xia Stainless Steel System and the Stabilis System.  The Reflex
system was a new entry in the anterior cervical plating system
segment.   The Xia Stainless Steel system, a new offering within the
Xia Spinal System, was designed to better serve deformity correction
requirements.  The Xia Spinal System is a posterior system designed to
relieve pain by stabilizing the spine in the thoracic, lumbar and sacral regions
and is accompanied by instrumentation that simplifies the surgical
procedures.  Launched in international markets, the Stabilis system is a
novel interbody fusion device designed to improve stability and alignment during
fusion.  In 2000, the Company launched enhanced versions of the Xia
titanium system, OPUS and Diapason thoracolumbar fixation systems.  In the
international markets in 2000, the Company also introduced Solis System, a new
cervical interbody device, and an enhanced version of OIC, a lumbar interbody
fusion device.  The Company investigates new spinal technology to be used
in the treatment of spinal disorders.   Started in late 2001, the
Company has continued work on a human pre-pilot study in Germany in an effort to
begin to assess the safety and efficacy of a polymer-based prosthetic nucleus
pulposus device.

Bone Cement

Simplex bone cement, a material used to secure cemented implants to bone, was
first approved for domestic orthopaedic use in 1971 and is the most widely used
bone cement in the world.  The Company manufactures several variations of
Simplex Bone Cement to meet specific patient needs.  Simplex P has more
than 40 years of clinical history, the longest of any bone cement, with more
than 250 published clinical studies.  In 2000, a new formulation
incorporating antibiotics, Simplex P bone cement with Tobramycin, was introduced
in selected international markets.

OP-1

Two decades ago, Stryker saw the potential that biologic products held for
orthopaedics in an aging world and began a long-term investment in OP-1, a
proprietary, recombinant  version of the bone growth factor osteogenic
protein-1.  In 1991, the Company received FDA approval to begin human
clinical trials of OP-1, which was developed in collaboration with Creative
BioMolecules, Inc. (a company that subsequently merged into Curis, Inc.), as
part of a long-term research program funded by Stryker since 1985.  This
device is composed of recombinant human OP-1 and a bioresorbable collagen
matrix.  OP-1 is naturally present in the human body and directs a cascade
of cellular events that result in bone growth.  In preclinical studies,
OP-1 induced the formation of new bone when implanted into bony defect
sites.  The initial human clinical study, which began in 1992, compared the
efficacy of OP-1 with autograft (the current standard bone graft procedure for
the treatment of tibial nonunion fractures, which uses bone chips removed from a
patient's hip in a second operation) in the repair of nonunion fractures of the
tibia.  In 1995, the FDA allowed the Company to enlarge the scope of the
clinical trials for expanded indications of nonunion fractures in all long
bones.  The study demonstrated that OP-1 patients had outcomes of
comparable clinical success to those of the autograft patients without the need
for a second invasive procedure to harvest autograft from the hip.  There
were three prospectively determined clinical trial outcomes defined in the
study:  weight-bearing, level of pain with weight-bearing and radiographic
assessment of cortical and/or trabecular bridging.  The study design
predicted 80% success at nine months post-surgery.  Both the OP-1 and
autograft groups met this prediction for the clinical outcomes of weight-bearing
and pain, and both groups had comparable results.  The blinded radiographic
assessment by an independent panel of radiologists showed that neither group
achieved the 80% criteria for bridging, although bridging was higher for the
autograft group.

The PMA application for OP-1 was filed and accepted by the FDA in June 1999.
The Company received a "Not Approvable" letter from the FDA on January 29, 2001
that cited the failure of the pivotal clinical trial to meet the study endpoint
of non-inferiority of OP-1 compared with the autograft control on a combined
clinical and radiographic basis.  In 2001, Stryker Biotech filed an
application for a Humanitarian Device Exemption ("HDE") from the FDA.  The
FDA granted this approval in October 2001.  This approval in the United
States is for the use of OP-1 as an alternative to autograft in recalcitrant
long-bone nonunions where use of autograft is unfeasible and alternative
treatments have failed.  Under the HDE, OP-1 was made available as a
humanitarian device, defined by the FDA as one intended to benefit patients by
treating or diagnosing a disease or condition that affects fewer than 4,000
individuals per year in the United States.  During the course of 2002, more
than 200 hospitals received Institutional Review Board ("IRB") approval to
implant OP-1 in the United States under the HDE.

The Company also filed a Marketing Authorization Application ("MAA") with the
European Medicines Evaluation Agency ("EMEA") for certain OP-1 uses, which was
accepted for filing in July 1999.  On December 14, 2000, the Committee for
Proprietary Medicinal Products ("CPMP") in Europe voted unanimously to recommend
market authorization for OP-1 for the indication of nonunions of the tibia that
have failed prior autograft treatment or when autograft is not feasible. 
Final European approval was obtained in May 2001 for this indication.  A
New Drug Application with the Therapeutic Goods Administration ("TGA") in
Australia was filed in December 1999, and in February 2001 the Australian Drug
Evaluation Committee ("ADEC") adopted a positive opinion to recommend the
granting of marketing authorization for OP-1 for treatment of long-bone
nonunions secondary to trauma for the purpose of initiating new bone
formation.  Approval from the TGA was received in April 2001. In February
2002, the Company received approval to market OP-1 in Canada for the clinical
indication of long-bone nonunions.

With these global approvals, the first of their kind, the Company began to
market OP-1.  In 2002, the increase in the number of patients treated
demonstrated the success of its sales effort and the trust surgeons have
developed in the product based on favorable patient outcomes.  During 2002,
more than 2,000 patients worldwide received implants of OP-1, more than the
combined total from 1992 through 2001.  In the United States, demand
increased significantly during each quarter of 2002, and OP-1 is now used at
more than 250 institutions, with multiple users at many of these sites.

Stryker is committed to the further development of OP-1 for spinal
indications including spinal stenosis.  This degenerative condition, which
is widespread in the over-65 population, causes severe pain in the lower back
and legs as a result of abnormal movement in the lower spine.  Spinal
fusion is used to stabilize the spine and reduce stenosis pain.  Fusing the
spine with OP-1 can eliminate the need for a preliminary surgery to take bone
from the patient's hip to use in the fusion process.

Currently, the Company is conducting a multicenter pivotal trial in the
United States and Canada for posterolateral spine fusion using a new product,
OP-1 Putty, to treat degenerative spondylolisthesis.  Patients were actively enrolled
during 2002 in the 312 patient study conducted at 25 hospital sites.  The
Company currently anticipates enrollment will be completed in 2003 and that the trial
will be completed in 2005.  In Japan, the Company won approval from the
Ministry for Health, Labor and Welfare to conduct a multicenter Phase II trial
for the same indication and began enrolling patients in 2002.  In the
Japanese trial, OP-1 is being used in conjunction with screw and rod systems to
fuse the spine.

In October 2002, the Company entered into an agreement with Curis, Inc.,
which eliminated all royalties payable to Curis relating to future Stryker sales
of OP-1. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company made a one-time cash
payment of $14.0 million to Curis.  Stryker owns the patents on its
osteogenic protein technology and has exclusive worldwide rights under those
patents to develop, market and sell OP-1 for treatment, repair or replacement of
bone and joint tissue.

The Company has a royalty-free cross-license agreement with Genetics
Institute, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Wyeth, which holds patents
covering a molecule different from OP-1 that may produce similar
effects.   The agreement will enable Stryker to commercialize OP-1
unencumbered by patent litigation with this competitor.  Others also are
attempting to develop osteogenic proteins and bioresorbable carriers for the
treatment, repair or replacement of bone and joint tissue.  These other
companies have filed and obtained patents in the United States and elsewhere
claiming such compounds and methods of making them and using them and may in the
future file and obtain other such patents.  The Company can provide no
assurance that it will not need a license under one or more of those patents to
further expand the OP-1 program or whether such licenses will be
available.

MedSurg Equipment

MedSurg Equipment products include powered surgical instruments, endoscopic
systems, medical video imaging equipment, hospital beds and stretchers,
craniomaxillofacial implants and image-guided surgical systems.  These
products are designed and manufactured by Stryker Instruments, Stryker
Endoscopy, Stryker Leibinger and Stryker Medical.

The Stryker Instruments, Stryker Endoscopy and Stryker Leibinger product
portfolios  include micropowered tools and instruments that are used in
orthopaedics, craniomaxillofacial surgery, functional endoscopic sinus surgery,
neurosurgery, spinal surgery and plastic surgery. The Total Performance System
("TPS"), released in 1996, is a universal surgical system that can be utilized
within several medical specialties. The TPS U2 Drill, introduced in 2000, and
TPS Burs are designed for use by spine surgeons and neurosurgeons, while the TPS
MicroDriver and TPS Sagittal Saw are designed for use by sports physicians and
plastic surgeons.  The Elite attachment line with a proprietary extendable
bar system and Saber Drill for ear, nose and throat ("ENT") surgery were added
in 2001 to further extend the TPS system in spine, neuro and ENT applications.
The TPS System also powers the Stryker Endoscopy SE5 and 12K Shaver Systems. The
Stryker Leibinger Hummer TPS is a powered instrument that incorporates new
irrigation capabilities and specialized cutters, eliminating the need for over
half of the instruments otherwise required for sinus surgery.

Stryker Instruments

Stryker Instruments products include a broad line of powered surgical
instruments that are used by surgeons for drilling, burring, rasping or cutting
bone, wiring or pinning bone fractures and preparing hip or knee surfaces for
the placement of artificial implants. Stryker Instruments also manufactures an
array of different attachments and cutting accessories for use by orthopaedic,
neurological and small-bone specialists.  In 2002, Stryker Instruments
launched System 5, its fifth generation product offering of its flagship
heavy-duty, battery-powered instruments. This line provides enhanced cutting
speed and torque as well as versatility in an ergonomic handpiece system. 
Applications for this line include total joint, trauma and sports medicine
procedures. The TPS is Stryker's offering in the high-speed market. This
electric system provides the precision and versatility needed in small-bone
orthopaedics, neurosurgical, ENT and spinal applications.

Stryker Instruments also produces products that are utilized in conjunction
with joint replacement surgery.  The Advanced Cement Mixing System, used to
mix bone cement, greatly reduces the risk that air bubbles will weaken the
long-term bond between the implant and surrounding bone. Interpulse is a
disposable, self-contained pulsed lavage system that is used by physicians to
cleanse the surgical site during total joint arthroplasty. The ConstaVac CBC II
Blood Conservation System is a post-operative wound drainage and blood
reinfusion device that enables joint replacement patients to receive their own
blood rather than donor blood. As part of a broad surgical product portfolio,
Stryker also markets the Steri-Shield Personal Protection System, combining a
helmet, hood and gown to help provide protection for operating room personnel
against contact with infectious bodily fluids and harmful microorganisms during
surgery.  In 2002, the Company introduced the PainPump2 which is a
disposable system that offers electronically controlled flow rates of pain
medication directly to the surgical site in order to help manage a patient's
postoperative discomfort. This innovative design allows the physician to program
the pump and provides a patient-controlled analgesia ("PCA") option, previously
unavailable to the market in a disposable pump.  In 2002, Stryker
Instruments acquired the DEKOMPRESSOR product line from Pain Concepts Inc. The
DEKOMPRESSOR is a single-use disposable device indicated for the percutaneous
removal of disc nucleus material. This important advance in lumbar disc pain
management, along with Stryker's offerings in Percutaneous Cement Delivery and
Radiofrequency Denervation, allows  Stryker to focus on the Interventional
Pain Management marketplace.  In 2000, Stryker Instruments introduced the
Neptune Waste Management System, a totally self-contained device for handling
and disposing fluid and smoke waste from surgical procedures.

Stryker Endoscopy

Stryker Endoscopy products include medical video cameras, digital
documentation equipment, arthroscopes, laparoscopes, powered surgical
instruments, sports medicine instrumentation and implants, radio frequency
ablation systems, irrigation fluid management systems, Endosuite operating room
solutions and state-of-the-art equipment for telemedicine and enterprise-wide
connectivity. Stryker Endoscopy has established a position of leadership in the
production of medical video technology and accessories for minimally invasive
surgery, as well as communications equipment to provide local or worldwide
interconnectivity.

In 2002, Stryker Endoscopy continued its leading market share position in the
Endosuite Operating Room.  An enhancement that changed the way minimally
invasive surgery is documented is the Stryker Digital Capture ("SDC") Pro 2
surgical DVD documentation system which was developed to store high quality
digital images to a DVD drive and distribute images on an existing hospital
network.  In 2002, the Company advanced its position in sports medicine by
launching several ACL fixation devices along with a 3 millimeter glenoid humeral
anchor for use in repairing rotator cuff injuries in the shoulder.

In 2001, Stryker Endoscopy launched the 988 Digital 3-Chip Camera, which is
the first digital output video camera in the medical industry.  In late
2001, the OptiVu HDVD wireless imaging system was introduced, which allows
surgeons to view surgical images while maintaining a natural head and neck
position.  This lightweight "heads-up" display improves surgical
visualization by aligning the image with the surgeon's hands.

In 2000, Stryker Endoscopy launched a third-generation Switchpoint III video
system through Stryker Communications.  The Switchpoint III OR control
center provides a simple-to-use method for routing video signals from the
operating room to other locations, further enhancing the Endosuite concept of
operating room equipment management.  The X6000 Xenon light source, also
introduced in 2000, provides powerful color-correct light for all procedures
where rigid endoscopes are used.

Stryker Endoscopy's line of rigid scopes ranges in diameter from 2.3
millimeters to 10 millimeters, containing a series of precision lenses as well
as fiber optics that allow the physician to view internal anatomy with a high
degree of clarity.  In 2000, the Company expanded its rigid scope line with
the introduction of a 5.0 millimeter full-screen laparoscope, which provides a
large, bright image in a minimally invasive scope design, and the launch of a
full line of autoclavable arthroscopes and laparoscopes.

The use of radio frequency ("RF") energy for tissue ablation is growing
rapidly in the field of arthroscopy.  In 2000, the Company introduced its
SERFAS tissue ablation system, which utilizes RF energy to provide rapid tissue
resection in arthroscopic procedures while maintaining hemostasis.

Stryker Leibinger

Stryker Leibinger manufactures plates, screws and instruments for
craniomaxillofacial fixation and image-guided surgery systems. In 2002, the
Company launched the Universal Mandible Plating System. This innovative system
accommodates all mandibular fracture and reconstruction needs in one small,
simple and easy-to-use system.  In 2002, the Company also introduced its
new software module for fluoroscopic image-guided surgery.  This software,
designed for the Stryker Navigation System, allows surgeons to employ
image-guided surgery in conjunction with intra-operative fluoroscopic
images.

In 2001, the Company launched two new fixation systems for neurosurgery, the
Quikdisk and the Neuroclip.  These innovative systems provide stable
fixation following cranial surgery in less time than conventional screws and
plates.  Stryker Leibinger also introduced new image-guided surgery software
modules and instrument sets for knee replacement, ENT and spine surgeries in
2001.  All three modules utilize Stryker Leibinger's active wireless
technology, which allows the surgeon to use the surgical instrument as a
computer mouse in controlling the system.

Other products marketed by Stryker Leibinger include the Colorado
Microdissection Needle, which is used for fine cutting of soft tissue, and
BoneSource, a calcium phosphate putty that is used to fill in
craniomaxillofacial defects.

Stryker Medical

Stryker Medical is a leader in the specialty stretcher products segment,
offering more than 30 different types of stretchers customized to fit the needs
of acute care and specialty surgical care facilities.  Stryker Medical
produces beds that are designed to fit the unique needs of specialty departments
within the acute care environment.  New in 2002, the Go Bed +
medical/surgical beds feature low bed height for safe patient ingress and exit.
 The Go Bed + also offers the optional Chaperone center-of-gravity bed exit
system with Zone Control to help prevent patient falls.  Zone Control is a
feature that enables the caregiver to adjust the sensitivity of the bed exit
system in order to accommodate different patient needs. Stryker Medical has a
complete line of ICU beds for critical care and step-down units.  The beds
incorporate advanced features that facilitate patient care, such as in-bed
scales that accurately weigh the patient regardless of bed position and a
radiolucent surface that facilitates chest x-rays without moving the patient
from the bed.  Stryker Medical also offers a continuum of mattresses as an
option with its frames.   Stryker Medical's legacy of innovation in
the pre-hospital market continued in 2002.  In 2002, the Company launched
its third generation MX-Pro R3 ambulance cot for use in the emergency medical
services market.  To facilitate patient transport up and down stairs,
Stryker Medical introduced the StairPro series of stairchairs in 2002.

New in 2001 were the Secure II and Go Bed medical/surgical beds, which both
feature low bed-height for safe patient ingress and exit.  The Secure II
also offers the optional Chaperone center-of-gravity bed exit system with Zone
Control to help prevent patient falls.  In 2001, Stryker Medical continued
to enhance its reputation for durability and innovation by introducing Trio, the
first truly mobile surgery table; Trio can be used preoperatively, during the
procedure and for postoperative recovery.  Introduced in 2001, the Cub pediatric crib is
Stryker Medical's most recent product entry in the pediatric segment.  Cub's
access and safety features are unparalleled in this segment.  The M-1
ambulance cot, introduced in 2001, is Stryker Medical's most advanced cot for
the international market.

Other

Other includes Physical Therapy Services.  Physiotherapy Associates
provides physical, occupational and speech therapy services to patients
recovering from orthopaedic or neurological illness and injury through a network
of 331 outpatient physical therapy centers in 27 states and the District of
Columbia.  Physiotherapy Associates works closely with referring physicians
to design and execute rehabilitation protocols with the goal of quick recoveries
for injured workers, athletes and other patients.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

Most of the Company's products and product improvements have been developed
internally.  In addition, the Company maintains close working relationships
with physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist
in product research and development.  New and improved products play a
critical role in the Company's sales growth.  The Company continues to
place emphasis on the development of proprietary products and product
improvements to complement and expand its existing product lines.  The
Company has a decentralized research and development focus, with manufacturing
locations responsible for new product development and product
improvements.  Research, development and engineering functions at the
manufacturing locations maintain relationships with distribution locations and
customers to understand changes in the market and product needs.

Total expenditures for product research, development and engineering were
$141.4 million in 2002, $142.1 million in 2001 and $122.2 million in 2000. 
 Research, development and engineering spending was affected in 2002 by the
commercial launch of the OP-1 product, which occurred in various markets in the
second and fourth quarters of 2001.  Following the launch, in 2002 Stryker
Biotech recorded a greater proportion of its expenses as cost of sales and
selling, general and administrative expenses, compared with 2001 when this
division classified substantially all of its costs as research, development and
engineering. Increased spending from the Company's continued focus on new
product development partially offset the decreased research, development and
engineering expenses related to Stryker Biotech.

Recent new product introductions in the Orthopaedic Implant segment include
the development of reconstructive implant (hip, knee, shoulder), spinal and
trauma designs.  Introduced in 2002 were the Trident Acetabular Cup System,
Accolade C-Cemented Stem, ScorpioFlex Knee for the United States market and
Super Secur-Fit Plus Hip and Xia II Spinal System for the Japanese market. 
In 2001, Accolade Hip System, EIUS minimally invasive Uni Knee System, Scorpio
Plus Mobile Bearing Knee System, Trident Ceramic Acetabular System, Super EON
and Super Secur-Fit hips for the Japanese market, T2 Intramedullary Nail System,
Reflex Anterior Cervical Plate and Xia Stainless Steel.  In 2000, the
Citation TMZF hip stems, Scorpio TS Knee Revision System, Xcellerate knee
instrument system, Antigrade/Retrograde intramedullary nail, Tenxor Hybrid
external fixator, Asnis III cannulated screw system, OPUS spine system and Solis
interbody device were introduced.

New products at Stryker Instruments and Stryker Endoscopy include the
development of advanced powered instruments, pain management systems, video
technology and specialized operating room equipment.  In 2002, the System 5
heavy-duty, battery-powered instruments, SDC Pro 2 surgical DVD documentation
system, PainPump2 and Precision System for percutaneous cement delivery were
introduced.  In 2001, the TPS Saber Drill, Elite Attachments and Elite Burs
for TPS, Cordless Driver II, SDC Pro 2 surgical documentation system,
Percutaneous Cement Delivery System, Neptune Waste Management System, 988
Digital Camera and OptiVu HDVD wireless imaging system were introduced.  In
2000, the TPS U2 drill, Steri-Shield T4 Personal Protection System, Switchpoint
router system, X6000 xenon light source and SERFAS radio frequency ablation
system were introduced.

In 2002, Leibinger introduced the Universal Mandible Plating System and a new
software module for fluoroscopic image-guided surgery.  In 2001, Leibinger
introduced new image-guided surgery software modules and instrument sets for
knee replacement, ENT and spinal applications and Quickdisk and Neuroclip for
cranial fixation.  In 2000, new Leibinger product introductions included
the Stryker Navigation System for image-guided surgery and the Delta System of
resorbable screws and plates.

Stryker Medical continues to develop new patient handling equipment with the
Go Bed +, the Stair Pro and the EvacChair launched in 2002 and the Trio Mobile
Surgery Platform, the Cub pediatric crib and an enhanced Secure II bed launched
in 2001.  In 2000, the Adel maternity bed, the Gynnie OB/GYN stretcher and
the REM, Aires and Isoflex sleep surfaces were introduced.

Stryker Biotech is developing the use of OP-1 for other surgical indications
in addition to the approved limited trauma indications in certain markets. 
In 2001, an IDE pivotal clinical trial was initiated to study the new product
OP-1 Putty in an uninstrumented posterolateral spine fusion indication.  The
Company currently anticipates enrollment will be completed in 2003 and that the study
will be completed in 2005.  The Company is also conducting a Phase II
clinical trial in Japan to study OP-1 Putty in an instrumented posterolateral
spine fusion indication.  Patient enrollment also began in 2002 in this
study of 32 patients that is being conducted at four university hospital
sites.

MARKETING

In the United States, most of the Company's products are marketed directly to
more than 6,000 hospitals and to doctors and other health-care facilities by
approximately 2,000 sales and marketing personnel.  Stryker primarily maintains
separate and dedicated sales forces for each of its principal product lines to
provide focus and a high level of expertise to each medical specialty served.

Approximately 67% of the Company's domestic revenues in 2002 were accounted
for by sales to hospital cooperative buying groups and other large national
accounts and 2% by sales to the Veterans Administration and other hospitals
operated by the federal government.

International sales accounted for 34% of total revenues in 2002.  The
Company's products are sold in more than 100 countries through more than 2,100
local dealers and direct sales efforts.  Local dealer support and direct
sales are coordinated by approximately 1,900 sales and marketing
personnel.  Stryker distributes its products through sales subsidiaries and
branches with offices located in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil,
Canada, Chile, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, India,
Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland,
Portugal, Romania, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the
United Kingdom.  Stryker exports products to dealers and to customers in
Africa, China, the CIS (former Soviet Union), India, Korea, Latin America,
Malaysia, the Middle East, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and Yugoslavia. 
Additional information regarding the Company's international and domestic
operations and sales appears in "Note 12 - Segment and Geographic Data" on pages
51 through 53 of this report.

The Company's business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the
number of orthopaedic implant surgeries is lower during the summer months.

COMPETITION

The Company is one of four leading competitors in the United States for
orthopaedic reconstructive products.  The three other leading competitors are DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (a
subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson), Zimmer Holdings, Inc., and Biomet, Inc.
While competition abroad varies from area to area, the Company believes it is
also a leading player in the international markets, with these same companies
and Centerpulse Orthopedics, Inc. (a subsidiary of Centerpulse Ltd.), as its
principal competitors.

In the trauma segment, Stryker is one of four leaders competing principally
with Synthes-Stratec, Smith & Nephew Orthopaedics (a division of Smith &
Nephew plc) and DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc.

In the spinal implant segment, the Company is one of five leaders, including
the principal competitors Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Inc. (a subsidiary of
Medtronic, Inc.), DePuy AcroMed, Inc. (a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson),
Synthes-Stratec and Centerpulse Spine-Tech, Inc. (a subsidiary of Centerpulse
Ltd.).

In the powered surgical instruments segment, Stryker is one of the three
leaders, together with the principal domestic competitors Linvatec, Inc. (a
subsidiary of CONMED Corporation) and Medtronic Midas Rex, Inc. (a subsidiary of
Medtronic, Inc.).  These companies are also competitors in the
international markets, along with Aesculap-Werke AG (a division of B. Braun
Melsungen AG), a large European
manufacturer.

In the arthroscopy segment, the Company is one of the three leaders, together
with the principal competitors Smith & Nephew Endoscopy (a division of Smith
& Nephew plc) and Linvatec, Inc.  In the laparoscopic imaging products
segment, the Company is one of the four leaders, together with the principal
competitors Karl Storz GmbH & Co. (a German company), ACMI Corporation and
Olympus Optical Co. Ltd. (a Japanese company).

In the craniomaxillofacial segment, Stryker is one of three leaders, together
with the principal competitors Synthes-Stratec and Walter Lorenz Surgical, Inc.
(a subsidiary of Biomet, Inc.).

In the surgical navigation segment, Stryker is one of five principal
competitors including Medtronic Surgical Navigation Technologies (a division of
Medtronic, Inc.), BrainLAB Inc. (a subsidiary of BrainLAB AG), AESCULAP AG &
Co. KG (a division of B. Braun Melsungen AG), Radionics, Inc. (a subsidiary of
Tyco International Ltd.) and GE Medical Systems Navigation and Visualization,
Inc. (a subsidiary of General Electric Company).

The Company's primary competitor in the hospital bed segment is Hill-Rom
Company, Inc. (a division of Hillenbrand Industries, Inc.).  In the
specialty stretcher segment, the primary competitors are Hausted, Inc. (a
subsidiary of STERIS Corporation), Hill-Rom Company, Inc., and Midmark Hospital
Products Group (a subsidiary of Ohio Medical Instrument Company, Inc.).  In
the ambulance cot segment, Ferno-Washington, Inc. is the Company's principal
competitor.

In the United States outpatient physical and occupational rehabilitation
market, the Company's primary competitors are independent therapist-owned
practices and hospital-based services, in addition to other national
rehabilitation companies, including HEALTHSOUTH Corporation and NovaCare
Rehabilitation (a division of Select Medical Corporation).

The Company believes that several companies are engaged in the research and
development of morphogenic proteins for the repair of hard and soft tissues that
would compete with the Company's OP-1 product.  Wyeth has completed human
clinical trials of a recombinant bone morphogenetic protein ("rhBMP-2") for
repair of orthopaedic and other skeletal defects and has awarded certain
distribution rights to Medtronic Sofamor Danek for rhBMP-2 in the United States
and Europe.  A number of companies currently provide various other
therapies, including allografts, bone fillers and electrical stimulation devices
for the treatment, repair or replacement of bone and joint tissue.  The
Company believes that its OP-1 product, which is approved for limited trauma
indications in certain markets and is currently in clinical trials for other
indications, would ultimately compete with these products and traditional
therapies, such as autograft.

The principal factors that the Company believes differentiate it in these
highly competitive market segments and enable it to compete effectively are
innovation, reliability, service and reputation.  The Company is not able
to predict the effect that continuing efforts to reduce health-care expenses
generally and hospital costs in particular will have on the future sales of its
products or its competitive position.  (See "Regulation and Product
Quality.")  The Company believes that its competitive position in the
future will depend to a large degree on the new products and improvements in
existing products it is able to develop.  While the Company does not
consider patents a major factor in its overall competitive success, patents and
trademarks are significant to the extent that a product or attribute of a
product represents a unique design or process.  Patent or trademark
protection of such products restricts competitors from duplicating these unique
designs and features.  Stryker seeks to obtain patent protection whenever
possible on its products.  The Company currently has approximately 730
United States patents and 1,190 international patents.

MANUFACTURING AND SOURCES OF SUPPLY

The Company's manufacturing processes consist primarily of precision
machining, metal fabrication and assembly operations and the forging and
investment casting of cobalt chrome and finishing of cobalt chrome and
titanium.  Approximately 12% of the Company's cost of sales in 2002
represented finished products that were purchased complete from outside
suppliers.  The Company also purchases parts and components, such as
forgings, castings, gears, bearings, casters and electrical components, and uses
outside sources for certain finishing operations, such as plating, hardening and
coating of machined components and sterilization of certain products.  The
principal raw materials used by the Company are stainless steel, aluminum,
cobalt chrome and titanium alloys.  In all, purchased parts and components
from outside sources were approximately 40% of the total cost of sales in
2002.

While the Company relies on single sources for certain purchased materials
and services, it believes alternate sources are available if needed.  The
Company has not experienced any significant difficulty in the past in obtaining
the materials necessary to meet its production schedules.

Products manufactured by the Company's Stryker Medical division are generally
assembled to order, while other products are stocked in inventory.

REGULATION AND PRODUCT QUALITY

The Medical Device Amendments of 1976 to the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic
Act, the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990, and regulations issued or proposed
thereunder, provide for regulation by the FDA of the design, manufacture and
marketing of medical devices, including most of the Company's products.

The FDA's Quality System regulations set forth standards for the Company's
product design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain
records and provide for inspections of the Company's facilities by the
FDA.  There are also certain requirements of state, local and foreign
governments that must be complied with in the manufacturing and marketing of the
Company's products.  The Company believes that the manufacturing and
quality control procedures it employs meet the requirements of these
regulations.

Most of the Company's new products fall into FDA classifications that require
notification of and review by the FDA before marketing, submitted as a 510(k).
The Company's OP-1 product requires extensive clinical testing, consisting of
safety and efficacy studies, followed by a PMA application for a specific
surgical indication.

Stryker also is subject to the laws that govern the manufacture and
distribution of medical devices of each country in which the Company
manufactures or sells products.  The member states of the European Union
("EU") have adopted the European Medical Device Directives, which create a
single set of medical device regulations for all EU member countries. 
These regulations require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute
medical devices in EU member countries to obtain Community European ("CE") marks
for their products.  Stryker has authorization to apply the CE mark to its
hip, knee, upper extremity, spinal implant and trauma products, and to its
Endoscopy, Instruments, Leibinger and Medical division products.  The
Company's OP-1 product has been considered a drug under the regulations for
Europe, Australia and Japan.

Government agencies, legislative bodies and private sector initiatives to
limit the growth of health-care costs, including price regulation and
competitive pricing, are continuing in markets where the Company does business,
including the United States, Europe and Japan.  It is impossible to predict
at this time the long-term impact of such cost containment measures on the
Company's future business.

EMPLOYEES

At December 31, 2002, the Company had 14,045 employees worldwide, including
5,138 involved in manufacturing, warehousing and distribution operations; 3,825
in marketing and sales; 746 in research, development and engineering; 2,914
providing physical, occupational and speech therapy; and the balance in general
management and administration.  Approximately 1,540 employees are covered
by collective bargaining agreements.  On August 23, 2002, the Company and
the I.U.E.-CWA Local 485 entered into a Shutdown Agreement and Release
("SAR").  The SAR covers approximately 400 domestic employees and was
entered into pursuant to the Company's decision to close its Rutherford, New
Jersey manufacturing facility.  The SAR expires at the earliest of August
31, 2004 or when the Rutherford operation closes.  Additional information
regarding the Company's decision to close its Rutherford operation appears in
"Note 6 - Restructuring and Acquisition-Related Liabilities" on pages 42 through
44 of this report.  Labor agreements covering approximately 1,140
international employees are updated annually.  The Company believes that
its employee relations are satisfactory.

      RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Results of Operations

The table below outlines the components of the consolidated statements of
earnings as a percentage of net sales and the year-to-year percentage change in
dollar amounts:

The table below sets forth domestic/international and product line sales
information:

2002 Compared with 2001

Stryker Corporation's net sales increased 16% in 2002 to
$3,011.6 million from $2,602.3 million in 2001.  Net sales grew by 11%
as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix; 3% related to
higher selling prices; and 2% as a result of acquired businesses.

Domestic sales were $1,973.7 million for 2002, representing an increase of
17% as a result of strong shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg
Equipment and higher revenue from Physical Therapy Services.  The July 1,
2002, acquisition of the Surgical Dynamics Inc. spinal implant business (SDI)
from Tyco International Ltd. added $22.8 million to domestic sales for
2002.  International sales were $1,037.9 million for 2002, representing an
increase of 14% as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and
MedSurg Equipment.  The acquisition of SDI added $2.5 million to
international sales for 2002.  The impact of foreign currency comparisons
to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $13.7 million for
2002.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency, international sales
increased 12% in 2002.

Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $1,704.8 million for 2002,
representing an increase of 18% as a result of higher shipments of
reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma and spinal implants. 
Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of Orthopaedic Implants
increased 17% in 2002.  Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $1,105.3
million for 2002, representing an increase of 13% as a result of higher
shipments of powered surgical instruments, endoscopic systems, hospital beds and
stretchers and Leibinger craniomaxillofacial implants and image-guided surgical
systems. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of MedSurg Equipment
increased 13% in 2002.  Physical Therapy Services revenues were $201.5
million for 2002, representing an increase of 11% as a result of new physical
therapy centers and higher revenue from existing centers.

Cost of sales represented 36.9% of sales compared with 37.0% in 2001. 
The slightly lower cost of sales percentage in 2002 is due to an increase in the
absorption of fixed manufacturing costs caused by increased production at
certain of the Company's manufacturing plants to meet current demand and higher
sales growth for the higher margin Orthopaedic Implant products, offset
partially by higher product obsolescence resulting from product launches.

While research, development and engineering expenses in 2002 were consistent
with prior year amounts, they decreased to 4.7% of sales from 5.5% in
2001.   Research, development and engineering spending was affected in
2002 by the commercial launch of the osteogenic protein-1 (OP-1) product, which
occurred in various markets in the second and fourth quarters of 2001. 
Following the launch, in 2002 Stryker Biotech recorded a greater proportion of
its expenses as cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses,
compared with 2001 when this division classified substantially all of its costs
as research, development and engineering. Increased spending from the Company's
continued focus on new product development partially offset the decreased
research, development and engineering expenses related to Stryker Biotech. 
New product introductions in 2002 included ScorpioFlex knee for the United
States market, Super Secur-Fit Plus hip for the Japanese market, Trident Ceramic
Acetabular Hip System in Canada, Xia II Spinal System, System 5 heavy-duty,
battery-powered system, TPS Saber Drill, SDC Pro 2 surgical DVD documentation
system, PainPump2, Precision System for percutaneous cement delivery,
fluoroscopic software module for the Stryker Navigation System and Go Bed +.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 18% in 2002 and
represented 38.7% of sales compared with 37.9% in 2001.  The increase in
selling, general and administrative expense is partially due to an increase in
sales commission expense as a result of the 16% increase in net sales in
2002.  In addition, the Company incurred an $8.9 million increase in
insurance costs during 2002.  The change in classification of certain
Stryker Biotech expenses, as discussed above, also contributed to the increase
in selling, general and administrative expenses.  Discount expense related
to the accounts receivable securitization program, which is included in selling,
general and administrative expenses, declined to $2.7 million in 2002 from $5.8
million in 2001 as a result of lower discount rates.

The Company recognized charges of $17.2 million in continuing operations
($11.5 million net of income taxes) relating to restructuring and
acquisition-related items in the third quarter of 2002 and restructuring and
acquisition-related charges of $0.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2001. 
The 2002 restructuring and acquisition-related items include a charge of $21.0
million ($14.1 million net of income taxes) for employment-related costs to
close the Company's Rutherford, New Jersey manufacturing facility, partially
offset by a credit of $3.8 million ($2.6 million net of income taxes) to reverse
certain Howmedica restructuring and acquisition-related costs to reflect actual
final payments required.  The $21.0 million restructuring charge relates to
the shutdown agreement reached between the Company and the employee bargaining
unit to close the Howmedica Osteonics implant manufacturing facility in
Rutherford, New Jersey which was ratified by the members of the I.U.E.-CWA Local
485 on August 23, 2002.  Under the agreement, laid-off employees will
receive significantly more benefits than they would have under the Collective
Bargaining Agreement that was set to expire on August 31, 2002.  In
addition, at least 80 qualified employees from the Rutherford facility will be
offered employment at the new Howmedica Osteonics facility in Mahwah, New
Jersey.  The charge covers employment-related severance costs for
approximately 400 employees.  The Company expects the Rutherford facility
to be closed over the next 12 months with final severance payments to be made in
2004.  As Howmedica Osteonics prepares to permanently cease manufacturing
in Rutherford, it will transition production to its facilities in Mahwah, New
Jersey as well as Cork and Limerick, Ireland.

In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recognized charges of $0.6 million
in continuing operations related to various restructuring and
acquisition-related events.  The 2001 restructuring and acquisition-related
charges included $2.4 million of charges, partially offset by the reversal of
prior year restructuring accruals totaling $1.8 million.  See the following
comparison of 2001 results to 2000 results for additional information.

Interest expense declined to $40.3 million in 2002 from $67.9 million in
2001, primarily as a result of lower outstanding debt balances.  The
decrease in intangibles amortization to $28.9 million in 2002 from $38.4 million
in 2001 is primarily the result of the Company's adoption of Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 142,

Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets

, which prohibits the amortization of goodwill.  If
the nonamortization provisions of Statement No. 142 had been applied in the
prior year, amortization expense for 2001 would have been reduced by $18.1
million and net earnings would have increased by $12.1 million ($.06 per diluted
share).  Other expense was $0.5 million in 2002, compared with $1.6 million
of other income in 2001 due to foreign currency transaction losses in the
current year versus gains in the prior year, partially offset by higher interest
income.

The effective income tax rate was 31.8% in 2002 compared with 33.0% in
2001.  The Company's effective income tax rate for the year was reduced
from 33.0% to 31.8% in the fourth quarter of 2002, thereby reducing income tax
expense by $6.1 million, primarily as a result of increased manufacturing in
lower tax jurisdictions such as Ireland and Puerto Rico.

Earnings before extraordinary item increased 27% to $345.6 million from
$271.8 million in 2001; basic earnings per share before extraordinary item
increased 27% to $1.75 in 2002 from $1.38 in 2001; and diluted earnings per
share before extraordinary item increased 27% to $1.70 in 2002 from $1.34 in
2001.  In December 2001, the Company refinanced and prepaid the remaining
$642.7 million outstanding under the $1,650.0 million Senior Secured Credit
Facilities established in 1998 in connection with the Howmedica
acquisition.  The prepayment of the 1998 Facilities resulted in the
write-off in 2001 of related unamortized deferred loan costs of $7.1 million,
which was reflected as an extraordinary loss of $4.8 million (net of income
taxes of $2.3 million; $.02 per basic and diluted share).  Net earnings
were $345.6 million (basic and diluted net earnings per share of $1.75 and
$1.70, respectively) compared with $267.0 million (basic and diluted net
earnings per share of $1.36 and $1.32, respectively) in 2001.

Excluding nonrecurring items that include the impact of the restructuring and
acquisition-related items on 2002 and 2001 and the impact of the change in
goodwill amortization and the extraordinary loss on 2001, net earnings in 2002
were $357.1 million, representing a 26% increase over net earnings of $284.3
million in 2001.  Diluted net earnings per share increased 25% to $1.75
compared with $1.40 in 2001.  The reconciliations, including related
earnings per share amounts, of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings
before nonrecurring items are as follows:

2001 Compared with 2000

Stryker Corporation's net sales increased 14% in 2001 to
$2,602.3 million from $2,289.4 million in 2000.  Net sales grew by 12%
as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix; 3% related to
higher selling prices; 1% as a result of acquired businesses; and 1% related to
the inclusion of freight revenue in net sales in 2001. Freight revenue was
recorded as an offset to cost of sales during 2000.  These increases were
partially offset by a 3% decline due to changes in foreign currency exchange
rates.

The Company's domestic sales increased 20% in 2001 to $1,688.4 million from
$1,408.2 million in 2000.  The domestic sales gain was the result of higher
shipments of Orthopaedic Implants, MedSurg Equipment and higher revenue from
Physical Therapy Services.  International sales increased 4% for the year
to $913.9 million from $881.2 million in 2000 as a result of higher shipments of
Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  The impact of foreign currency
comparisons on the dollar value of international sales was unfavorable by $62.1
million for the year.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency,
international sales increased 11% in 2001.

Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $1,447.2 million for 2001,
representing an increase of 10% as a result of higher shipments of
reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma and spinal implants. 
Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of Orthopaedic Implants
increased 13% in 2001.  Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $974.2
million for 2001, representing an increase of 18% based on higher shipments of
powered surgical instruments, endoscopic systems, hospital beds and stretchers
and Leibinger craniomaxillofacial implants and image-guided surgical
systems.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of MedSurg
Equipment increased 20% in 2001.  Physical Therapy Services revenues were
$180.9 million for 2001, representing an increase of 23% as a result of new
physical therapy centers and higher revenue from existing centers.

Cost of sales represented 37.0% of sales compared with 35.6% in 2000. 
The higher cost of sales percentage in 2001 resulted primarily from the change
in recording of freight revenue described above and the classification of
certain shipping costs as cost of sales in 2001 that had been reported in
selling, general and administrative expenses in the prior year.  The cost
of sales percentage increased approximately 1.0% in 2001 as a result of the
change in classification of freight revenue and shipping costs.  Cost of
sales for 2001 was also higher by approximately 0.4% due to an increase in
unabsorbed manufacturing costs caused by the slowing of production in certain of
the Company's manufacturing plants to reduce overall inventory levels.  The
Company continually assesses the overall capacity provided by its manufacturing
plants relative to cost, inventory management and expected sales growth.  A
slight increase in Orthopaedic Implant margins was more than offset by higher
sales and revenues of lower-margin MedSurg Equipment products and Physical
Therapy Services.

Research, development and engineering expenses increased 16% in 2001 and
represented 5.5% of sales compared with 5.3% in 2000.  The increase in
research, development and engineering spending in 2001 resulted from continued
Company-wide focus on new product development.  New product introductions
in 2001 included the Accolade Cemented Hip Stem, EIUS knee, T2 Intramedullary
Nail System, Reflex Anterior Cervical Plate, Percutaneous Cement Delivery
System, Elite Attachments for TPS, Cordless Driver II, Stryker Knee Navigation
System, SDC Pro 2 surgical documentation system, 988 Digital Camera, Go Bed,
Trio Mobile Surgery Platform and an enhanced Secure II bed.  In the second
quarter of 2001, the Company received marketing approval for its OP-1 product in
Australia and the European Union.  The approved indication in Australia was
for the treatment of nonunion of long bone fractures secondary to trauma for the
purposes of initiating repair by new bone formation.  The approved
indication in Europe was for tibial nonunions of nine-month duration, secondary
to trauma, in skeletally mature patients, in cases where previous treatment with
autograft has failed or use of autograft is unfeasible.  In the fourth
quarter of 2001, the Company was granted Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE)
status for OP-1 by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 
The approved indication in the United States was for use as an alternative to
autograft in recalcitrant long bone nonunions where use of autograft is
unfeasible and alternative treatments have failed.  Under the HDE, OP-1 has
been made available as a humanitarian device, defined by the FDA as one intended
to benefit patients by treating or diagnosing a disease or condition that
affects fewer than 4,000 individuals per year in the United States  The
first commercial sales of OP-1 in Australia began in mid-May 2001 and the
commercial launch of OP-1 in select markets of the European Union began in
August.  The first sales of OP-1 in the United States under the HDE began
in November.  The commercial launch of OP-1 did not have a significant
impact on sales in 2001.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 11% in 2001 and
represented 37.9% of sales compared with 38.7% in 2000.  The classification
of certain shipping costs as cost of sales in 2001 reduced selling, general and
administrative expenses as a percent of sales by approximately 0.4% in
2001.  In addition, discount expense related to the accounts receivable
securitization program, which was included in selling, general and
administrative expenses, declined to $5.8 million in 2001 from $7.1 million in
2000 as a result of lower discount rates.

The Company recognized charges of $0.6 million in continuing operations
relating to various restructuring and acquisition-related events in the fourth
quarter of 2001 and recognized restructuring and acquisition-related credits of
$1.0 million in 2000.  The 2001 restructuring and acquisition-related
charges include $2.4 million of charges, partially offset by the reversal of
prior year restructuring accruals totaling $1.8 million.  The $2.4 million
in 2001 charges included a $0.9 million acquisition-related charge for severance
and related costs associated with the reorganization of the Company's sales
structure in Italy to accommodate the integration of the business acquired from
the Company's independent Italian distributor.  The reorganization
established a direct sales force in Italy that distributes the Company's full
product portfolio.  The $0.9 million charge covered severance costs for
three employees in Italy and costs to cancel contracts with discontinued
agents.  The reorganization of the sales structure in Italy was completed
in the first quarter of 2002.  The 2001 charge also included a $0.7 million
charge related to the reorganization of the Company's distribution channels in
Latin America and $0.8 million for severance costs for 10 employees in
Europe.  The $0.7 million charge reflected the cost to terminate a
distributor and was based on contractual terms.  Planned European workforce
reductions were completed in the first quarter of 2002.  The $1.8 million
in credits included $1.4 million related to a reduction in the expected costs to
complete headcount reductions associated with the 2000 and 1999 reorganizations
of the Company's European and Japanese distribution operations.  The 2001
credits also included $0.4 million to reverse the remaining loss reserves
established in Japan for discontinued ophthalmology inventories sold on a
contingent basis in 1999.

In 2000, the Company recognized credits of $1.0 million, consisting of the
reversal of prior year restructuring accruals totaling $7.0 million, partially
offset by charges totaling $6.0 million. The $7.0 million in credits included
$1.2 million related to the reorganization of Stryker's distribution channels
associated with the acquisition of Howmedica and $2.7 million to reverse
reserves for a distributor reorganization that was charged to operations in
1996.  The credits also included $2.7 million related to a reduction in the
expected costs to complete headcount reductions in Japan and $0.4 million to
reverse a portion of loss reserves established in Japan for discontinued
ophthalmology inventories sold on a contingent basis in 1999.  The $6.0
million in 2000 restructuring charges included a $4.0 million charge to cover
severance costs for 95 employees, primarily in Europe; $1.4 million for asset
write-offs, primarily for goodwill and inventory, and lease commitments
associated with certain operations, principally in Europe, that were closed in
the fourth quarter of 2000.  The planned workforce reductions were
completed in 2001, and the remaining amount of the reserve was reversed in
2001.  The 2000 restructuring charges also included $0.6 million to
terminate two small European distributors.

Interest expense declined to $67.9 million in 2001 from $96.6 million in
2000, primarily as a result of lower outstanding debt balances.  The
increase in intangibles amortization to $38.4 million in 2001 from $34.7 million
in 2000 related primarily to business acquisitions during 2001 and the second
half of 2000.  Other income increased to $1.6 million in 2001 from other
expense of $1.2 million in 2000, primarily as a result of foreign currency
transaction gains in 2001 versus foreign currency transaction losses in 2000,
partially offset by lower interest income.  The effective income tax rate
for 2001 was 33.0% compared with a 34.0% effective income tax rate in
2000.  The decrease in the rate from 2000 to 2001 was attributable to the
mix of operating results among the tax jurisdictions.

Earnings before extraordinary item increased 23% to $271.8 million in 2001
from $221.0 million in 2000; basic earnings per share before extraordinary item
increased 22% to $1.38 in 2001 from $1.13 in 2000; and diluted earnings per
share before extraordinary item increased 22% to $1.34 in 2001 from $1.10 in
2000.  In December 2001, the Company refinanced and prepaid the remaining
$642.7 million outstanding under the $1,650.0 million Senior Secured Credit
Facilities established in 1998 in connection with the Howmedica
acquisition.  The prepayment of the 1998 Facilities resulted in the
write-off of related unamortized deferred loan costs of $7.1 million, which was
reflected as an extraordinary loss of $4.8 million (net of income taxes of $2.3
million; $.02 per basic and diluted share).  Net earnings were $267.0
million (basic and diluted net earnings per share of $1.36 and $1.32,
respectively) compared with $221.0 million (basic and diluted net earnings per
share of $1.13 and $1.10, respectively) in 2000.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company's working capital at December 31, 2002 decreased $15.9 million to
$443.8 million from $459.7 million at December 31, 2001.  The working
capital decrease is due primarily to lower cash balances, additional liabilities
resulting from restructuring and acquisition-related items recorded during 2002
and increases in other accrued liabilities, partially offset by increases in
accounts receivable and inventories.  The additional liabilities from
restructuring and acquisition-related items is the result of the aforementioned
pending closure of the Company's Rutherford, New Jersey manufacturing
facility.  Other accrued liabilities increased in 2002 as a result of
higher obligations for third-party sales agent commissions, third-party
royalties, non-income based taxes and general increases in other accrued
liabilities.  Accounts receivable days sales outstanding, excluding the
effect of the Company's $130.0 million accounts receivable securitization
program, decreased 1 day to 58 days at December 31, 2002 from 59 days at
December 31, 2001.  The lower days sales outstanding at December 31, 2002
is the result of improved collection efforts as well as an increase in the
allowance for bad debts to provide for potential exposures in Europe and Latin
America.  Days sales in inventory decreased 12 days to 126 days at December
31, 2002 from 138 days at December 31, 2001.  The lower days sales in
inventory is primarily the result of improved inventory management and higher
provisions for product obsolescence as a result of product launches.

The Company generated cash of $503.9 million from operations in 2002 compared
with $468.3 million in 2001.  The generation of cash in 2002 is the result
of strong cash earnings (net earnings plus noncash adjustments) and increases in
accrued expenses and income tax liabilities and decreases in the accounts
receivable and inventory days mentioned previously.  These items were
partially offset by increases in deferred charges and accounts receivable from
increased sales and payments of $8.4 million attributable to restructuring and
acquisition-related liabilities and acquisition purchase liabilities.  In
2002, the Company used cash of $173.6 million for business and product line
acquisitions, $139.0 million for capital expenditures and $19.7 million for the
payment of dividends.  Business and product line acquisitions include
$135.0 million paid to Tyco International Ltd. in the third quarter to acquire
SDI, $14.0 million paid to Curis, Inc. to eliminate all royalties payable on
future sales of OP-1 and $10.0 million paid to Pain Concepts, Inc. to acquire
the DEKOMPRESSOR product line (as further discussed in Other Matters).  In
addition to the borrowings used to fund business and product line acquisitions,
the Company borrowed an additional $438.0 million under its existing credit
facilities to fund cash flow needs during 2002 and made repayments of $836.6
million against the credit facilities.  Total borrowings declined by $220.9
million after adjusting for the effect of foreign currency translation.

In 2002, the Company used cash of $139.0 million for capital expenditures,
including $17.9 million related to the construction of Phase II of the Company's
Mahwah, New Jersey manufacturing and distribution facility.  In addition,
the Company spent $14.3 million for the expansion of the Company's Cork, Ireland
manufacturing facility and $8.8 million for improvements to the Company's newly
leased Endoscopy manufacturing facility in San Jose, California.

The Company had $37.8 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31,
2002.  The Company also had outstanding borrowings totaling $501.7 million
at that date.  Current maturities of long-term debt at December 31, 2002
are $10.7 million and will decrease to $0.2 million in 2004 and $0.2 million in
2005.  The Company's $250.0 million 364-day revolving credit agreement
expires in December 2003 and is renewable at the Company's and the lenders'
discretion.  The Company's $750.0 million five-year, nonamortizing,
revolving credit agreement expires in December 2006.  The Company believes
its cash on hand as well as anticipated cash flows from operations will be
sufficient to fund future operating and capital requirements and required debt
repayments.  Should additional funds be required, the Company had $589.8
million of additional borrowing capacity available under all of its existing
credit facilities at December 31, 2002.

The Company's future contractual obligations for agreements with initial
terms greater than one year are summarized as follows:

The Company's additional borrowing capacity, along with the expected
expiration period of the commitments, are summarized as follows:

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
the financial statements and accompanying notes.  On an on-going basis,
management evaluates these estimates.  Estimates are based on historical
experience, when available, and on various other assumptions that are believed
to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis
for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that
are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Management believes that an understanding of the following critical
accounting policies is important in obtaining an overall understanding of the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Inventory Reserves

:  The Company maintains reserves for excess
and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its
products at prices in excess of current carrying costs.  The markets in
which the Company operates are highly competitive, with new products and
surgical procedures introduced on an on-going basis.  Such marketplace
changes may cause the Company's products to become obsolete.  The Company
makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these
products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on
historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future
trends.  If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new
product introductions are less favorable than projected by management,
additional inventory write-downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect
future operating results.

Income Taxes

:  The Company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions
both inside and outside the United States.  Accordingly, management must
determine the appropriate allocation of income in accordance with local law for
each of these jurisdictions.  Tax audits associated with the allocation of
this income and other complex issues that may arise require an extended period
of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the
income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax
rates.  The Company believes its income tax accruals are adequate to cover
exposures related to such potential changes in income allocation between tax
jurisdictions.  To the extent additional information becomes available,
such accruals are adjusted to reflect revised probable outcomes.

Impairment of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangibles

:  The
Company follows the provisions of FASB Statement No. 142,

Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets

, in determining the amount, if any, by which the Company's
goodwill may be impaired in value.  The Company uses the two-step process
prescribed in Statement No. 142.  The first step is a screen for potential
impairment.  The second step, if necessary, measures the amount of the
impairment.  Inherent in the two-step process are certain assumptions and
estimates necessary to determine fair values for reportable units, as defined in
Statement No. 142.  Should actual results or changes in future expectations
differ from those projected by management, goodwill impairment charges may be
required which could unfavorably affect future operating results.  See
Other Matters for further discussion regarding the adoption of Statement No.
142.

Other Matters

The Company distributes its products throughout the world.  As a result,
the Company's financial results could be significantly affected by factors such
as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in
foreign markets.  The Company's operating results are primarily exposed to
changes in exchange rates among the United States dollar and the Japanese yen
and European currencies, particularly the euro and the British pound.  When
the United States dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the dollar
value of foreign currency sales declines.  When the United States dollar
weakens, the opposite situation occurs.  The Company manufactures its
products in the United States, France, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, Canada and
Puerto Rico and incurs the costs to manufacture in the applicable local
currencies.  This worldwide deployment of factories serves to partially
mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the Company's cost of
sales.

The Company has certain investments in net assets in international locations
that are not hedged that are subject to translation gains and losses due to
changes in foreign currencies.  For the year ended December 31, 2002, the
strengthening of foreign currencies increased the value of these investments in
net assets by $79.4 million.  This gain reduced the previously recorded
cumulative loss from weakening of foreign currencies that is deferred and
recorded as a separate component of stockholders' equity.

As of January 1, 2001, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

, as amended
by Statements No. 137 and No. 138.  The Statements require the Company to
recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.  Derivatives
that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through earnings.  If a
derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair
value of derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of the
hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in
accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) until the hedged item is recognized
in earnings.

The Company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the
impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional
currencies, thereby limiting risk to the Company that would otherwise result
from changes in exchange rates. These nonfunctional currency exposures
principally relate to intercompany payables arising from intercompany purchases
of manufactured products.  The periods of the forward currency exchange
contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized
gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions
denominated in the nonfunctional currencies.

At December 31, 2002, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange
contracts to purchase $82.0 million and sell $97.7 million of various currencies
(principally United States dollars and euros) with maturities ranging
principally from 30 to 180 days.  At December 31, 2001, the Company had
outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $97.4 million and
sell $72.1 million of various currencies (principally United States dollars and
euros) with maturities ranging principally from 30 to 180 days.  The
estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the
measurement of the contracts at month-end spot rates as adjusted for amortized
forward points.  A hypothetical 10% change in exchange rates for these
currencies would change the 2002 fair value by approximately $0.5 million and
would have changed the 2001 fair value by approximately $1.4 million.

The Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates
to its borrowings and the accounts receivable securitization facility.  The
Company manages the interest rate risk on its borrowings through interest rate
swap agreements, which have fixed the base rate on a $250.0 million notional
amount of the $486.9 million of variable-rate borrowings outstanding at December
31, 2002.  If market interest rates for similar borrowings had averaged 1%
more than they did in 2002, the Company's 2002 interest expense, after
considering the effects of its interest rate swaps, would have increased, and
earnings before income taxes would have decreased by $1.1 million.  By
comparison, if market interest rates had averaged 1% less than they did during
2002, the Company's 2002 interest expense, after considering the effects of its
interest rate swaps, would have decreased, and earnings before income taxes
would have increased by $1.1 million.  If market interest rates for the
accounts receivable securitization facility had averaged 1% more than they did
in 2002, the Company's discount expense would have increased, and earnings
before income taxes would have decreased by $1.3 million.  By comparison,
if market interest rates had averaged 1% less than they did in 2002, the
Company's discount expense would have decreased, and earnings before income
taxes would have increased by $1.3 million.  These amounts are determined
by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the Company's
borrowing cost, interest rate swap agreements and accounts receivable
securitization facility without any actions by management to mitigate its
exposure to such changes.

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by
counterparties on the above instruments, but does not anticipate nonperformance
by any of the counterparties.

The Company's interest rate swap agreements effectively convert a portion of
its variable-rate borrowings to a fixed-rate basis through 2003, thus reducing
the impact of changes in interest rates on future interest expense. 
Approximately 51% of the Company's outstanding variable-rate borrowings as of
December 31, 2002 have been hedged through the designation of interest rate swap
agreements classified as cash flow hedges.  A gain of $9.3 million
attributable to changes in the fair value of interest rate swap agreements was
recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) in
2002.  If in the future the interest rate swap agreements were determined
to be ineffective or were terminated before the contractual termination dates,
or if it became probable that the hedged variable cash flows associated with the
variable-rate borrowings would stop, the Company would be required to reclassify
into earnings all or a portion of the unrealized losses on cash flow hedges
included in accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss).  Interest rate
differentials to be paid or received as a result of interest rate swaps are
recognized as an adjustment of interest expense related to the designated
borrowings.  Based on the maturities of the Company's interest rate swap
agreements, interest expense for the year ending December 31, 2003 is expected
to be $9.2 million higher than the interest cost on the variable-rate borrowings
through the recognition of amounts included as unrealized losses on cash flow
hedges at December 31, 2002.

The Company uses yen-denominated floating-rate borrowings to protect a
portion of the value of its investment in its subsidiary in Japan. 
Realized and unrealized gains and losses from this hedge are not included in the
Consolidated Statements of Earnings, but are recorded as foreign currency
translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) in
stockholders' equity.  Net gains (losses) of ($1.6) million, $5.8 million
and $7.7 million attributable to the yen-denominated floating-rate borrowings
hedge were recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments in 2002, 2001
and 2000, respectively.

As of January 1, 2002, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Statement
No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

, related to acquisitions
completed before July 1, 2001.  Statement No. 142 prohibits the
amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and
requires the Company to evaluate these intangibles for impairment on an annual
basis.  In accordance with the Statement's provisions, an assembled
workforce intangible asset with an unamortized balance of $5.5 million as of
January 1, 2002 was reclassified from other intangibles to goodwill.  In
the first quarter of 2002, the Company completed the initial impairment test of
goodwill and, in the fourth quarter of 2002, completed the required annual
impairment test of goodwill as prescribed by Statement No. 142, and determined
that recorded goodwill was not impaired and no goodwill write-down was
necessary.

In October 2002, the Company purchased the DEKOMPRESSOR product line from
Pain Concepts, Inc., at a total cost of $10.0 million giving the Company access
to intellectual property and other commercial rights relating to the design and
manufacture of certain medical devices.  Intangible assets acquired,
principally patents, are being amortized over 17 years.  The Company is
contingently liable for potential future milestone payments of up to $42.5
million, primarily based on future sales growth over the next five years.

On October 1, 2002, the Company entered into an agreement with Curis, Inc.,
which eliminated all royalties payable to Curis relating to future Stryker sales
of OP-1.  Under terms of the agreement, the Company made a one-time cash
payment of $14.0 million to Curis.  The payment was allocated to existing
patents and is being amortized over 15 years.

On July 1, 2002, the Company acquired SDI from Tyco International Ltd., for
$135.0 million in cash.  The acquisition expands the Company's spinal
product line by adding interbody spinal cages for the United States market as
well as other thoracolumbar and cervical spinal fixation devices.  The
acquisition was funded using existing credit facilities.

The acquisition of SDI was accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting.  The results of operations for the acquired business are
included in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements beginning July 1,
2002.  The acquisition of SDI added $25.3 million to the Company's sales
for the second half of 2002.   SDI had sales of $55.6 million for the
year ended December 31, 2001 and sales of $33.1 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2002.  The purchase price of $135.0 million in cash and
liabilities assumed has been preliminarily allocated to the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of
acquisition.  Based on the preliminary purchase price allocation, $87.1
million of the purchase price was allocated to patent licensing agreements to be
amortized over their remaining life of 8 years, $12.4 million to inventory,
$38.0 million to deferred tax assets related to future tax deductions, $5.1
million to other tangible assets and $7.6 million to liabilities assumed. 
Immediately after the acquisition was consummated, management of the Company
began to implement an integration plan to combine Stryker and SDI.  In
conjunction with the integration plan, the Company has recorded additional
purchase liabilities of $3.6 million, which were included in the preliminary
purchase price allocation.  The additional purchase liabilities include
$3.1 million for severance and related costs and $0.5 million for contractual
obligations.  The severance and related costs are provided for workforce
reductions covering 37 SDI employees.  The workforce reductions were
completed during the fourth quarter of 2002 with severance payments to be made
through the third quarter of 2003.  The Company's pro forma consolidated
financial results did not differ significantly as a result of the SDI
acquisition.

In July 2002, the FASB issued Statement No. 146,

Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities

.  The Statement addresses
the timing of recognition and the related measurement of the costs of one-time
termination benefits such as those associated with the closing of the Rutherford
facility.  Under the provisions of Statement No. 146, the
employment-related closing costs for Rutherford would be recognized over the
12-month closing period.  Statement No. 146 is effective for exit
activities initiated after December 31, 2002, with early application
allowed.  The Company initiated the actions related to Rutherford in June
2002 and did not adopt the provisions of Statement No. 146 when recording the
costs of the Rutherford closing.  Accordingly, the actual
employment-related costs of the closing were expensed, upon union approval of
the shutdown agreement, in the third quarter of 2002.

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45,

Guarantor's
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others

.  Interpretation No. 45 changes
current practice in accounting for, and disclosure of, guarantees. 
Interpretation No. 45 will require that certain guarantees be recorded as
liabilities at fair value on the Company's balance sheet.  Current practice
requires that liabilities related to guarantees be recorded only when a loss is
probable and reasonably estimable, as those terms are defined in FASB Statement
No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

.  Interpretation No. 45 also
requires a guarantor to make significant new disclosures, even when the
likelihood of making any payments under the guarantee is remote, which is
another change from current practice.  The disclosure requirements of
Interpretation No. 45 are effective immediately and are included in Note 14,
"Contingencies" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  The initial
recognition and measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to
guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002.  The Company has not
yet determined what effect, if any, the new recognition and measurement
provisions will have on the Company's future financial results.

In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement No. 148,

Accounting

for
Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure - an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 123

.  Statement No. 148 amends Statement No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

, to provide alternative methods
of transition for a voluntary change to the fair-value based method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation.  In addition, Statement
No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of Statement No. 123 to require
disclosure in interim financial statements regarding the method of accounting
for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on
reported results.  The Company does not intend to adopt a fair-value based
method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation until a final
standard is issued by the FASB that addresses concerns related to applicability
of current option pricing models to non-exchange traded employee stock option
plans.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Stryker Corporation and
Subsidiaries

December 31, 2002

(in millions, except per share
amounts)

NOTE 1

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Business

: Stryker Corporation develops, manufactures and markets
specialty surgical and medical products that are sold primarily to hospitals
throughout the world and provides outpatient physical therapy services in the
United States.

Principles of Consolidation

: The Consolidated Financial Statements
include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries after
elimination of all significant intercompany accounts and transactions.

Revenue Recognition

: Revenue is recognized on the sale of products and
services when the related goods have been shipped and title passes or services
have been rendered.

Shipping and Handling of Products

: Amounts billed to customers for
shipping and handling of products are included in net sales in 2002 and
2001.  Prior to 2001, such amounts were recorded as an offset to cost of
sales.  Costs incurred related to shipping and handling of products are
included in cost of sales in 2002 and 2001.  Prior to 2001, certain
shipping costs were reported in selling, general and administrative
expenses.

Use of Estimates

: The preparation of these Consolidated Financial
Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
Company management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. 
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currency Translation

: The functional currencies for the
Company's international affiliates are their local currencies. 
Accordingly, the financial statements of the Company's international affiliates
are translated into United States dollars using current exchange rates for
balance sheets and average exchange rates for statements of earnings and cash
flows.  Unrealized translation adjustments are included in accumulated
other comprehensive gain (loss) in stockholders' equity.  Transaction gains
and losses, such as those resulting from the settlement of nonfunctional
currency receivables or payables, are included in net earnings.

Cash Equivalents and Investments

: Cash equivalents are highly liquid
investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased. 
Investments include marketable equity securities and other investments
classified in other assets.  Other investments consist of mutual funds that
are acquired to offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred
compensation arrangements.

The Company's investments are stated at fair value based on quoted market
prices. Interest, dividends and realized gains and losses on the sale of cash
equivalents and marketable equity securities are included in other expense
(income).  Adjustments to the fair value of marketable equity securities,
which are classified as available-for-sale, are recorded as increases or
decreases, net of income taxes, within accumulated other comprehensive gain
(loss) in stockholders' equity.  Adjustments to the fair value of other
investments, which are classified as trading, are recorded in earnings as
offsets to the related changes in liabilities under deferred compensation
arrangements.

Accounts Receivable Securitization

: The Company has an accounts
receivable securitization facility pursuant to which certain subsidiaries of the
Company sell on an ongoing basis all of their domestic accounts receivable to
Stryker Funding Corporation, a wholly owned special-purpose subsidiary of the
Company, which in turn may sell up to an aggregate of a $130.0 undivided
percentage ownership interest in such receivables to a multiseller commercial
paper conduit administered by a bank.  Creditors of Stryker Funding
Corporation have a claim to its assets before any equity becomes available to
the Company.

The amounts of accounts receivable sold to Stryker Funding Corporation, net
of the Company's retained interest, totaled $130.0 at December 31, 2002 and
2001, and are reflected in the balance sheet as reductions of accounts
receivable.  The amount of receivables sold is subject to change monthly,
based on the level of defined eligible receivables less contractual reserves.
The Company's retained interest in accounts receivable held by Stryker Funding
Corporation, which is in the form of a subordinated note, represents an
overcollateralization of the undivided interest sold.  This retained
interest totaled $98.5 and $76.8 at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.  Discount expense associated with the securitization
facility, including the conduit's financing cost of issuing its commercial
paper, was $2.7 in 2002, $5.8 in 2001 and $7.1 in 2000 and is included in
selling, general and administrative expenses.

Inventories

: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or
market.  Cost for approximately 88% (87% in 2001) of inventories is
determined using the lower of first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost or market. 
Cost for certain domestic inventories is determined using the last-in, first-out
(LIFO) cost method.  The FIFO cost for all inventories approximates
replacement cost.

The Company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting
from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current
carrying costs.  The markets in which the Company operates are highly
competitive, with new products and surgical procedures introduced on an on-going
basis.  Such marketplace changes may cause the Company's products to become
obsolete.  The Company makes estimates regarding the future recoverability
of the cost of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete
inventories based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates
and expected future trends.

Property, Plant and Equipment

: Property, plant and equipment is stated
at cost. Depreciation is computed by either the straight-line or
declining-balance method over the estimated useful lives of 3 to 30 years for
buildings and improvements and 3 to 10 years for machinery and equipment.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

:  Goodwill represents the
excess of purchase price over fair value of tangible net assets of acquired
businesses after amounts allocated to other intangible assets.  Other
intangible assets include developed technology, which is amortized on a
straight-line basis over 20 years, and customer relationships (which reflect
expected continued customer patronage), trademarks, trade names and patents,
which are amortized on a straight-line basis over 5 to 35 years (weighted
average life of 15 years for other intangible assets).

Deferred Charges

: Deferred charges represent the net book value of
loaner instruments for surgical implants provided to customers by the
Company.  These instruments are amortized on a straight-line basis over a
three-year period.  Amortization expenses for instruments are included in
selling, general and administrative expenses.

Deferred Loan Costs

:
Deferred loan costs associated with the Company's borrowings are amortized over
the terms of the related borrowings using the effective-interest method. 
Deferred loan costs are classified in other assets and had a net book value of
$2.5 and $2.9 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  Amortization
expenses for deferred loan costs are included in interest expense and were $0.6
in 2002, $5.9 in 2001 and $8.2 in 2000.  The prepayment of the remaining
amounts outstanding under the Company's Senior Secured Credit Facilities in
December 2001 resulted in the write-off of related unamortized deferred loan
costs of $7.1 (see Note 7).

Income Taxes

: The Company accounts for
income taxes using the liability method.  Under this method, deferred tax
assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial
reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the
enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected
to reverse.  Deferred income tax expense (credit) represents the change in
net deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year.

Derivative
Financial Instruments

: The Company uses derivative financial instruments to
manage the economic impact of fluctuations in interest rates and currency
exchange rates.  The Company enters into interest rate swaps and currency
forward contracts to manage these economic risks.

As of January 1, 2001, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) Statement No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities

, as amended by Statements No. 137 and No. 138.  The
Statements require the Company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet
at fair value.  Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair
value through earnings.  If a derivative is a hedge, depending on the
nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset
against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm
commitments through earnings or recognized in accumulated other comprehensive
gain (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings (see Note 2).

Legal and Other Contingencies:

The Company is involved in
various proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of
business, including proceedings related to product, labor and other
matters.  The potential future outcomes of these matters are outside of
management's complete control and will generally not be known for prolonged
periods of time.  In certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek
damages, as well as other compensatory relief, which could result in the payment
of significant claims and settlements.  In legal matters for which
management has sufficient information to reasonably estimate the Company's
future obligations, a liability representing management's best estimate of the
probable cost for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded.  The
estimates are based on consultation with outside counsel, previous settlement
experience and settlement strategies.

Stock Options

: At December 31, 2002, the Company has key
employee and director stock option plans, which are described more fully in Note
8.  The Company follows Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

, in accounting for its stock
option plans.  Under Opinion No. 25, no compensation expense is
recognized because the exercise price of the Company's stock options equals the
market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant.  Had
compensation expense for the Company's stock-based compensation plans been
determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under those
plans consistent with the method of FASB Statement No. 123,

Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation

, the Company's net earnings and net earnings per
share would have been as follows:

The weighted-average fair value per share of options granted during 2002,
2001 and 2000, estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model, was $22.94, $21.76 and $14.82, respectively.  The fair value
of options granted was estimated on the date of grant using the following
assumptions:

Comprehensive Gain (Loss)

: The components of accumulated other
comprehensive gain (loss) are as follows:

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

: In July 2002, the FASB issued
Statement No. 146,

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities

.  Statement No. 146 addresses the timing of recognition and
the related measurement of the costs of one-time termination benefits such as
those associated with the closing of the Rutherford facility.  Under the
provisions of Statement No. 146, the employment-related closing costs for
Rutherford would be recognized over the 12-month closing period.  Statement
No. 146 is effective for exit activities initiated after December 31, 2002, with
early application allowed.  The Company initiated the actions related to
Rutherford in June 2002 and did not adopt the provisions of Statement No. 146
when recording the costs of the Rutherford closing.  Accordingly, the
actual employment-related costs of the closing were expensed, upon approval of
the shutdown agreement, in the third quarter of 2002.  See Note 6, "
Restructuring and Acquisition-Related Liabilities," for further information
regarding the Rutherford closing.

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45,

Guarantor's
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others

.  Interpretation No. 45 changes
current practice in accounting for, and disclosure of, guarantees. 
Interpretation No. 45 will require certain guarantees to be recorded as
liabilities at fair value on the Company's balance sheet. Current practice
requires that liabilities related to guarantees be recorded only when a loss is
probable and reasonably estimable, as those terms are defined in FASB Statement
No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

.  Interpretation No. 45 also
requires a guarantor to make significant new disclosures, even when the
likelihood of making any payments under the guarantee is remote, which is
another change from current practice.  The disclosure requirements of
Interpretation No. 45 are effective immediately and are included in Note 14,
"Contingencies."  The initial recognition and measurement provisions are
applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after
December 31, 2002.  The Company has not yet determined what effect, if any,
the new recognition and measurement provisions will have on the Company's future
financial results.

In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement No. 148,

Accounting

for
Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure - an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 123

.  Statement No. 148 amends Statement No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

, to provide alternative methods
of transition for a voluntary change to the fair-value based method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation.  In addition, Statement
No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of Statement No. 123 to require
disclosure in interim financial statements regarding the method of accounting
for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on
reported results.  The Company does not intend to adopt a fair-value based
method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation until a final
standard is issued by the FASB that addresses concerns related to the
applicability of current option pricing models to non-exchange traded employee
stock option plans.

Reclassifications

: Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified
to conform with the presentation used in 2002.

NOTE 2

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT

The following is a summary of the Company's investments:

Net realized losses on sales of the Company's investments in 2002 and 2001
totaled $0.1 and $0.9, respectively.  Net realized gains on sales of the
Company's investments totaled $3.3 in 2000.

Interest income, which is included in other income, totaled $2.4 in 2002,
$2.2 in 2001 and $4.1 in 2000.

The Company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the
impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional
currencies, thereby limiting risk to the Company that would otherwise result
from changes in exchange rates.  These nonfunctional currency exposures
relate principally to intercompany receivables and payables arising from
intercompany purchases of manufactured products.  The periods of the
forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed
transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and
recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies.  All
currency forward contracts and cross-currency swaps are marked-to-market each
period with resulting gains (losses) included in other expense (income) in the
Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

At December 31, 2002, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange
contracts to purchase $82.0 and sell $97.7 of various currencies (principally
United States dollars and euros) with maturities ranging principally from 30 to
180 days.  At December 31, 2001, the Company had outstanding forward
currency exchange contracts to purchase $97.4 and sell $72.1 of various
currencies (principally United States dollars and euros) with maturities ranging
principally from 30 to 180 days.  The estimated fair value of forward
currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at
month-end spot rates as adjusted for amortized forward points.

The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively
convert a portion of its variable-rate borrowings to a fixed-rate basis through
2003, thus reducing the impact of changes in interest rates on future interest
expense.  Approximately 51% of the Company's outstanding variable-rate
borrowings as of December 31, 2002 have been hedged through the designation of
interest rate swap agreements classified as cash flow hedges.  The Company
has fixed the base rate on a $250.0 notional amount of the $486.9 of
variable-rate borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2002 at an average rate of
5.58%.  The interest rate swaps mature over various terms ranging from
September 2003 through December 2003.  The fair value of the Company's
interest rate swap agreements represents the estimated receipts or payments that
would be made to terminate the agreements.

Upon adoption of FASB Statement No. 133, as amended, on January 1, 2001 the
Company recognized a gain from the cumulative effect of an accounting change of
$3.5 in accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) related to the interest rate
swap agreements.  A gain of $9.3 and a loss of $22.0 attributable to
changes in the fair value of interest rate swap agreements was recorded as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) in 2002 and 2001,
respectively.  If in the future the interest rate swap agreements were
determined to be ineffective or were terminated before the contractual
termination dates, or if it became probable that the hedged variable cash flows
associated with the variable-rate borrowings would stop, the Company would be
required to reclassify into earnings all or a portion of the unrealized losses
on cash flow hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive gain
(loss).  Interest rate differentials to be paid or received as a result of
interest rate swaps are recognized as an adjustment of interest expense related
to the designated borrowings.  Based on the maturities of the Company's
interest rate swap agreements, interest expense for the year ending December 31,
2003 is expected to be $9.2 higher than the interest cost on the variable-rate
borrowings through the recognition of amounts included as unrealized losses on
cash flow hedges at December 31, 2002.

The Company uses yen-denominated floating-rate borrowings to protect a
portion of the value of its investment in its subsidiary in Japan. 
Realized and unrealized gains and losses from this hedge are not included in the
Consolidated Statements of Earnings, but are recorded as foreign currency
translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) in
stockholders' equity.  Net gains (losses) of ($1.6), $5.8 and $7.7
attributable to the yen-denominated floating-rate borrowings hedge were recorded
as foreign currency translation adjustments in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively.

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by
counterparties on the above instruments but does not anticipate nonperformance
by any of the counterparties.

NOTE 3

INVENTORIES

Inventories are summarized as follows

:

NOTE 4

BUSINESS AND PRODUCT LINE ACQUISITIONS

In October 2002, the Company purchased the DEKOMPRESSOR product line from
Pain Concepts, Inc., at a total cost of $10.0 giving the Company access to
intellectual property and other commercial rights relating to the design and
manufacture of certain medical devices.  Intangible assets acquired are
being amortized over 17 years.  The Company is contingently liable for
potential future milestone payments of up to $42.5, primarily based on future
sales growth over the next five years.

On October 1, 2002, the Company entered into an agreement with Curis, Inc.,
which eliminated all royalties payable to Curis relating to future Stryker sales
of osteogenic protein-1 (OP-1).  Under terms of the agreement, the Company
made a one-time cash payment of $14.0 to Curis.  The payment was allocated
to existing patents and is being amortized over 15 years.

On July 1, 2002, the Company acquired the Surgical Dynamics Inc. spinal
implant business (SDI) from Tyco International Ltd. for $135.0 in cash. 
The acquisition expands the Company's spinal product line by adding interbody
spinal cages for the United States market as well as other thoracolumbar and
cervical spinal fixation devices.  The acquisition was funded using
existing credit facilities.

The acquisition of SDI was accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting.  The results of operations for the acquired business are
included in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements beginning July 1,
2002.  The acquisition of SDI added $25.3 to the Company's sales for the
second half of 2002.   SDI had sales of $55.6 for the year ended
December 31, 2001 and sales of $33.1 for the six months ended June 30,
2002.  The purchase price of $135.0 in cash and liabilities assumed has
been preliminarily allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition.  Based on
the preliminary purchase price allocation, $87.1 of the purchase price was
allocated to patent licensing agreements to be amortized over their remaining
life of 8 years, $12.4 to inventory, $38.0 to deferred tax assets related to
future tax deductions, $5.1 to other tangible assets, and $7.6 to liabilities
assumed.  Immediately after the acquisition was consummated, management of
the Company began to implement an integration plan to combine Stryker and
SDI.  In conjunction with the integration plan, the Company has recorded
additional purchase liabilities of $3.6, which were included in the preliminary
purchase price allocation.  The additional purchase liabilities include
$3.1 for severance and related costs and $0.5 for contractual obligations. 
The severance and related costs are provided for workforce reductions covering
37 SDI employees.  The workforce reductions were completed during the
fourth quarter of 2002 with severance payments to be made through the third
quarter of 2003.  Pro forma consolidated results of operations would not
differ significantly as a result of the SDI acquisition.

In November 2001, the Company acquired the business of an independent Italian
distributor of certain of the Company's products at a cost of approximately euro
28.2 ($25.3).  An initial cash payment of euro 7.3 ($6.5) was made in
November 2001, with the remaining purchase price to be paid ratably over a
five-year period.  The purchase consolidates the distribution of
substantially all of the Company's products in Italy.  The acquisition was
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.  Tangible assets
acquired included $5.1 of inventory and $0.8 of deferred charges. 
Intangible assets acquired principally included customer relationships and
noncompete agreements.  Approximately $10.2 of the purchase price was
allocated to customer relationships and is being amortized over 20 years. 
Approximately $9.2 of the purchase price was allocated to other intangibles,
principally noncompete agreements, and is being amortized over a weighted
average life of four years.

In August 2000, the Company completed the acquisition of Image Guided
Technologies, Inc. (IGT) by merger for 0.3 shares of Stryker common stock with a
value of $12.0.  IGT manufactured three-dimensional optical measurement
devices ("optical localizers") for anatomical image-display workstations used by
physicians to perform image-guided surgery.  The acquisition was accounted
for using the purchase method of accounting.  Intangible assets acquired,
principally patents, are being amortized over periods ranging from 10 to 15
years.

NOTE 5

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

As of January 1, 2002, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Statement
No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

, related to acquisitions
completed before July 1, 2001.  Statement No. 142 prohibits the
amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and
requires the Company to evaluate these intangibles for impairment on an annual
basis.  In accordance with the Statement's provisions, an assembled
workforce intangible asset with an unamortized balance of $5.5 as of January 1,
2002 was reclassified from other intangibles to goodwill.  In the first
quarter of 2002, the Company completed the required impairment test of goodwill
and, in the fourth quarter of 2002, completed the required annual impairment
test of goodwill as prescribed by Statement No. 142 and determined that recorded
goodwill was not impaired and that no goodwill write-down was necessary.

If the nonamortization provisions of Statement No. 142 had been applied in
2001 and 2000, amortization expense would have been reduced by $18.1 ($12.1 net
of income taxes) and $17.3 ($11.5 net of income taxes), respectively. 
Reconciliations of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings for 2001 and
2000 are presented to show what net earnings would have been had the
nonamortization provisions of Statement No. 142 been applied in those
years.  Those reconciliations, including related per share amounts, are as
follows:

The changes in the net carrying amount of goodwill by segment for the year
ended December 31, 2002 are as follows:

Other intangibles at December 31, 2002 consist of the following:

Amortization expense for other intangibles totaled $28.9 for the year ended
December 31, 2002.  The estimated amortization expense for each of the five
succeeding years is as follows:

NOTE 6

RESTRUCTURING AND ACQUISITION-RELATED LIABILITIES

The Company recorded restructuring and acquisition-related pretax charges
(credits) consisting of the following items:

The 2002 restructuring and acquisition-related items reflect a charge of
$17.2 ($11.5 net of income taxes) in the third quarter of 2002.  These
items include a charge of $21.0 ($14.1 net of income taxes) for
employment-related costs to close the Company's Rutherford, New Jersey
manufacturing facility, partially offset by a credit of $3.8 ($2.6 net of income
taxes) to reverse certain Howmedica restructuring and acquisition-related costs
to reflect actual final payments required.

The $21.0 restructuring charge relates to the shutdown agreement reached
between the Company and the employee bargaining unit to close the Howmedica
Osteonics implant manufacturing facility in Rutherford, New Jersey which was
ratified by the members of the I.U.E.- CWA Local 485 on August 23, 2002. 
Under the agreement, laid-off employees will receive significantly more benefits
than they would have under the Collective Bargaining Agreement that was set to
expire on August 31, 2002.  In addition, at least 80 qualified employees
from the Rutherford facility will be offered employment at the new Howmedica
Osteonics facility in Mahwah, New Jersey.  The charge covers
employment-related severance costs for approximately 400 employees.  The
Company expects the Rutherford facility to be closed over the next 12 months
with final severance payments to be made in 2004.  As Howmedica Osteonics
prepares to permanently cease manufacturing in Rutherford, it will transition
production to its facilities in Mahwah, New Jersey as well as Cork and Limerick,
Ireland.

The 2001 restructuring credits of $0.3 relate to various restructuring events
in the fourth quarter of 2001.  The $0.6 credit for severance and related
costs reflects charges of $0.8 offset by credits of $1.4.  The $0.8 charge
covers severance costs for 10 employees in Europe.  Planned workforce
reductions were completed in the first quarter of 2002.  The $1.4 credit
relates to a reduction in the expected cost to complete headcount reductions
associated with the 2000 and 1999 reorganizations of the Company's European and
Japanese distribution operations.  The $0.7 charge related to
reorganization of distribution channels reflects the cost to terminate a
distributor in Latin America.  The cost of the termination is based on
contractual terms.  The $0.4 credit related to discontinuance of product
line represents a reversal of remaining loss reserves established in Japan for
discontinued ophthalmology inventories sold on a contingent basis in 1999.

The 2001 acquisition-related charges include $0.9 for severance and related
costs associated with the reorganization of the Company's sales structure in
Italy to accommodate the integration of the business acquired in the fourth
quarter of 2001 from the Company's independent Italian distributor (see Note
4).  The reorganization established a direct sales force in Italy that will
distribute the Company's full product portfolio.  The $0.9 charge covers
severance costs for three employees in Italy and costs to cancel contracts with
discontinued agents.  The reorganization of the sales structure in Italy
was completed in the first quarter of 2002.

The 2000 restructuring charges of $0.2 relate to various restructuring events
in the fourth quarter of 2000.  Severance and related costs of $1.3 reflect
charges of $4.0 partially offset by a credit of $2.7.  The $4.0 charge
covers severance costs for 95 employees, primarily in Europe.  The planned
workforce reductions were completed in 2001, and the remaining amount of this
reserve was reversed in 2001.  The $2.7 credit relates to a reduction in
the expected cost to complete the headcount reductions associated with the 1999
reorganization of the Company's Japanese distribution operations.  The
credit of $2.1 related to reorganization of distribution channels reflects a
charge of $0.6 to terminate two small European distributors, offset by a credit
of $2.7 to reverse reserves for a distributor reorganization that was charged to
operations in 1996.  The delay in the use of the 1996 reserves occurred
because the distributor is located in a country where Howmedica had a direct
sales operation.  The purchase of the Howmedica assets in this country was
delayed because of the lengthy regulatory approval process there and was
completed in 2000.  After evaluating its business in this country, the
Company decided not to terminate the distributor and reversed the previously
recorded reserve. The $0.4 credit related to discontinuance of product line
represents a reversal of a portion of the loss reserves established in Japan for
discontinued ophthalmology inventories sold on a contingent basis in 1999. 
The other charges of $1.4 represent asset write-offs, primarily for goodwill and
inventory, and lease commitments associated with certain operations, principally
in Europe, that were closed in the fourth quarter of 2000.

The acquisition-related credit of $1.2 in 2000 reflected a reduction in the
expected cost to complete the conversion of the remaining Osteonics distributors
in the United States and certain distributors in Europe and the Pacific region
to direct sales in the form of branches or agents to accommodate the integration
of the Howmedica sales force.  These conversions provided the Company
greater control over the distribution channels and facilitated the integration
with the Howmedica organization. The cost of the conversions was based on
contractual terms.

The following table provides a rollforward of remaining liabilities
associated with business acquisition purchase liabilities and restructuring and
acquisition-related charges recorded by the Company in 2002, 2001 and prior
years:

NOTE 7

BORROWINGS AND OTHER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS

Long-term debt is as follows:

In December 2001, the Company established $1,000.0 in Unsecured Credit
Facilities.  These Facilities replaced the $1,650.0 Senior Secured Credit
Facilities that were established in 1998 in conjunction with the acquisition of
Howmedica.  A total of $730.5 was initially drawn under the new Credit
Facilities, of which $642.7 prepaid the debt outstanding under the 1998
Facilities and $87.8 was used to terminate the Company's synthetic lease and
purchase its Mahwah, New Jersey manufacturing and distribution facility.

The Unsecured Credit Facilities include a $250.0 364-day revolving credit
agreement and a $750.0 five-year, nonamortizing, revolving credit
agreement.  The $250.0 364-day revolving credit agreement bears interest at
a base rate, as defined, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.245% to
0.800%, depending on the Company's debt rating.  The $750.0 five-year,
nonamortizing, revolving credit agreement has a $250.0 multicurrency sublimit,
under which yen and euro can be borrowed.  The five-year facility also has
a $50.0 swing line sublimit and a $100.0 letter of credit sublimit.  The
five-year facility bears interest at a base rate, as defined, plus an applicable
margin ranging from 0.235% to 0.775%, depending on the Company's debt
rating.  The Unsecured Credit Facilities require a commitment fee ranging
from 0.055% to 0.225% on the aggregate commitment of the facilities, depending
on the Company's debt rating.  In addition, a utilization fee of 0.125% is
required when the sum of the outstanding amounts exceeds 50% of the aggregate
commitments.  During 2002, the weighted average interest rate for all
borrowings under the Unsecured Credit Facilities, after considering the effects
of the Company's interest rate swaps, was 5.33%.  The Facilities require
the Company to comply with certain financial and other covenants.

At December 31, 2002, the Company had borrowed yen 4,820.5 under the
multicurrency sublimit available under the five-year revolving credit
agreement.  The yen borrowing acts as a hedge of a portion of the Company's
net investment in Japan.  As a result, adjustments made to the loan balance
to reflect applicable currency exchange rates at December 31 are included within
accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) in stockholders' equity.

The $1,650.0 Senior Secured Credit Facilities that were prepaid in December
2001 consisted of $1,150.0 in term loans, a six-year $250.0 revolving credit
facility and a six-year $250.0 reducing multicurrency facility.  The Senior
Secured Credit Facilities had a weighted average interest rate for all
borrowings, after considering the effects of the Company's interest rate swaps,
of 7.05% during 2001.

The prepayment of the remaining amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities in December 2001 resulted in the write-off of related
unamortized deferred loan costs of $7.1, which was reflected as an extraordinary
loss of $4.8 (net of income taxes of $2.3; $.02 per basic and diluted share) in
the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

The Company has fixed the base rate on a $250.0 notional amount of the
variable-rate borrowings at an average rate of 5.58% using interest rate swaps
(see Note 2).

Maturities of debt for the four years succeeding 2003 are: 2004 - $0.2; 2005
- - $0.2; 2006 - $487.1; and 2007 - $0.2.

The carrying amounts of the Company's long-term debt approximate their fair
values, based on the quoted interest rates for similar types and amounts of
borrowing agreements.

Interest paid on debt was $37.1 in 2002, $66.9 in 2001 and $94.3 in 2000 and
approximates interest expense.

NOTE 8

CAPITAL STOCK

The Company has key employee and director stock option plans under which
options are granted at a price not less than fair market value at the date of
grant.  The options are granted for periods of up to 10 years and become
exercisable in varying installments.  A summary of stock option activity
follows:

Shares reserved for future grants were 9.5 and 11.2 at December 31, 2002 and
2001, respectively.

Exercise prices for options outstanding as of December 31, 2002 ranged from
$5.59 to $57.05.  A summary of shares exercisable follows:

On April 19, 2000, the Company's stockholders approved an amendment to the
Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation to increase its authorized shares
of common stock to 500.0 from 150.0.

On April 19, 2000, the Company's Board of Directors approved a two-for-one
stock split effective May 12, 2000 for stockholders of record on May 1,
2000.

All share and per share data have been adjusted to reflect the increase in
authorized shares and the stock split as though they had occurred at the
beginning of the periods presented.

The Company has 0.5 authorized shares of $1 par value preferred stock, none
of which are outstanding.

NOTE 9

EARNINGS PER SHARE

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings
per share:

NOTE 10

RETIREMENT PLANS

Certain of the Company's subsidiaries have defined benefit plans covering
some or all of their employees.  All of the defined benefit plans have
benefit obligations in excess of plan assets.  A summary of the information
related to all of the Company's defined benefit plans is as follows:

The components of the amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets
are as follows:

Pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets
had projected benefit obligations, accumulated benefit obligations and fair
value of plan assets of $63.6, $59.8 and $29.9, respectively, as of December 31,
2002.

The components of net periodic benefit cost are as follows:

A subsidiary of the Company terminated its defined benefit plan in 2001 and
transferred the plan assets and related benefit obligations to a defined
contribution retirement plan.  The loss on plan termination was $0.5.

Retirement plan expense under the Company's profit sharing and defined
contribution retirement plans totaled $45.2 in 2002, $36.5 in 2001 and $31.9 in
2000.  A portion of the Company's retirement plan expenses was funded with
Stryker common stock totaling $4.1 in 2002, $3.4 in 2001 and $3.1 in 2000. 
The use of Stryker common stock represents a noncash investing activity that is
not reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  The amount of
Stryker common stock held by the Company's defined contribution retirement plans
totaled $51.5 (0.8 shares) and $42.6 (0.7 shares) as of December 31, 2002 and
2001, respectively.  The value of Stryker common stock as a percentage of
total defined contribution retirement plan assets was 20.2% as of December 31,
2002 and 17.9% as of December 31, 2001.

NOTE 11

INCOME TAXES

Earnings before income taxes and extraordinary item consist of the
following:

In 2002, earnings from the Company's Puerto Rico-based manufacturing
operations are reported as foreign operations due to a change in legal
status.  Prior to 2002, these earnings were reported as United States
operations under an Internal Revenue Code Section 936 election.

The components of the provision for income taxes follow:

A reconciliation of the United States statutory income tax rate to the
Company's effective income tax rate follows:

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.  The tax effect of
significant temporary differences, which comprise the Company's deferred tax
assets and liabilities, is as follows:

Net operating loss carryforwards totaling approximately $64.9 at December 31,
2002 are available to reduce future taxable earnings of certain foreign
subsidiaries.  A significant portion of these carryforwards may be carried
forward indefinitely.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are included in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets as follows

:

No provision has been made for United States federal and state income taxes
or foreign taxes that may result from future remittances of the undistributed
earnings ($660.7 at December 31, 2002) of foreign subsidiaries because it is
expected that such earnings will be reinvested overseas indefinitely. 
Determination of the amount of any unrecognized deferred income tax liability on
these unremitted earnings is not practicable.

Total income taxes paid, net of refunds received, were $112.1 in 2002, $63.0
in 2001 and $75.3 in 2000.

NOTE 12

SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

The Company segregates its operations into two reportable business segments:
Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The Orthopaedic Implants segment
sells orthopaedic reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma and spinal
implants, bone cement and OP-1. The MedSurg Equipment segment sells powered
surgical instruments, endoscopic systems, medical video imaging equipment,
hospital beds and stretchers, craniomaxillofacial implants and image-guided
surgical systems.  Other includes Physical Therapy Services and corporate
administration, interest expense and interest income.

The Company's reportable segments are business units that offer different
products and services and are managed separately because each business requires
different manufacturing, technology and marketing strategies.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in
the summary of significant accounting policies. The Company evaluates
performance based on net earnings of each segment. Identifiable assets are those
assets used exclusively in the operations of each business segment or are
allocated when used jointly. Corporate assets are principally cash and cash
equivalents, investments and property, plant and equipment.

Sales and other financial information by business segment follows:

The Company's principal areas of operation outside of the United States are
Europe and Japan.  The Company also has operations in the Pacific, Canada,
Latin America and the Middle East.  Geographic information follows:

NOTE 13

LEASES

The Company leases various manufacturing and office facilities and equipment
under operating leases.  Future minimum lease commitments under these
leases are as follows:

Rent expense totaled $61.3 in 2002, $51.6 in 2001 and $42.2 in 2000.

NOTE 14

CONTINGENCIES

The Company is involved in various proceedings, legal actions and claims
arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to
product, labor and other matters.  Such matters are subject to many
uncertainties, and outcomes are not predictable with assurance.  The
Company records amounts for losses that are deemed to be probable and subject to
reasonable estimate.  However, the Company does not anticipate material
losses as a result of these proceedings beyond amounts already provided in the
accompanying financial statements.

Pursuant to certain of the Company's credit and lease agreements, the Company
has provided financial guarantees to third parties in the form of
indemnification provisions.  These provisions indemnify the third parties
for costs, including but not limited to adverse judgments in lawsuits and the
imposition of additional taxes due to either a change in the tax law or an
adverse interpretation of the tax law.  The term of the guarantee is equal
to the term of the related credit or lease agreement.  The Company is not
able to calculate the maximum potential amount of future payments it could be
required to make under these guarantees, as the potential payment is dependent
on the occurrence of future unknown events (e.g., changes in United States or
foreign tax laws).

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders of Stryker
Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Stryker
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002.  These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States.  Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Stryker
Corporation and subsidiaries at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the consolidated
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States.

As discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements, in 2002 the Company
changed its method of accounting for goodwill and, as discussed in Note 1, in
2001 the Company changed its method of accounting for derivative financial
instruments.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Within the 90-day period preceding the date of this report, an
evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's
disclosure controls and procedures was carried out under the supervision and
with the participation of the Company's management, including the Chairman of
the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President and the Vice President, Chief
Financial Officer and Secretary ("the Certifying Officers").  Based on that
evaluation, the Certifying Officers concluded that the Company's disclosure
controls and procedures are effective to bring to the attention of the Company's
management the relevant information necessary to permit an assessment of the
need to disclose material developments and risks pertaining to the Company's
business in its periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.  There have been no significant changes to the Company's
internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these
controls subsequent to the date of the evaluation.
