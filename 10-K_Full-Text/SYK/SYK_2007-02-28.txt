BUSINESS

GENERAL

Stryker
Corporation (the Company or Stryker) is one of the world's leading medical
technology companies with the most broadly based range of products in
orthopaedics and a significant presence in other medical specialties.  Stryker
works with respected medical professionals to help people lead more active and
more satisfying lives.  The Company's products include implants used in joint
replacement, trauma, craniomaxillofacial and spinal surgeries; biologics;
surgical, neurologic, ear, nose & throat (ENT) and interventional pain
equipment; endoscopic, surgical navigation, communications and digital imaging
systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment.  Stryker
also provides outpatient physical therapy services in the United States.  Stryker was incorporated in Michigan in 1946 as the successor company to
a business founded in 1941 by Dr. Homer H. Stryker, a leading orthopaedic
surgeon and the inventor of several orthopaedic products.

Stryker's
filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, including
its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current
reports on Form 8-K, are accessible free of charge at www.stryker.com within
the "For Investors" link.

In
the first quarter of 2006, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of
Sightline Technologies Ltd. (Sightline), a private, development-stage company. 
The acquisition of Sightline, a developer of flexible endoscopes, is expected
to enhance the Company's presence in the gastrointestinal and other markets
within its MedSurg Equipment segment.

In
the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company completed the repatriation of $722
million of foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation
Act (the Act).  The Act provided a temporary incentive for United States companies to repatriate accumulated income earned in foreign jurisdictions at a
reduced income tax cost.  The repatriated funds were invested pursuant to
an approved Domestic Reinvestment Plan that conformed to the Act.

In
the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company acquired, by merger, all of the
outstanding stock of PlasmaSol Corp. (PlasmaSol).  PlasmaSol has developed a
technology that should allow Stryker to provide sterilization equipment for use
with certain of its MedSurg Equipment products.

In
the first quarter of 2005, the Company acquired eTrauma.com Corp. (eTrauma). 
The acquisition expanded the Company's endoscopic and digital imaging equipment
product offerings within its MedSurg Equipment segment by adding eTrauma's
proprietary Picture Archive and Communications Systems (PACS) image management
and viewing software.

In
the third quarter of 2004, the Company completed its acquisition, by merger, of
SpineCore, Inc. (SpineCore), a developer of artificial lumbar and cervical
discs.  This acquisition is expected to enhance the Company's presence in the
spinal implant market, an important growth area within its Orthopaedic Implants
segment.

PRODUCT
SALES

The
Company segregates its operations into two reportable business segments:
Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  The Orthopaedic Implants segment
sells orthopaedic reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma, spinal and
craniomaxillofacial implant systems; bone cement; and the bone growth factor

OP-1.  The MedSurg Equipment segment sells surgical equipment; surgical
navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as
well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment.  The Other category
includes Physical Therapy Services and corporate administration, interest
expense and interest and

- - 5 -

marketable securities income.  The following amounts
(in millions) and percentages represent business segment and
domestic/international net sales during each of the three years ended
December 31:

Additional
financial information regarding the Company's operating segments and geographic
areas can be found under the captions "

Results
of Operations

" on pages 28 through 35 and "

Note
11 - Segment and Geographic Data

" on pages 62 through 64 of this
report.

Approximately
75% of the Company's sales in 2006, 76% in 2005 and 78% in 2004 consisted of
products with short lives, such as reconstructive, trauma, spinal and
craniomaxillofacial implant systems (while implants have a long useful life to
the patient, they have a one-time use to the hospital); disposables and
expendable tools; parts and service revenues, including service and repair
charges; and physical therapy revenues.  The balance of sales in each of the
years came from products that could be considered capital equipment, having
useful lives in excess of one year.

The
Company's backlog of firm orders is not considered material to an understanding
of its business.

Orthopaedic Implants

Orthopaedic
Implants are designed and manufactured by Stryker Orthopaedics, Stryker Osteosynthesis,
Stryker Spine and Stryker Biotech and consist of such products as implants used
in joint replacement, trauma, craniomaxillofacial and spinal surgeries; bone
cement; and the bone growth factor OP-1.  Artificial joints are made of cobalt
chromium, titanium alloys, ceramics or ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene
and are implanted in patients whose natural joints have been damaged by
arthritis, osteoporosis, other diseases or injury.  The Company's OP-1 bone
growth factor, which induces the formation of new bone when implanted into
bone, is composed of recombinant human OP-1 and a bioresorbable collagen
matrix.

Minimally Invasive Surgery

Many
of Stryker's technologically advanced reconstructive implants are suited to
minimally invasive surgery (MIS) procedures that are intended to reduce
soft-tissue damage and pain while hastening return to function.  The Company
supports surgeons with technology, procedural development and specialized
instrumentation as they develop new MIS techniques.

In
2006, the Company began the initial launch of a hip resurfacing product in
certain international markets.  This product represents a less invasive option
for younger patients with the potential for enhanced stability and range of
motion.  In hip resurfacing procedures, very little bone is removed from the
femoral head, the femoral neck is preserved and the femoral canal is spared.

In
order to facilitate emerging procedural approaches, the Company has also
developed instrumentation for MIS total hip arthroplasty.  The Company's
surgical navigation systems are frequently used in MIS procedures to improve
the accuracy of measurements and to position the implant.

- - 6 -

Stryker
Osteosynthesis has a market leadership position in the Intramedullary (IM) Hip
Screw market due to the minimally invasive nature of the Gamma Nail. In 2004, Stryker
launched a new version of the Gamma Nail that can be implanted through an even
smaller incision. In addition, surgeons are testing the use of the Company's
surgical navigation systems for this procedure as well as in surgery for pelvic
fractures.

The
Company's Scorpio Total Knee Minimally Invasive Instrumentation is designed to
complement the unique, minimally invasive total knee procedure pioneered by a
leading orthopaedic surgeon.  This technique can reduce the length of the
incision by approximately 70%.  Because of the Company's commitment to
responsible science, a multicenter study was conducted to validate the technique's
reproducibility and potential benefits, such as reduced pain and earlier return
to function.

The
EIUS Unicondylar Knee and the Avon Patellofemoral Joint are resurfacing,
bone-conserving designs that are used to treat disease isolated to one
compartment of the knee.  These pre-total knee treatment options can also
be implanted using minimally invasive techniques.

Orthobiologics

Stryker strives to be an innovator and leader in the
fast-growing field of orthobiologics with products that combine both natural
and synthetic technologies.  The Company's innovative product portfolio
includes such products as OP-1, a proprietary, recombinant version of a
signaling protein with multiple tissue regeneration properties; TissueMend, a
single-layer acellular collagen matrix that is easy to handle and delivers both
unrivaled strength and documented remodeling capability; Hydroset, the next
generation in bone substitute technology which is injectible, sculptable and
fast setting; BoneSource BVF, an effective osteoconductive bone substitute with
excellent biocompatibility and mechanical stability; and BoneSave, a
granules-based alternative to conventional bone grafting.

Hip Implant Systems

Through
Stryker Orthopaedics, the Company offers a variety of hip implant systems for
the global reconstructive market.  The ABG Hip System, Partnership Hip System,
Secur-Fit Hip System, Omnifit Hip System, Accolade Hip System and Restoration
Hip System are all comprehensive systems of hip implants and associated
instrumentation designed to provide physicians and patients with reliable
results and to reduce operating time for primary and revision procedures.  The
Exeter Total Hip System is based on a collarless, highly polished,
double-tapered femoral design that reduces shear stresses and increases
compression at the cement/bone interface.  During 2004, the Company began
transitioning to its new Restoration Modular Revision Hip System in the United States, Europe, Australia and Canada.  This system offers surgeons performing revision
surgeries flexibility in treating complex hip stem revisions and restoring
patient biomechanics.  The Restoration Modular Revision Hip System also takes
advantage of Stryker's long clinical history with hydroxylapatite (HA), a
naturally occurring calcium phosphate material that demonstrates a high level
of biocompatibility due to its resemblance to bone, by incorporating PureFix HA
coating on many components.  The Restoration Modular Revision Hip System
complements the Company's existing Restoration HA and Restoration plasma spray
(PS) monolithic revision systems.

In 2006,
the Company announced that it received clearance from the FDA for
its advanced bearing system, LFIT Anatomic Femoral Heads with X3 polyethylene
liners.  This represents a significant advancement in hip bearing technology
with the combination of Stryker's Low Friction Ion Treatment (LFIT) technology
and X3 advanced bearing technology.  The femoral heads are anatomically sized
for more natural hip performance.

Following
the clinical success of its Crossfire technology, a highly crosslinked
polyethylene designed to reduce wear, Stryker launched X3 polyethylene in
2005.  X3 polyethylene is the Company's next-generation highly crosslinked
polyethylene and features a higher level of strength and wear reduction in both
hip and knee replacements.

Stryker
was the first company to receive clearance from the FDA to commercially release
for sale in the United States a hip implant with HA surface treatment.  The
Company's global clinical experience with HA-

- - 7 -

coated hip stems now extends over 20
years and reported clinical performance continues to equal or exceed that of
comparable hip stems reported in the scientific literature.

The
Company began a limited launch of its CentPillar Hip System in the Japanese
market in 2003, with a full rollout in 2004.  The Taro Hip System and
CentPillar Hip System provide lines of products that offer an increased range
of motion and a minimally invasive technique preferred by Japanese surgeons for
their patients.

The
Company received premarket approval (PMA) from the FDA in 2003 for its
ceramic-on-ceramic hip replacement system, the Trident Ceramic Acetabular
Insert, for patients in the United States.  Stryker Orthopaedics has successfully
launched the Trident ceramic insert in the United States, Europe, Australia and Canada.  The Trident insert is wear resistant, and it is protected and strengthened by
a patented titanium sleeve.  In 2006, the Company launched the Trident
Tritanium Acetabular Shell which contains a highly porous surface that closely
resembles the structure of trabecular bone.  This shell is designed for
revision surgery and contains multiple screw holes to achieve bone fixation and
initial stability.  Other technologies used for total hip replacement include
metal-on-conventional polyethylene and metal-on-highly crosslinked polyethylene
articulations.

The
Company entered 2007 with more than 30 years of clinical history with the
Exeter Hip System, more than 20 years of clinical history with the Omnifit
cemented stem and more than 20 years of clinical history with the Omnifit HA
stem.  Long-term clinical results are an important factor in the Company's
ability to market hip implants.

Knee Implant Systems

The
Company offers five major knee implant systems under the Stryker brand name: 
the Duracon, EIUS, Global Modular Replacement System (GMRS), Scorpio and
Triathlon systems.  Utilized in more than 500,000 procedures worldwide, the
Duracon System combines high levels of joint conformity throughout the range of
motion and consistent anatomic tracking.  The DuraconTS and ScorpioTS Revision
systems and Modular Rotating Hinge completed the product line offerings with
implants for complex revision procedures.

Launched
on a limited basis in the United States and Europe in 2004, the Triathlon Knee
System represents the Company's evolutionary design that has been developed to
more closely reproduce natural knee motion and is designed to provide mobility
with stability through more than 150 degrees of flexion.  In 2006, Stryker
introduced anterior referencing instruments for use with this knee system.  In
2005, the Company launched a posteriorly-stabilized (PS) version of the
Triathlon knee following the launch of the cruciate-retaining (CR) version in
2004.  During 2005, the Company continued its launch of the Triathlon Knee
System on a worldwide basis throughout the United States and Europe and into Canada and the Pacific region.  The state-of-the-art Triathlon Knee instrumentation is designed
to improve operating room efficiency through a streamlined, integrated system
providing options and flexibility to meet surgeons' varying preferences and
multiple surgical techniques.

The
GMRS is a global product that offers a comprehensive solution for severe bone
loss in oncology, trauma and revision surgery patients.  GMRS has tibial and
femoral components, including a total femur, and a modular rotating hinge
knee.  The system employs both titanium and cobalt chrome alloys for strength
and lightness of weight, together with the superior flexibility of the hinge. 
The MRS, the predecessor to the GMRS, was the first modular segmental
replacement system when it was introduced in 1988.  These systems' components
have maintained a leadership position in this market segment since their
introduction.

The
Scorpio knee implant design is based on the epicondylar axis of the knee.  This
patented approach addresses significant clinical issues, such as improved
patient rehabilitation and midflexion stability, through an increase in the
patella-femoral moment arm and a single anterior-posterior radius.  In 2006,
the Scorpio HA CR and Scorpio HA PS versions were launched.  The Scorpio HA CR
product is designed to minimize polyethylene wear and the Scorpio HA PS product
features a minimally invasive open box design and maximized stability.  The
Scorpio Plus Mobile Bearing tibial component was launched in markets outside
the United States in 2001, and a clinical trial is in progress in the United
States.  This addition to the Scorpio line provides a competitive

- - 8 -

entry into
the growing, mobile-bearing market segment.  The Scorpio NRG, originally
launched in Japan, was introduced in Europe and the Pacific region in 2005 and
in the United States in 2006.  Scorpio NRG provides additional kinematic
benefits over ScorpioFlex, including increased rotational allowance, an
articulating design for deeper flexion and greater extension allowance without
impingement.  The ScorpioFlex, which is available for both posterior
cruciate-retaining and cruciate-substituting indications, is specifically
designed for patients who have the ability and motivation to return to
high-flexion activities such as gardening and golfing.  ScorpioFlex has also
enjoyed success in Japan, where it is sold under the trade name Scorpio
SuperFlex.  The Scorpio System is supported by the Passport instrumentation
system, which was designed to provide intraoperative flexibility and precision
as well as a simple, cost-effective approach to total knee replacement
surgery.

The
EIUS Unicondylar Knee replacement system is designed for the minimally invasive
knee surgery market segment.  This system marries bone-sparing femoral and
tibial implants with sophisticated instrumentation and a surgical technique
aimed at reducing rehabilitation time for patients.

Other Joint Replacement
Products

The Company markets other joint
replacement products, principally shoulder and elbow implants and related
instruments, under the Stryker brand name.  The Solar Total Shoulder System
provides a unique design for the humeral head that allows surgeons to adjust
tension of the supporting tissues while maximizing range of motion.  The
shoulder instruments offer surgeons increased visibility and access to this
tightly confined joint space.  The Solar BiPolar Shoulder provides surgeons
with additional options for addressing rotator cuff arthropathy arthritis of
the shoulder and incorporates the patented bipolar locking mechanism that is
also used in the Company's hip implants.  The Solar Shoulder product line gives
surgeons increased intraoperative flexibility to restore the patient's
shoulder kinematics.  The Solar Total Elbow complements products offered for
upper extremity procedures.  The semiconstrained design and modular components
address varying types of patient anatomy.

Bone
Cement

Simplex bone cement, a material used to secure
cemented implants to bone, was first approved for orthopaedic use in the United States in 1971 and is the most widely used bone cement in the world.  The Company
manufactures and provides several variations of Simplex bone cement to meet
specific patient needs.  Simplex has more than 45 years of clinical history,
the longest of any bone cement, with more than 400 published clinical papers.

Trauma Implant Systems

Through Stryker Osteosynthesis, the Company
develops, manufactures and markets its trauma extremities and deformities
systems.  These systems, including nailing, plating, hip fracture, external
fixation systems and bone substitutes are used primarily in deformity
corrections and in the fixation of fractures resulting from sudden injury.
These products consist of internal fixation devices marketed under such names
as Gamma, Grosse & Kempf, Omega, Dall-Miles, Asnis, AxSOS, Hydroset, T2 and
S2, along with external fixation devices marketed under the Apex, Hoffmann II
and Monotube Triax names.

The Company's internal fixation product
portfolio includes a full array of IM nails, hip fracture devices and
plates and screws in both titanium and stainless steel.  These products
complement the total hip and knee replacement offerings mentioned above by
offering a restorative option in addition to total replacement.

To address the hip trauma and fracture
segment, the Company markets several products, including the IM nail portfolio,
led by the T2 Nailing System; the Gamma Nail, a unique IM nail for trochanteric
fractures; the Omega hip screw system; the Asnis Cannulated Screw System; and
the Hansson pin system, providing a complete offering of surgical solutions for
the hip trauma patient.  These hip fracture systems offer orthopaedic surgeons
multiple options depending on their preferences and patient needs.

The T2 Nailing System includes femoral,
tibial and humeral components with a common instrument platform for accuracy
and ease of use.  The Company has also recently introduced the T2 Ankle
Arthrodesis Nail to provide the option for tibiotalocalcaneal fusion with a
retrograde IM nail that provides for limited soft tissue

- - 9 -

damage in the ankle
area, early weight bearing and compression of the subtalar and tibiotalar
joints.  Building on the success of this titanium nail, the Company introduced
the stainless steel S2 tibial and femoral nails.  The S2 nails are designed to
meet the needs of Level 1 trauma centers in the United States and to broaden
the Stryker product line in the rest of the world.  Following an initial
release in selected markets during 2003, the Gamma3 IM hip fracture nail was
fully launched during 2004 in the United States, Japan and Europe.  The Gamma3
is based on more than 15 years of Gamma Nail experience and is the third
generation of IM short and long Gamma fixation nails.  The Gamma3 System is
designed to facilitate minimally invasive surgery and reduce surgery time
through the use of newly designed implants and instrumentation.  The Asnis
Cannulated Screw System can help simplify the operative procedure through
features that allow surgeons to place, insert and remove locking screws
easily.

To
address the knee trauma segment, Stryker offers the Hoffman II Modular Fixation System, the T2 SCN
Nailing System and the SPS and AxSOS plating solutions.  The Hoffman II knee-bridging
frame is used to stabilize injuries to the knee until definitive treatment with
a plate or nail, or reconstruction takes place.  In addition, Stryker offers
the T2 SCN Nail, which can be used for definitive treatment of supracondylar
femur fractures just above the knee joint. This nail can also be used for
periprosthetic fracture fixation for traumatic fractures in patients who have
already had a joint replacement.

Stryker
has several product lines for upper extremity trauma. The Numelock II Polyaxial
Locked Plating System is the only comprehensive, upper extremity, polyaxial
periarticular fracture fixation system on the market. The T2 Proximal Humeral
Nail has been very well received and offers a minimally invasive option for
fractures of the humerus. The Universal Distal Radius System complements the
stainless steel Numelock II with a titanium option in distal radius plates and
screws. The Universal Distal Radius System offers a wide array of precontoured,
variable-sized plates for volar, distal and column approaches and both open
reduction and internal fixation techniques.  In 2006, the Company launched, on
a limited basis, the second generation VariAx Universal Distal Radius System that
is thinner than the original and features polyaxial locking.  The AxSOS Locking
Plate System, also introduced in 2006, is designed to treat metaphyseal and diaphyseal
fractures with low profile anatomically contoured plates, a unique screw design
and a simple instrument platform.

The Company's external fixation products
also include the Hoffmann II Compact and MicroFix, the Monotube Triax
monolateral system, the TenXor circular fixation system for complex fractures
and a complete range of pins and wires for attaching the devices to fractured
bones. The Hoffmann II Compact for upper extremity fractures includes a
patented snap-fit mechanism that makes it easy for surgeons to construct the
fixation device to fit the patient and align the fractured bones.  It also has a
full selection of lightweight radiolucent connection bars that allow for quick intraoperative fracture repair. The Monotube Triax
System is available in three
sizes and includes an adjustable feature that enables surgeons not only to stabilize
fractures but also to lengthen the bone in cases where bone has been removed
due to damage.  The TenXor hybrid frame enables surgeons to treat complex fractures
around the joints with both pins and long transfixing wires.  This attribute is
especially useful for patients with multipart fractures near the ankle and
knee.  The system features advanced composite materials and is compatible with
the Hoffman II snap-fit connection devices.

Craniomaxillofacial
Implant Systems

Through
Stryker Osteosynthesis, the Company develops, manufactures and markets plating
systems and related implants and products for craniomaxillofacial surgery.  In
2006, Stryker introduced HydroSet, a self-setting calcium phosphate bone
substitute that is indicated to fill certain bone voids or gaps of the skeletal
system.  Also in 2006, the Company launched DuraMatrix, a second generation
dura substitute technology, which is a conformable and resorbable membrane
matrix engineered from highly purified type I collagen.  In 2005, the Company
extended its Universal Fixation System for craniomaxillofacial surgery with the
addition of a facial trauma module.

Spinal Implant Systems

Through
Stryker Spine, the Company develops, manufactures and markets spinal implant
products including cervical, thoracolumbar and interbody systems used in spine
injury, deformity and degenerative

- - 10 -

therapies.  Spinal implant products include
plates, rods, screws, connectors, spacers and cages, along with proprietary
implant instrumentation.  In 2006, the Company introduced the VLIFT vertebral
body replacement system consisting of a preassembled, cylindrically shaped
titanium cage with a distractible or retractable center.  The hollow core of
the cage allows for packing bone graft.  Also in 2006, Stryker launched the AVS
AS and AL Spacers which are used as vertebral body support devices in anterior
procedures.

In
2004, Stryker introduced the OASYS fixation system developed to serve posterior
cervical fusion, which is an emerging area of spinal surgery. The product was
introduced in the United States following a successful launch in the European
market during 2003.  Also in 2004, Stryker introduced the Reflex Hybrid
anterior cervical plate and the AVS PL vertebral spacer system.  The Reflex
Hybrid features the ability to utilize both fixed and variable angle screws. 
The AVS PL spacer system represents Stryker's initial product offering in the
vertebral spacer category.

OP-1 Implant/BMP-7

More than two
decades ago, Stryker saw the potential that orthobiologic products held for
orthopaedics in an aging world and began a long-term investment in OP-1, initially
focused on the bone growth properties of
OP-1.  OP-1 was originally discovered by Creative BioMolecules, Inc. (a company
that subsequently merged into Curis, Inc.) with which Stryker funded a
long-term development collaboration with a vision to develop the first
molecules to stimulate tissue regeneration. Stryker's first therapeutic
product, OP-1 Implant, is composed of recombinant human OP-1 and a
bioresorbable collagen matrix.  OP-1 is a natural protein that the human body
makes to induce bone formation. In preclinical studies, OP-1 induced the
formation of new bone when implanted into bony defect sites. Stryker was the
first company to enter clinical studies with a bone morphogenic protein, BMP-7
(or OP-1). Studies have been performed in two challenging clinical indications:
first, in nonunion fractures of long bones, and second, in posterolateral spine
fusions.

Stryker
has received approval for a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) from the FDA. 
This approval in the United States is for the use of OP-1 Implant as an
alternative to autograft in recalcitrant long-bone nonunions where use of
autograft is not feasible and alternative treatments have failed.  An HDE, as
defined by the FDA, is for a product intended to benefit patients by treating
or diagnosing a disease or condition that affects fewer than 4,000 individuals
per year in the United States.  As of December 31, 2006, Stryker had more than 800
hospital Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals for OP-1 Implant in
patients in the United States under this HDE.

The
Company has received market approvals from regulators in Europe, Australia and
Canada for the indication of nonunion fractures of the tibia that failed prior
autograft treatment or when autograft treatment is not feasible; for the
treatment of long-bone nonunions secondary to trauma for the purpose of
initiating new bone formation; or for the clinical indication of long-bone nonunions. 
The
Company filed a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) with the European
Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA) for certain OP-1 uses, and the MAA was accepted for filing in July 1999.  On December 14, 2000, the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP) in Europe voted unanimously to recommend market
authorization for OP-1 Implant (marketed in Europe under the name Osigraft) for
the indication of nonunions of the tibia that failed prior autograft treatment
or when autograft is not feasible.  Final European approval was obtained for
this indication in May 2001.  A New Drug Application with the Therapeutic Goods
Administration (TGA) in Australia was filed in December 1999, and in February
2001 the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) recommended the granting
of marketing authorization for OP-1 Implant for treatment of long-bone nonunions
secondary to trauma for the purpose of initiating new bone formation.  Approval
from the TGA was received in April 2001.  In February 2002, the Company
received approval to market OP-1 Implant in Canada for the clinical indication
of long-bone nonunions.

In the
United States, Stryker received a further HDE in May 2004 for revision
posterolateral spine fusion following the completion of a pilot clinical study
that indicated possible benefit of a new formulation of OP-1, known as OP-1
Putty, for this application.  As of December 31, 2006, Stryker had more than 600
hospital IRB approvals for OP-1 Putty in the United States under this HDE.

Demand
for OP-1 Implant and OP-1 Putty continued to increase during each quarter of
2006.  Stryker is committed to the further development of OP-1 as an
alternative to iliac crest bone graft for patients requiring spinal fusion
using a variety of surgical techniques.  Spinal fusion is used to stabilize the
spine and improve patient outcomes postoperatively.  The Company conducted a
multicenter pivotal trial in the United States and Canada using OP-1 Putty in posterolateral
lumbar spine fusion in the setting of degenerative spondylolisthesis.  In 2003,
the Company completed enrollment in this trial and the final 2-year follow-up evaluation
of the 297 enrolled patients was completed at the end of 2005.  The results
were analyzed and submitted to the FDA in June 2006 as part of a PMA
application for the use of OP-1 Putty in posterolateral lumbar spine fusion
surgeries.  The PMA is currently under review by the FDA.  Stryker has
scheduled a meeting with the FDA for the first quarter of 2007 to optimize the
clinical data package of the posterolateral lumbar spine fusion PMA
submission.  The Company continues to believe in the eventual approval of OP-1 for spinal
fusion in the United States, though nearer term timing cannot be predicted.  In December 2006, Stryker filed a MAA
with the EMEA for a posterolateral lumbar spine fusion indication.

During
2006, Stryker filed an investigational device exemption (IDE) application with
the FDA to
start a clinical study in transforaminal lumbar interbody fusions using OP-1
Putty.  The IDE was approved and patient recruitment will begin in 2007.

Stryker
is also interested in exploiting the cartilage regeneration properties of OP-1
and has successfully completed preclinical studies showing that OP-1 can
stimulate new cartilage formation and increase disc height in animal models of
degenerative disc disease.  In 2005, Stryker filed its first Investigational
New Drug (IND) application with the FDA to treat degenerative disc disease with
a new injectable form of OP-1 in a dose-ranging study in humans.  During 2006,
Stryker initiated the dose-ranging clinical study for the first time use of
BMP-7 to regenerate cartilage tissue and patient enrollment has commenced.  In
December 2006, Stryker filed an IND application with the FDA to treat
osteoarthritis in the knee with the injectable form of OP-1 and received FDA
concurrence, in January 2007, to proceed with a clinical study.

Surgical Equipment

Through
Stryker Instruments, the Company offers a broad line of surgical, neurologic,
ENT and interventional pain equipment that is used in surgical specialties for
drilling, burring, rasping or cutting bone in small-bone orthopaedics, neurologic,
spine and ENT procedures; wiring or pinning bone fractures; and preparing hip or
knee surfaces for the placement of artificial implants.  Stryker
Instruments also manufactures an array of different attachments and cutting
accessories for use by orthopaedic, neurologic and small-bone specialists.

In
2006, the Company introduced the Stryker Precision Oscillating Tip Saw.  In
contrast to standard surgical saws with oscillating blades, this innovative saw
has a stationary blade shaft with an oscillating tip.  This feature gives surgeons the opportunity for greater accuracy while simplifying cuts and
reducing the potential for

- - 12 -

soft tissue damage.  This saw represents an advance
in procedural simplification, offering customers the potential for time and
cost savings by reducing the number of steps in the surgical process.

In
2006, the System 6 heavy duty power system was released.  This next-generation
system includes several new attachments, is more powerful and has a longer
battery life.  The System 6 Rotary Handpieces provide more options to surgeons
by allowing both high-speed drilling and high-torque reaming in one handpiece. 
System 6 Heavy Duty Saws provide increased torque for a faster and more
efficient cut.

In
2006, the Company launched the Silverglide Non-Stick bipolar forceps.  These
forceps rapidly diffuse heat, eliminating localized sticking of tissue to the
instrument, thus reducing bleeding in neurosurgery procedures.

The
introduction of the Maestro drill in 2005 expanded Stryker's line of micro
powered instruments for spine, neurology and ENT applications.  Employing the
pneumatic technology that is the preference of many surgeons in these
specialties, the Maestro drill leverages the Company's TPS and Consolidated
Operating Room Equipment (CORE) platforms by using the same cutting
attachments.

In
2004, Stryker launched the CORE electric console for use with its line of CORE powered instruments.  The CORE platform console is a technological advancement on the
precision and versatility offered by the TPS console platform and offers
integrated irrigation, multi-handpiece functionality and a standardized user
interface.

Stryker
Instruments also produces products that are utilized in conjunction with joint
replacement surgery.  In 2004, Stryker introduced the Revolution Cement Mixing
System, representing an improved design over its existing Advanced Cement
Mixing System.  The Revolution System is designed to provide one solution for
mixing all surgical cements, in addition to offering mixing efficacy, safety
and ease of use.  Interpulse is a disposable, self-contained pulsed lavage
system that is used by physicians to cleanse the surgical site during total
joint arthroplasty.  The ConstaVac CBC II Blood Conservation System is a
postoperative wound drainage and blood reinfusion device that enables joint
replacement patients to receive their own blood rather than donor blood.

In
2005, the Company advanced its postsurgical technology with the introduction of
the Block Aid PainPump System.  This device enables one product to meet the
needs of both site-specific pain management and a reprogrammable pump that is
ideal for continuous nerve blocks.  The Company also markets the PainPump2, a
disposable system that offers electronically controlled flow rates of pain
medication directly to the surgical site to help manage a patient's
postoperative discomfort. This innovative design allows the physician to
program the pump and provides a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) option,
previously unavailable to the market in a disposable pump.

To
promote safety for patients and medical staff, Stryker works closely with
hospitals and other health-care organizations to develop a broad product
portfolio.  In 2005, Stryker introduced its next-generation Sterishield T5
Personal Protection System, which advances its market-leading helmet, hood and
gown to help provide protection for operating room personnel from infection,
cross-contamination and harmful microorganisms.  This system employs advanced
user-cooling features and provides the option for integrated communication and
lighting systems.  The Neptune Waste Management System represents Stryker's
leading product for waste management in the operating room.  The self-contained
device, first introduced in 2000 and consistently improved, collects and disposes
of fluid and smoke waste from surgical procedures, minimizing the need for
operator intervention and, therefore, the risk of exposure to these waste
products.  In 2004, the Company introduced the Neptune Bronze platform, which
provides a low-cost alternative to its operating room waste management
solution.

Through
Stryker Instruments, the Company offers SpinePlex, a variation of its surgical Simplex
bone cement for applications in the treatment of vertebral compression
fractures.  In 2006, the Company introduced the Discmonitor Discography System,
a disposable device used to inject fluid into the intervertebral disc nucleus
during discography procedures.  This system features a digital display and
allows physicians to save key data points for each disc.  Stryker's
radiofrequency generator system for chronic pain management, originally
introduced in 2004, was enhanced in 2006 with improved user interfaces,a
simplified operating system and the expansion of the cannula and electrode
offerings including the industry's first monopolar nitinol electrode.

- - 13 -

Stryker
also offers the Dekompressor, a
single-use disposable device indicated for the percutaneous removal of disc
nucleus material, which offers an early, less invasive approach to mitigating
back and leg pain associated with contained lumbar herniations.  This product,
along with Stryker's offerings in percutaneous cement delivery, discography and
radiofrequency denervation, allows Stryker to focus on the interventional pain management
marketplace.

Surgical Navigation
Systems

Through
Stryker Instruments, the Company offers a broad line of surgical navigation
systems that give surgeons in several specialties the ability to use electronic
imaging to see more clearly, align instruments better and accurately track
where the instruments are relative to a patient's anatomy during surgical
procedures.  In 2006, Stryker released two groundbreaking navigation
applications for the joint replacement and craniomaxillofacial implant
markets.  The eNdtrac ASM software and instrumentation give orthopaedic
surgeons the option of navigating their cuts while eliminating the need to
place additional pins in the femur and tibia outside of the surgical incision. 
The iNtellect software packages provide neurologic and ENT surgeons with
enhanced graphics, a significantly simplified image import process,
customizable procedure-specific workflows and user-friendly advanced tools for
comprehensive planning and navigation.

During
2005, the Company launched a number of new products across multiple surgical
specialties to better serve the surgical navigation marketplace.  For the knee
implant market, eNact Knee 3.1 software was introduced, further simplifying the
procedure via reactive workflow by leveraging Stryker's Smart Instrumentation
and Camera technology.  This unique technology promotes greater surgical
efficiency because the software automatically reacts to a surgeon's
individualized procedural workflow.  To serve the implant instrumentation
market, the Company introduced the OrthoLock Anchoring System, which allows for
less invasive procedures and provides surgeons a choice between two and
three pin tracker anchoring.  Also introduced was the Ortho Grip Knee Pointer,
which allows surgeons to utilize an ergonomically designed pistol grip
instrument during the implant registration process.  Stryker also released two
major advancements in its Neuro portfolio with Neuro 2.0 software and the Shunt
Placement Tool.  Neuro 2.0 provides surgeons with the option of utilizing the
Company's Mask technology to register the patient without traditional fiducial
markers and increases surgical efficiency by significantly reducing
intraoperative patient registration time.  The Shunt Placement Tool provides a
higher degree of accuracy for one of the most common neurosurgical procedures
by utilizing a dedicated instrument and corresponding software designed
specifically for the procedure.  In spine navigation, Spine 1.2 software was
released for support of complex spine procedures, such as multiple-level
scoliosis repair, requiring intraoperative 3D CT data.  Also in 2005, a
portable laptop navigation system was introduced; it has a smaller footprint in
the surgical suite, is easily portable, is cost efficient and offers the
functionality and technological advantages of Stryker's System II Cart.

The
Company launched the Navigation System II Cart and Camera as well as Hip 2.0,
Uni-knee, and Knee 3.0 for use with the Stryker Navigation System in 2004.  All
of these new product offerings are imageless platforms incorporating more
intuitive hardware and software functions that result in greater ease of use,
less invasive procedures and reduced surgical time.

Endoscopic, Communications
and Digital Imaging Systems

Stryker Endoscopy
produces and markets medical video-imaging and communications equipment and
instruments for arthroscopy, general surgery and urology.  Stryker Endoscopy

fiber optics that, when combined with Stryker's high-definition (HD) camera
systems, allow the physician to view internal anatomy with a high degree of
clarity.

- - 14 -

In
2006, the Company introduced the 1188 HD Camera, the next generation of Stryker
3-Chip HD Cameras.  The 1188 HD offers superior picture quality, enhanced
clarity and more intuitive user controls.  This product provides surgical teams
with improved visibility during endoscopic procedures, which can improve overall
surgical and patient outcomes.  In conjunction with the launch of the 1188 HD
Camera, the Company also introduced complementary products such as the X8000
Lightsource and Vision Elect Monitor, that feature improvements over earlier
offerings.  In 2004, Stryker introduced the first HD medical video 3-chip
camera, the 1088 HD.  To accommodate the recording of HD images, the Company
introduced the Stryker Digital Capture (SDC) HD digital documentation system. 
Another milestone was the introduction of best-in-class scope technology with
the U-500 FlexVision flexible ureteroscope.  Also in 2004, Stryker launched its
Formula shaver system, which is small, light and equipped with radio frequency
identification (RFID), facilitating communication between the blade and
console.

In
2006, Stryker launched the Infinity II Communication Platform featuring an
intuitive customer interface and an open architecture.  This second-generation
model allows customers to run multiple PC applications from a single touch

(DVI) board.

In
2005, the Company acquired eTrauma which expanded the Company's endoscopic and
medical video imaging equipment product offerings by adding eTrauma's
proprietary PACS image management and viewing software.  The PACS software was complemented
by the 2005 launch of OrthoPad, Stryker's electronic medical records software. 
In 2006, Stryker launched Office PACS 3.4, which provides seamless integration
between the clinic and the operating room.

Patient Handling and
Emergency Medical Equipment

Stryker
Medical is a leader in the stretcher products segment, offering a wide variety
of stretchers customized to fit the needs of acute care and specialty surgical
care facilities.  Early in 2006, Stryker Medical introduced the ACS Stretcher,
a value offering for the basic ambulatory surgery center market.  In 2004, the
Company launched a completely new concept in stretcher design, the M-Series
Stretcher.  With a focus on patient safety and product mobility, the M-Series
features Stryker's Glideaway siderails, which provide maximum coverage when
raised and a zero-transfer-gap when lowered; a 700-pound weight capacity; an
integrated transfer board; and four-wheel, steel-ring brakes for stability. The
M-Series provides customers with three different mobility options to suit their
transportation needs: a fifth wheel for enhanced steering, Big Wheel technology
for increased maneuverability and the self-propelled Zoom technology.  All
three mobility options provide a safe and comfortable surface for patients
while reducing the risk of back injury for hospital staff.

Stryker
also produces beds and accessories that are designed to meet the unique needs
of specialty departments within the acute care environment.  In 2005, Stryker
introduced the XPRT nonintegrated sleep surface with low air loss, percussion
and rotational functions to aid in the prevention and treatment of certain
ulcers and pulmonary care.  In 2004, Stryker introduced the LD304 birthing bed,
which features a removable foot section with the unique Lock-Rite System.  Also
introduced in 2004 was the Go Bed II medical/surgical bed that features low
bed-height for safe patient ingress and exit.  The Go Bed II also offers the
optional Chaperone center-of-gravity bed-exit system with Zone Control to help
prevent patient falls.  Zone Control is a feature that enables the caregiver to
adjust the sensitivity of the bed-exit system to accommodate different patient
needs. Stryker has a complete line of intensive care unit (ICU) beds for
critical care and step-down units.  The beds incorporate advanced features that
facilitate patient care, such as in-bed scales that accurately weigh the
patient regardless of bed position and a radiolucent surface that facilitates
chest x-rays without moving the patient from the bed.

The
Company's legacy of innovation in the prehospital market continued in 2004 with
the launch of the MX-PRO BT ambulance cot with a weight capacity of 850 pounds
for use in the emergency medical services transport market.  To facilitate patient
transport up and down stairs, Stryker offers the STAIR-PRO series of stair
chairs.  To better serve the emergency medical market, in 2006 Stryker
introduced a customized version of the POWER-PRO ambulance cot, which was
originally introduced in 2005.  This new version extends the original design to
carry transport incubators on both inter-facility and intra-facility
transports.  The POWER-PRO ambulance cot is a revolutionary design with an
advanced electronic/hydraulic lift system that enables emergency

- - 15 -

medical
professionals to effortlessly raise and lower the cot with the press of a
button, which helps mitigate caregiver back injuries.

Other

The
Other category includes Physical Therapy Services.  Physiotherapy Associates
provides physical, occupational and speech therapy services to patients
recovering from orthopaedic or neurologic illness and injury through a network of
487 outpatient physical therapy centers in 31 states and the District of
Columbia.  Physiotherapy Associates works closely with referring physicians to
design and execute rehabilitation protocols with the goal of quick recoveries
for injured workers, athletes and other patients.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

Most
of the Company's products and product improvements have been developed internally. 
The Company maintains close working relationships with physicians and medical
personnel in hospitals and universities who assist in product research and
development.  New and improved products play a critical role in the Company's
sales growth.  The Company continues to place emphasis on the development of
proprietary products and product improvements to complement and expand its
existing product lines.  The Company has a decentralized research and
development focus, with manufacturing locations responsible for new product
development and product improvements.  Research, development and engineering personnel
at the various manufacturing locations maintain relationships with staff at distribution
locations and with customers to understand changes in the market and product
needs.

Total
expenditures for product research, development and engineering were $324.6
million in 2006, $284.7 million in 2005 and $214.9 million in 2004.  Research,
development and engineering expenses represented 6.0% of sales in 2006,
compared with 5.8% in 2005 and 5.0% in 2004.   The higher spending level is the
result of the Company's continued focus on new product development for
anticipated future product launches and continued investments in new
technologies.  Recent new product introductions in the Orthopaedic Implants and
MedSurg Equipment segments are more fully described under the caption "

Product Sales

" on pages 5 through 16 of this
report.

In
addition to internally developed products, the Company invests in technologies
developed by third parties that have the potential to expand the markets in
which the Company operates.  Certain of these investments result in charges for
purchased in-process research and development.  The purchased in-process
research and development charges of $52.7 million recorded in the first quarter
of 2006, $15.9 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 and $120.8
million recorded in the third quarter of 2004 relate to the acquisitions of Sightline,
PlasmaSol and SpineCore, respectively.

In
2006 and 2005, the Company acquired Sightline, a developer of flexible
endoscopes, and PlasmaSol, a developer of sterilization equipment, respectively. 
At the date of the acquisitions, the technologies acquired had not yet reached technological
feasibility.  The Company is currently working to advance the technologies
toward commercial applications prior to obtaining necessary approvals from the
FDA for sale of the final products.

In 2004, the Company acquired SpineCore, a developer
of artificial lumbar and cervical discs.  Current products under development
include the FlexiCore lumbar artificial disc and the CerviCore cervical
artificial disc.  FlexiCore is currently involved in a U.S. clinical study under an approved IDE granted by the FDA. 
Following completion of enrollment in the clinical study during 2005, a 2-year
patient follow-up is ongoing prior to submission of a PMA application to the
FDA.  Submission of a PMA application for the FlexiCore disc is currently
expected to occur in 2007.  During 2005, the Company received clearance in Australia and CE Marking approval in Europe for the FlexiCore implant.  Also in 2005, Stryker
received conditional approval for a U.S. trial of the CerviCore cervical disc
replacement.  Enrollment in the IDE clinical study is expected to be completed
in 2007.  Submission of a PMA application utilizing the resulting data from
this study is anticipated in 2009.

- - 16 -

The
Company believes that the technologies acquired in the Sightline, PlasmaSol and
SpineCore acquisitions will result in the introduction of new products and
additional future sales.  However, factors including regulatory delays,
safety concerns or patent disputes could delay the introduction or marketing of
these potential new products.  Additionally, unanticipated issues may arise
during current and future clinical trials that could delay or terminate a
product's development prior to regulatory approval.  The Company may
experience an unfavorable impact on its operating results if it is unable to
capitalize on those efforts by attaining the proper FDA approval.  As of
December 31, 2006, the Company has not encountered significant issues and
expects completion of the development and initial commercialization of the
flexible endoscope technologies in 2007 and both the sterilization technologies
and spinal disc implant technologies beginning in 2008.

In the
fourth quarter of 2006, the Company opened a new facility to support product
development activities across its manufacturing divisions.  Located near Dehli, India, the facility will provide software and mechanical engineering resources for
divisional R&D teams to accelerate new product innovation and it will
facilitate the development and testing of Stryker's internal systems.  Over
time, the facility will also support local markets in Asia to expand the
Company's presence in that region.

pages 62 through 64 of this report.

The
Company's business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of
orthopaedic implant surgeries is lower during the summer months.

COMPETITION

The
Company is one of five leading competitors in the United States for orthopaedic
reconstructive products.  The four other leading competitors are DePuy
Orthopaedics, Inc. (a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson), Zimmer Holdings,
Inc., Biomet, Inc., and Smith & Nephew plc.  While competition abroad
varies from area to area, the Company believes it is also a leading player in
the international markets with these same companies as its principal
competitors.

In the trauma
implant segment, Stryker is one of five leaders competing principally with
Synthes, Inc., Smith & Nephew Orthopaedics (a division of Smith &
Nephew plc), Zimmer Holdings, Inc., and DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc.

In
the craniomaxillofacial implant segment, Stryker is one of four leaders,
together with the principal competitors Synthes, Inc., Walter Lorenz Surgical,
Inc. (a subsidiary of Biomet, Inc.), and KLS Martin L.P.

- - 17 -

In
the spinal implant segment, the Company is one of five leaders, including the
principal competitors Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Inc. (a subsidiary of Medtronic,
Inc.), DePuy Spine, Inc. (a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson),
Synthes, Inc., and Zimmer Holdings, Inc.

Several
companies are engaged in the research and development of products for the
repair of hard and soft tissues that, if approved, would compete with the
Company's OP-1 product.  Medtronic Sofamor Danek has received FDA approval for
its recombinant bone morphogenetic protein ("rhBMP-2") for certain
spine, trauma and orthopaedic indications including the treatment of acute,
open fractures of the tibial shaft and spinal fusion surgeries.  A number of
companies currently provide various other therapies, including allografts, bone
fillers and electrical stimulation devices for the treatment, repair or
replacement of bone and joint tissue.  The Company believes that its OP-1
product, which is approved for limited trauma and spine indications in certain
markets and is currently in clinical trials for other indications, will
ultimately compete with these products and with traditional therapies, such as
autograft and allograft.

In
the surgical equipment segment, Stryker is one of three leaders, together with
the principal domestic competitors Medtronic Midas Rex, Inc. (a subsidiary of
Medtronic, Inc.), and Linvatec, Inc. (a subsidiary of Conmed Corporation).  These companies are also competitors in
the international segments, along with Aesculap-Werke AG (a division of B.
Braun Melsungen AG), a large European manufacturer.

In
the surgical navigation segment, Stryker is one of six principal competitors
including Medtronic Surgical Navigation Technologies (a division of Medtronic,
Inc.), BrainLAB Inc. (a subsidiary of BrainLAB AG), Aesculap AG & Co. KG (a division of B. Braun Melsungen
AG), Radionics, Inc. (a subsidiary of Tyco International Ltd.), and GE Medical
Systems Navigation and Visualization, Inc. (a subsidiary of General Electric
Company).

In
the arthroscopy segment, the Company is one of four leaders, together with the
principal competitors Smith & Nephew Endoscopy (a division of Smith &
Nephew plc), Linvatec, Inc., and Arthrex, Inc.  In the laparoscopic imaging
products segment, the Company is one of four leaders, together with the
principal competitors Karl Storz GmbH & Co. (a German company), Gyrus ACMI Corporation and Olympus Optical Co. Ltd. (a Japanese company).

The
Company's primary competitor in the patient handling segment is Hill-Rom
Company, Inc. (a division of Hillenbrand Industries, Inc.).  In the specialty
stretcher segment, the primary competitors are Hausted, Inc. (a subsidiary of Steris Corporation), Hill-Rom Company,
Inc., and Midmark Hospital Products Group (a subsidiary of Ohio Medical
Instrument Company, Inc.).  In the emergency medical services segment,
Ferno-Washington, Inc., is the Company's principal competitor.

In
the United States outpatient physical and occupational rehabilitation market,
the Company's primary competitors are independent, therapist-owned practices
and hospital-based services, in addition to other national rehabilitation
companies, including Healthsouth
Corporation, NovaCare Rehabilitation (a division of Select Medical Corporation),
Benchmark Physical Therapy and U.S. Physical Therapy, Inc.

The principal
factors that the Company believes differentiate it in the highly competitive
market segments in which it operates and enable it to compete effectively are
innovation, reliability, service and reputation.  The Company believes that its
competitive position in the future will depend to a large degree on its ability
to develop new products and make improvements to existing products.  While the
Company does not consider patents a major factor in its overall competitive
success, patents and trademarks are significant to the extent that a product or
attribute of a product represents a unique design or process.  Patent or
trademark protection of such products restricts competitors from duplicating
these unique designs and features.  Stryker seeks to obtain patent protection
on its products whenever possible.  The Company currently owns approximately 820
United States patents and 1,330 international patents.

used by the Company are stainless steel, aluminum, cobalt chrome and titanium
alloys.  In all, purchased parts and components from outside sources were
approximately 44% of the total cost of sales in 2006.

While
the Company relies on single sources for certain purchased materials and
services, it believes alternate sources are available if needed.  The Company
has not experienced any significant difficulty in the past in obtaining the
materials necessary to meet its production schedules.

Substantially
all products manufactured by the Company are stocked in inventory, while
certain products manufactured within the Company's MedSurg Equipment segment
are assembled to order.

REGULATION AND PRODUCT QUALITY

The

The
FDA's Quality System regulations set forth standards for the Company's product
design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records
and provide for inspections of the Company's facilities by the FDA.  There are
also certain requirements of state, local and foreign governments that must be
complied with in the manufacturing and marketing of the Company's products. 
The Company believes that the manufacturing and quality control procedures it employs
meet the requirements of these regulations.

Most
of the Company's new products fall into FDA classifications that require
notification of and review by the FDA before marketing, submitted as a 510(k). 
The Company's FlexiCore and CerviCore artificial disc products and OP-1
products require extensive clinical testing, consisting of safety and efficacy
studies, followed by PMA applications for specific surgical indications.

Stryker also is
subject to the laws that govern the manufacture and distribution of medical
devices of each country in which the Company manufactures or sells products. 
The member states of the European Union (EU) have adopted the European Medical
Device Directives, which create a single set of medical device regulations for
all EU member countries.  These regulations require companies that wish to
manufacture and distribute medical devices in EU member countries to obtain CE
Marking for their products.  Stryker has authorization to apply the CE Marking to
substantially all of its products.  The Company's OP-1 product has been
considered a drug under the regulations for Europe, Australia and Japan.

The
Company's Physiotherapy Associates, Inc., subsidiary is subject to various
federal and state regulations regarding the provision of physical therapy
services.  The primary entities administering these regulations are the Centers
for Medicare & Medicaid Services, CHAMPUS, state workers compensation
agencies, state insurance commissioners and state licensing agencies.

Initiatives
sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector to
limit the growth of health-care expenses generally and hospital costs in
particular, including price regulation and competitive pricing, are ongoing in
markets where the Company does business.  It is not possible to predict at this
time the long-term impact of such cost-containment measures on the Company's
future business.

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE
REGISTRANT

Information
regarding the executive officers of the Company appears under the caption
"Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance" on
pages 69 through 70 of this report.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

The
following information contains specific risks that could potentially impact the
Company's business, financial condition or operating results.  The Company may
be subject to additional risks that are not currently known to the Company or
those which the Company deems immaterial that may also impact its business
operations.

The Company's
inability to maintain adequate working relationships with healthcare
professionals could have a negative impact on the Company's future operating
results.

The
Company maintains close working relationships with respected physicians and
medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist in product research
and development.  The Company continues to place emphasis on the
development of proprietary products and product improvements to complement and
expand its existing product lines.  If the Company is unable to maintain
these good relationships, its ability to market and sell new and improved
products could decrease and future operating results could be unfavorably
affected.

The Company's inability
to continue to hire and retain key employees could have a negative impact on
the Company's future operating results.

The talent and
drive of the Company's employees are key factors in the success of its
business.  The Company's sales, technical and other key personnel play an
integral role in the development, marketing and selling of new and existing
products.  If the Company is unable to recruit, hire, develop and retain a
talented, competitive work force it may not be able to meet its strategic
business objectives.

Stricter pricing
guidelines for the Orthopaedic Implants industry could have a negative impact
on the Company's future operating results.

Initiatives
sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector to
limit the growth of health-care costs, including price regulation and
competitive pricing, are ongoing in markets where the Company does business. 
The Company could experience a negative impact on its operating results due to
increased pricing pressure in the United States, Japan and certain other
markets.  Governments, hospitals and other third party payers could reduce the
amount of approved reimbursements for the Company's Orthopaedic Implant
products.  Reductions in reimbursement levels or coverage or other
cost-containment measures could unfavorably affect the Company's future
operating results.

The Company's operating
results could be negatively impacted by changes in its excess and obsolete
inventory reserves.

The Company
maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the
potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current
carrying costs. The markets in which the Company operates are

- - 20 -

highly
competitive and new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an
ongoing basis.  Such marketplace changes may cause some of the Company's
products to become obsolete.  The Company makes estimates regarding the future
recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for
excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience, expiration of
sterilization dates and expected future trends.  If actual product life cycles,
product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable
than projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required,
which could unfavorably affect future operating results.

The Company's operating
results could be negatively impacted if it is unable to capitalize on research
and development spending.

The Company has
spent a significant amount of time and resources on research and development projects
in order to develop and validate new and innovative products.  The Company
believes these projects will result in the manufacturing of new products and
will create additional future sales.  However, factors including regulatory
delays, safety concerns, or patent disputes could slow down the introduction or
marketing of new products.  Additionally, unanticipated issues may arise in
connection with current and future clinical studies, including those for additional
OP-1 applications and the FlexiCore and CerviCore spinal implant products, that
could delay or terminate a product's development prior to regulatory approval. 
The Company may experience an unfavorable impact on its operating results if it
is unable to capitalize on those efforts by attaining the proper FDA approval or
to successfully market these and other new products, including the PlasmaSol
sterilization products and the Sightline flexible endoscope products.

The Company's operating
results could be negatively impacted by future product liability claims, unfavorable
court decisions or legal settlements.

The Company is a
defendant in various proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the
normal course of business, including product liability and other matters.  Such
matters are subject to many uncertainties, and outcomes are not predictable
with assurance.  To partially mitigate losses arising from unfavorable outcomes
in such matters, the Company purchases third-party insurance coverage subject
to certain deductibles and loss limitations.  While the Company believes its
current insurance coverage is adequate to mitigate losses arising from such
matters, its future operating results may be unfavorably impacted by any
settlement payments or losses beyond the amounts of insurance carried. 
Likewise, the Company may incur significant legal expenses regardless of
whether it is found to be liable.  In addition, such product liability
settlements may negatively impact the Company's ability to obtain
cost-effective third-party insurance coverage in future periods.

In December 2003,
the Company announced that it and its subsidiary Physiotherapy Associates,
Inc., received a subpoena from the United States Attorney's Office in Boston, Massachusetts, in connection with a Department of Justice investigation of
Physiotherapy Associates' billing and coding practices.  In March 2005, the
Company announced that it received a subpoena from the United States Department
of Justice requesting documents for the period January 2002 through the present
relating to "any and all consulting contracts, professional service agreements,
or remuneration agreements between Stryker Corporation and any orthopedic
surgeon, orthopedic surgeon in training, or medical school graduate using or
considering the surgical use of hip or knee joint replacement/reconstruction
products manufactured or sold by Stryker Corporation."  In June 2006, the
Company announced that it received a subpoena from the United States Department
of Justice, Antitrust Division, requesting documents for the period January
2001 through the present regarding possible violations of federal criminal law,
including possible violation of the antitrust laws, relating to the manufacture
and sale of orthopaedic implant devices.  The Company is fully cooperating with
the Department of Justice regarding these matters.  As a result of these
investigations, the Company's future operating results could be negatively
impacted by settlements of these matters.

The Company's operating
results could be negatively impacted by economic, political or other
developments in countries in which the Company does business.

Future operating
results could be negatively impacted by unstable economic, political and social
conditions including but not limited to fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates, political instability, or

- - 21 -

changes in the interpretation of or
creation of new laws and regulations in each of the countries where the Company
conducts business, including the United States.  Additionally, the Company operates
in multiple tax jurisdictions and must determine the appropriate allocation of
income to each of these jurisdictions based on current interpretations of
complex income tax regulations.  Tax audits associated with the allocation of
income and other complex issues may result in significant tax adjustments that
could negatively impact the Company's future operating results.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Throughout this discussion, references are made
to the following financial measures:  "constant currency," "adjusted net
earnings," "adjusted basic net earnings per share" and "adjusted diluted net
earnings per share."  These financial measures do not replace the presentation
of Stryker Corporation's (the Company or Stryker) reported financial results
under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company has provided
these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures because they provide meaningful
information regarding the Company's results on a consistent and comparable
basis for the periods presented.  Management uses these non-GAAP financial
measures for reviewing the operating results of its business segments, for
analyzing potential future business trends in connection with its budget
process and bases certain annual bonus plans on these non-GAAP financial
measures.  In order to measure the Company's sales performance on a constant
currency basis, it is necessary to remove the impact of changes in foreign
currency exchange rates which affects the comparability and trend of sales.  In
order to measure the Company's earnings performance on a consistent and
comparable basis, it is necessary to exclude certain items that affect the
comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings.  These items
include purchased in-process research and development charges recorded in 2006,
2005 and 2004 and the additional income taxes associated with the repatriation
of foreign earnings recorded in 2005.  Additional details regarding the nature,
determination and financial statement impact of these items are included in

Results
of Operations

.  Given the nature of these items, management believes that
excluding them from certain financial metrics is more representative of the
Company's past and potential future operational performance.  In addition, the
Company believes investors will utilize this information to evaluate
period-to-period results on a comparable basis and to better understand
potential future operating results.  The Company encourages investors and other
users of these financial statements to review its Consolidated Financial
Statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely
solely on any single financial measure.

Executive Level Overview

Stryker
is one of the world's leading medical technology companies with the most
broadly based range of products in orthopaedics and a significant presence in
other medical specialties.  Stryker works with respected medical professionals
to help people lead more active and more satisfying lives.  The Company's
products include implants used in joint replacement, trauma,
craniomaxillofacial and spinal surgeries; biologics; surgical, neurologic, ear,
nose & throat and interventional pain equipment; endoscopic, surgical navigation,
communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient handling and
emergency medical equipment.  Stryker also provides outpatient physical therapy
services in the

United States.

- - 25 -

The Company segregates its operations into two
reportable business segments: Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  The
Orthopaedic Implants segment sells orthopaedic reconstructive (hip, knee and
shoulder), trauma, spinal and craniomaxillofacial implant systems, bone cement
and the bone growth factor OP-1.  The MedSurg Equipment segment sells surgical
equipment; surgical navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital
imaging systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. 
The Other category includes Physical Therapy Services and corporate
administration, interest expense and interest and marketable securities income.

Domestic
sales accounted for 66% of total revenues in 2006.  Most of the Company's
products are marketed directly to doctors, hospitals and other health-care
facilities by approximately 3,200 sales and marketing personnel in the United States.  Stryker primarily maintains separate and dedicated sales forces for each of
its principal product lines to provide focus and a high level of expertise to
each medical specialty served.

International
sales accounted for 34% of total revenues in 2006.  The Company's products are
sold in more than 100 countries through both Company-owned sales subsidiaries
and branches as well as third-party dealers and distributors.

The
Company's business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of
orthopaedic implant surgeries is lower during the summer months.

In
the first quarter of 2006, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of
Sightline Technologies Ltd. (Sightline), a private, development-stage company,
for an upfront payment of $50.0 million in cash plus certain transaction costs
and the assumption of certain liabilities.  Sightline is a developer of
flexible endoscopes that should improve insertion and sterilization during
colonoscopy procedures.  This acquisition is expected to enhance the Company's
presence in the gastrointestinal and other markets within its MedSurg Equipment
segment.

In the fourth quarter of 2005,
the Company acquired, by merger, all of the outstanding stock of PlasmaSol
Corp. (PlasmaSol).  PlasmaSol has developed a technology that should allow
Stryker to provide sterilization equipment for use with certain of its MedSurg
Equipment products.  The cost of the transaction totaled $17.5 million
including an upfront cash payment plus the assumption of certain liabilities.

In
the first quarter of 2005, the Company acquired, by merger, all of the
outstanding stock of eTrauma.com Corp. (eTrauma) for $50.0 million in cash plus
certain transaction costs.  The acquisition expanded the Company's digital
imaging equipment product offerings within its MedSurg Equipment segment by
adding eTrauma's proprietary Picture Archive and Communications Systems (PACS)
image management and viewing software.

In
the third quarter of 2004, the Company acquired, by merger, all of the
outstanding stock of SpineCore, Inc. (SpineCore), for an upfront payment of
$120.0 million in cash plus certain transaction costs.  SpineCore is a
developer of artificial lumbar and cervical discs.  This acquisition is
expected to enhance the Company's presence in the spinal implant market, an
important growth area within its Orthopaedic Implants segment.

Additional
details, including the financial statement impacts resulting from these
acquisitions, are included in

Results of
Operations

.

On
December 31, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 158,

Employers' Accounting for Defined
Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans - an amendment of FASB
Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)

.  The Statement requires an entity to
recognize, on its balance sheet, an asset or liability reflecting the funded
status of defined benefit postretirement plans as the difference between the
projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets with changes
continuing to be reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss)
component of shareholders' equity net of related income taxes.  This Statement
does not change the calculation of the amount of net periodic benefit cost
included in net earnings.  As a result of the adoption of the Statement, the
funded status of the Company's defined benefit pension plans resulted in the
recognition, in the Company's December 31, 2006 consolidated balance sheet, of
an

- - 26 -

additional $22.8 million liability with corresponding changes in accumulated
other comprehensive gain (loss) and deferred income taxes.  The adoption of the
Statement did not require a restatement of prior periods.

Effective
January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Statement No. 123
(revised),

Share-Based Payment

.  The revised Statement requires
companies to measure the cost of employee stock options based on the grant-date
fair value and recognize that cost over the period during which a recipient is
required to provide services in exchange for the options, typically the vesting
period.  The Company adopted the provisions of the revised Statement using the
modified-retrospective transition method provided in the revised Statement. 
Under this method, the Company restated all prior periods presented on a
consistent basis, based on the pro forma expense previously disclosed. 
Additional details, including the financial statement impact resulting from
this adoption, are included in

Results of
Operations

.

In
the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company completed the repatriation of $722
million of foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation
Act (the Act).  The Act provided a temporary incentive for United States companies to repatriate accumulated income earned in foreign jurisdictions at a
reduced income tax cost.  Additional details, including the financial statement
impact resulting from the repatriation of funds, are included in

Results of Operations

.

Outlook for 2007

The
Company's outlook for 2007 continues to be optimistic regarding underlying
growth rates in orthopaedic procedures and the Company's broadly based range of
products in orthopaedics and other medical specialties, despite the potential
for increased pricing pressure in certain markets.  The Company projects that
diluted net earnings per share for 2007 will approximate $2.42, representing a
28% increase over diluted net earnings per share of $1.89 for the year ended
December 31, 2006.  Excluding the impact of the charge to write off purchased
in-process research and development associated with the acquisition of
Sightline in 2006, as more fully described in

Results of Operations

, the
Company projects that diluted net earnings per share for 2007 will increase 20%
over adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $2.02 for the year ended
December 31, 2006.

The financial
forecast for 2007 includes a constant currency net sales increase in the range
of 11% to 13% as a result of growth in shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and
MedSurg Equipment which is comparable to the 11% constant currency net sales increase
reported for the full year of 2006.  If foreign currency exchange rates hold
near current levels, the Company anticipates a favorable impact on net sales of
approximately 1% to 2% in the first quarter of 2007 and a favorable impact on
net sales of approximately 0% to 1% for the full year of 2007.

2006 Compared with 2005

Stryker
Corporation's net sales increased 11% in 2006 to $5,405.6 million from
$4,871.5 million in 2005.  Net sales grew by 10% as a result of increased
unit volume and changes in product mix and 1% as a result of higher selling
prices.

Domestic sales were
$3,556.8 million for 2006, representing an increase of 12% as a result of
higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  International
sales were $1,848.8 million for 2006, representing an increase of 8% as a
result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  The
impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international
sales was unfavorable by $5.2 million for 2006.  On a constant currency basis,
international sales increased 9% in 2006.

Worldwide
sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $3,110.1 million for 2006, representing an
increase of 9%, on both a reported and constant currency basis, as a result of
higher shipments of reconstructive, trauma, spinal and craniomaxillofacial
implant systems; bone cement; and the bone growth factor OP-1.

Hip Implant Systems:

Sales of hip implant systems increased 2% during
the year on both a reported and constant currency basis.  In the United States, sales growth was driven by sales of the recently launched X3 polyethylene
and increased sales in Accolade cementless hip products and Restoration Modular
Hip System revision hip products, partially offset by declines in sales of other
hip systems.  Solid growth in the Trident Hip System, Accolade cementless hip
products and Restoration Modular Hip System revision hip products in Europe as well as solid growth in Accolade cementless hip products and the Trident Hip
System in the Pacific region also contributed to the sales growth in hip
implant systems.

Knee Implant Systems:

Sales of knee implant systems increased 12%
during the year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, due to strong
growth in the Triathlon Knee System in the United States, Europe and the
Pacific region and solid growth in the Scorpio Knee System in most
international markets, partially offset by slower growth in Japan as a result
of government imposed price cuts.

- - 29 -

Trauma Implant Systems:

Sales of trauma implant systems increased 13% during
the year, 14% on a constant currency basis, as a result of strong worldwide
sales growth in the Gamma3 Hip Fracture System and strong sales growth in the
T2 Nailing System in the United States and Europe, partially offset by slower
growth in Japan as a result of the price cuts.

Spinal Implant Systems:

Sales of spinal implant systems increased 18%
during the year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, primarily due
to strong worldwide sales growth of interbody devices led by sales of the AVS
vertebral spacer system as well as solid worldwide sales growth in
thoraco-lumbar products.

Craniomaxillofacial Implant Systems:

Sales of craniomaxillofacial
implant systems increased 16% during the year, on both a reported and constant
currency basis, as a result of strong domestic sales growth led by products for
neurologic indications and craniomaxillofacial implants.

Worldwide
sales of MedSurg Equipment were $2,037.1 million for 2006, representing an
increase of 16%, on both a reported and constant currency basis, as a result of
higher shipments of surgical equipment; surgical navigation systems;
endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient
handling and emergency medical equipment.

Surgical Equipment and Surgical Navigation Systems:

Sales of surgical
equipment and surgical navigation systems increased 12% during the year, on
both a reported and constant currency basis, due to strong domestic sales
growth in surgical navigation systems and operating room equipment and solid
domestic sales growth in interventional pain products.  Strong sales growth in
powered surgical instruments outside the United States also led to the
Company's sales growth.

Endoscopic,Communications
and Digital Imaging Systems:

Sales of
endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems increased 19% during the
year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, as a result of strong
worldwide sales growth in medical video imaging equipment led by the recently
launched 1188 HD Camera and related accessories as well as imaging and
communications products.  Strong worldwide sales growth in general surgery
products also contributed to the Company's sales growth.

Patient Handling and Emergency Medical Equipment:

Sales of patient
handling and emergency medical equipment increased 18% during the year, 17% on
a constant currency basis, due to strong sales growth in hospital bed products
in the United States, Latin America and Canada, strong domestic sales growth in
emergency medical equipment as well as solid stretcher sales growth in Europe
and Latin America.

Physical
Therapy Services revenues were $258.4 million for 2006, representing a decrease
of 2% primarily due to lower revenues from existing centers.

Cost
of sales represented 34.2% of sales in 2006 compared with 35.3% in 2005.  The
lower cost of sales percentage in 2006 is primarily due to lower excess and
obsolete inventory costs as a result of fewer comparative product introductions
during the year and reduced royalty costs related to the expiration of certain
royalty agreements partially offset by faster sales growth in the lower margin
MedSurg Equipment segment.

Research,
development and engineering expenses represented 6.0% of sales in 2006 compared
with 5.8% in 2005.  These expenses increased 14% in 2006 to $324.6 million. 
The higher spending level is the result of the Company's continued focus on new
product development for anticipated future product launches and continued
investments in new technologies.  New product introductions in 2006 for the
Orthopaedic Implants segment included the LFIT Anatomic Femoral Heads with X3 polyethylene
liners which address range of motion and dislocation potential and the AVS AS
Spacer which is used for anterior lumbar interbody fusion.  Within the MedSurg Equipment segment, new product
introductions in 2006 included the 1188
HD Camera and related accessories, the next generation of Stryker 3-Chip HD
Cameras, the System 6 heavy duty power system and the Precision Oscillating Tip
Saw which features a stationary blade shaft with an oscillating tip.

Selling,
general and administrative expenses increased 11% in 2006 and represented 38.1%
of sales compared with 38.0% in 2005.  The slight increase in selling, general
and administrative expenses as a percent of

- - 30 -

sales in 2006 is due to higher
sales-related costs, primarily compensation, loaner instrumentation
amortization and sample expenses, partially offset by decreases in insurance
costs and slower growth in discretionary spending.

The
purchased in-process research and development charge of $52.7 million recorded
in the first quarter of 2006 relates to the acquisition of Sightline.  At the
date of the acquisition, the flexible endoscope technologies acquired had not
yet reached technological feasibility.  The upfront payment of $50.0 million,
plus certain transaction costs and the assumption of certain liabilities, was preliminarily
allocated to assets acquired, purchased in-process research and development and
liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of
acquisition.  The purchased in-process research and development charge of $15.9
million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 relates to the acquisition of
PlasmaSol.  At the date of the acquisition, the sterilization technology
acquired had not yet been approved for sale by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) and, therefore, had not yet reached technological
feasibility.  The purchase price of $17.5 million was allocated to assets acquired,
primarily for deferred income tax assets associated with acquired net operating
losses, and purchased in-process research and development based on their fair
value at the date of acquisition.

The
Company believes that the technologies acquired in both the Sightline and
PlasmaSol acquisitions will result in the introduction of new products and
additional future sales.  However, factors including regulatory delays, safety
concerns or patent disputes could delay the introduction or marketing of these
potential new products.  Additionally, unanticipated issues may arise during
current and future clinical trials that could delay or terminate a product's
development prior to regulatory approval.  The Company may experience an
unfavorable impact on its operating results if it is unable to capitalize on
those efforts by attaining the proper FDA approval.  As of December 31, 2006,
the Company has not encountered significant issues and expects completion of
the development and initial commercialization of the flexible endoscope
technologies and the sterilization technologies in 2007 and 2008, respectively.

As a result of the adoption of FASB Statement
No. 123 (revised) requiring the expensing of stock options, the Company's operating
income for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was reduced by $56.2
million and $48.7 million, respectively, and the Company's net earnings for the
same periods were reduced by $36.5 million and $31.6 million, respectively. 
Basic and diluted net earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2006
and 2005 were reduced by $.09 and $.08, respectively.

Interest and marketable securities income,
which is included in other income (expense), increased to $41.4 million in 2006
from $13.3 million in 2005, primarily as a result of increased cash and cash
equivalents and marketable securities balances compared to the year earlier
period.  Interest expense, which is included in other income (expense),
increased to $9.5 million in 2006 from $7.7 million in 2005, primarily as a result
of borrowings in Europe to complete the repatriation of foreign earnings in the
fourth quarter of 2005.

The Company's effective income tax rate for the
year ended December 31, 2006 was 29.5% as compared to an effective income tax
rate for the year ended December 31, 2005 of 32.6%.  The effective income tax
rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflects the impact of the
nondeductibility for income tax purposes of the purchased in-process research
and development charge associated with the acquisition of Sightline.  The
effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2005 reflects the
impact of the nondeductibility for income tax purposes of the purchased in-process
research and development charge associated with the acquisition of PlasmaSol as
well as the income taxes associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings. 
After considering these factors, the Company's reported effective income tax
rates for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 are lower than the United States statutory income tax rate primarily as a result of manufacturing in lower tax,
international jurisdictions.

Net earnings in 2006 increased 21% to $777.7
million from $643.6 million in 2005; basic net earnings per share increased 20%
to $1.91 in 2006 from $1.59 in 2005; and diluted net earnings per share
increased 20% to $1.89 in 2006 from $1.57 in 2005.

Excluding the impacts of the charges to write
off purchased in-process research and development in 2006 and 2005 and to
recognize the income tax expense associated with the repatriation of foreign
earnings in 2005, adjusted net earnings increased 21% to $830.4 million in 2006
from $686.9 million in 2005.  Adjusted basic net

earnings per share increased
20% to $2.04 in 2006 from $1.70 in 2005, and adjusted diluted net earnings per
share increased 21% to $2.02 in 2006 from $1.67 in 2005.  The reconciliations

2005 Compared with 2004

Stryker
Corporation's net sales increased 14% in 2005 to $4,871.5 million from
$4,262.3 million in 2004.  Net sales grew by 12% as a result of increased
unit volume and changes in product mix, 1% related to higher selling prices and
1% due to acquisitions.

Domestic sales were
$3,165.6 million for 2005, representing an increase of 15% as a result of
higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment and higher
revenue from Physical Therapy Services.  International sales were $1,705.9
million for 2005, representing an increase of 13% as a result of higher shipments
of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  The impact of foreign currency
comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $11.5
million for 2005.  On a constant currency basis, international sales increased
12% in 2005.

Worldwide
sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $2,849.5 million for 2005, representing an
increase of 11% as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive, trauma,
spinal and craniomaxillofacial implant systems; bone cement; and the bone
growth factor OP-1.  Sales of Orthopaedic Implants also increased 11% for the
year on a constant currency basis.

Hip Implant Systems:

Sales of hip implant systems increased 4%
during the year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, due to growth
in sales of the Trident Hip System in Europe and the Pacific region and in
Accolade cementless hip products and Restoration Modular Hip System revision
hips in the United States, partially offset by lower sales of the Trident
ceramic-on-ceramic hip system and hip fracture products in the United States.

- - 32 -

Knee Implant Systems:

Sales of knee implant systems increased 14%
during the year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, due to strong sales
growth in the recently launched Triathlon Knee System in the United States,
Europe and the Pacific region as well as the Scorpio Knee System in Europe,
Japan and the Pacific region.

Trauma Implant Systems:

Sales of trauma implant systems increased 17% during
the year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, as a result of the
full-scale launch of the Gamma3 Hip Fracture System in the United States, Japan and Europe in the second half of 2004.  Strong growth in the Company's T2
Nailing System, both in the United States and internationally, also drove
trauma sales growth in 2005.

Spinal Implant Systems:

Sales of spinal implant systems increased 17%
during the year, on both a reported and  constant currency basis, primarily due
to strong sales growth of interbody devices in the United States led by sales
of the recently launched AVS spacer products as well as solid worldwide growth
in cervical and thoraco-lumbar product sales.

Craniomaxillofacial Implant Systems:

Sales of craniomaxillofacial
implant systems increased 8% during the year, 7% on a constant currency basis,
as a result of solid domestic sales of products for neurologic indications.

Worldwide
sales of MedSurg Equipment were $1,759.4 million for 2005, representing an
increase of 20% as a result of higher shipments of surgical equipment; surgical
navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as
well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. Sales of MedSurg
Equipment also increased 20% for the year on a constant currency basis.

Surgical Equipment and Surgical Navigation Systems:

Sales of surgical
equipment and surgical navigation systems increased 16% during the year, on both
a reported and constant currency basis, due to strong worldwide sales growth in
the System 5 heavy-duty powered system, interventional pain products,
Sterishield personal protection systems and surgical navigation products as well
as strong sales growth in the Neptune operating waste management system in the
United States.

Endoscopic,Communications
and Digital Imaging Systems:

Sales of
endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems increased 24% during the
year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, as a result of strong sales
growth in medical video imaging equipment, led by growth of digital imaging
equipment and the 1088 HD Camera, and strong growth in general surgery products
in the United States, partially offset by slower sales growth in arthroscopy in
the United States resulting from the discontinuance of allograft products
during the year.

Patient Handling and Emergency Medical Equipment:

Sales of patient
handling and emergency medical equipment increased 23% during the year, 22% on
a constant currency basis, due to strong sales growth in hospital and maternity
beds and emergency medical equipment in the United States and solid stretcher
growth in the U. S. market.

Physical
Therapy Services revenues were $262.6 million for 2005, representing an
increase of 7% with all of the growth coming from new physical therapy centers.

Cost
of sales represented 35.3% of sales in 2005 compared with 35.5% in 2004.  The
lower cost of sales percentage in 2005 is partially due to increased average
selling prices for the Company's products and lower excess and obsolete
inventory costs associated with discontinued products, partially offset by
faster sales growth in the lower margin MedSurg Equipment segment and higher
growth in royalty costs relative to sales growth.

Research,
development and engineering expenses represented 5.8% of sales in 2005 compared
with 5.0% in 2004. These expenses increased 32% in 2005 to $284.7 million.  The
higher spending level is the result of the Company's continued focus on new
product development for anticipated future product launches and continued
investments in new technologies, together with, beginning in the third quarter
of 2004, spending associated with the continued development of products
acquired from SpineCore.  New product introductions in 2005 in the Orthopaedic
Implants segment included X3 polyethylene, the Company's next-generation highly
crosslinked polyethylene featuring a higher level of strength and wear
reduction in both hip and knee replacements, and the

- - 33 -

posteriorly stabilized
version of the Triathlon Knee System in the United States, Europe, Canada and
the Pacific region.  Within the
MedSurg Equipment segment, new product introductions in 2005 included the
Maestro drill, which expanded the Company's line of micro powered instruments
for spine; neurologic; and ear, nose & throat applications.

Selling, general and administrative expenses
increased 10% in 2005 and represented 38.0% of sales compared with 39.5% in
2004.  The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a
percent of sales in 2005 is due to lower meeting costs and slower growth in
advertising costs and insurance premiums relative to the Company's growth in
net sales.  These decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales
commission expense as a result of the 14% growth in net sales in 2005 in
addition to higher amortization expense associated with loaner instrument sets.

The purchased in-process research and
development charge of $15.9 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005
relates to the acquisition of PlasmaSol, as previously described.  The
purchased in-process research and development charge of $120.8 million recorded
in the third quarter of 2004 relates to the acquisition of SpineCore, a
private, development-stage company.  At the date of the acquisition, the
artificial lumbar and cervical spinal disc implant technologies acquired were
in preliminary stages of clinical studies in the United States and had not yet
reached technological feasibility.  The upfront payment of $120.0 million, plus
certain transaction costs, was allocated to assets acquired, purchased
in-process research and development and liabilities assumed based on their
estimated fair value at the date of acquisition.

The Company believes that the technologies
acquired in both the PlasmaSol and SpineCore acquisitions will result in the
introduction of new products and additional future sales.  However, factors
including regulatory delays, safety concerns or patent disputes could delay the
introduction or marketing of these potential new products.  Additionally,
unanticipated issues may arise during current and future clinical trials that
could delay or terminate a product's development prior to regulatory approval. 
The Company may experience an unfavorable impact on its operating results if it
is unable to capitalize on those efforts by attaining the proper FDA approval. 
As of December 31, 2006, the Company had not encountered significant issues and
expects completion of the development and initial commercialization of both the
sterilization technologies and spinal disc implant technologies beginning in
2008.

As a result of the adoption of FASB Statement
No. 123 (revised), the Company's operating income for the years ended December
31, 2005 and 2004 was reduced by $48.7 million and $38.9 million, respectively,
and the Company's net earnings for the same periods were reduced by $31.6 million
and $25.7 million, respectively.  Basic and diluted net earnings per share for
the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 were reduced by $.08 and $.06,
respectively.

Interest  and marketable securities income,
which is included in other income (expense), increased to $13.3 million in 2005
from $4.7 million in 2004, primarily due to increased cash and cash equivalents
and marketable securities balances compared to the year earlier period.  Interest
expense, which is included in other income (expense), increased to $7.7 million
in 2005 from $6.8 million in 2004, primarily as a result of increased
borrowings in Europe to complete the repatriation of foreign earnings in the
fourth quarter of 2005.

The effective income tax rate was 32.6% for the
year ended December 31, 2005 and 35.1% for the year ended December 31, 2004. 
The effective income tax rate for 2005 reflects a charge of $27.4 million to
recognize the income tax expense and related liability associated with the repatriation
of $722 million of foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs
Creation Act completed in the fourth quarter.  The effective income tax rate
for 2005 also reflects the impact of the nondeductibility for income tax
purposes of the purchased in-process research and development charge associated
with the acquisition of PlasmaSol.  The effective income tax rate for the year
ended December 31, 2004 reflects the impact of the nondeductibility for income
tax purposes of the purchased in-process research and development charge
associated with the acquisition of SpineCore.  After considering these factors,
the Company's reported effective income tax rates for the years ended December
31, 2005 and 2004 are lower than the United States statutory income tax rate
primarily as a result of manufacturing in lower tax, international jurisdictions.

- - 34 -

Net earnings in
2005 increased 46% to $643.6 million from $440.0 million in 2004; basic net
earnings per share increased 45% to $1.59 in 2005 from $1.10 in 2004; and
diluted net earnings per share increased 45% to $1.57 in 2005 from $1.08 in
2004.

Excluding the
impacts of the charges to write off purchased in-process research and
development in 2005 and 2004 and to recognize income tax expense associated with
the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005, adjusted net earnings increased
22% to $686.9 million in 2005 from $560.8 million in 2004.  Adjusted basic net
earnings per share increased 21% to $1.70 in 2005 from $1.40 in 2004, and
adjusted diluted net earnings per share increased 22% to $1.67 in 2005 from

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company's
working capital at December 31, 2006 increased $561.5 million to $2,182.8
million from $1,621.3 million at December 31, 2005.  The increase in working
capital resulted from growth in the Company's overall business and the use of
cash earnings to fund increases in accounts receivable, inventories and prepaid
expenses.

Accounts
receivable days sales outstanding was 56 days at December 31, 2006 compared
with 54 days at December 31, 2005.  Days sales in inventory increased 8 days to
122 days at December 31, 2006 from 114 days at December 31, 2005.  The increase
in days sales in inventory at December 31, 2006 is primarily due to higher
levels of inventory in support of anticipated product launches and first
quarter sales as well as management's effort to run the manufacturing plants at
a steady rate during the year.

The Company
generated cash of $867.3 million from operations in 2006 compared with $833.4
million in 2005.  The increase in cash from operations in 2006 compared with
the prior year is primarily due to increased earnings partially offset by
growth in the working capital accounts, primarily inventories and accounts
receivable.

- - 35 -

In 2006, the
Company used cash of $217.5 million for capital expenditures, including $29.4
million related to the implementation of ERP systems at multiple manufacturing
and distribution facilities; $24.1 million for the expansion of the Company's
OP-1 manufacturing facility in Lebanon, New Hampshire; $17.5 million for the
new corporate headquarters in Kalamazoo, Michigan; and $12.5 million for
construction of the Homer Stryker Center for education and clinical research in
Mahwah, New Jersey.  In addition, the Company used cash of $97.1 million for
acquisitions and $44.6 million for the payment of dividends.  The Company also
purchases and sells marketable securities, which are classified as
available-for-sale investments in accordance with the provisions of FASB
Statement No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities

.  Marketable securities totaled $998.2 million at December 31,
2006.

In addition to the acquisitions discussed previously,
the Company acquired eTrauma in the first quarter of 2005 for an upfront
payment of $50.0 million in cash plus certain transaction costs.  The
acquisition of eTrauma was accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting.  The results of operations for the acquired business are included
in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of the
acquisition and did not materially impact the Company's reported operating
results.  Pro forma consolidated results of operations would not differ
significantly as a result of the eTrauma acquisition.

The purchase price for eTrauma was allocated to the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at
the date of acquisition.  Based on the purchase price allocation, $22.0 million
was allocated to identifiable intangible assets, to be amortized over their
remaining lives of 5 to 8 years, and $30.2 million was allocated to goodwill.  Immediately after the acquisition was consummated,
management of the Company began to implement an integration plan to combine
Stryker and eTrauma.  In conjunction with the integration plan, the Company
recorded additional purchase liabilities for severance and related costs of
$0.3 million, which were included in the purchase price allocation.

The Company had
$416.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $998.2 million in marketable
securities at December 31, 2006.  The Company also had outstanding borrowings
totaling $14.8 million at that date, all of which were classified as current
obligations.  The Company believes its cash on hand and marketable securities,
as well as anticipated cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to fund
future operating capital requirements; future manufacturing facility
construction and other capital expenditures; future business and product line
acquisitions to supplement its current product offerings; loaner
instrumentation for surgical implants in support of new product launches;
required debt repayments and the payment of dividends.

Should additional
funds be required, the Company had $1,028.1 million of additional borrowing
capacity available under all of its existing credit facilities, including the
Company's $1,000.0 million 5-year nonamortizing, revolving Unsecured Credit
Facility that expires in November 2010.  In addition, the Company had $200.0
million of eligible accounts receivable that could be sold through its accounts
receivable securitization facility at December 31, 2006.

The Company's
future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than 1
year, including agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of
business, are summarized as follows (in millions):

Critical Accounting
Policies

The preparation
of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements and accompanying notes.  Management evaluates these estimates and
assumptions on an ongoing basis.  Estimates are based on historical experience,
when available, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are
not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Management
believes that of its significant accounting policies (see Note 1 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements), an understanding of the following critical
accounting policies is important in obtaining an overall understanding of the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The
Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in
the collection of accounts receivable.  The Company makes estimates regarding
the future ability of its customers to make required payments based on
historical credit experience and expected future trends.  If actual customer
financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management,
additional accounts receivable write-offs may be necessary, which could
unfavorably affect future operating results.

Inventory Reserves

The
Company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the
potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current carrying
costs.  The markets in which the Company operates are highly competitive and
new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis.  Such
marketplace changes may cause some of the Company's products to become
obsolete.  The Company makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of
the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete
inventories based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates
and expected future trends.  If actual product life cycles, product demand or
acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by
management, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which could
unfavorably affect future operating results.

Income Taxes

The Company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions both inside and
outside the United States.  Accordingly, management must determine the
appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions.  Tax audits
associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues,
including inventory transfer pricing and product royalty arrangements, may
require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax
adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between
jurisdictions with different tax rates.  Because tax adjustments in certain
jurisdictions can be significant, the Company records accruals representing
management's best estimate of the probable resolution of these matters.  These
income tax accruals are included

- - 37 -

within the income taxes liability in the
consolidated balance sheets.  To the extent additional information becomes
available, such accruals are adjusted to reflect the revised estimated probable
outcome.

Other Matters

The Company
distributes its products throughout the world.  As a result, the Company's
financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in
foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign
markets.  The Company's operating results are primarily exposed to changes in
exchange rates among the United States dollar, the Japanese yen and European
currencies, in particular the euro and the British pound.  When the United States dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the dollar value of sales
denominated in foreign currencies increases.  When the United States dollar strengthens, the opposite situation occurs.  The Company
manufactures its products in the United States, France, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, Canada and Puerto Rico and incurs the costs to manufacture in the
applicable local currencies.  This worldwide deployment of factories serves to
partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the
Company's cost of sales.

The Company enters into forward currency exchange
contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions
denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting risk to the Company
that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates.  These
nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables
and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products.  The
periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of
the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the
measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional
currencies.  All forward currency exchange
contracts are marked-to-market each period with resulting gains (losses)
included in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of earnings.

At December 31, 2006, the Company had
outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $387.9 million and
sell $227.0 million of various currencies (principally

United States dollars and euros) with maturities ranging principally from 7 to 180 days.  At
December 31, 2005, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange
contracts to purchase $217.6 million and sell $196.1 million of various
currencies (principally United States dollars and euros) with maturities ranging
principally from 7 to 180 days.  The estimated fair value of forward currency
exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end
spot rates as adjusted by current forward points.  A hypothetical 10% change in
foreign currencies relative to the U. S. dollar would change the December 31,
2006 fair value by approximately $9.7 million.  The Company is exposed to
credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on its outstanding
forward currency exchange contracts but does not anticipate nonperformance by
any of the counterparties.

The Company has certain investments in net assets in
international locations that are not hedged.  These investments are subject to
translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currencies that are
deferred and recorded as a separate component of shareholders' equity.  For the
year ended December 31, 2006, the strengthening of foreign currencies relative
to the United States dollar increased the value of these investments in net assets,
and the related deferred gain in shareholders' equity, by $102.6 million to
$119.6 million from $17.0 million at December 31, 2005.

The
Company is partially self-insured for product liability claims and utilizes a
wholly owned captive insurance company in the United States to manage its
self-insured retention limits.  The captive insurance company provides
insurance reserves for estimated liabilities for product claims incurred but
not reported based on actuarially determined liabilities.  The actuarial
valuations are based on historical information along with certain assumptions
about future events.

In December 2003, the Company announced that
its subsidiary Physiotherapy Associates, Inc., and Stryker received a subpoena
from the United States Attorney's Office in Boston, Massachusetts, in
connection with a United States Department of Justice investigation of
Physiotherapy Associates' billing and coding practices.  In March 2005, the
Company announced that it received a subpoena from the United States Department
of Justice requesting documents for the period January 2002 through the present
relating to "any and

- - 38 -

all consulting contracts, professional service
agreements, or remuneration agreements between Stryker Corporation and any
orthopedic surgeon, orthopedic surgeon in training, or medical school graduate
using or considering the surgical use of hip or knee joint
replacement/reconstruction products manufactured or sold by Stryker
Corporation."  In June 2006, the Company announced that it received a
subpoena from the United States Department of Justice, Antitrust Division,
requesting documents for the period January 2001 through the present regarding
possible violations of federal criminal law, including possible violation of
the antitrust laws, relating to the manufacture and sale of orthopaedic implant
devices.  The Company is fully cooperating with the Department of Justice
regarding these matters.

In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation
No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of
FASB Statement No. 109

.  This Interpretation clarifies the accounting for
income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is
required to meet before being recognized in the Company's Consolidated Financial
Statements.  The Interpretation also provides guidance for the measurement and
classification of tax positions, interest and penalties and requires additional
disclosure on an annual basis.  The Company plans to
adopt the provisions of the Interpretation effective January 1, 2007, as
required.  The Company has not yet determined the effect the adoption of the
Interpretation will have on the financial position of the Company but does not
anticipate a material impact.  Any difference between the amounts recognized in
the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements prior to the adoption of the
Interpretation and the amounts reported after the adoption will be accounted
for as a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded in the beginning balance of
retained earnings on January 1, 2007 and will not require restatement of prior
periods.

FINANCIAL
  STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Board of Directors and
Shareholders of Stryker Corporation

:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Stryker
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006.  Our audits also
included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2.  These
financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of Stryker
Corporation's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Stryker Corporation
and subsidiaries at December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the consolidated results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.  Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule,
when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in
Notes 1, 7 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2006 Stryker
Corporation changed its methods of accounting for share-based payments and retirement
plans in connection with the required adoption of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards Nos. 123(R) and 158, respectively.

We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the effectiveness of Stryker Corporation's internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established
in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February
2, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Stryker Corporation and Subsidiaries

December 31, 2006

NOTE

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Business

: Stryker Corporation (the Company or
Stryker) is one of the world's leading medical technology companies with the
most broadly based range of products in orthopaedics and a significant presence
in other medical specialties.  Stryker works with respected medical
professionals to help people lead more active and more satisfying lives.  The
Company's products include implants used in joint replacement, trauma,
craniomaxillofacial and spinal surgeries; biologics; surgical, neurologic, ear,
nose & throat and interventional pain equipment; endoscopic, surgical
navigation, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient
handling and emergency medical equipment.  Stryker also provides outpatient
physical therapy services in the United States.

Principles of
Consolidation

: The Consolidated
Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned
subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions.

Revenue Recognition

: A significant portion of the Company's Orthopaedic
Implants revenue is generated from consigned inventory maintained at hospitals
or with field representatives.  For these products, revenue is recognized at
the time the Company receives appropriate notification that the product has
been used or implanted.  The Company records revenue from MedSurg Equipment
product sales when title and risk of ownership have been transferred to the
customer, which is typically upon shipment to the customer.  For its Physical
Therapy Services line of business, the Company records revenue when the
services have been rendered.  The Company records estimated sales returns,
discounts and other applicable adjustments as a reduction of net sales in the
same period revenue is recognized.

Shipping and Handling of
Products

: Amounts billed to customers
for shipping and handling of products are included in net sales.  Costs
incurred related to shipping and handling of products are included in cost of
sales.

Use of Estimates

: The preparation of these Consolidated Financial
Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires Company management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying
notes.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currency
Translation

: The functional
currencies for substantially all of the Company's international affiliates are
their local currencies.  Accordingly, the financial statements of these
international affiliates are translated into United States dollars using
current exchange rates for balance sheets and average exchange rates for
statements of earnings and cash flows.  Unrealized translation adjustments are
included in accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) in shareholders'
equity.  Transaction gains and losses, such as those resulting from the
settlement of nonfunctional currency receivables or payables, are included in
net earnings.

Cash Equivalents,
Marketable Securities and Other Investments

: Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with a maturity of 3
months or less when purchased.  Marketable securities consist of marketable
debt securities and certificates of deposit classified as available-for-sale. 
Other investments, included within other assets in the consolidated balance
sheets, consist of mutual funds, classified as trading, that are acquired to
offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation
arrangements and are expected to be used to settle these liabilities.

The
Company's marketable securities and other investments are stated at fair value
based on quoted market prices.  Adjustments to the fair value of marketable
securities and other investments that are classified as available-for-sale are
recorded as increases or decreases, net of income taxes, within accumulated
other comprehensive gain (loss) in shareholders' equity.  Adjustments to the
fair value of other investments that are classified as trading are recorded in
earnings as offsets to the related changes in liabilities under deferred

- - 45 -

compensation arrangements.  The amortized cost of marketable debt securities
classified as available-for-sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums and
discounts to maturity computed under the effective interest method.  Such
amortization is included in other income (expense) along with interest and realized
gains and losses.  The cost of securities sold is determined by the specific
identification method.

Accounts Receivable

:  Accounts receivable consists of trade and other
miscellaneous receivables.  The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful
accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable.  The
Company makes estimates regarding the future ability of its customers to make
required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future
trends.

Accounts Receivable
Securitization

: The Company has an
accounts receivable securitization facility pursuant to which certain subsidiaries
of the Company sell, on an ongoing basis, all of their domestic accounts
receivable to Stryker Funding Corporation (SFC), a wholly owned special-purpose
subsidiary of the Company, which in turn may sell, without recourse, up to an
aggregate of a $200.0 million undivided percentage ownership interest in such
receivables to bank-administered multiseller commercial paper conduits. 
Creditors of SFC have a claim to its assets before any equity becomes available
to the Company.

There
were no amounts of undivided percentage ownership interests in accounts
receivable sold by SFC under the facility as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. 
Accounts receivable sold would be reflected in the consolidated balance sheet
as reductions of accounts receivable in the period sold.  The amount of
receivables available to be sold is subject to change monthly, based on the
level of defined eligible receivables less defined customary reductions for
servicing, dilution and loss reserves.  The Company's retained interest in accounts
receivable held by SFC, which is in the form of a subordinated note, represents
an overcollateralization of any undivided interest sold.  This retained
interest totaled $436.2 million and $347.1 million at December 31, 2006 and
2005, respectively.

Inventories

: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or
market.  Cost for approximately 79% of inventories is determined using the
first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method.  Cost for certain domestic inventories
is determined using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) cost method.  The FIFO cost
for all inventories approximates replacement cost.

The
Company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the
potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current
carrying costs.  The markets in which the Company operates are highly
competitive, and new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an
ongoing basis.  Such marketplace changes may cause some of the Company's
products to become obsolete.  The Company makes estimates regarding the future
recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for
excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience, expiration of
sterilization dates and expected future trends.

Property, Plant and Equipment

: Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. 
Depreciation is computed by either the straight-line or declining-balance
method over the estimated useful lives of 3 to 30 years for buildings and
improvements and 3 to 10 years for machinery and equipment.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

:  Goodwill represents the excess of
purchase price over fair value of tangible net assets of acquired businesses
after amounts allocated to other intangible assets.  Other intangible assets
include developed technology, which is amortized on a straight-line basis over
20 years, and customer relationships (which reflect expected continued customer
patronage), trademarks and patents, which are amortized on a straight-line
basis over 4 to 40 years (weighted-average life of 14 years for other
intangible assets).

Loaner Instrumentation

: Loaner instrumentation represents the net book value
of loaner instruments for surgical implants provided to customers by the
Company.  Loaner instrumentation is amortized on a straight-line basis over a
3-year period.  Amortization expense for loaner instrumentation is included in
selling, general and administrative expenses.

Stock Options:

At
December 31, 2006,

the Company had
key employee and director stock option plans, which are described more fully in
Note 7.  Effective January 1, 2006, the
Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 123 (revised),

Share-Based
Payment

.  The revised Statement

- - 46 -

requires companies to measure the cost of employee stock options based on the
grant-date fair value and recognize that cost over the period during which a
recipient is required to provide services in exchange for the options,
typically the vesting period.  The Company adopted the provisions of the revised
Statement using the modified-retrospective transition method provided in the revised
Statement.  Under this method, the Company restated all prior periods presented
on a consistent basis, based on the pro forma expense previously disclosed.

As a result of the adoption of the revised
Statement, the Company's operating income for the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004 was reduced by $56.2 million, $48.7 million and $38.9
million, respectively, and the Company's net earnings for the same periods were
reduced by $36.5 million, $31.6 million and $25.7 million, respectively.  Basic
and diluted net earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005
and 2004 were reduced by $.09, $.08 and $.06, respectively.  In addition, prior
period balance sheets were adjusted to reflect the cumulative impact of stock
option compensation expense and stock option exercise activity as required by
the modified-retrospective transition method.  The consolidated balance sheet
at December 31, 2005 was adjusted to reflect decreases in retained earnings and
deferred stock-based compensation of $125.7 million and $1.6 million,
respectively, and increases in the balances of additional paid-in capital and
noncurrent deferred income tax assets of $172.5 million and $48.4 million,
respectively.

Prior to the adoption of the revised Statement,
the Company presented all of the income tax benefits resulting from the
exercise of stock options as cash flows provided by operating activities in the
consolidated statements of cash flows.  The revised Statement requires the
income tax benefit from deductions, resulting from the exercise of stock
options, in excess of the compensation cost recognized (excess income tax
benefit) to be classified as cash flows provided by financing activities.  Excess
income tax benefit from exercise of stock options reported as cash flows
provided by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005
and 2004, respectively, would have been classified as cash flows provided by
operating activities if the Company had not adopted the provisions of the
revised Statement.

The
weighted-average fair value per share of options granted during 2006, 2005 and
2004, estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model, was $17.16, $17.45 and $16.83, respectively.  The fair value of options
granted was estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions:

The risk-free interest
rate for periods within the expected life of options granted is based on the United
States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.  Expected stock
price volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company's stock.  The
expected option life, representing the period of time that options granted are
expected to be outstanding, is based on historical option exercise and employee
termination data.  The Company recognizes the cost of stock options using the
straight-line method over their vesting periods.

Income Taxes

: The Company accounts for income taxes using the
liability method.  Under this method, deferred income tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and
tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax
rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to
reverse.  Deferred income tax expense (credit) represents the change in net
deferred income tax assets and liabilities during the year.

The Company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions both inside and
outside the United States and tax authorities in these jurisdictions regularly
perform audits of the Company's tax filings.  Accordingly, management must
determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions
based on current interpretations of complex income tax regulations.  Tax audits
associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues,
including inventory transfer pricing and product royalty arrangements, may
require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax
adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between
jurisdictions with different tax rates.  Because tax adjustments in certain
jurisdictions can be significant, the

- - 47 -

Company records accruals representing
management's best estimate of the probable resolution of these matters.  These
income tax accruals are included within the income taxes liability in the
consolidated balance sheets.  To the extent additional information becomes
available, such accruals are adjusted to reflect the revised estimated probable
outcome.

Derivative Financial
Instruments

: The Company follows the provisions of FASB Statement No. 133,

Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

, as amended by Statements
No. 137 and No. 138, in accounting for its derivative financial instruments. 
The Statements require the Company to recognize all derivatives on the balance
sheet at fair value.  The Company uses derivative financial instruments
to manage the economic impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates.  The
Company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to manage these
economic risks.  These contracts are adjusted to fair value through earnings.

Legal and Other
Contingencies:

The Company is
involved in various proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal
course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor,
intellectual property and other matters.  The potential future outcomes of
these matters are outside of management's complete control and will generally
not be known for prolonged periods of time.  In certain of the legal
proceedings, the claimants seek damages, as well as other compensatory relief,
which could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements.  In
legal matters for which management has sufficient information to reasonably
estimate the Company's future obligations, a liability representing
management's best estimate of the probable cost for the resolution of these
legal matters is recorded.  The estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel,
previous settlement experience and settlement strategies.

Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Gain (Loss)

: The
components of accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) are as follows (in
millions):

On
December 31, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Statement No.
158,

Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
Postretirement Plans -  an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and
132(R)

.  The Statement requires an entity to recognize, on its balance
sheet, an asset or liability reflecting the funded status of defined benefit
postretirement plans as the difference between the projected benefit obligation
and fair value of plan assets with changes continuing to be reflected in the
accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) component of shareholders' equity
net of related income taxes.  This Statement does not change the calculation of
the amount of net periodic benefit cost included in net earnings.  As a result
of the adoption of the Statement, the funded status of the Company's defined
benefit pension plans resulted in the recognition, in the Company's December
31, 2006 consolidated  balance sheet, of an additional $22.8 million liability
with corresponding changes in accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) and
deferred income taxes.  The adoption of the Statement did not require a
restatement of prior periods.  Additional information regarding the adoption of
this Statement is provided in Note 9.

- - 48 -

Recently Issued Accounting Standards:

In June 2006,
the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

.  This Interpretation
clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum
recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being
recognized in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.  The
Interpretation also provides guidance for the measurement and classification of
tax positions, interest and penalties, and requires additional disclosure on an
annual basis.  The Company plans to adopt the
provisions of the Interpretation effective January 1, 2007, as required.  The
Company has not yet determined the effect the adoption of the Interpretation
will have on the financial position of the Company but does not anticipate a
material impact.  Any difference between the amounts recognized in the
Company's Consolidated Financial Statements prior to the adoption of the
Interpretation and the amounts reported after the adoption will be accounted
for as a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded in the beginning balance of
retained earnings on January 1, 2007 and will not require restatement of prior
periods.

Reclassifications:

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to
conform with the presentation used in 2006.

NOTE 2

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT

The
following is a summary of the Company's investments (in millions):

The
net carrying value and estimated fair value of available-for-sale debt
securities at December 31, 2006, by contractual maturity, are as follows (in
millions):

- - 50 -

Interest
and marketable securities income, which is included in other income (expense),
totaled $41.4 million in 2006, $13.3 million in 2005 and $4.7 million in 2004.

The Company
enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of
currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies,
thereby limiting risk to the Company that would otherwise result from changes
in exchange rates.  These nonfunctional currency exposures relate principally
to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany transactions,
including purchases of manufactured products.  The periods of the forward
currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed
transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and
recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies.  All forward currency exchange contracts are
marked-to-market each period with resulting gains (losses) included in other
income (expense) in the consolidated statements of earnings.

At
December 31, 2006, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange
contracts to purchase $387.9 million and sell $227.0 million of various
currencies (principally United States dollars and euros) with maturities
ranging principally from 7 to 180 days.  At
December 31, 2005, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange
contracts to purchase $217.6 million and sell $196.1 million of various
currencies (principally United States dollars and euros) with maturities
ranging principally from 7 to 180 days.  The estimated fair value of forward
currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at
month-end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points and is recorded as a
component of accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance
sheets.  At December 31, 2006, the Company is exposed to credit loss in the
event of nonperformance by counterparties on its outstanding forward currency
exchange contracts but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the
counterparties.

NOTE

INVENTORIES

Inventories are summarized as
follows (in millions):

NOTE 4

ACQUISITIONS

In the first quarter of 2006, the Company acquired all
of the outstanding stock of Sightline Technologies Ltd. (Sightline), a private,
development-stage company, for an upfront payment of $50.0 million in cash plus
certain transaction costs and the assumption of certain liabilities.  The
acquisition of Sightline, a developer of flexible endoscopes, is expected to
enhance the Company's presence in the gastrointestinal and other markets within
its MedSurg Equipment segment.  Sightline's operating results are included in
the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of the
acquisition and did not materially impact the Company's operating results.  Pro
forma consolidated results of operations would not differ significantly as a
result of the Sightline acquisition.

The
purchase price was preliminarily allocated to assets acquired, purchased
in-process research and development and liabilities assumed based on their
estimated fair value at the date of acquisition.  The amount of the purchase
price allocated to purchased in-process research and development resulted in a
charge of $52.7

- - 51 -

million, or $.13 per diluted share, against the Company's
operating results.  At the date of the acquisition, the flexible endoscope
technologies acquired had not yet reached technological feasibility.  The
amount written off as purchased in-process research and development was not
deductible for income tax purposes in the United States.

Terms
of the transaction also include potential milestone payments of up to an
additional $90.0 million upon the achievement of certain operational and
financial targets related to Sightline's products, the first of which is
expected to occur in 2007.  The potential milestone payments are expected to be
capitalized at their fair values as intangible assets at the time of payment
and will be amortized over their remaining useful lives.

In
the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company acquired, by merger, all of the
outstanding stock of PlasmaSol Corp. (PlasmaSol), a private, development-stage
company.  PlasmaSol is a developer of a technology that should allow Stryker to
provide sterilization equipment for use with certain of its MedSurg Equipment
products.  The cost of the transaction totaled $17.5 million including an
upfront cash payment plus the assumption of certain liabilities.  PlasmaSol's
operating results are included in the Company's Consolidated Financial
Statements from the date of the acquisition and did not materially impact the
Company's operating results.  Pro forma consolidated results of operations would
not differ significantly as a result of the PlasmaSol acquisition.

The
purchase price was allocated to assets acquired primarily for deferred income tax
assets associated with acquired net operating losses and purchased in-process
research and development based on their estimated fair value at the date of
acquisition.  The amount of the purchase price allocated to purchased
in-process research and development resulted in a charge of $15.9 million, or
$.04 per diluted share, against the Company's 2005 operating results.  At the
date of acquisition, the sterilization technology acquired had not yet been
approved for sale by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and,
therefore, had not yet reached technological feasibility.  The amount written
off as purchased in-process research and development was not deductible for
income tax purposes in the United States.

In the first quarter of 2005, the Company acquired, by
merger, all of the outstanding stock of eTrauma.com Corp. (eTrauma) for $50.0
million in cash plus certain transaction costs.  The acquisition expanded the
Company's digital imaging equipment product offerings within its MedSurg
Equipment segment by adding eTrauma's proprietary Picture Archive and
Communications Systems (PACS) image management and viewing software.  The
acquisition of eTrauma was accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting.  The results of operations for the acquired business are included
in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of the
acquisition and did not materially impact the Company's operating results.  Pro
forma consolidated results of operations would not differ significantly as a
result of the eTrauma acquisition.

The purchase
price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on
their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition.  Based on the purchase
price allocation, $22.0 million was allocated to identifiable intangibles, to
be amortized over their remaining lives of 5 to 8 years, and $30.2 million was
allocated to goodwill, which was not deductible for income tax purposes in the United States.  Immediately after the acquisition was
consummated, management of the Company began to implement an integration plan
to combine Stryker and eTrauma.  In conjunction with the integration plan, the
Company recorded additional purchase liabilities for severance and related
costs of $0.3 million, which were included in the purchase price allocation.

In the third quarter of 2004, the Company acquired, by
merger, all of the outstanding stock of SpineCore, Inc. (SpineCore), for an
upfront payment of $120.0 million in cash plus certain transaction costs.  The
acquisition of SpineCore, a developer of artificial lumbar and cervical spinal
disc implant technologies, is expected to enhance the Company's presence in the
spinal implant market, an important growth area within its Orthopaedic Implants
segment.  SpineCore's operating results are included in the Company's
Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of the acquisition and did not
materially impact the Company's operating results.  Pro forma consolidated results of operations would not
differ significantly as a result of the SpineCore acquisition.

The purchase price was allocated to
assets acquired, purchased in-process research and development and liabilities
assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. 
The amount of the purchase price allocated to purchased in-process research and
development resulted in a charge of $120.8 million, or $.30 per diluted share,
against the Company's 2004 operating results.  At the date of the
transaction, the spinal disc implant

- - 52 -

technologies acquired were in preliminary
stages of clinical studies in the United States and had not yet reached
technological feasibility.  The amount written off as purchased in-process
research and development was not deductible for income tax purposes in the
United States.

Terms
of the transaction also include potential milestone and royalty payments of up
to an additional $240.0 million upon commercialization of SpineCore's products
in the United States, which is not expected to occur before 2008.  The
potential milestone payments are expected to be capitalized at their fair
values as intangible assets at the time of payment and will be amortized over
their remaining useful lives.

The
Company believes that the technologies acquired in the Sightline, PlasmaSol and
SpineCore acquisitions will result in the introduction of new products and
additional future sales.  However, factors including regulatory delays, safety
concerns or patent disputes could delay the introduction or marketing of these
potential new products.  Additionally, unanticipated issues may arise during
current and future clinical trials that could delay or terminate a product's
development prior to regulatory approval.  The Company may experience an
unfavorable impact on its operating results if it is unable to capitalize on
those efforts by attaining the proper FDA approval.  As of December 31, 2006, the
Company had not encountered significant issues and expects completion of the
development and initial commercialization of the flexible endoscope
technologies in 2007 and both the sterilization technologies and spinal disc
implant technologies in 2008.

The
Company has established a $1,000.0 million Unsecured Credit Facility.  The
facility, which expires in November 2010, includes a senior 5-year
nonamortizing, revolving credit agreement with a maximum amount of $1,000.0
million.  The Company may increase the credit facility maximum limit in $100.0
million increments up to an additional $500.0 million upon acceptance by the
existing lender group or additional lenders.

The
Unsecured Credit Facility requires a facility fee ranging from 0.04% to 0.15%
on the aggregate commitment of the credit facility, depending on the Company's
debt rating.  The credit facility includes a $500.0 million multicurrency
sublimit, under which yen and euro can be borrowed; a $100.0 million swing line
sublimit;

- - 54 -

and a $100.0 million letter of credit sublimit.  The credit facility
bears interest at a base rate, as defined, plus an applicable margin ranging
from 0.12% to 0.475%, depending on the Company's debt rating.

During
2006, the weighted-average interest rate, excluding required fees, for all
borrowings under the credit facility was 2.9%.  The Unsecured Credit Facility
requires the Company to comply with certain financial and other covenants.  The
Company was in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2006.  In addition
to the Unsecured Credit Facility, the Company has lines of credit, issued by
various financial institutions, available to fund the Company's day-to-day
operating needs.  At December 31, 2006, the Company had $1,028.1 million of
additional borrowing capacity available under all of its existing credit
facilities.

The
carrying amounts of the Company's long-term debt approximate their fair values,
based on the quoted interest rates for similar types and amounts of borrowing
agreements.

Interest
paid on debt, including required fees, was $6.3 million in 2006, $8.1 million
in 2005 and $6.0 million in 2004; these amounts are reflected in interest
expense, which is included in other income (expense).

NOTE

total grant-date fair value of shares vested during
the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $46.4 million, $43.1
million and $39.5 million, respectively.  Shares reserved for future
compensation grants of Stryker common stock were 25.9 million at December 31,
2006. Option shares reserved for future grants were 10.1 million at December
31, 2005.  Exercise prices for options outstanding as of December 31, 2006
ranged from $7.10 to $52.73.  At December 31, 2006, there was $136.0 million of
unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options granted under
the stock option plans; that cost is expected to be recognized over the
following 8.2 years (weighted-average period of 1.9 years).

NET EARNINGS PER SHARE

The following table sets forth the computation of
basic and diluted net earnings per share (in millions, except per share
amounts):

Options
to purchase an average of 4.5 million and 2.5 million shares of common stock
during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, were
outstanding but were not included in the computation of diluted net earnings
per share because the exercise prices of the options were greater than the
average market price of common shares for those periods.

RETIREMENT PLANS

Certain
of the Company's subsidiaries have both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension
plans covering some or all of their employees.  All of the defined benefit
pension plans have projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets.  As
discussed in Note 1, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Statement No.
158 as of December 31, 2006.  The adoption of the Statement did not require a
restatement of prior periods   Substantially all of the defined benefit pension
plans use a December 31 measurement date for the determination of plan
obligations and funded status of the plans.  A summary of the Company's defined
benefit pension plans is as follows (in millions):

benefit obligation in excess of plan assets had projected benefit obligations,
accumulated benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets of $146.2
million, $129.5 million and $80.2 million, respectively, as of December 31,

The estimated net actuarial loss and amortization of
prior service cost and transition amount for the defined benefit pension plans
to be recognized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net period
benefit cost in the year ended December 31, 2007, are $1.8 million and $0.2
million, respectively.

The Company has assumed an average long-term expected
return on defined benefit plan assets of 6.3% as of December 31, 2006.  The
expected return is determined by applying the target allocation in each asset
category of plan investments to the anticipated return for each asset category
based on historical and projected returns.

The weighted-average allocation of plan assets by
asset category is as follows:

The investment strategy for the Company's defined
benefit pension plans is both to meet the liabilities of the plans as they fall
due and to maximize the return on invested assets within appropriate risk
tolerances.  Reflected below are target investment allocation ranges for the
plans at December 31, 2006:

The Company anticipates contributing approximately
$8.2 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2007.

portion of the Company's retirement plan expenses was funded with Stryker
common stock totaling $7.0 million in 2006, $6.3 million in 2005 and $5.4
million in 2004.  The use of Stryker common stock represents a noncash
operating activity that is not reflected in the consolidated statements of cash
flows.  The amount of Stryker common stock held by the Company's defined
contribution retirement plans totaled $86.2 million (approximately 1.6 million
shares) and $71.2 million (approximately 1.6 million shares) as of December 31,
2006 and 2005, respectively.  The value of Stryker common stock as a
percentage of total defined contribution retirement plan assets was 13% as of
both December 31, 2006 and 2005.

NOTE 10

INCOME TAXES

In the fourth
quarter of 2004, the President of the United States signed the American Jobs
Creation Act (the Act).  The Act provided a temporary incentive for United States companies to repatriate accumulated income earned in foreign jurisdictions by
providing an 85% dividends-received deduction for certain dividends from
controlled corporations.

- - 59 -

In the third quarter of 2005, the Company's Board of
Directors approved a plan to repatriate $722 million of foreign earnings under
the provisions of the Act.  The repatriation plan was completed in the fourth
quarter of 2005, and the Company recorded a charge of $27.4 million, or $.07
per diluted share, to recognize the income tax expense and related liability in
the United States associated with the repatriation.  The repatriated funds were
invested pursuant to an approved Domestic Reinvestment Plan that conformed to
the Act.

Earnings before income taxes consist of the following
(in millions):

components of the provision for income taxes follow (in millions):

A
reconciliation of the United States statutory income tax rate to the Company's

- - 60 -

Deferred
income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and
the amounts used for income tax purposes.  Valuation allowances are recorded to
reduce deferred income tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax
benefit will not be realized.  The tax effect of significant temporary
differences, which comprise the Company's deferred income tax assets and
liabilities, is as follows (in millions):

Net operating loss carryforwards totaling
approximately $47.6 million at December 31, 2006 are available to reduce future
taxable earnings of certain domestic and foreign subsidiaries.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are
included in the consolidated balance sheets as follows (in millions):

At December 31, 2006, tax authorities in several tax jurisdictions
both inside and outside the United States were conducting routine audits of the
Company's income tax returns filed in prior years.  These audits are generally
designed to determine if individual tax authorities are in agreement with the
Company's interpretations of complex income tax regulations regarding the
allocation of income to the various tax jurisdictions.  During 2006, the
Company did not reach resolution on any significant outstanding tax audit and,
therefore, increased its income tax accruals by $19.7 million for the Company's
best estimate of the probable resolution of these tax positions.

No
provision has been made for United States federal and state income taxes or
foreign income taxes that may result from future remittances of the
undistributed earnings ($1,772.8 million at December 31, 2006) of foreign
subsidiaries because it is expected that such earnings will be reinvested
overseas indefinitely.  Determination of the amount of any unrecognized
deferred income tax liability on these unremitted earnings is not practicable.

- - 61 -

Total
income taxes paid, net of refunds received, were $325.6 million in 2006, $247.8
million in 2005 and $235.8 million in 2004.

NOTE 11

SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

The
Company segregates its operations into two reportable business segments:
Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  The Orthopaedic Implants segment
sells orthopaedic reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma, spinal and
craniomaxillofacial implant systems; bone cement; and the bone growth factor

OP-1.  The MedSurg Equipment segment sells surgical equipment; surgical
navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as
well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment.  The Other category
includes Physical Therapy Services and corporate administration, interest
expense and interest and marketable securities income.

Effective January 1, 2006, the
Company changed its business segment reporting to include the financial results
of certain products within its MedSurg Equipment segment rather than within its
Orthopaedic Implants segment.  The Company believes these products are better
aggregated with its other MedSurg Equipment products based on similarities in
manufacturing and marketing practices and customer base.  Prior year results
have been reclassified to correspond with this change in reporting.

The
Company's reportable segments are business units that offer different products
and services and are managed separately because each business requires
different manufacturing, technology and marketing strategies.  The accounting
policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of
significant accounting policies.  The Company measures the financial results of
its reportable segments using an internal performance measure that excludes the
purchased in-process research and development charges recognized in 2006, 2005
and 2004, the additional income taxes on the repatriation of foreign earnings
recognized in 2005 as well as the effect of share-based compensation, which
includes compensation related to both employee and director stock option plans
and restricted stock grants.  Identifiable assets are those assets used
exclusively in the operations of each business segment or are allocated when
used jointly.  Corporate assets are principally cash and cash equivalents;
marketable securities; and property, plant and equipment.

NOTE 13

CONTINGENCIES

The
Company is involved in various proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in
the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor,
intellectual property and other matters.  Such matters are subject to many
uncertainties, and outcomes are not predictable with assurance.  The Company
records amounts for losses that are deemed to be probable and subject to
reasonable estimate.  However, the Company does not anticipate material losses
as a result of these proceedings beyond amounts already provided in the
accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.

In December 2003,
the Company announced that its subsidiary Physiotherapy Associates, Inc., and
Stryker received a subpoena from the United States Attorney's Office in Boston, Massachusetts, in connection with a United States Department of Justice
investigation of Physiotherapy Associates' billing and coding practices.  In
March 2005, the Company announced that it received a subpoena from the United
States Department of Justice requesting documents for the period January 2002
through the present relating to "any and all consulting contracts,
professional service agreements, or remuneration agreements between Stryker
Corporation and any orthopedic surgeon, orthopedic surgeon in training, or
medical school graduate using or considering the surgical use of hip or knee
joint replacement/reconstruction products manufactured or sold by Stryker
Corporation."  In June 2006, the Company announced that it received a
subpoena from the United States Department of Justice, Antitrust Division
requesting documents for the period January 2001 through the present regarding
possible violations of federal criminal law, including possible violation of
the antitrust laws, relating to the manufacture and sale of orthopaedic implant
devices.  The Company is fully cooperating with the Department of Justice
regarding these matters.

Pursuant
to certain of the Company's credit and lease agreements, the Company has
provided financial guarantees to third parties in the form of indemnification
provisions.  These provisions indemnify the third parties for costs, including
but not limited to adverse judgments in lawsuits and the imposition of
additional taxes due to either a change in the tax law or an adverse
interpretation of the tax law.  The terms of the guarantees are equal to the
terms of the related credit or lease agreements.  The Company is not able to
calculate the maximum potential amount of future payments it could be required
to make under these guarantees, as the potential payment is dependent on the
occurrence of future unknown events (e.g., changes in United States or foreign tax laws).

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures -

An evaluation
of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of
December 31, 2006 was carried out under the supervision and with the
participation of the Company's management, including the President and Chief
Executive Officer and the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (the
"Certifying Officers").  Based on that evaluation, the Certifying Officers
concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
There was no change to the Company's internal control over financial reporting
during the period ended December 31, 2006 that materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over
financial reporting.

Management's
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting -

The management of Stryker Corporation is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f).  Stryker
Corporation's internal control system is designed to provide reasonable
assurance to the Company's management and Board of Directors regarding the
preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.

Stryker
Corporation's management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 under the supervision
and with the participation of the Certifying Officers.  In making this
assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission in

Internal Control--Integrated
Framework

.  Based on that assessment, management believes that, as of
December 31, 2006, the Company's internal control over financial reporting is
effective.

Stryker
Corporation's independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young
LLP, has issued an attestation report on management's assessment of the
Company's internal control over financial reporting.  This report appears on
the following page.

Other
Matters

- The Company has begun the
process of implementing new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems at
certain of its divisions.  An ERP system is a fully-integrated set of programs
and databases that incorporate order processing, production planning and
scheduling, purchasing, accounts receivable and inventory management and
accounting.  During the first quarter of 2006, the Company's Orthopaedics and
Spine divisions began to transition to their new ERP systems.  The Company's
Endoscopy division began to transition to its new ERP system in the third
quarter of 2006.  In connection with these ERP system implementations, the
Company will update its internal controls over financial reporting, as
necessary, to accommodate modifications to its business processes and
accounting procedures.  The Company does not believe that these ERP system
implementations will have an adverse effect on the Company's internal control
over financial reporting.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER
FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Stryker Corporation

:

We have audited
management's assessment, included in the accompanying Management Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Stryker Corporation and
subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).  Stryker Corporation's
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on management's assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of Stryker
Corporation's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that
our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company's internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, management's assessment that Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO
criteria. Also, in our opinion, Stryker Corporation maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2006, based on

the COSO criteria

.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of
Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the
related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders' equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006, and
our report dated February 2, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
