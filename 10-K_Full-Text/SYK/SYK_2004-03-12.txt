PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

GENERAL

Stryker
Corporation (the "Company" or "Stryker") is a leader in the
worldwide orthopaedic market and is one of the world's largest medical device
companies.  Stryker delivers results
through a wide range of capabilities including joint replacements, trauma,
spine and micro implant systems, orthobiologics,
powered surgical instruments, surgical navigation systems and endoscopic
products as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment.  Stryker also provides outpatient physical
therapy services in the United States. 
Stryker was incorporated in Michigan in 1946 as the successor company to
a business founded in 1941 by Dr. Homer H. Stryker, a leading orthopaedic
surgeon and the inventor of several orthopaedic products.

Stryker's
filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, including
its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports
on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports are accessible free of charge at
www.stryker.com within the "For Investors" link.

In October 2002, the Company purchased the DEKOMPRESSOR
product line from Pain Concepts, Inc. 
The DEKOMPRESSOR
is a single-use disposable device indicated for the percutaneous removal of
disc nucleus material.

In July 2002, the Company acquired the Surgical Dynamics
Inc. spinal implant business ("SDI") from Tyco International
Ltd.  The acquisition expanded the
Company's spinal product line by adding interbody
spinal cages for the United States market as well as other thoracolumbar
and cervical spinal fixation devices.

In November 2001, the Company acquired the business of an
independent Italian distributor of certain Stryker products.  The purchase consolidated the distribution of
substantially all of the Company's products in Italy.

The Company's Physiotherapy Associates, Inc. subsidiary
has also purchased a number of physical therapy clinic operations during each
of the last three years.

PRODUCT
SALES

The
Company segregates its operations into two reportable business segments:
Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. 
The Orthopaedic Implants segment sells orthopaedic reconstructive (hip,
knee and shoulder), trauma and spinal implants, bone cement and the bone growth
factor osteogenic protein-1 ("OP-1"). 
The MedSurg Equipment segment sells powered surgical instruments,
endoscopic products, hospital beds and stretchers and micro implant and
surgical navigation systems.  Other
includes Physical Therapy Services and corporate administration, interest
expense and interest income.  The
following amounts ($000,000s) and percentages represent business segment and
domestic/international net sales during each of the three years ended
December 31:

Additional
financial information regarding the Company's operating segments and geographic
areas can be found under the caption "

Note 12 - Segment
and Geographic Data

" on pages 50 through 52 of this report.

Approximately
79% of the Company's sales in 2003 and 2002 and approximately 76% of the
Company's sales in 2001 consisted of products with short lives, such as
implants (while implants have a long useful life to the patient, they have a
one-time use to the hospital), trauma-related products, disposables and
expendable tools and parts and service revenues, such as service and repair
charges and physical therapy revenues. 
The balance of sales in each of the years came from products that could
be considered capital equipment, having useful lives in excess of one year.

The
Company's backlog of firm orders is not considered material to an understanding
of its business.

Orthopaedic Implants

Orthopaedic
Implants are designed and manufactured by Stryker Orthopaedics, Stryker Trauma,
Stryker Spine and Stryker Biotech and consist of such products as hip, knee,
shoulder and spinal implants, associated implant instrumentation,
trauma-related products, bone cement and OP-1 bone growth factor.  Artificial joints are made of cobalt
chromium, titanium alloys, ceramics or ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene
and are implanted in patients whose natural joints have been damaged by
arthritis, osteoporosis, other diseases or injury.  The Company's OP-1 bone
growth factor, which induces the formation of new bone when implanted into
bone, is composed of recombinant human osteogenic protein-1 and a bioresorbable collagen matrix.

Minimally Invasive Surgery

Many
of Stryker's technologically advanced reconstructive implants are suited to
minimally invasive procedures that are intended to reduce soft-tissue damage
and pain while hastening return to function. 
The Company supports surgeons with technology and specialized
instrumentation as they develop new minimally invasive techniques.  During 2003, the Company began the initial
introduction of Scorpio Total Knee Minimally Invasive Instrumentation.  This line of instruments is designed to
complement the unique, minimally invasive total knee procedure pioneered by a
leading orthopaedic surgeon.  This
technique can reduce the length of the incision by approximately 70% and has
been performed in more than 500 procedures. 
Because of the Company's commitment to responsible science, a multicenter study was conducted to validate the technique's
reproducibility and potential benefits, such as reduced pain and earlier return
to function.  In order to facilitate
emerging procedural approaches, the Company is also developing instrumentation
for minimally invasive total hip arthroplasty. 
The Company's surgical navigation systems are frequently used in
minimally invasive procedures to improve the accuracy of measurements and to
position the implant.

Hip Implants

Through
Stryker Orthopaedics, the Company offers a variety of hip systems for the
global reconstructive market.  The ABG
Hip System, Partnership Hip System, Secur-Fit Hip
System, Omnifit Hip System, Accolade Hip System and
Restoration Hip System each represents a comprehensive system of hip implants
and associated instrumentation designed to provide physicians and patients with
reliable results and to reduce operating time for primary and revision
procedures.  The Exeter Total Hip System
is based on a unique, collarless, highly polished, double-tapered femoral
design that reduces shear stresses and increases compression at the cement/bone
interface.  In 2003, the Company began a
limited launch of its CentPillar Hip System in the
Japanese market.  A full rollout of this
product is expected in 2004.  The Taro
Hip System and CentPillar Hip System provide lines of products that offer an
increased range of motion and a minimally invasive technique preferred by
Japanese surgeons for their patients.

On
February 3, 2003, the Company received premarket
approval ("PMA") from the United States Food and Drug Administration
("FDA") for its ceramic-on-ceramic hip replacement, the Trident Ceramic
Acetabular Insert, for patients in the United States.    Stryker
Orthopaedics successfully launched the Trident ceramic insert in the United
States in the second quarter of 2003 following successful launches in Europe,
Australia and Canada in 2002.  Among its features are a wear-resistant
ceramic insert and a titanium sleeve, which protects and strengthens the insert. 
Other technologies used for total hip replacement include conventional
polyethylene-on-

- 4 -

metal and metal-on-metal articulations.  By the end of 2003,
approximately 55% of the Company's acetabular inserts sold in the United States
utilized Crossfire technology, a highly cross-linked polyethylene designed to
reduce wear, and approximately 30% of the inserts utilized the Company's ceramic
insert technology.

In
2002, the Company launched the Trident Acetabular Cup system.  This patented design, which allows for the
use of either polyethylene inserts or ceramic inserts, positioned the Company
well for the launch of its ceramic acetabular products in the United States in
2003.  Trident's two independent locking
mechanisms provide maximum security for each bearing surface and increase the
strength of the ceramic liner.  Also
released in 2002 was the Accolade C-Cemented stem.  This stem compliments the Accolade TMZF cementless stem launched in 2001, which incorporates many
of the same innovative design features for use with cemented stems and also
utilizes the simple and efficient Accolade instrumentation system.

In
2001, the Company introduced the Omnifit Super EON
and Super Secur-Fit hip systems for the Japanese
market.  These systems capitalize on the
Company's long-term clinical history with the OmniFit
type geometry, but are modified to offer increased range of motion for patients
in the Japanese market.  The Company also
released the Accolade Hip system to the global marketplace.  This system incorporates a clinically
successful geometry with a proprietary TMZF titanium alloy, PureFixhydroxylapatite ("HA"), and an innovative neck geometry to maximize range of motion.

In
late 1990, Stryker became the first company to receive clearance from the FDA
to commercially release for sale in the United States a hip implant with HA
surface treatment.  HA is a naturally
occurring calcium phosphate material that demonstrates a high level of
biocompatibility due to its resemblance to human bone.  The Company's global clinical experience with
HA-coated hip stems now extends over 14 years and reported clinical performance
continues to equal or exceed that of comparable hip stems reported in the
scientific literature.

The
Company entered 2004 with more than 30 years of clinical history with the
Exeter Hip System, more than 20 years of clinical history with the Omnifit cemented stem and 14 years of clinical history with
the Omnifit HA stem. 
Long-term clinical results are an important factor in the Company's
ability to market hip implants.

Knee Implants

The
Company offers five major knee systems under the Stryker brand name:  the Duracon, Kinemax, Interax, Global Modular
Replacement System (GMRS) and Scorpio systems. 
Introduced in 1991 and utilized in more than 500,000 procedures
worldwide, the Duracon system combines high levels of
joint conformity throughout the range of motion and consistent anatomic
tracking.  The Duracon
TS and Modular Rotating Hinge, which were introduced in 1999 and 2001,
respectively, completed the Duracon product line
offering with implants for complex revision procedures.

Launched in 2003, the GMRS is a global product that
offers a comprehensive solution for radical bone loss in oncology, trauma and
revision surgery patients.  GMRS has
tibial and femoral components, including a total femur, and a modular rotating
hinge knee.  The system employs both
titanium and cobalt chrome alloys for strength and lightness of weight,
together with the superior flexibility of the hinge.  The MRS system, the predecessor to the GMRS,
was the first modular segmental replacement system and has maintained a
leadership role in this market segment since its introduction.

The Kinemax system is focused in markets outside the United
States and offers versatility through design principles based on the clinically
successful Total Condylar and Kinematic
Knee Systems.  Precision-designed
Monogram instruments provide a common instrument platform for the Duracon, Kinemax and Interax knee systems. The ergonomic engineering of Monogram
instruments facilitates efficient use in the operating room, enabling surgeons
to choose the instruments that represent their optimal surgical technique.

The
Scorpio knee system was designed considering normal motion of the knee based
off of its epicondylar axis.  This patented approach addresses significant
clinical issues, such as improved patient rehabilitation and midflexion stability, through an increase in the
patella-femoral moment arm and a single anterior-posterior radius.  The Scorpio Plus Mobile
Bearing tibial component was launched in markets outside the United States in 2001 and a clinical trial in the United States is underway. 
This addition to the Scorpio line

- 5 -

provides a competitive entry into this
growing market segment.  The ScorpioFlex, which is available for both posterior cruciate-retaining and substituting indications, is
specifically designed for patients who have the ability and motivation to
return to high-flexion activities such as gardening and golfing.  ScorpioFlex has
enjoyed success in Japan, where it is sold under the trade name Scorpio SuperFlex, and is now being sold in the United States.  The Scorpio system is supported by the
Passport instrumentation system, which was designed to provide intraoperative flexibility and precision as well as a
simple, cost-effective approach to total knee replacement surgery.

The
EIUS Uni Knee replacement system, introduced in late 2001, is designed for the
quickly growing minimally invasive knee surgery market segment.  The EIUS Uni Knee has experienced strong
sales following its introduction in 2001. 
This system marries bone-sparing femoral and tibial implants with
sophisticated instrumentation and a surgical technique aimed at reducing
rehabilitation time for patients.

Knee
Navigation 2.0, the next generation of surgical navigation software for total
knee replacement, was introduced in 2003. 
This image-guided system offers high precision and consistency through
unique two-way communication between the computer and the surgical instruments,
giving the patient the most precise fit available.  Knee Navigation 2.0 improves the original
version, launched in 2002, with a quicker setup and even greater precision in
kinematics and alignment.

Other Reconstructive Products

The Company markets other reconstructive products,
principally shoulder and elbow implants and related instruments, under the
Stryker brand name.  The Solar Total
Shoulder System provides a unique design for the humeral head that allows the
surgeon to adjust tension of the supporting tissues while maximizing range of
motion.  The shoulder instruments offer
the surgeon increased visibility and access to this tightly confined joint
space.  The Solar BiPolar
Shoulder provides the surgeon with additional options for addressing arthritis
of the shoulder and is designed with the patented bipolar locking mechanism
that is also used in the Company's hip implants.  The Solar Shoulder product line gives the
surgeon increased intraoperative flexibility to
restore the patient's shoulder kinematics. 
The Solar Total Elbow complements products offered for upper extremity
procedures.  The semiconstrained
design and modular components address varying types of patient anatomy.

Bone Cement

Simplex bone cement, a material used to secure cemented
implants to bone, was first approved for orthopaedic use in the United States
in 1971 and is the most widely used bone cement in the world.  The Company manufactures several variations
of Simplex bone cement to meet specific patient needs.  Simplex has more than 40 years of clinical
history, the longest of any bone cement, with more than 250 published clinical
studies.

In
2003, Stryker received FDA clearance to market Simplex P with Tobramycin, an antibiotic bone
cement.  The new, blended Simplex, which
has been on the market in Europe since 2000, is indicated in the United States
for patients who are undergoing the second stage of a two-stage revision for a
total joint procedure.

Trauma

Through Stryker Trauma, the Company
develops, manufactures and markets its trauma-related products.  Trauma products, including nailing, plating,
hip fracture and external fixation systems, are used primarily in the fixation
of fractures resulting from sudden injury. These products consist of internal
fixation devices marketed under such names as Gamma, Grosse & Kempf, Omega, Dall Miles, Asnis, T2 and S2, along with external fixation devices
marketed under the Apex, Hoffmann II and MonotubeTriax names.

The Company's internal fixation product portfolio includes a full compliment
of intramedullary nails, hip fracture devices and plates and screws in both
titanium and stainless steel. The intramedullary ("IM") nail portfolio is led by
the T2 Nailing System, which was released in 2001.  The T2 system includes
femoral, tibial and humeral components with a common instrument platform for
accuracy and ease of use.  Building on the

- 6 -

success of this titanium nail, the Company introduced the stainless steel S2
tibial and femoral nails in 2003.  The S2 nails are designed to meet the
needs of Level 1 trauma centers in the United States as well as broadening the
Stryker product line in the rest of the world.

To address the hip fracture segment, the
Company markets several products including the Gamma Nail (a unique IM nail for
trochanteric fractures), the Omega hip screw system,
the AsnisCannulated Screw
System and the Hansson pin system. The AsnisCannulated Screw System can
help simplify the operative procedure through features that allow the surgeon
to place, insert and remove locking screws easily. These hip fracture systems
offer orthopaedic surgeons multiple options depending on their preferences and
patient needs. In 2003, there was also an initial release in selected markets
of the Gamma 3 intramedullary hip fracture nail, improved for less invasive
procedures.

The Company's external fixation products
include the Hoffmann II modular fixation system, the MonotubeTriaxmonolateral system,
the Tenxor circular fixation system for complex
fractures and a complete range of pins and wires for attaching the devices to
fractured bones. The Hoffmann II system for lower extremity fractures (pelvis,
femur, tibia) and the smaller Hoffmann II Compact for
upper extremity fractures include a patented snap-fit mechanism that makes it
easy for the surgeon to construct the fixation device to fit the patient and
align the fractured bones.  Both the
Hoffmann II and the Hoffmann II Compact include a full selection of lightweight
radiolucent connection bars that allow for quick intraoperative
fracture repair. The Triax system is available in
three different sizes and includes an adjustable feature that enables the
surgeon to not only stabilize fractures, but to lengthen the bone in cases
where bone has been removed due to damage. 
The Tenxor hybrid frame enables a surgeon to
treat complex fractures around the joints with both pins and long transfixing
wires.  This attribute is especially
useful for patients with multipart fractures near the ankle and knee.  The system features advanced composite materials
and is compatible with the Hoffman II snap-fit connection devices.

Spinal Implants

Through
Stryker Spine, the Company develops, manufactures and markets spinal implant
products including cervical, thoracolumbar and interbody systems used in spine injury, deformity and
degenerative therapies.  Spinal implant
products comprise plates, rods, screws, connectors, spacers, cages and
proprietary instrument and container systems. 
In 2003, Stryker extended the Xia Spinal System by adding a new,
low-profile hook system and additional components for anterior fixation.  In addition, Stryker introduced Oasys, a new posterior fixation system developed to serve
an emerging area of spine fusion surgery, in the European market during 2003.

In
2002, the Company acquired SDI, adding the Ray Threaded Fusion Cage interbody system and the SR90 thoracolumbar
system to the global product portfolio. 
Also in 2002, Stryker introduced enhanced versions of the Xia titanium
system, Reflex system and Diapason system along with the new Bonecraft system which is designed to aid surgeons in
shaping and cutting allograft bone.

In
2001, Stryker launched the Reflex, the Xia stainless steel and the Stabilis systems. 
The Reflex system was a new entry in the anterior cervical plating
segment.   The Xia stainless steel
system, a new offering within the Xia Spinal System, was designed to better
serve deformity correction requirements. 
The Xia Spinal System is a posterior system designed to relieve pain by
stabilizing the spine in the thoracic, lumbar and sacral regions.  It is accompanied by instrumentation that
simplifies the surgical procedures. 
Launched in international markets, the Stabilis
system is a novel interbody fusion device designed to
improve stability and alignment during fusion.

OP-1

Two decades ago, Stryker saw the potential that biologic
products held for orthopaedics in an aging world and began a long-term
investment in OP-1, a proprietary, recombinant version of the bone growth
factor osteogenic protein-1.  In 1991,
the Company received FDA approval to begin human clinical trials of OP-1, which
was developed in collaboration with Creative BioMolecules,
Inc. (a company that subsequently merged into Curis,
Inc.), as part of a long-term research program funded by Stryker.  The OP-1 device is composed of recombinant
human OP-1 and a bioresorbable collagen matrix.  OP-1 is naturally present in the human body
and directs a cascade of cellular events that result in bone growth.  In preclinical studies, OP-1 induced the formation

- 7 -

of new bone when implanted into bony defect sites.  The initial human clinical study, which began
in 1992, compared the efficacy of OP-1 with autograft (the current standard
bone graft procedure for the treatment of tibial nonunion fractures, which uses
bone chips removed from a patient's hip in a second operation) in the repair of
nonunion fractures of the tibia.  In
1995, the FDA allowed the Company to enlarge the scope of the clinical trials
for expanded indications of nonunion fractures in all long bones.  The study demonstrated that OP-1 patients had
outcomes of comparable clinical success to those of the autograft
patients.  This eliminated the need for a
second invasive procedure to harvest autograft from the hip.  There were three prospectively determined
clinical trial outcomes defined in the study: 
weight bearing, level of pain with weight bearing and radiographic
assessment of cortical and/or trabecular
bridging.  The study design predicted 80%
success at nine months postsurgery.  Both the OP-1 and autograft groups met this
prediction for the clinical outcomes of weight bearing and pain, and both
groups had comparable results.  The
blinded radiographic assessment by an independent panel of radiologists showed
that neither group achieved the 80% criteria for bridging, although bridging
was higher for the autograft group.

The PMA application for OP-1 was filed and accepted by
the FDA in June 1999. The Company received a "Not Approvable" letter
from the FDA on January 29, 2001 that cited the failure of the pivotal clinical
trial to meet the study endpoint of noninferiority of
OP-1 compared with the autograft control on a combined clinical and
radiographic basis.  In 2001, Stryker
filed an application for a Humanitarian Device Exemption ("HDE") from
the FDA.  The FDA granted this approval
in October 2001.  This approval in the
United States is for the use of OP-1 as an alternative to autograft in
recalcitrant long-bone nonunions where use of autograft is unfeasible and
alternative treatments have failed.  Under
the HDE, OP-1 was made available as a humanitarian device, defined by the FDA
as one intended to benefit patients by treating or diagnosing a disease or
condition that affects fewer than 4,000 individuals per year in the United
States.  As of
December 31,
 2003, more than 500 hospitals
have received Institutional Review Board ("IRB") approval to implant
OP-1 in the United
  States
under the HDE.

The
Company also filed a Marketing Authorization Application ("MAA") with
the European Medicines Evaluation Agency ("EMEA") for certain OP-1
uses, and the MAA was accepted for filing in July 1999.  On December 14, 2000, the Committee for
Proprietary Medicinal Products ("CPMP") in Europe voted unanimously
to recommend market authorization for OP-1 for the indication of nonunions of
the tibia that failed prior autograft treatment or when autograft is not
feasible.  Final European approval was
obtained in May 2001 for this indication. 
A New Drug Application with the Therapeutic Goods Administration
("TGA") in Australia was filed in December 1999, and in February 2001
the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee ("ADEC") adopted a positive
opinion to recommend the granting of marketing authorization for OP-1 for
treatment of long-bone nonunions secondary to trauma for the purpose of
initiating new bone formation.  Approval
from the TGA was received in April 2001. In February 2002, the Company received
approval to market OP-1 in Canada for the clinical indication of long-bone
nonunions.

With
these global approvals, the first of their kind, the Company began to market
OP-1.  In 2002 and 2003, the increase in
the number of patients treated demonstrated the success of its sales effort and
the trust that surgeons have developed in the product based on favorable
patient outcomes.  In the United States, demand increased significantly during each quarter
of 2003.

Stryker
is committed to the further development of OP-1 for spinal indications,
including spinal stenosis.  This degenerative condition, which is
widespread in the over-65 population, causes severe pain in the lower back and
legs as a result of abnormal movement in the lower spine.  Spinal fusion is used to stabilize the spine
and reduce stenosis pain.  Fusing the spine with OP-1 can eliminate the
need for a preliminary surgery to take bone from the patient's hip to use in
the fusion process.

Currently,
the Company is conducting a multicenter pivotal trial
in the United States and Canada for posterolateral
spine fusion using a new product, OP-1 Putty, to treat degenerative spondylolisthesis. 
In 2003, the Company completed enrollment in this trial.  The Company currently anticipates that the
follow-up on the 297 enrolled patients will be completed in 2005.  In Japan, the Company completed enrollment in
a 32-patient Phase II trial for a similar indication, using OP-1 in conjunction
with rods and screws to fuse the spine.

In
October 2002, the Company entered into an agreement with Curis,
Inc., which eliminated all royalties payable to Curis
relating to future Stryker sales of OP-1. Under the terms of the agreement, the
Company made a

- 8 -

one-time cash payment of $14.0 million to Curis.  Stryker owns the patents on its osteogenic
protein technology and has exclusive worldwide rights under those patents to develop, market and sell OP-1 for treatment, repair or
replacement of bone and joint tissue.

The
Company has a royalty-free cross-license agreement with Genetics Institute,
Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Wyeth, which holds
patents covering a molecule different from OP-1 that may produce similar
effects.   The agreement enables Stryker
to commercialize OP-1 unencumbered by patent litigation with this
competitor.  Others also are attempting
to develop osteogenic proteins and bioresorbable
carriers for the treatment, repair or replacement of bone and joint
tissue.  These other companies have filed
and obtained patents in the United States and elsewhere claiming such compounds
and methods of making them and using them and may in the future file and obtain
other such patents.  The Company can
provide no assurance that it will not need a license under one or more of those
patents to further expand the OP-1 program or whether such licenses will be
available.

MedSurg Equipment

MedSurg
Equipment products include powered surgical instruments, endoscopic products,
hospital beds and stretchers and micro implant and surgical navigation
systems.  These products are designed and
manufactured by Stryker Instruments, Stryker Endoscopy, Stryker Leibinger Micro
Implants and Stryker Medical.

The
Stryker Instruments, Stryker Endoscopy and Stryker Leibinger Micro Implants
product portfolios include micropowered tools and
instruments that are used in orthopaedics, craniomaxillofacial surgery,
functional endoscopic sinus surgery, neurosurgery, spinal surgery and plastic
surgery. The Total Performance System ("TPS"), released in 1996, is a
universal surgical system that can be utilized within several medical
specialties. The TPS U2 Drill, introduced in 2000, and TPS Burs are designed
for use by spine surgeons and neurosurgeons, while the TPS MicroDriver
and TPS Sagittal Saw are designed for use by sports
physicians and plastic surgeons.  The
Elite attachment line with a proprietary extendable bar system and Saber Drill
for ear, nose and throat ("ENT") surgery were added in 2001 to
further extend the TPS system in spine, neurosurgery and ENT applications. The
TPS System also powers the Stryker Endoscopy SE5 and 12K Shaver Systems. The
Stryker Leibinger Micro Implants Hummer TPS is a powered instrument that
incorporates new irrigation capabilities and specialized cutters, eliminating
the need for over half of the instruments otherwise required for sinus surgery.

Powered Surgical Instruments and Surgical Navigation
Systems

Stryker
Instruments provides powered surgical instruments, operating room equipment,
interventional pain products and surgical navigation systems.  Products include a broad line of powered
surgical instruments that are used by surgeons for drilling, burring, rasping
or cutting bone; wiring or pinning bone fractures; and preparing hip or knee
surfaces for the placement of artificial implants. Stryker Instruments also
manufactures an array of different attachments and cutting accessories for use
by orthopaedic, neurological and small-bone specialists.  In 2003, Stryker
launched the
CORE platform of micro powered surgical instruments in the U.S. market.  This platform includes specialty-driven handpieces, including those for spine and neurosurgery
procedures, providing increased power and torque, greater speed and precision
cutting.  The CORE platform is a
technological advancement on the precision and versatility offered by the TPS
platform.

In
2002, the Company launched System 5, its fifth generation product
offering of its flagship heavy-duty, battery-powered surgical instruments. This
line provides enhanced cutting speed and torque as well as versatility in an
ergonomic handpiece system.  Applications for this line include total
joint, trauma and sports medicine procedures.

Stryker
Instruments also produces products that are utilized in conjunction with joint
replacement surgery.  The Advanced Cement
Mixing System, used to mix bone cement, greatly reduces the risk that air
bubbles will weaken the long-term bond between the implant and surrounding
bone.  Interpulse
is a disposable, self-contained pulsed lavage system
that is used by physicians to cleanse the surgical site during total joint
arthroplasty. The ConstaVac CBC II Blood Conservation
System is a postoperative wound drainage and blood reinfusion device that
enables joint replacement patients to receive their own blood rather than donor
blood.

In
2002, the Company introduced the PainPump2, a disposable system that offers
electronically controlled flow rates of pain medication directly to the
surgical site to help manage a patient's postoperative discomfort. This
innovative design allows the physician to program the pump and provides a
patient-controlled analgesia ("PCA") option, previously unavailable
to the market in a disposable pump.  In
2003, Stryker made product improvements to the PainPump2, allowing the pump to
be programmed to extend continuous peripheral nerve blockage during surgery and
provide non-narcotic pain management following the procedure.

In
2002, Stryker acquired the DEKOMPRESSOR
product line from Pain Concepts Inc. The DEKOMPRESSOR is a single-use
disposable device indicated for the percutaneous removal of disc nucleus
material, offering an early, less invasive approach to mitigating back and leg
pain associated with contained lumbar herniations.  This important advance in lumbar disc pain
management, along with Stryker's offerings in Percutaneous Cement Delivery and
Radiofrequency Denervation, allows Stryker to focus
on the Interventional Pain Management marketplace.

As
part of a broad surgical product portfolio, Stryker works closely with
hospitals and other health-care organizations to promote safety for patients
and medical staff.  The Neptune Waste
Management System represents Stryker's leading product for fluid waste
management in the operating room.  The
self-contained device, first introduced in 2000 and consistently improved,
collects and disposes of fluid and smoke waste from surgical procedures,
minimizing the need for operator intervention and therefore the risk of
exposure.  Stryker also markets the Steri-Shield Personal Protection System, combining a
helmet, hood and gown to help provide protection for operating room personnel
from infection, cross-contamination and harmful micro-organisms.

In
2002, the Company introduced its new surgical navigation software module for
fluoroscopic image-guided surgery.  This
software, designed for the Stryker Navigation System, allows surgeons to employ
image-guided surgery in conjunction with intraoperative
fluoroscopic images.  Stryker also
introduced new image-guided surgery software modules and instrument sets for
knee replacement, ENT and spine surgeries in 2001.  All three modules utilize Stryker's active
wireless technology, which allows the surgeon to use the surgical instrument as
a computer mouse in controlling the system.

Endoscopic Products

Stryker Endoscopy produces and markets medical video-imaging and
communications equipment and instruments for arthroscopy and general
surgery.  Stryker Endoscopy has
established a position of leadership in the production of medical video
technology and accessories for minimally invasive surgery, as well as
communications equipment to provide local or worldwide interconnectivity.  Products include medical video cameras,
digital documentation equipment, arthroscopes, laparoscopes, powered surgical
instruments, sports medicine instrumentation and implants, radio frequency
ablation systems, irrigation fluid management systems, Endosuite
operating room solutions and state-of-the-art equipment for telemedicine and
enterprise-wide connectivity.

In
2003, Stryker extended its market leading 988 Digital 3-Chip camera by
introducing a fully autoclavable model for more efficient sterilization.  The 3-Chip cameras continue to provide multispecialty video imaging through several product
generations.  In addition, the Company
introduced the Stryker Integrated Delivery Network, a voice-activated operating
room network in 2003.  Also in 2003,
Stryker signed an exclusive license and distribution services agreement with a
third party to provide distribution services for certain allograft products in
the United States.  Allografts
are used in numerous sports medicine procedures including the repair of
anterior cruciate ligaments.

In
2002, Stryker continued its leading market share position with the Endosuite Operating Room. 
An enhancement that changed the way minimally invasive surgery is
documented is the Stryker Digital Capture ("SDC") Pro 2 surgical DVD
documentation system, which was developed to store high quality digital images
to a DVD drive and distribute images on an existing hospital network.  In 2002, the Company advanced its position in
sports medicine by launching several anterior cruciate
ligament fixation devices along with a 3-millimeter glenoid
humeral anchor for use in repairing rotator cuff injuries in the shoulder.

- 10 -

In
2001, Stryker launched the 988 Digital 3-Chip Camera, which is the first
digital output video camera in the medical industry.

Stryker's
line of rigid scopes ranges in diameter from 2.3 millimeters to 10 millimeters,
containing a series of precision lenses as well as fiber optics that allow the
physician to view internal anatomy with a high degree of clarity.

Micro Implant Systems

Stryker
Leibinger Micro Implants manufactures plating systems and related products for
craniomaxillofacial and hand surgery.  In
2003, the Company extended the Universal Fixation System for
craniomaxillofacial surgery with the launch of the Midface
System.  The Company anticipates an
addition of a cranial/neurological system in early 2004.  Also in 2003, BoneSource
Classic was introduced, representing an advance in Stryker's BoneSource line of products to include HA, a naturally
occurring calcium phosphate material that demonstrates a high level of
biocompatibility due to its resemblance to human bone.

In
2002, the Company launched the Universal Mandible Plating System. This
innovative system accommodates all mandibular
fracture and reconstruction needs in one small, simple and easy-to-use
system.  The Profyle
Modular Hand Plating System, launched in 2002, features simple instrumentation,
low-profile implants and a wide variety of screw diameters and plate
configurations.

In
2001, the Company launched two new fixation systems for neurosurgery, the Quikdisk and the Neuroclip.  These innovative systems provide stable
fixation following cranial surgery with less surgical time than conventional
screws and plates.

Hospital Beds and Stretchers

Stryker
Medical is a leader in the specialty stretcher products segment, offering more
than 30 different types of stretchers customized to fit the needs of acute care
and specialty surgical care facilities. 
Stryker also produces beds that are designed to fit the unique needs of
specialty departments within the acute care environment.  New in 2003, the motorized, self-propelled
Zoom stretcher completes the application of this innovative technology across
critical care beds, medical-surgical beds and stretchers.  Coupled with Stryker's Big Wheel technology
for maneuverability, Zoom technology produces patient-handling equipment that
provides a safe and comfortable surface for patients while reducing the risk of
back injury for staff.

New
in 2002, the Go Bed + medical/surgical beds feature low bed-height for safe
patient ingress and exit.  The Go Bed +
also offers the optional Chaperone center-of-gravity bed-exit system with Zone
Control to help prevent patient falls. 
Zone Control is a feature that enables the caregiver to adjust the
sensitivity of the bed-exit system to accommodate different patient needs.
Stryker has a complete line of ICU beds for critical care and step-down
units.  The beds incorporate advanced
features that facilitate patient care, such as in-bed scales that accurately
weigh the patient regardless of bed position and a radiolucent surface that
facilitates chest x-rays without moving the patient from the bed.  Stryker also offers a continuum of mattresses
as an option with its frames.   The
Company's legacy of innovation in the prehospital
market continued in 2002 with the launch of the third-generation MX-Pro R3
ambulance cot for use in the emergency medical services market.  To facilitate patient transport up and down
stairs, Stryker also introduced the StairPro series
of stair chairs in 2002.

New in 2001 were the Secure II and Go Bed medical/surgical beds, which both
feature low bed-height for safe patient ingress and exit.  The Secure II
also offers the optional Chaperone center-of-gravity bed-exit system with Zone
Control to help prevent patient falls.  In 2001, Stryker strengthened its
reputation for durability and innovation by introducing Trio, the first truly
mobile surgery table; Trio can be used preoperatively, during the procedure and
for postoperative recovery.  Introduced in 2001, the Cub pediatric crib is
Stryker's most recent product entry in the pediatric segment.  Cub's access
and safety features are unparalleled in this segment.  The M-1 ambulance
cot, introduced in 2001, is the Company's most advanced cot for the
international market.

Other
includes Physical Therapy Services. 
Physiotherapy Associates provides physical, occupational and speech
therapy services to patients recovering from orthopaedic or neurological illness
and injury through a network of 374 outpatient physical therapy centers in 25
states and the District of Columbia. 
Physiotherapy Associates works closely with referring physicians to
design and execute rehabilitation protocols with the goal of quick recoveries
for injured workers, athletes and other patients.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

Most
of the Company's products and product improvements have been developed
internally.  The Company maintains close
working relationships with physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and
universities who assist in product research and development.  New and improved products play a critical
role in the Company's sales growth.  The
Company continues to place emphasis on the development of proprietary products
and product improvements to complement and expand its existing product
lines.  The Company has a decentralized
research and development focus, with manufacturing locations responsible for
new product development and product improvements.  Research, development and engineering
functions at the manufacturing locations maintain relationships with
distribution locations and customers to understand changes in the market and
product needs.

Total
expenditures for product research, development and engineering were $180.2
million in 2003, $141.4 million in 2002 and $142.1 million in 2001.  Research, development and engineering
expenses represented 5.0% of sales in 2003, compared with 4.7% in 2002 and 5.5%
in 2001.  Research, development and
engineering spending was affected in 2002 by the
commercial launch of the OP-1 product, which occurred in various markets in the
second and fourth quarters of 2001. 
Following the launch, in 2002 Stryker Biotech recorded a greater
proportion of its expenses as cost of sales and selling, general and
administrative expenses, compared with 2001 when this division classified
substantially all of its costs as research, development and engineering.
Increased spending from the Company's continued focus on new product
development partially offset the decreased research, development and
engineering expenses related to Stryker Biotech.  Recent new product introductions in the
Orthopaedic Implant and MedSurg segments are more fully described under the
caption "

the United States, most of the Company's products are marketed directly to more
than 6,000 hospitals and to other health-care facilities and doctors by
approximately 2,100 sales and marketing personnel.  Stryker primarily maintains separate and
dedicated sales forces for each of its principal product lines to provide focus
and a high level of expertise to each medical specialty served.

International
sales accounted for 36% of total revenues in 2003.  The Company's products are sold in more than
100 countries through more than 1,900 local dealers and direct sales
efforts.  Local dealer support and direct
sales are coordinated by approximately 1,900 sales and marketing
personnel.  Stryker distributes its

COMPETITION

The
Company is one of four leading competitors in the United States for orthopaedic
reconstructive products.  The three other
leading competitors are DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (a
subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson), Zimmer Holdings, Inc., and Biomet, Inc. While competition abroad varies from area to
area, the Company believes it is also a leading player in the international
markets with these same companies as its principal competitors.

In the trauma implant segment, Stryker is one of five
leaders competing principally with Synthes-Stratec,
Smith & Nephew Orthopaedics (a division of Smith & Nephew plc), Zimmer
Holdings, Inc., and DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc.

In
the spinal implant segment, the Company is one of four leaders, including the
principal competitors Medtronic SofamorDanek, Inc. (a subsidiary of Medtronic, Inc.), DePuyAcroMed, Inc. (a subsidiary
of Johnson & Johnson), and Synthes-Stratec.

The
Company believes that several companies are engaged in the research and
development of morphogenic proteins for the repair of
hard and soft tissues that would compete with the Company's OP-1 product.  Wyeth has completed
human clinical trials of a recombinant bone morphogenetic protein
("rhBMP-2") for repair of orthopaedic and other skeletal defects and
has awarded certain distribution rights to Medtronic SofamorDanek for rhBMP-2 in the United States and
Europe.  A number of companies currently
provide various other therapies, including allografts,
bone fillers and electrical stimulation devices for the treatment, repair or
replacement of bone and joint tissue. 
The Company believes that its OP-1 product, which is approved for
limited trauma indications in certain markets and is currently in clinical
trials for other indications, would ultimately compete with these products and
with traditional therapies, such as autograft.

In
the powered surgical instruments segment, Stryker is one of three leaders,
together with the principal domestic competitors Medtronic Midas Rex, Inc. (a
subsidiary of Medtronic, Inc.), and Linvatec, Inc. (a
subsidiary of CONMED
Corporation).  These companies are also
competitors in the international segments, along with Aesculap-Werke
AG (a division of B. Braun Melsungen AG), a large
European manufacturer.

In
the arthroscopy segment, the Company is one of four leaders, together with the
principal competitors Smith & Nephew Endoscopy (a division of Smith &
Nephew plc), Linvatec, Inc., and Arthrex,
Inc.  In the laparoscopic imaging
products segment, the Company is one of four leaders, together with the
principal competitors Karl Storz GmbH & Co. (a
German company), ACMI Corporation and Olympus Optical Co. Ltd. (a Japanese
company).

In
the craniomaxillofacial segment, Stryker is one of four leaders, together with
the principal competitors Synthes-Stratec, Walter
Lorenz Surgical, Inc. (a subsidiary of Biomet, Inc.),
and KLS Martin L.P.

In the surgical navigation segment, Stryker is one of
five principal competitors including Medtronic Surgical Navigation Technologies
(a division of Medtronic, Inc.), BrainLAB Inc. (a
subsidiary of BrainLAB AG), AESCULAP AG & Co. KG (a
division of B. Braun Melsungen AG), Radionics, Inc. (a subsidiary of Tyco International Ltd.),
and GE Medical Systems Navigation and Visualization, Inc. (a subsidiary of
General Electric Company).

The
Company's primary competitor in the patient-handling segment is Hill-Rom
Company, Inc. (a division of Hillenbrand Industries, Inc.).  In the specialty stretcher segment, the
primary competitors are Hausted, Inc. (a subsidiary
of STERIS Corporation), Hill-Rom Company, Inc.,
and Midmark Hospital Products Group (a subsidiary of
Ohio Medical Instrument Company, Inc.). 
In the ambulance cot segment, Ferno-Washington,
Inc. is the Company's principal competitor.

In
the United States outpatient physical and occupational rehabilitation segment,
the Company's primary competitors are independent therapist-owned practices and
hospital-based services, in addition to other national

- 13 -

rehabilitation
companies, including HEALTHSOUTH
Corporation and NovaCare Rehabilitation (a division of Select Medical
Corporation).

The principal factors that the Company believes
differentiate it in these highly competitive market segments and enable it to
compete effectively are innovation, reliability, service and reputation.  The Company is not able to predict the effect
that continuing efforts to reduce health-care expenses generally and hospital
costs in particular will have on the future sales of its products or its
competitive position.  (See
"

Regulation and Product Quality

.")  The Company believes that its competitive
position in the future will depend to a large degree on its ability to develop
new products and make improvements in existing products.  While the Company does not consider patents a
major factor in its overall competitive success, patents and trademarks are
significant to the extent that a product or attribute of a product represents a
unique design or process.  Patent or
trademark protection of such products restricts competitors from duplicating
these unique designs and features. 
Stryker seeks to obtain patent protection on its products whenever
possible.  The Company currently has
approximately 840 United States patents and 1,240 international patents.

MANUFACTURING AND SOURCES OF
SUPPLY

The
Company's manufacturing processes consist primarily of precision machining,
metal fabrication and assembly operations; the forging and investment casting
of cobalt chrome; and the finishing of cobalt chrome and titanium.  In addition, the Company is the sole manufacturer
of its OP-1 product.  Approximately 11%
of the Company's cost of sales in 2003 represented finished products that were
purchased complete from outside suppliers. 
The Company also purchases parts and components, such as forgings,
castings, gears, bearings, casters and electrical components, and uses outside
sources for certain finishing operations, such as plating, hardening and
coating of machined components and sterilization of certain products.  The principal raw materials used by the
Company are stainless steel, aluminum, cobalt chrome and titanium alloys.  In all, purchased parts and components from
outside sources were approximately 33% of the total cost of sales in 2003.

While
the Company relies on single sources for certain purchased materials and
services, it believes alternate sources are available if needed.  The Company has not experienced any
significant difficulty in the past in obtaining the materials necessary to meet
its production schedules.

Substantially
all products manufactured by the Company are stocked in inventory, while
certain products manufactured within the Company's MedSurg segment are
assembled to order.

REGULATION AND PRODUCT
QUALITY

The
Medical Device Amendments of 1976 to the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act;
the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990; and regulations issued or proposed thereunder provide for regulation by the FDA of the design,
manufacture and marketing of medical devices, including most of the Company's
products.

The
FDA's Quality System regulations set forth standards for the Company's product
design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records
and provide for inspections of the Company's facilities by the FDA.  There are also certain requirements of state,
local and foreign governments that must be complied with in the manufacturing
and marketing of the Company's products. 
The Company believes that the manufacturing and quality control
procedures it employs meet the requirements of these regulations.

Most
of the Company's new products fall into FDA classifications that require
notification of and review by the FDA before marketing, submitted as a 510(k).
The Company's OP-1 product requires extensive clinical testing, consisting of
safety and efficacy studies, followed by a PMA application for a specific
surgical indication.

Stryker also is subject to the laws that govern the
manufacture and distribution of medical devices of each country in which the
Company manufactures or sells products. 
The member states of the European Union ("EU") have adopted
the European Medical Device Directives, which create a single set of medical
device regulations for all EU member countries. 
These regulations require companies that wish to manufacture and
distribute medical devices in EU member countries to obtain Community European
("CE") marks for their products.  Stryker has authorization to apply the CE
mark to its hip, knee, upper extremity, spinal implant and trauma products, and
to

- 14 -

its Endoscopy, Instruments, Leibinger Micro Implants and Medical division
products.  The Company's OP-1 product has been considered a drug under the
regulations for Europe, Australia and Japan.

The
Company's Physiotherapy Associates, Inc. subsidiary is subject to various
federal and state regulations regarding the provision of physical therapy
services.  The primary entities
administering these regulations are the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
Services, CHAMPUS, state workers compensation agencies, state insurance
commissioners and state licensing agencies.

Government
agencies, legislative bodies and private-sector initiatives to limit the growth
of health-care costs, including price regulation and competitive pricing, are
continuing in markets where the Company does business.  It is impossible to predict at this time the
long-term impact of such cost-containment measures on the Company's future
business.

EMPLOYEES

At
December 31, 2003, the Company had 14,762 employees worldwide, including 5,355
involved in manufacturing, warehousing and distribution operations; 3,991 in
marketing and sales; 848 in research, development and engineering; 3,115

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Executive Level Overview

Stryker
Corporation (the "Company" or "Stryker") is a leader in the
worldwide orthopaedic market and is one of the world's largest medical device
companies.  Stryker delivers results
through a wide range of capabilities including joint replacements, trauma,
spine and micro implant systems, orthobiologics,
powered surgical instruments, surgical navigation systems and endoscopic
products as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment.  Stryker also provides outpatient physical
therapy services in the United States.

The
Company segregates its operations into two reportable business segments:
Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. 
The Orthopaedic Implants segment sells orthopaedic reconstructive (hip,
knee and shoulder), trauma and spinal implants, bone cement and the bone growth
factor osteogenic protein-1 (OP-1).  The
MedSurg Equipment segment sells powered surgical instruments, endoscopic products,
hospital beds and stretchers and micro implant and surgical navigation
systems.  Other includes Physical Therapy
Services and corporate administration, interest expense and interest
income.

Domestic
sales accounted for 64% of total revenues in 2003.  Most of the Company's products are marketed
directly to more than 6,000 hospitals and to doctors and other health-care
facilities by approximately 2,100 sales and marketing personnel in the United
States.  Stryker primarily maintains
separate and dedicated sales forces for each of its principal product lines to
provide focus and a high level of expertise to each medical specialty served.

International
sales accounted for 36% of total revenues in 2003.  The Company's products are sold in more than
100 countries through more than 1,900 local dealers and direct sales
efforts.  Local dealer support and direct
sales are coordinated by approximately 1,900 sales and marketing
personnel.  Stryker distributes its
products through sales subsidiaries and branches with offices located in
Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Denmark,
Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Korea,
Mexico, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania,
Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan and the United
Kingdom.  Stryker exports products to
dealers and to customers in Africa, Bangladesh, China, the CIS (former Soviet
Union), Cyprus, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Korea, Latin America, Malaysia, the
Middle East, Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Vietnam and Yugoslavia.

Outlook for 2004

The
Company's outlook for 2004 continues to be very optimistic regarding the
markets it participates in and the underlying growth rates in orthopaedic
procedures.  The Company expects diluted
net earnings per share for 2004 to approximate $2.68.  The financial expectations for 2004 include
net sales growth of approximately 16% as a result of strong growth in shipments
of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment, favorable foreign currency
exchange rate movements and higher revenue from Physical Therapy Services.  If foreign currency exchange rates hold at
January 27, 2004 levels, the Company anticipates a favorable impact on net
sales in the first quarter and full year of 2004 of approximately $45 million
and $145 million, respectively.

As
the Company pays down outstanding borrowings under its Unsecured Credit
Facilities and reduces the $150.0 million outstanding under its accounts
receivable securitization facility, the Company expects to generate cash
earnings in excess of its needs to fund future working capital requirements.   The Company anticipates investing in future
business growth, including business and product line acquisitions to supplement
its current product offerings, instrumentation in support of new product
launches and future building expansions, including manufacturing facility expansions
for certain divisions within its MedSurg segment.

Results of Operations

The table below outlines the components of the
consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of net sales and the
year-to-year percentage change in dollar amounts:

- 19 -

The
table below sets forth domestic/international and product line sales
information:

2003 Compared with 2002

Stryker Corporation's net sales
increased 20% in 2003 to $3,625.3 million from $3,011.6 million in
2002.  Net sales grew by 12% as a result
of increased unit volume and changes in product mix; 2% related to higher
selling prices; 5% due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates; and 1% as
a result of acquired businesses.

Domestic sales were $2,333.4 million for 2003,
representing an increase of 18% as a result of strong shipments of Orthopaedic
Implants and MedSurg Equipment and higher revenue from Physical Therapy
Services.  International sales were
$1,291.9 million for 2003, representing an increase of 24% as a result of
higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  The impact of foreign currency comparisons to
the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $145.9 million for
2003.  Excluding the impact of foreign
currency, international sales increased 10% in 2003.

Worldwide
sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $2,093.0 million for 2003, representing an
increase of 23% as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive, trauma and
spinal implants.  Excluding the impact of
foreign currency, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 16% for the
year.  Worldwide sales of MedSurg
Equipment were $1,309.3 million for 2003, representing an increase of 18% as a
result of higher shipments of powered surgical instruments, endoscopic
products, hospital beds and stretchers and micro implant and surgical
navigation systems. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of MedSurg
Equipment increased 15% for the year. 
Physical Therapy Services revenues were $223.0 million for 2003,
representing an increase of 11% as a result of new physical therapy centers and
higher revenues from existing centers.

Cost of sales represented
36.2% of sales compared with 36.9% in 2002. 
The lower cost of sales percentage in 2003 is due to the faster sales
growth in the higher margin Orthopaedic Implants business and an increase in
the absorption of fixed manufacturing costs caused by increased production at
certain of the Company's manufacturing plants to meet current demand.

Research, development and
engineering expenses represented 5.0% of sales in 2003 compared to 4.7% in
2002.  The higher spending level is the
result of final development spending in advance of the Company's product
launches in 2003 and continued focus on new product development for anticipated
future product launches.  New product
introductions in 2003 included the Trident Ceramic Acetabular System, Simplex P
with Tobramycin Bone Cement and the CORE platform of
micro powered surgical instruments in the United States market and the System 5
heavy-duty, battery-powered surgical instruments in Europe.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 22% in 2003 and
represented 39.1% of sales compared with 38.7% in 2002.  The 22% increase
in selling, general and administrative expenses is partially due to an increase
in sales commission expense as a result of the 20% increase in net sales in
2003.  In addition, the Company incurred a $14.0 million increase in
insurance costs during 2003 resulting from increased premiums

- 20 -

charged by third-party insurers and a wholly owned captive insurance company
established in 2003 as more fully described in Other Matters.  The increase
in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in 2003
is primarily due to higher distribution costs associated with the increased
sales mix of Orthopaedic Implants, increased amortization of loaner instrument
sets, the increase in insurance costs and higher advertising costs associated
with the Company's previously announced patient education campaign.

The Company recognized charges of $17.2 million ($11.5
million net of income taxes) related to restructuring and acquisition-related
items in the third quarter of 2002.  The
2002 restructuring and acquisition-related items included a charge of $21.0
million ($14.1 million net of income taxes) for employment-related costs to
close the Company's Rutherford, New Jersey, manufacturing facility, partially
offset by a credit of $3.8 million ($2.6 million net of income taxes) to
reverse certain Howmedica acquisition-related costs to reflect actual final
payments required.  See the following
comparison of 2002 results to 2001 results for additional information.

Interest expense declined to $22.6
million in 2003 from $40.3 million in 2002, primarily as a result of lower
outstanding debt balances.  The increase
in intangibles amortization to $45.4 million in 2003 from $28.9 million in 2002
is primarily the result of the increased intangible assets recorded as a result
of the July 1, 2002 acquisition of the Surgical Dynamics Inc. spinal implant
business (SDI) from Tyco International Ltd. as more fully described in Other
Matters.  In addition, the Company
recorded a $6.5 million charge related to a trademark impairment resulting from
a branding initiative adopted by the Company in the fourth quarter of
2003.  The branding initiative is
intended to improve the Company's customers' and other stakeholders' overall
awareness of Stryker's capabilities.  The
charge is included in intangibles amortization in the consolidated statements of
earnings.  Other income was $3.8 million
in 2003, compared with $0.5 million of other expense in 2002 due to foreign
currency transaction gains in the current year compared to losses in the prior
year and higher interest income.

The effective income tax rate was
30.5% in 2003 compared with 31.8% in 2002. 
The Company's effective income tax rate for 2003 was reduced primarily
as a result of increased manufacturing in lower tax jurisdictions such as
Ireland and Puerto Rico.

Net earnings increased 31% to $453.5
million from $345.6 million in 2002; basic net earnings per share increased 30%
to $2.28 in 2003 from $1.75 in 2002; and diluted net earnings per share
increased 31% to $2.23 in 2003 from $1.70 in 2002.

Excluding the impact of the
restructuring and acquisition-related items for the year ended December 31,
2002 adjusted net earnings increased 27% from $357.1 million in 2002 to $453.5
million in 2003.  Adjusted basic net
earnings per share increased 26% from $1.81 in 2002 to $2.28 in 2003.  Adjusted diluted net earnings per share
increased 27% from $1.75 in 2002 to $2.23 in 2003.

These
adjusted non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of the
Company's GAAP financial results.  The
Company has provided this supplemental non-GAAP information because it provides
meaningful information regarding the Company's results on a consistent and
comparable basis for the periods presented. 
Management uses this non-GAAP financial information for reviewing the
operating results of its business segments and for analyzing potential future
business trends in connection with its budget process.  In addition, the Company believes investors
utilize this information to evaluate period-to-period results and to understand
potential future operating results.  The
Company believes that the economic nature of the restructuring charge and the
acquisition-related credit are sufficiently unique that similar items have not
been recorded in the prior two fiscal years nor are they reasonably likely to
recur within two years.  In addition, the
Company reasonably believes that it is probable that the financial impact of
each of these individual items will become insignificant by the end of
2004.  The Company encourages investors
and other users of these financial statements to review its Consolidated
Financial Statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and to
not rely solely on any single financial measure.  The reconciliations of these non-GAAP
financial measures are as follows (in millions):

2002 Compared with 2001

Stryker Corporation's net sales
increased 16% in 2002 to $3,011.6 million from $2,602.3 million in
2001.  Net sales grew by 11% as a result
of increased unit volume and changes in product mix; 3% related to higher
selling prices; and 2% as a result of acquired businesses.

Domestic sales were $1,973.7 million for 2002,
representing an increase of 17% as a result of strong shipments of Orthopaedic
Implants and MedSurg Equipment and higher revenue from Physical Therapy
Services.  The July 1, 2002, acquisition
of SDI added $22.8 million to domestic sales for 2002.  International sales were $1,037.9 million for
2002, representing an increase of 14% as a result of higher shipments of
Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. 
The acquisition of SDI added $2.5 million to international sales for
2002.  The impact of foreign currency
comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $13.7
million for 2002.  Excluding the impact
of foreign currency, international sales increased 12% in 2002.

Worldwide
sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $1,704.8 million for 2002, representing an
increase of 18% as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive, trauma and
spinal implants.  Excluding the impact of
foreign currency, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 17% for the
year.  Worldwide sales of MedSurg
Equipment were $1,105.3 million for 2002, representing an increase of 13% as a
result of higher shipments of powered surgical instruments, endoscopic
products, hospital beds and stretchers and micro implant and surgical
navigation systems. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of MedSurg
Equipment increased 13% for the year. 
Physical Therapy Services revenues were $201.5 million for 2002,
representing an increase of 11% as a result of new physical therapy centers and
higher revenues from existing centers.

Cost of sales represented 36.9% of
sales compared with 37.0% in 2001.  The
slightly lower cost of sales percentage in 2002 was due to an increase in the
absorption of fixed manufacturing costs caused by increased production at
certain of the Company's manufacturing plants to meet current demand and higher
sales growth for the higher margin Orthopaedic Implant products, offset
partially by higher product obsolescence resulting from product launches.

While research, development and
engineering expenses in 2002 were consistent with prior year amounts, they
decreased to 4.7% of sales from 5.5% in 2001.  
Research, development and engineering spending was
affected in 2002 by the commercial launch of OP-1, which occurred in various
markets in the second and fourth quarters of 2001.  Following the launch, in 2002 Stryker Biotech
recorded a portion of its expenses as cost of sales and selling, general and
administrative expenses, compared with 2001, when this division classified
substantially all of its costs as research, development and engineering.  Increased spending from the Company's
continued focus on new product development partially offset the decreased
research, development and engineering expenses related to Stryker Biotech.  New product introductions in 2002 included ScorpioFlex knee

- 22 -

for the United States market, Super Secur-Fit Plus hip for the Japanese market, Trident Ceramic
Acetabular System in Canada, Xia II Spinal System, System 5 heavy-duty,
battery-powered surgical instruments, TPS Saber Drill, SDC Pro 2 surgical DVD
documentation system, PainPump2, Precision System for percutaneous cement
delivery, fluoroscopic software module for the Stryker Navigation System and Go
Bed +.

Selling, general and administrative
expenses increased 18% in 2002 and represented 38.7% of sales compared with
37.9% in 2001.  The increase in selling,
general and administrative expenses was partially due to an increase in sales
commission expense as a result of the 16% increase in net sales in 2002.  In addition, the Company incurred an $8.9
million increase in insurance costs during 2002.  The change in classification of certain
Stryker Biotech expenses, as discussed above, also contributed to the increase
in selling, general and administrative expenses.  Discount expense related to the accounts
receivable securitization facility, which was included in selling, general and
administrative expenses, declined to $2.7 million in 2002 from $5.8 million in
2001 as a result of lower discount rates.

The Company recognized charges of $17.2 million ($11.5
million net of income taxes) related to restructuring and acquisition-related
items in the third quarter of 2002.  The
2002 restructuring and acquisition-related items included a charge of $21.0
million ($14.1 million net of income taxes) for employment-related costs to
close the Company's Rutherford, New Jersey, manufacturing facility, partially
offset by a credit of $3.8 million ($2.6 million net of income taxes) to
reverse certain Howmedica acquisition-related costs to reflect actual final
payments required.  The $21.0 million
restructuring charge related primarily to a shutdown agreement reached between
the Company and the employee bargaining unit to close the Orthopaedics division
implant manufacturing facility in Rutherford, New Jersey, which was ratified by
the members of the I.U.E.-CWA Local 485 on August 23, 2002.  The charge covered employment-related
severance costs for 353 employees.  The
Rutherford facility was closed during 2003 with final severance payments to be
made by the end of 2005.  The
Orthopaedics division has completed the transition of production to its
facilities in Mahwah, New Jersey, as well as Cork and Limerick, Ireland.

In the fourth quarter of 2001, the
Company recognized charges of $0.6 million related to various restructuring and
acquisition-related events.  The 2001
restructuring and acquisition-related charges included $2.4 million of charges,
partially offset by the reversal of prior year restructuring accruals totaling
$1.8 million.

Interest expense declined to $40.3
million in 2002 from $67.9 million in 2001, primarily as a result of lower
outstanding debt balances.  The decrease
in intangibles amortization to $28.9 million in 2002 from $38.4 million in 2001
was primarily the result of the Company's adoption of Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 142,

Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets

, which prohibits the amortization of goodwill.  If the nonamortization provisions of
Statement No. 142 had been applied in the prior year, amortization expense for
2001 would have been reduced by $18.1 million and net earnings would have
increased by $12.1 million ($.06 per diluted share).  Other expense was $0.5 million in 2002,
compared with $1.6 million of other income in 2001 due to foreign currency
transaction losses in the current year versus gains in the prior year,
partially offset by higher interest income.

The effective income tax rate was
31.8% in 2002 compared with 33.0% in 2001. 
The Company's effective income tax rate for 2002 was reduced from 33.0%
to 31.8% in the fourth quarter of 2002, thereby reducing income tax expense by
$6.1 million, primarily as a result of increased manufacturing in lower tax
jurisdictions such as Ireland and Puerto Rico.

Earnings before extraordinary item
increased 27% to $345.6 million from $271.8 million in 2001; basic earnings per
share before extraordinary item increased 27% to $1.75 in 2002 from $1.38 in
2001; and diluted earnings per share before extraordinary item increased 27% to
$1.70 in 2002 from $1.34 in 2001.  In
December 2001, the Company refinanced and prepaid the remaining $642.7 million
outstanding under the $1,650.0 million Senior Secured Credit Facilities
established in 1998 in connection with the Howmedica acquisition.  The prepayment of the 1998 Facilities
resulted in the write-off in 2001 of related unamortized deferred loan costs of
$7.1 million, which was reflected as an extraordinary loss of $4.8 million (net
of income taxes of $2.3 million; $.02 per basic and diluted share).  Net earnings were $345.6 million (basic and
diluted net earnings per share of $1.75 and $1.70, respectively) compared with
$267.0 million (basic and diluted net earnings per share of $1.36 and $1.32, respectively)
in 2001.

Excluding the impact of the
restructuring and acquisition-related items on 2002 and 2001 and the impact of
the change in goodwill amortization and the extraordinary item on 2001,
adjusted net earnings in 2002 were $357.1 million, representing a 26% increase
over adjusted net earnings of $284.3 million in 2001.  Adjusted basic net earnings per share
increased 25% to $1.81 compared with $1.45 in 2001.  Adjusted diluted net earnings per share
increased 25% to $1.75 compared with $1.40 in 2001.

These adjusted non-GAAP financial

supplemental non-GAAP information because it provides meaningful information
regarding the Company's results on a consistent and comparable basis for the

Financial Statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and to
not rely solely on any single financial measure.  The reconciliations of these non-GAAP
financial measures are as follows (in millions):

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company's working capital at
December 31, 2003 increased $103.3 million to $547.1 million from $443.8
million at December 31, 2002, including the effect of the proceeds from the
sale of an additional $20.0 million of accounts receivable pursuant to the
accounts receivable securitization facility, that were used to reduce
outstanding borrowings under the Company's Unsecured Credit Facilities.  The increase in working capital resulted from
growth in the Company's overall business and the use of strong earnings to fund
increases in accounts receivable, inventory and prepaid expenses and to pay
current liabilities due in 2003, primarily for

- 24 -

income taxes and restructuring
and acquisition-related liabilities. 
Trade accounts payable and other accrued liabilities increased in 2003
as a result of the growth in the business, higher obligations for third-party
sales agent commissions, third-party royalties, non-income based taxes,
increased reserves for legal claims and assessments and increases in other
accrued liabilities.  Accounts receivable
days sales outstanding, excluding the effect of  $150.0 million outstanding under the
Company's $200.0 million accounts receivable securitization facility, of 58
days was unchanged at December 31, 2003 compared to December 31, 2002.  Days sales in inventory decreased 6 days to 120 days at December 31,
 2003 from 126 days at December 31,
 2002.  The lower days sales in
inventory is primarily the result of improved inventory management and
higher provisions for product obsolescence as a result of product launches.

The Company generated cash of $648.5
million from operations in 2003 compared with $516.2 million in 2002.  The generation of cash in 2003 is the result
of strong cash earnings (net earnings plus noncash
adjustments) and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses.  These items were partially offset by
increases in deferred charges and accounts receivable from increased sales and
payments of $15.5 million attributable to restructuring and acquisition-related
liabilities and acquisition purchase liabilities.  In 2003, the Company used cash of $10.8
million for business and product line acquisitions, $144.5 million for capital
expenditures and $23.7 million
for the payment of dividends.  In
addition to the borrowings used to fund business and product line acquisitions,
the Company borrowed an additional $664.5 million under its existing credit
facilities to fund cash flow needs during 2003 and made repayments of $1,144.6
million against the credit facilities. 
Total borrowings declined by $475.6 million after adjusting for the
effect of foreign currency translation.

In 2003, the Company used cash of
$144.5 million for capital expenditures, including $27.7 million related to the
construction of Phase II of the Company's Mahwah, New Jersey, manufacturing and
distribution facility.  In addition, the
Company spent $4.6 million for the expansion of the Company's manufacturing
facility in West Lebanon, New Hampshire, and $3.8 million for the expansion of
the Company's Cork, Ireland, manufacturing facility.

The Company had $65.9 million in
cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2003. 
The Company also had outstanding borrowings totaling $26.1 million at
that date.  Current maturities of
long-term debt at December 31, 2003 are $7.3 million and will increase to $15.6
million in 2006.  The Company's $750.0
million five-year, nonamortizing, revolving credit agreement expires in
December 2006.  As a result of current
cash and outstanding debt balances, the Company decided not to renew its
previously existing $250.0 million 364-day revolving credit agreement which
expired in December 2003.  The Company
believes its cash on hand, as well as anticipated cash flows from operations,
will be sufficient to fund future operating capital requirements, future
manufacturing facility construction and other capital expenditures, future
business and product line acquisitions and required debt repayments.  Should additional funds be required, the
Company had $802.1 million of additional borrowing capacity available under all
of its existing credit facilities and an additional $50.0 million of eligible
accounts receivable which could be sold through its accounts receivable
securitization facility at December 31, 2003.

The Company's future contractual
obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than one year, including
agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business, are
summarized as follows (in millions):

The Company's additional borrowing capacity, along with the expected expiration period of the
commitment, are summarized as follows (in millions):

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of the Company's
Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes.  On an ongoing basis,
management evaluates these estimates. 
Estimates are based on historical experience, when available, and on
various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources.  Actual
results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions.

Management
believes that an understanding of the following critical accounting policies is
important in obtaining an overall understanding of the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The
Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in
the collection of accounts receivable. 
The Company makes estimates regarding the future ability of its
customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and
expected future trends.  If actual
customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management,
additional accounts receivable write-offs may be necessary, which could
unfavorably affect future operating results.

Inventory Reserves

The
Company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the
potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current
carrying costs.  The markets in which the
Company operates are highly competitive, with new products and surgical
procedures introduced on an ongoing basis. 
Such marketplace changes may cause the Company's products to become
obsolete.  The Company makes estimates
regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records
a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience,
expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends.  If actual product life cycles, product demand
or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by
management, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which could
unfavorably affect future operating results.

Income Taxes

The Company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions
both inside and outside the United States.  Accordingly, management must
determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions. 
Tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex
issues may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in
income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between
jurisdictions with different tax rates.  Because tax adjustments in certain
jurisdictions can be significant, the

- 26 -

Company records accruals representing management's best estimate of the
probable resolution of these matters.  To the extent additional information
becomes available, such accruals are adjusted to reflect the revised estimated
probable outcome.

Other Matters

The Company distributes its products
throughout the world.  As a result, the
Company's financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as
changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in
foreign markets.  The Company's operating
results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the United
States dollar and the Japanese yen and European currencies, in particular the
euro and the British pound.  When the
United States dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the dollar value of
sales denominated in foreign currencies increases.  When the United States dollar strengthens,
the opposite situation occurs.  The
Company manufactures its products in the United States, France, Germany,
Ireland, Switzerland, Canada and Puerto Rico and incurs the costs to
manufacture in the applicable local currencies. 
This worldwide deployment of factories serves to partially mitigate the
impact of currency exchange rate changes on the Company's cost of sales.

The
Company follows the provisions of FASB Statement No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

, as
amended by Statements No. 137 and No. 138, in accounting for its derivative
financial instruments.  The Statements
require the Company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair
value.  Derivatives that are not
documented and accounted for as hedges must be adjusted to fair value through
earnings.  If a derivative is a hedge,
depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the
derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged
assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in
accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) until the hedged item is recognized
in earnings.

The Company enters into forward currency exchange
contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions
denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting risk to the Company
that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. These nonfunctional
currency exposures principally relate to intercompany payables arising from
intercompany purchases of manufactured products.  The periods of the forward currency exchange
contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized
gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions
denominated in the nonfunctional currencies.

At December 31, 2003, the Company
had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $123.9 million
and sell $154.9 million of various currencies (principally United States
dollars and euros) with maturities ranging principally from 30 to 180 days.  At December 31, 2002, the Company had
outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $82.0 million and
sell $97.7 million of various currencies (principally United States dollars and
euros) with maturities ranging principally from 30 to 180 days.  The estimated fair value of forward currency
exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end
spot rates as adjusted by current forward points.  A hypothetical 10% change in exchange rates
for these currencies would change the 2003 fair value by approximately $2.1
million and would have changed the 2002 fair value by approximately $0.5
million.

At
December 31, 2003, the Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance by counterparties on its outstanding forward currency exchange
contracts but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties.

The Company is exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates as a
result of its borrowings and the accounts receivable securitization facility. 
The Company managed a portion of its interest rate risk on its borrowings
through interest rate swap agreements, which had fixed the base rate on a $250.0
million notional amount of the variable-rate borrowings during 2003.  These
interest rate swap agreements expired during 2003.  If market interest
rates for similar borrowings had averaged 1% more than they did in 2003, the
Company's 2003

- 27 -

interest expense, after considering the effects of its interest rate swaps,
would have increased, and earnings before income taxes would have decreased, by
$0.7 million.  By comparison, if market interest rates had averaged 1% less
than they did during 2003, the Company's 2003 interest expense, after
considering the effects of its interest rate swaps, would have decreased, and
earnings before income taxes would have increased, by $0.7 million.  If
market interest rates for the accounts receivable securitization facility had
averaged 1% more than they did in 2003, the Company's discount expense would
have increased, and earnings before income taxes would have decreased, by $1.7
million.  By comparison, if market interest rates had averaged 1% less than
they did in 2003, the Company's discount expense would have decreased, and
earnings before income taxes would have increased, by $1.7 million.  These
amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates
on the Company's borrowing cost, interest rate swap agreements and accounts
receivable securitization facility without any actions by management to mitigate
its exposure to such changes.

The
Company's interest rate swap agreements, which matured over various terms
ranging from September 2003 through December 2003, effectively converted a
portion of its variable-rate borrowings to a fixed-rate basis, thus reducing
the impact of changes in interest rates on interest expense.  The Company designated the interest rate swap
agreements as cash flow hedges.  Gains of
$9.2 million and $9.3 million and a loss of $22.0 million attributable to
changes in the fair value of interest rate swap agreements were recorded as
components of accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) in 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively.  Interest rate differentials paid or received as a
result of interest rate swaps were recognized as an adjustment of interest
expense related to the designated borrowings.

The
Company has used yen-denominated floating-rate borrowings to protect a portion
of the value of its investment in its subsidiary in Japan.  Realized and unrealized gains and losses from
this hedge were not included in the consolidated statements of earnings, but
were recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within accumulated
other comprehensive gain (loss) in stockholders' equity.  Net gains (losses) of ($2.1) million, ($1.6)
million and $5.8 million attributable to the yen-denominated floating-rate
borrowings hedge were recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments in
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

The
Company has certain investments in net assets in international locations that
are not hedged.  These investments are
subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign
currencies.  For the year ended December
31, 2003, the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar
increased the value of these investments in net assets by $176.3 million.  This gain eliminated the previously recorded
cumulative loss of $68.6 million that had been deferred and recorded as a
separate component of stockholders' equity at December 31, 2002.

On
July 1, 2002, the Company acquired SDI from Tyco International Ltd., for $135.0
million in cash.  The acquisition
expanded the Company's spinal product line by adding interbody
spinal cages for the United States market as well as other thoracolumbar
and cervical spinal fixation devices. 
The acquisition was funded using existing credit facilities.  The acquisition of SDI was accounted for
using the purchase method of accounting. 
The results of operations for the acquired business are included in the
Company's Consolidated Financial Statements beginning July 1, 2002.  The Company's pro forma consolidated
financial results in 2002 did not differ significantly as a result of the SDI
acquisition.

The
Company is partially self-insured for product liability claims.  In 2003, the Company established a wholly
owned captive insurance company in the U.S. to manage its self-insured
retention limits.  The captive insurance
company provides insurance reserves for estimated liabilities for product claims
incurred but not reported based on actuarially determined liabilities.  The actuarial valuations are based on
historical information along with certain assumptions about future events.

During
the second quarter of 2003, the Company issued 50,000 shares of restricted
stock to its newly appointed President and Chief Operating Officer.  The stock vests ratably on the first five
anniversary dates of the grant, provided that the recipient is still employed
by the Company.  The aggregate market
value of the restricted stock at the date of issuance of $3.4 million, as
measured at the quoted price of the Company's common stock, has been recorded
as deferred stock-based compensation, a separate component of stockholders'
equity, and is being amortized over the five-year vesting period.

In
December 2003, the Company announced that its subsidiary, Physiotherapy
Associates, Inc., and Stryker received a subpoena from the United States
Attorney's Office in Boston, Massachusetts, in connection with a Department of
Justice investigation of Physiotherapy Associates' billing and coding
practices. Physiotherapy Associates provides physical, occupational and speech
therapy services to patients through 374 outpatient centers in the United
States and represented 6% and 7% of Stryker's net sales for the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively  
Revenues derived from billings to U.S. Federal health-care programs
approximated 14% of Physiotherapy Associates' revenues during these periods.
The Company is fully cooperating with the Department of Justice regarding this
matter.

In
December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to Statement No. 132,

Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and
Other Postretirement Benefits

.  This
revision requires additional disclosures by the Company regarding its plan
assets, investment strategies, plan obligations and cash flows.  The Company has adopted these new disclosure
requirements for all of its defined benefit plans.

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Stryker Corporation and Subsidiaries

December 31, 2003

(in millions, except per share amounts)

NOTE 1

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Business

:
Stryker Corporation develops, manufactures and markets specialty surgical and
medical products that are sold primarily to hospitals throughout the world and
provides outpatient physical therapy services in the United States.

Principles of Consolidation

: The Consolidated Financial Statements include the
accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries after elimination
of all significant intercompany accounts and transactions.

Revenue Recognition

: A significant portion of the Company's Orthopaedic Implants revenue
is generated from consigned inventory maintained at hospitals or with field
representatives.  For these products, revenue
is recognized at the time the Company receives appropriate notification that
the product has been used or implanted. 
The Company records revenue from MedSurg Equipment product sales when
title and risk of ownership have been transferred to the customer, which is
typically upon shipment to the customer. 
For its Physical Therapy Services line of business, the Company records
revenue when the services have been rendered. 
The Company records estimated sales returns, discounts and other
applicable adjustments as a reduction of net sales in the same period revenue
is recognized.

Shipping and Handling of Products

: Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling of products are included in net sales.  Costs incurred related to shipping and
handling of products are included in cost of sales.

Use of Estimates

: The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires Company management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying
notes.  Actual results could differ from
those estimates.

Foreign Currency Translation

: The functional currencies for substantially all of
the Company's international affiliates are their local currencies.  Accordingly, the financial statements of
these international affiliates are translated into United States dollars using
current exchange rates for balance sheets and average exchange rates for
statements of earnings and cash flows. 
Unrealized translation adjustments are included in accumulated other
comprehensive gain (loss) in stockholders' equity.  Transaction gains and losses, such as those
resulting from the settlement of nonfunctional currency receivables or
payables, are included in net earnings.

Cash Equivalents and Investments

: Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with
a maturity of three months or less when purchased.  Investments include marketable equity
securities and other investments classified in other assets.  Other investments consist of mutual funds
that are acquired to offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements.

The
Company's investments are stated at fair value based on quoted market prices.
Interest, dividends and realized gains and losses on the sale of cash
equivalents and marketable equity securities are included in other expense
(income).  Adjustments to the fair value
of marketable equity securities, which are classified as available-for-sale,
are recorded as increases or decreases, net of income taxes, within accumulated
other comprehensive gain (loss) in stockholders' equity.  Adjustments to the fair value of other
investments, which are classified as trading, are recorded in earnings as
offsets to the related changes in liabilities under deferred compensation
arrangements.

Accounts Receivable

:  Accounts receivable consist of trade and
other miscellaneous receivables.  The Company maintains an allowance for
doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable. 
The

- 34 -

Company makes estimates regarding the future ability of its customers to make
required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future
trends.

Accounts Receivable Securitization

: As amended and restated on April 24, 2003, the
Company has an accounts receivable securitization facility pursuant to which
certain subsidiaries of the Company sell on an ongoing basis all of their
domestic accounts receivable to Stryker Funding Corporation (SFC), a wholly
owned special-purpose subsidiary of the Company, which in turn may sell up to
an aggregate of a $200.0 (the limit was $130.0 at December 31, 2002) undivided
percentage ownership interest in such receivables to bank-administered multiseller
commercial paper conduits.  Creditors of
SFC have a claim to its assets before any equity becomes available to the
Company.

The
amounts of undivided percentage ownership interests in accounts receivable sold
to SFC, net of the Company's retained interest, totaled $150.0 at December 31,
2003 and $130.0 at December 31, 2002, and are reflected in the balance sheet as
reductions of accounts receivable.  The
proceeds from the sale of additional accounts receivable interests were used to
reduce outstanding borrowings under the Company's unsecured credit
facilities.  The amount of receivables
sold is subject to change monthly, based on the level of defined eligible
receivables less contractual reserves. The Company's retained interest in
accounts receivable held by SFC, which is in the form of a subordinated note,
represents an overcollateralization of the undivided
interest sold.  This retained interest
totaled $107.1 and $98.5 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  Discount expense associated with the
securitization facility, including the conduit's financing cost of issuing its
commercial paper, was $2.6 in 2003, $2.7 in 2002 and $5.8 in 2001 and is
included in selling, general and administrative expenses.

Inventories

:
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.  Cost for approximately 88% of inventories is
determined using the lower of first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost or market.  Cost for certain domestic inventories is
determined using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) cost method.  The FIFO cost for all inventories
approximates replacement cost.

The
Company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the
potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current
carrying costs.  The markets in which the
Company operates are highly competitive, with new products and surgical
procedures introduced on an ongoing basis. 
Such marketplace changes may cause the Company's products to become
obsolete.  The Company makes estimates
regarding the future recoverability of the cost of these products and records a
provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience,
expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends.

Property, Plant and Equipment

: Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost.
Depreciation is computed by either the straight-line or declining-balance
method over the estimated useful lives of 3 to 30 years for buildings and
improvements and 3 to 10 years for machinery and equipment.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

:  Goodwill represents the excess of purchase
price over fair value of tangible net assets of acquired businesses after
amounts allocated to other intangible assets. 
Other intangible assets include developed technology, which is amortized
on a straight-line basis over 20 years, and customer relationships (which
reflect expected continued customer patronage), trademarks, brand names and
patents, which are amortized on a straight-line basis over 5 to 40 years
(weighted average life of 15 years for other intangible assets).

Deferred Charges

: Deferred charges represent the net book value of loaner instruments
for surgical implants provided to customers by the Company.  These instruments are amortized on a
straight-line basis over a three-year period. 
Amortization expenses for instruments are included in selling, general
and administrative expenses.

Deferred Loan Costs

: Deferred loan
costs associated with the Company's borrowings are amortized over the terms of
the related borrowings using the effective-interest method.  Deferred loan costs are classified in other
assets and had a net book value of $1.9 and $2.5 at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.  Amortization expenses for
deferred loan costs are included in interest expense and were $0.6 in 2003,
$0.6 in 2002 and $5.9 in 2001.  The
prepayment of the remaining amounts outstanding under the Company's Senior
Secured Credit Facilities in December 2001 resulted in the write-off of related
unamortized deferred loan costs of $7.1 (see Note 7).

- 35 -

Income Taxes

: The Company accounts
for income taxes using the liability method. 
Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are
determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of
assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates in effect
for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.  Deferred income tax expense (credit)
represents the change in net deferred tax assets and liabilities during the
year.

Derivative Financial Instruments

: The
Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage the economic impact of
fluctuations in currency exchange rates. 
The Company enters into currency forward contracts to manage these
economic risks.  The Company had entered
into interest rate swap contracts with various maturity dates through December
2003 to manage the economic impact of fluctuations in interest rates.

The Company follows the provisions
of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities

, as amended by Statements No. 137 and No. 138, in
accounting for its derivative financial instruments.  The Statements require the Company to
recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.  Derivatives that are not hedges must be
adjusted to fair value through earnings. 
If a derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge,
changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the
change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments
through earnings or recognized in accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss)
until the hedged item is recognized in earnings (see Note 2).

Legal and Other Contingencies:

The Company is
involved in various proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal
course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor and other
matters.  The potential future outcomes
of these matters are outside of management's complete control and will
generally not be known for prolonged periods of time.  In certain of the legal proceedings, the
claimants seek damages, as well as other compensatory relief, which could
result in the payment of significant claims and settlements.  In legal matters for which management has
sufficient information to reasonably estimate the Company's future obligations,
a liability representing management's best estimate of the probable cost for
the resolution of these legal matters is recorded.  The estimates are based on consultation with
outside counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies.

Stock Options

: At December 31, 2003,
the Company has key employee and director stock option plans, which are
described more fully in Note 8.  The
Company follows Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

,
in accounting for its stock option plans. 
Under Opinion No. 25, no compensation expense is recognized because
the exercise price of the Company's stock options equals the market price of
the underlying stock on the measurement date (date of grant).  Had compensation expense for the Company's
stock-based compensation plans been determined based on the fair value at the
grant dates for awards under those plans consistent with the method of FASB
Statement No. 123,

Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation

, the Company's net earnings and net earnings per
share would have been as follows:

- 36 -

The
weighted-average fair value per share of options granted during 2003, 2002 and
2001, estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model, was $30.38, $22.94 and $21.76, respectively.  The fair value of options granted was
estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions:

Comprehensive Gain (Loss)

: The components of accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) are as follows:

Recently Issued Accounting Standards:

In
December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to Statement No. 132,

Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and
Other Postretirement Benefits

.  This
revision requires additional disclosures by the Company regarding its plan
assets, investment strategies, plan obligations and cash flows.  The Company has adopted these new disclosure
requirements for all of its defined benefit plans (see Note 10).

Reclassifications:

Certain prior year amounts
have been reclassified to conform with the
presentation used in 2003.

NOTE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT

The
following is a summary of the Company's investments:

Net realized losses on sales of the Company's investments in 2003, 2002 and
2001 totaled $0.1, $0.1, and $0.9, respectively.

- 37 -

Interest income, which is included in other income,
totaled $3.1 in 2003, $2.4 in 2002 and $2.2 in 2001.

The
Company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact
of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional
currencies, thereby limiting risk to the Company that would otherwise result
from changes in exchange rates.  These
nonfunctional currency exposures relate principally to intercompany receivables
and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products.  The periods of the forward currency exchange
contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized
gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions
denominated in the nonfunctional currencies. 
All currency forward contracts and
cross-currency swaps are marked-to-market each period with resulting gains
(losses) included in other expense (income) in the consolidated statements of
earnings.

At December 31, 2003, the Company had outstanding
forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $123.9 and sell $154.9 of
various currencies (principally United States dollars and euros) with
maturities ranging principally from 30 to 180 days.  At December 31, 2002, the Company had
outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $82.0 and sell
$97.7 of various currencies (principally United States dollars and euros) with
maturities ranging principally from 30 to 180 days.  The estimated fair value of forward currency
exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end
spot rates as adjusted by current forward points.

During
1998, the Company entered into interest rate
swap agreements that effectively converted a portion of its variable-rate
borrowings to a fixed-rate basis through 2003, thus reducing the impact of
changes in interest rates on interest expense during that period.  The swap agreements fixed the
Company's base rate on $250.0 of its variable-rate borrowings during 2003 at an
average rate of 5.58%.  The interest rate
swaps matured over various terms ranging from September 2003 through December
2003.

Upon adoption of FASB Statement No. 133, as
amended, on January 1, 2001, the Company recognized a gain from the cumulative
effect of an accounting change of $3.5 in accumulated other comprehensive gain
(loss) related to the interest rate swap agreements.  Gains of $9.2 and $9.3 and a loss of $22.0
attributable to changes in the fair value of interest rate swap agreements were
recorded as components of accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) in 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively.  Interest
rate differentials paid or received as a result of interest rate swaps were
recognized as an adjustment of interest expense related to the designated
borrowings.

The
Company has used yen-denominated floating-rate borrowings to protect a portion
of the value of its investment in its subsidiary in Japan.  Realized and unrealized gains and losses from
this hedge were not included in the consolidated statements of earnings, but
were recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within accumulated
other comprehensive gain (loss) in stockholders' equity.  Net gains (losses) of ($2.1) million, ($1.6)
million and $5.8 million attributable to the yen-denominated floating-rate
borrowings hedge were recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments in
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

At December 31, 2003, the Company is exposed to credit
loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on its outstanding
forward currency exchange contracts but does not anticipate nonperformance by
any of the counterparties.

INVENTORIES

Inventories are summarized as follows

:

NOTE 4

BUSINESS AND PRODUCT LINE ACQUISITIONS

In October 2002, the
Company purchased the DEKOMPRESSOR product line from Pain Concepts, Inc., at a
total cost of $10.0, giving the Company access to intellectual property and
commercial rights relating to the design and manufacture of certain medical
devices.  Intangible assets acquired are
being amortized over 17 years.  The
Company is contingently liable for potential future milestone payments of up to
$42.5, primarily based on future sales growth.

On
October 1, 2002, the Company entered into an agreement with Curis,
Inc., which eliminated all royalties payable to Curis
relating to future Stryker sales of osteogenic protein-1 (OP-1).  Under terms of the agreement, the Company
made a one-time cash payment of $14.0 to Curis.  The payment was allocated to existing patents
and is being amortized over 15 years.

On July 1, 2002, the Company acquired the Surgical
Dynamics Inc. spinal implant business (SDI) from Tyco International Ltd., for
$135.0 in cash.  The acquisition expanded
the Company's spinal product line by adding interbody
spinal cages for the United States market as well as other thoracolumbar
and cervical spinal fixation devices. 
The acquisition was funded using existing credit facilities.

The
acquisition of SDI was accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting.  The results of operations
for the acquired business are included in the Company's Consolidated Financial
Statements beginning July 1, 2002.  The
purchase price of $135.0 in cash, less a contractually required adjustment of
$6.6  received in the third quarter of
2003 based on the decrease in SDI's working capital between April 30, 2002 and
closing, and liabilities assumed have been allocated to the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of
acquisition.  The purchase price
allocation was finalized in 2003.  Based
on the final purchase price allocation (as adjusted for the determined working
capital adjustment amount), $87.7 of the purchase price was allocated to patent
licensing agreements to be amortized over their remaining life of eight years,
$9.1 to inventory, $34.7 to deferred tax assets related to future tax
deductions, $4.8 to other tangible assets and $7.9 to liabilities assumed.  Immediately after the acquisition was
consummated, management of the Company began to implement an integration plan
to combine Stryker and SDI.  In
conjunction with the integration plan, the Company recorded additional purchase
liabilities of $3.6, which were included in the purchase price allocation.  The additional purchase liabilities included
$3.1 for severance and related costs and $0.5 for contractual obligations.  The severance and related costs were provided
for workforce reductions covering 37 SDI employees.  The workforce reductions were completed
during the fourth quarter of 2002 with severance payments made through the
third quarter of 2003.  The Company's pro
forma consolidated financial results did not differ significantly as a result
of the SDI acquisition.

In
November 2001, the Company acquired the business of an independent Italian
distributor of certain of the Company's products at a cost of approximately
euro 28.2 ($25.3).  An initial cash
payment of euro 7.3 ($6.5) was made in November 2001, with the remaining purchase
price to be paid ratably over a five-year period.  The

- 39 -

purchase consolidates the distribution of
substantially all of the Company's products in Italy.  The acquisition was accounted for using the
purchase method of accounting.  Tangible
assets acquired included $5.1 of inventory and $0.8 of deferred charges.  Intangible assets acquired principally
included customer relationships and noncompete
agreements.  Approximately $10.2 of the
purchase price was allocated to customer relationships and is being amortized
over 20 years.  Approximately $9.2 of the
purchase price was allocated to other intangibles, principally noncompete agreements, and is being amortized over a
weighted average life of four years.

NOTE

GOODWILL
AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

In the fourth quarter of 2003, the
Company recorded a $6.5 charge related to a trademark impairment resulting from
a branding initiative adopted by the Company in the fourth quarter of
2003.  The branding initiative is
intended to improve the Company's customers' and other stakeholders' overall
awareness of Stryker's capabilities.  The
charge reduces the book value of a trademark within the Orthopaedic Implants
segment to its fair value as determined by using a discounted cash flow
model.  The charge is included in
intangibles amortization in the consolidated statements of earnings.

As
of January 1, 2002, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Statement No.
142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

,
related to acquisitions completed before July 1, 2001.  Statement No. 142 prohibits the amortization
of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and requires the
Company to evaluate these intangibles for impairment on an annual basis.  In accordance with the Statement's
provisions, an assembled workforce intangible asset with an unamortized balance
of $5.5 as of January 1, 2002 was reclassified from other intangibles to
goodwill.  In the first quarter of 2002,
the Company completed the required initial impairment test of goodwill and, in
the fourth quarters of 2002 and 2003, completed the required annual impairment
tests of goodwill as prescribed by Statement No. 142 and determined, in all
instances, that recorded goodwill was not impaired and that no goodwill
write-down was necessary.

If
the nonamortization provisions of Statement No. 142 had been applied in 2001,
amortization expense would have been reduced by $18.1 ($12.1 net of income
taxes).  A reconciliation of reported net
earnings to adjusted net earnings for 2001 is presented to show what net
earnings would have been had the nonamortization provisions of Statement No.
142 been applied in that year and is compared to reported net earnings in 2003
and 2002.  This reconciliation, including
related per share amounts, is as follows:

- 40 -

The
changes in the net carrying amount of goodwill by segment for the year ended
December 31, 2003 are as follows:

Other
intangibles at December 31, 2003 consist of the following:

Amortization
expense for other intangibles, including the $6.5 trademark impairment charge,
totaled $45.4 for the year ended December 31, 2003.  The estimated amortization expense for each
of the five succeeding years is as follows:

NOTE

RESTRUCTURING AND ACQUISITION-RELATED LIABILITIES

The
Company recorded restructuring and acquisition-related pretax charges (credits)
in 2002 and 2001 consisting of the following items:

- 41 -

The 2002 restructuring and acquisition-related items
reflect a charge of $17.2 ($11.5 net of income taxes) in the third quarter of
2002.  These items included a charge of
$21.0 ($14.1 net of income taxes) for employment-related costs to close the
Company's Rutherford, New Jersey, manufacturing facility, partially offset by a
credit of $3.8 ($2.6 net of income taxes) to reverse certain Howmedica
acquisition-related costs to reflect actual final payments required.

The $21.0 restructuring charge related primarily to a shutdown agreement
reached between the Company and the employee bargaining unit to close the Orthopaedics division implant
manufacturing facility in Rutherford, New Jersey, which was ratified by the
members of the I.U.E.-CWA Local 485 on August 23, 2002.  The charge covered employment-related
severance costs for 353 employees.  The
Rutherford facility was closed during 2003 with final severance payments to be
made by the end of 2005.  The
Orthopaedics division has completed the transition of production to its
facilities in Mahwah, New Jersey, as well as Cork and Limerick, Ireland.

The
2001 restructuring credits of $0.3 relate to various restructuring events in
the fourth quarter of 2001.  The $0.6
credit for severance and related costs reflects charges of $0.8 offset by
credits of $1.4.  The $0.8 charge covers
severance costs for 10 employees in Europe. 
Planned workforce reductions were completed in the first quarter of
2002.  The $1.4 credit relates to a
reduction in the expected cost to complete headcount reductions associated with
the 2000 and 1999 reorganizations of the Company's European and Japanese
distribution operations.  The $0.7 charge
related to reorganization of distribution channels reflects the cost to
terminate a distributor in Latin America. 
The cost of the termination was based on contractual terms.  The $0.4 credit related to discontinuance of
product line represents a reversal of remaining loss reserves established in
Japan for discontinued ophthalmology inventories sold on a contingent basis in
1999.

The
2001 acquisition-related charges include $0.9 for severance and related costs
associated with the reorganization of the Company's sales structure in Italy to
accommodate the integration of the business acquired in the fourth quarter of
2001 from the Company's independent Italian distributor (see Note 4).  The reorganization established a direct sales
force in Italy that distributes the Company's full product portfolio.  The $0.9 charge covers severance costs for three
employees in Italy and costs to cancel contracts with discontinued agents.  The reorganization of the sales structure in
Italy was completed in the first quarter of 2002.

The
following table provides a rollforward of remaining
liabilities associated with business acquisition purchase liabilities and
restructuring and acquisition-related charges recorded by the Company in 2002,
2001 and prior years:

- 42 -

NOTE

LONG-TERM DEBT

Long-term
debt is summarized as follows:

In
December 2001, the Company established $1,000.0 in Unsecured Credit
Facilities.  These Facilities replaced
the $1,650.0 Senior Secured Credit Facilities that were established in 1998 in
conjunction with the acquisition of Howmedica. 
A total of $730.5 was initially drawn under the new Credit Facilities,
of which $642.7 prepaid the debt outstanding under the 1998 Facilities and
$87.8 was used to terminate the Company's synthetic lease and purchase its
Mahwah, New Jersey, manufacturing and distribution facility.

The
Unsecured Credit Facilities represent a $750.0 five-year, nonamortizing,
revolving credit agreement at December 31, 2003, with a $250.0 multicurrency sublimit, under which yen and euro can be borrowed.  The five-year facility also has a $50.0 swing
line sublimit and a $100.0 letter of credit sublimit.  The
five-year facility bears interest at a base rate, as defined, plus an
applicable margin ranging from 0.235% to 0.775%, depending on the Company's
debt rating.  The Unsecured Credit
Facilities require a commitment fee ranging from 0.065% to 0.225% on the
aggregate commitment of the facilities, depending on the Company's debt rating.  In addition, a utilization fee of 0.125% is
required when the sum of the outstanding amounts exceeds 50% of the aggregate
commitments.  During 2003, the weighted
average interest rate for all borrowings under the Unsecured Credit Facilities,
after considering the effects of the Company's interest rate swaps (see Note
2), was 5.17%.  The Facilities require
the Company to comply with certain financial and other covenants.

The
Unsecured Credit Facilities previously included a $250.0 364-day revolving
credit agreement which expired in December 2003.  The Company did not renew this revolving
credit agreement as it believes its cash on hand, as well as anticipated cash
flows from operations, will be sufficient to fund future operating and
investing activities.  Should additional
funds be required, the Company had $802.1 million of additional borrowing
capacity available under its remaining credit facilities at December 31,
 2003.

During
2003, the Company had borrowed yen 4,820.5 under the multicurrency sublimit available under the five-year revolving credit
agreement.  This borrowing was repaid in
full during the third quarter of 2003. 
The yen borrowing acted as a hedge of the Company's net investment in
Japan.  As a result, adjustments made to
the loan balance to reflect applicable currency exchange rates during 2003 were
included within accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) in stockholders'
equity.

The
$1,650.0 Senior Secured Credit Facilities that were prepaid in December 2001
consisted of $1,150.0 in term loans, a six-year $250.0 revolving credit
facility and a six-year $250.0 reducing multicurrency facility.  The prepayment of the remaining amounts
outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities in December 2001
resulted in the write-off of related unamortized deferred loan costs of $7.1,
which was reflected as an extraordinary loss of $4.8 (net of income taxes of
$2.3; $.02 per basic and diluted share) in the consolidated statements of
earnings.

Substantially all outstanding debt at December 31, 2003
matures in 2006 upon expiration of the Unsecured Credit Facilities.

The carrying amounts of the Company's long-term debt
approximate their fair values, based on the quoted interest rates for similar
types and amounts of borrowing agreements.

- 43 -

Interest paid on debt was $22.9 in 2003, $37.1 in 2002
and $66.9 in 2001 which approximates interest expense.

NOTE 8

CAPITAL
STOCK

The
Company has key employee and director stock option plans under which options
are granted at a price not less than fair market value at the date of
grant.  The options are granted for
periods of up to 10 years and become exercisable in varying installments.  A summary of stock option activity follows:

Shares reserved for future
grants were 7.9 and 9.5 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Exercise
prices for options outstanding as of December 31, 2003 ranged from $11.00 to
$77.65.  A summary of shares exercisable
follows:

The Company has 0.5
authorized shares of $1 par value preferred stock, none of which are
outstanding.

RETIREMENT PLANS

Certain
of the Company's subsidiaries have both funded and unfunded defined benefit
plans covering some or all of their employees. 
All of the defined benefit plans have projected benefit obligations in
excess of plan assets.  The Company uses
a December 31 measurement date for the determination of plan obligations and
funded status of its plans.  A summary of
the information related to all of the Company's defined benefit plans is as
follows:

- 46 -

The components of the amounts recognized in the
consolidated balance sheets are as follows:

The accumulated benefit obligation
for all of the defined benefit plans was $96.2 as of December 31, 2003.  Pension plans with an accumulated benefit
obligation in excess of plan assets had projected benefit obligations,
accumulated benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets of $95.6, $85.4
and $49.6, respectively, as of December 31, 2003.

The components of net periodic
benefit cost are as follows:

The Company has assumed an average
long-term expected return on defined benefit plan assets of 5.3% as of December
31, 2003.  The expected return is
determined by applying the target allocation in each asset category of plan
investments to the anticipated return for each asset category based on
historical and projected returns.

The weighted-average allocation of plan assets by asset category are as follows:

The investment strategy for the Company's defined
benefit plans is to both meet the liabilities of the plans as they fall due and
to maximize the return on invested assets within appropriate risk
tolerances.  Reflected below are target
investment allocation ranges for the plans at December 31, 2003:

- - 47 -

The Company anticipates contributing
approximately $4.8 to its defined benefit plans in 2004 to meet minimum funding
requirements.

A
subsidiary of the Company terminated its defined benefit plan in 2001 and
transferred the plan assets and related benefit obligations to a defined
contribution retirement plan.  The loss
on plan termination was $0.5.

Retirement
plan expense under the Company's profit sharing and defined contribution
retirement plans totaled $55.5 in 2003, $45.2 in 2002 and $36.5 in 2001.  A portion of the Company's retirement plan
expenses was funded with Stryker common stock totaling $4.8 in 2003, $4.1 in
2002 and $3.4 in 2001.  The use of
Stryker common stock represents a noncash investing
activity that is not reflected in the consolidated statements of cash
flows.  The amount of Stryker common
stock held by the Company's defined contribution retirement plans totaled $68.6
(approximately 0.8 shares) and $51.5 (approximately 0.8 shares) as of December
31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  The
value of Stryker common stock as a percentage of total defined contribution
retirement plan assets was 18.6% as of December 31, 2003 and 20.2% as of
December 31, 2002.

NOTE 11

INCOME TAXES

Earnings before income taxes and extraordinary item
consist of the following:

In
2003 and 2002, earnings from the Company's Puerto Rico-based manufacturing
operations are reported as foreign operations due to a change in legal
status.  Prior to 2002, these earnings
were reported as United States operations under an Internal Revenue Code
Section 936 election.

The
components of the provision for income taxes follow:

- 48 -

A
reconciliation of the United States statutory income tax rate to the Company's
effective income tax rate follows:

Deferred
income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and
the amounts used for income tax purposes.  The tax effect of significant temporary
differences, which comprise the Company's deferred income tax assets and
liabilities, is as follows:

Net operating loss carryforwards
totaling approximately $31.5 at December 31, 2003 are available to reduce
future taxable earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries.  A significant portion of these carryforwards may be carried forward indefinitely.

- 49 -

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are included in
the consolidated balance sheets as follows:

No
provision has been made for United States federal and state income taxes or
foreign taxes that may result from future remittances of the undistributed
earnings ($988.8 at December 31, 2003) of foreign subsidiaries because it is
expected that such earnings will be reinvested overseas indefinitely.  Determination of the amount of any
unrecognized deferred income tax liability on these unremitted
earnings is not practicable.

Total
income taxes paid, net of refunds received, were
$189.5 in 2003, $112.1 in 2002 and $63.0 in 2001.

NOTE 12

SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

The
Company segregates its operations into two reportable business segments:
Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The Orthopaedic Implants segment
sells orthopaedic reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma and spinal
implants and OP-1. The MedSurg Equipment segment sells powered surgical
instruments, endoscopic products, medical video imaging equipment, hospital
beds and stretchers and micro implant and surgical navigation systems.  Other includes Physical Therapy Services and
corporate administration, interest expense and interest income.

The
Company's reportable segments are business units that offer different products
and services and are managed separately because each business requires
different manufacturing, technology and marketing strategies.

The
accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the
summary of significant accounting policies. The Company measures the financial
results of its reportable segments using an internal performance measure that
excludes restructuring and acquisition-related items and extraordinary
items.  Identifiable assets are those
assets used exclusively in the operations of each business segment or are
allocated when used jointly. Corporate assets are principally cash and cash
equivalents, investments and property, plant and equipment.

- 50 -

Sales and other financial
information by business segment follows:

- 51 -

The
Company's principal areas of operation outside of the United States are Japan
and Europe.  The Company also has
operations in the Pacific, Canada, Latin America and the Middle East.  Geographic information follows:

NOTE

LEASES

The Company leases various manufacturing and office
facilities and equipment under operating leases.  Future minimum lease commitments under these
leases are as follows:

Rent
expense totaled $72.0 in 2003, $61.3 in 2002 and $51.6 in 2001.

NOTE 14

CONTINGENCIES

The
Company is involved in various proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in
the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor
and other matters.  Such matters are
subject to many uncertainties, and outcomes are not predictable with
assurance.  The Company records amounts
for losses that are deemed to be probable and subject to reasonable
estimate.  However, the Company does not
anticipate material losses as a result of these proceedings beyond amounts
already provided in the accompanying financial statements.

In
December 2003, the Company announced that its subsidiary, Physiotherapy
Associates, Inc., and Stryker received a subpoena from the United States
Attorney's Office in Boston, Massachusetts, in connection with a Department of
Justice investigation of Physiotherapy Associates' billing and coding
practices. Physiotherapy Associates provides physical, occupational and speech
therapy services to patients through 374 outpatient centers in the United
States and represented 6% and 7% of Stryker's net sales for the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 
Revenues derived from billings to U.S. Federal health-care programs
approximated 14% of Physiotherapy Associates revenues during these periods. The
Company is fully cooperating with the Department of Justice regarding this
matter.

Pursuant
to certain of the Company's credit and lease agreements, the Company has
provided financial guarantees to third parties in the form of indemnification
provisions.  These provisions indemnify
the third parties for costs, including but not limited to adverse judgments in
lawsuits and the imposition of additional taxes due to either a change in the
tax law or an adverse interpretation of the tax law.  The term of the guarantee is equal to the
term of the related credit or lease agreement. 
The Company is not able to calculate the maximum potential amount of
future payments it could be required to make under these guarantees, as the
potential payment is dependent on the occurrence of future unknown events
(e.g., changes in United States or foreign tax laws).

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

The

Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Stryker Corporation

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Stryker
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003.  These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States.  Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Stryker Corporation
and subsidiaries at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the consolidated results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States.

As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill in
2002.
