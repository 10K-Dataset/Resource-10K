PART I

ITEM
  1.

BUSINESS

GENERAL

Stryker
Corporation (the Company or Stryker) is one of the world's leading medical
technology companies with the most broadly based range of products in
orthopaedics and a significant presence in other medical specialties.  Stryker
works with respected medical professionals to help people lead more active and
more satisfying lives.  The Company's products include implants used in joint
replacement, trauma, craniomaxillofacial and spinal surgeries; biologics;
surgical, neurologic, ear, nose & throat (ENT) and interventional pain
equipment; endoscopic, surgical navigation, communications and digital imaging
systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment.  Stryker
also provides outpatient physical therapy services in the United States.  Stryker
was incorporated in Michigan in 1946 as the successor company to a business
founded in 1941 by Dr. Homer H. Stryker, a leading orthopaedic surgeon and the
inventor of several orthopaedic products.

Stryker's
filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, including
its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current
reports on Form 8-K, are accessible free of charge at www.stryker.com within the
"For Investors" link.

In the fourth
quarter of 2005, the Company completed the repatriation of $722 million of
foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act (the Act). 
The Act provided a temporary incentive for United States companies to
repatriate accumulated income earned in foreign jurisdictions at a reduced
income tax cost.  The repatriated funds have been invested pursuant to an
approved Domestic Reinvestment Plan that conforms to the Act.

In
the fourth quarter of 2005 the Company acquired, by merger, all of the
outstanding stock of PlasmaSol Corp. (PlasmaSol).  PlasmaSol has developed a
technology that should allow Stryker to provide sterilization equipment for use
with certain of its MedSurg Equipment products.

In
the first quarter of 2005, the Company acquired eTrauma.com Corp. (eTrauma).  The acquisition expanded the Company's endoscopic and digital imaging equipment
product offerings within its MedSurg Equipment segment by adding eTrauma's
proprietary Picture Archive and Communications Systems (PACS) image management
and viewing software.

In
the third quarter of 2004, the Company completed its acquisition, by merger, of
SpineCore, Inc. (SpineCore), a developer of artificial lumbar and cervical
discs.  This acquisition is expected to enhance the Company's presence in the
spinal implant market, an important growth area within its Orthopaedic Implants
segment.

The Company's
Physiotherapy Associates, Inc., subsidiary has also purchased a number of
physical therapy clinic operations during each of the last three years.

PRODUCT SALES

The
Company segregates its operations into two reportable business segments:
Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  The Orthopaedic Implants segment
sells orthopaedic reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma, spinal and micro
implant systems; bone cement; and the bone growth factor OP-1.  The MedSurg
Equipment segment sells surgical equipment; surgical navigation systems;
endoscopic, communications, and digital imaging systems; as well as patient
handling and emergency medical equipment.  The Other category includes Physical
Therapy Services and corporate administration, interest expense and interest
income.  The following amounts (in millions) and percentages represent business
segment and domestic/international net sales during each of the three years
ended December 31:


Additional
financial information regarding the Company's operating segments and geographic
areas can be found under the captions "

Results
of Operations

" on pages 25 through 31 and "

Note
12 - Segment and Geographic Data

" on pages 57 through 59 of this
report.

Approximately
76% of the Company's sales in 2005 and 78% in 2004 and 2003 consisted of
products with short lives, such as reconstructive, trauma, spinal and micro implant
systems (while implants have a long useful life to the patient, they have a
one-time use to the hospital); disposables and expendable tools; parts and
service revenues, including service and repair charges; and physical therapy
revenues.  The balance of sales in each of the years came from products that
could be considered capital equipment, having useful lives in excess of one
year.

The
Company's backlog of firm orders is not considered material to an understanding
of its business.

Orthopaedic Implants

Orthopaedic
Implants are designed and manufactured by Stryker Orthopaedics, Stryker Osteosynthesis,
Stryker Spine and Stryker Biotech and consist of such products as implants used
in joint replacement, trauma, craniomaxillofacial and spinal surgeries; bone
cement; and the bone growth factor OP-1.  Artificial joints are made of cobalt
chromium, titanium alloys, ceramics or ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene
and are implanted in patients whose natural joints have been damaged by
arthritis, osteoporosis, other diseases or injury.  The Company's OP-1 bone
growth factor, which induces the formation of new bone when implanted into
bone, is composed of recombinant human OP-1 and a bioresorbable collagen
matrix.

Minimally Invasive Surgery

Many
of Stryker's technologically advanced reconstructive implants are suited to
minimally invasive surgery (MIS) procedures that are intended to reduce
soft-tissue damage and pain while hastening return to function.  The Company
supports surgeons with technology, procedural development and specialized
instrumentation as they develop new MIS techniques.  During 2003, the Company
began the initial introduction of Scorpio Total Knee Minimally Invasive
Instrumentation.  This line of instruments is designed to complement the
unique, minimally invasive total knee procedure pioneered by a leading
orthopaedic surgeon.  This technique can reduce the length of the incision by
approximately 70%.  Because of the Company's commitment to responsible science,
a multicenter study was conducted to validate the technique's reproducibility
and potential benefits, such as reduced pain and earlier return to function. 
The EIUS Unicondylar Knee and the Avon Patellofemoral Joint are resurfacing,
bone-conserving designs that are used to treat disease isolated to one
compartment of the knee.  These pre-total knee treatment options can also be
implanted using minimally invasive techniques.

In
order to facilitate emerging procedural approaches, the Company has also
developed instrumentation for MIS total hip arthroplasty.  The Company's
surgical navigation systems are frequently used in MIS procedures to improve
the accuracy of measurements and to position the implant.


Stryker
Osteosynthesis has a market leadership position in the Intramedullary (IM) Hip
Screw market due to the minimally invasive nature of the Gamma Nail.  In 2004, Stryker
launched a new version of the Gamma Nail that can be implanted through an even
smaller incision.  In addition, surgeons are testing the use of the Company's
surgical navigation systems for this procedure as well as in surgery for pelvic
fractures.

Hip Implant Systems

Through
Stryker Orthopaedics, the Company offers a variety of hip implant systems for
the global reconstructive market.  The ABG Hip System, Partnership Hip System,
Secur-Fit Hip System, Omnifit Hip System, Accolade Hip System and Restoration
Hip System each represents a comprehensive system of hip implants and
associated instrumentation designed to provide physicians and patients with
reliable results and to reduce operating time for primary and revision
procedures.  The Exeter Total Hip System is based on a unique, collarless,
highly polished, double-tapered femoral design that reduces shear stresses and
increases compression at the cement/bone interface.  During 2004, the Company
began transitioning to its new Restoration Modular Revision Hip System in the United States, Europe, Australia and Canada.  This system offers surgeons performing revision
surgeries flexibility in treating complex stem revisions and restoring patient
biomechanics.  The Restoration Modular Revision Hip System also takes advantage
of Stryker's long clinical history with hydroxylapatite (HA), a naturally
occurring calcium phosphate material that demonstrates a high level of
biocompatibility due to its resemblance to bone, by incorporating PureFix HA
coating on many components.  The Restoration Modular Revision Hip System
complements the Company's existing Restoration HA and Restoration PS monolithic
revision systems.

Stryker
was the first company to receive clearance from the United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) to commercially release for sale in the United States a
hip implant with HA surface treatment.  The Company's global clinical
experience with HA-coated hip stems now extends over 15 years and reported
clinical performance continues to equal or exceed that of comparable hip stems
reported in the scientific literature.

Following
the clinical success of its Crossfire technology, a highly crosslinked
polyethylene designed to reduce wear, Stryker launched X3 Polyethylene in 2005. 
X3 Polyethylene is the Company's next-generation highly crosslinked
polyethylene and features a higher level of strength and wear reduction in both
hip and knee replacements.

The
Company began a limited launch of its CentPillar Hip System in the Japanese
market in 2003, with a full rollout in 2004.  The Taro Hip System and
CentPillar Hip System provide lines of products that offer an increased range
of motion and a minimally invasive technique preferred by Japanese surgeons for
their patients.

On February 3, 2003, the Company received premarket approval (PMA) from the FDA for its
ceramic-on-ceramic hip replacement system, the Trident Ceramic Acetabular
Insert, for patients in the United States.  Stryker Orthopaedics successfully
launched the Trident ceramic insert in the United States in the second quarter
of 2003 following successful launches in Europe, Australia and Canada.  The
Trident insert is wear resistant, and it is protected and strengthened by a
patented titanium sleeve.  Other technologies used for total hip replacement
include metal-on-conventional polyethylene and metal-on-highly crosslinked
polyethylene articulations.

The
Company entered 2006 with more than 30 years of clinical history with the
Exeter Hip System, more than 20 years of clinical history with the Omnifit
cemented stem and 15 years of clinical history with the Omnifit HA stem. 
Long-term clinical results are an important factor in the Company's ability to
market hip implants.

Knee Implant Systems

The
Company offers six major knee implant systems under the Stryker brand name: the Duracon, Kinemax,  EIUS, Global Modular Replacement System (GMRS), Scorpio
and Triathlon systems.  Introduced in 1991 and utilized in more than 500,000
procedures worldwide, the Duracon system combines high levels of joint
conformity throughout the range of motion and consistent anatomic tracking. 
The DuraconTS and ScorpioTS Revision systems and Modular Rotating Hinge, which
were introduced in 1999 and 2001, respectively, completed the product line
offerings with implants for complex revision procedures.


Launched
on a limited basis in the United States and Europe in 2004, the Triathlon Knee
system represents the Company's evolutionary design that has been developed to
more closely reproduce natural knee motion and is designed to provide mobility
with stability through more than 150 degrees of flexion.  In 2005, the Company
launched a posterior-stabilized version of the Triathlon knee following the
launch of the cruciate-retaining version in 2004.  During 2005, the Company
continued its launch of the Triathlon Knee system on a worldwide basis
throughout the United States and Europe and into Canada and the Pacific
region.  The state-of-the-art Triathlon Knee instrumentation is designed to
improve operating room efficiency through a streamlined, integrated system
providing options and flexibility to meet surgeons' varying preferences and
multiple surgical techniques.

Launched
in 2003, the GMRS is a global product that offers a comprehensive solution for
severe bone loss in oncology, trauma and revision surgery patients.  GMRS has
tibial and femoral components, including a total femur, and a modular rotating
hinge knee.  The system employs both titanium and cobalt chrome alloys for
strength and lightness of weight, together with the superior flexibility of the
hinge.  The MRS system, the predecessor to the GMRS, was the first modular
segmental replacement system and its components have maintained a leadership
role in this market segment since the system's introduction in 1988.

The
Kinemax system is focused in markets outside the United States and offers
versatility through design principles based on the clinically successful Total
Condylar and Kinematic Knee Systems.  Precision-designed Monogram instruments
provide a common instrument platform for the Duracon and Kinemax knee systems.

The
Scorpio knee implant design is based on the epicondylar axis of the knee.  This
patented approach addresses significant clinical issues, such as improved
patient rehabilitation and midflexion stability, through an increase in the
patella-femoral moment arm and a single anterior-posterior radius.  The Scorpio
Plus Mobile Bearing tibial component was launched in markets outside the United States in 2001 and a clinical trial in the United States is ongoing.  This addition to the
Scorpio line provides a competitive entry into the growing, mobile-bearing
market segment.  The ScorpioFlex, which is available for both posterior
cruciate-retaining and cruciate-substituting indications, is specifically
designed for patients who have the ability and motivation to return to
high-flexion activities such as gardening and golfing.  ScorpioFlex has also enjoyed
success in Japan, where it is sold under the trade name Scorpio SuperFlex.  The
Scorpio system is supported by the Passport instrumentation system, which was
designed to provide intraoperative flexibility and precision as well as a
simple, cost-effective approach to total knee replacement surgery.

The
EIUS Unicondylar Knee replacement system is designed for the growing minimally
invasive knee surgery market segment.  This system marries bone-sparing femoral
and tibial implants with sophisticated instrumentation and a surgical technique
aimed at reducing rehabilitation time for patients.

Other Joint Replacement
Products

The
Company markets other joint replacement products, principally shoulder and
elbow implants and related instruments, under the Stryker brand name.  The
Solar Total Shoulder System provides a unique design for the humeral head that
allows the surgeon to adjust tension of the supporting tissues while maximizing
range of motion.  The shoulder instruments offer the surgeon increased
visibility and access to this tightly confined joint space.  The Solar BiPolar
Shoulder provides the surgeon with additional options for addressing rotator
cuff arthropathy arthritis of the shoulder and is designed with the patented
bipolar locking mechanism that is also used in the Company's hip implants.  The
Solar Shoulder product line gives the surgeon increased intraoperative
flexibility to restore the patient's shoulder kinematics.  The Solar Total
Elbow complements products offered for upper extremity procedures.  The
semiconstrained design and modular components address varying types of patient
anatomy.


Bone Cement

Simplex bone
cement, a material used to secure cemented implants to bone, was first approved
for orthopaedic use in the United States in 1971 and is the most widely used
bone cement in the world.  The Company manufactures and provides several
variations of Simplex bone cement to meet specific patient needs.  Simplex has
more than 40 years of clinical history, the longest of any bone cement, with more
than 400 published clinical papers.

In
2003, Stryker received FDA clearance to market Simplex P with Tobramycin, a
preblended antibiotic bone cement. Simplex P with Tobramycin, which has been on
the market in Europe since 2000, is indicated in the United States for patients
who are undergoing the second stage of a two-stage revision for a total joint
procedure.

Trauma Implant Systems

Through Stryker Osteosynthesis, the Company
develops, manufactures and markets its trauma implant systems.  Trauma products,
including nailing, plating, hip fracture and external fixation systems, are
used primarily in the fixation of fractures resulting from sudden injury. These
products consist of internal fixation devices marketed under such names as
Gamma, Grosse & Kempf, Omega, Dall-Miles, Asnis, T2 and S2, along with
external fixation devices marketed under the Apex, Hoffmann II and Monotube
Triax names.

The Company's internal fixation product
portfolio includes a full array of intramedullary nails, hip fracture
devices and plates and screws in both titanium and stainless steel.  These
trauma products complement the total hip and knee replacement offerings
mentioned above by offering a restorative option in addition to total
replacement.

To address the hip trauma and fracture
segment, the Company markets several products, including the IM nail portfolio,
led by the T2 Nailing System; the Gamma Nail, a unique IM nail for trochanteric
fractures; the Omega hip screw system; the Asnis Cannulated Screw System; and
the Hansson pin system, providing a complete offering of surgical solutions for
the hip trauma patient.  These hip fracture systems offer orthopaedic surgeons
multiple options depending on their preferences and patient needs.

The T2 Nailing System includes femoral,
tibial and humeral components with a common instrument platform for accuracy
and ease of use.  Building on the success of this titanium nail, the Company
introduced the stainless steel S2 tibial and femoral nails in 2003.  The S2
nails are designed to meet the needs of Level 1 trauma centers in the United States as well as broadening the Stryker product line in the rest of the world. 
Following an initial release in selected markets during 2003, the Gamma3
intramedullary hip fracture nail was fully launched during 2004 in the United States, Japan and throughout Europe.  The Gamma3 is based on more than 15 years of Gamma Nail
experience and is the third generation of IM short and long Gamma fixation
nails.  The new Gamma3 system is designed to facilitate minimally invasive
surgery and reduce surgery time through the use of newly designed implants and
new instrumentation.  The Asnis Cannulated Screw System can help simplify the
operative procedure through features that allow the surgeon to place, insert and
remove locking screws easily.

To
address the knee trauma segment, Stryker offers the Hoffman II Modular Fixation System and the T2
SCN Nailing System.  The Hoffman II knee-bridging frame is used to
stabilize injuries to the knee until definitive treatment with a plate, nail or
reconstruction option takes place.  In addition, Stryker offers the T2 SCN
Nail, which can be used for definitive treatment of supracondylar femur
fractures just above the knee joint. This nail can also be used for
periprosthetic fracture fixation for traumatic fractures in patients who have
already had a joint replacement.

Stryker
has four product lines for upper extremity trauma. The Numelock II Polyaxial
Locked Plating system is the only comprehensive, upper extremity, polyaxial
periarticular fracture fixation system on the market. The recently introduced
T2 Proximal Humeral Nail has been very well received and offers a minimally
invasive option for fractures of the humerus. The Universal Distal Radius Set complements
the stainless steel Numelock II with a titanium option in distal radius plates
and screws. The Universal Distal Radius Set offers a wide array of precontoured,
variable-sized plates for volar, distal and column approaches and both open
reduction and internal fixation techniques.


The Company's external fixation products
also include the Hoffmann II Compact, the Monotube Triax monolateral system,
the TenXor circular fixation system for complex fractures and a complete range
of pins and wires for attaching the devices to fractured bones. The Hoffmann II
Compact for upper extremity fractures includes a patented snap-fit mechanism
that makes it easy for the surgeon to construct the fixation device to fit the
patient and align the fractured bones, and it includes a full selection of
lightweight radiolucent connection bars that allow for quick intraoperative
fracture repair. The Monotube Triax system is available in three different
sizes and includes an adjustable feature that enables the surgeon to not only
stabilize fractures, but also to lengthen the bone in cases where bone has been
removed due to damage.  The TenXor hybrid frame enables a surgeon to treat
complex fractures around the joints with both pins and long transfixing wires. 
This attribute is especially useful for patients with multipart fractures near
the ankle and knee.  The system features advanced composite materials and is
compatible with the Hoffman II snap-fit connection devices.

Spinal Implant Systems

Through
Stryker Spine, the Company develops, manufactures and markets spinal implant
products including cervical, thoracolumbar and interbody systems used in spine
injury, deformity and degenerative therapies.  Spinal implant products comprise
plates, rods, screws, connectors, spacers and cages, along with proprietary
implant instrumentation.  In 2004, Stryker introduced OASYS, a new fixation
system developed to serve posterior cervical fusion, an emerging area of spinal
surgery. The product was introduced in the United States following a successful
launch in the European market during 2003.  Also in 2004, Stryker introduced
the Reflex Hybrid anterior cervical plate and the AVS vertebral spacer system. 
The Reflex Hybrid features the ability to utilize both fixed and variable angle
screws.  The AVS PL spacers represented Stryker's initial product offering in
the vertebral spacer category.

In 2004, the Company acquired SpineCore, a developer
of artificial lumbar and cervical discs.  Current products under development
include the FlexiCore lumbar artificial disc and the CerviCore cervical
artificial disc.  FlexiCore is currently involved in a U.S. clinical study under an approved investigational device exemption (IDE) granted by the FDA.  Following
the completion of enrollment in the clinical study during 2005, a 2-year
patient follow-up is ongoing prior to submission of a PMA application to the
FDA.  Submission of a PMA application for the FlexiCore disc is currently expected
to occur as early as 2007.  During 2005, the Company received clearance in Australia and CE mark approval in Europe for the FlexiCore implant.  Also in 2005, Stryker received
conditional approval for a U.S. trial of the CerviCore cervical disc
replacement and began to enroll patients in an approved IDE clinical study. 
Submission of a PMA application utilizing the resulting data from this study is
anticipated in 2009.

In
2003, Stryker extended the Xia Spinal System by adding a new, low-profile hook
system and additional components for anterior fixation.  Stryker Spine's other
products include Xia Titanium, Xia Stainless Steel, Diapason, Opus, OIC, Solis
and the Stabilis Systems.  The Xia Stainless Steel System, an offering within
the Xia Spinal System, is designed to better serve deformity correction
requirements, while the Xia Titanium System is a broad spectrum of posterior
implants designed to relieve pain by stabilizing the spine in the thoracic,
lumbar and sacral regions.  It is accompanied by instrumentation that
simplifies the surgical procedures.  Diapason and Opus represent the original
Stryker "Ball Ring Technology" that has been on the market for over 10 years.  Launched in international markets, the OIC, Solis and Stabilis systems are
novel interbody fusion devices designed to improve stability and alignment
during fusion.

Micro Implant Systems

Through
Stryker Osteosynthesis, the Company develops, manufactures and markets plating
systems and related implants for craniomaxillofacial and hand surgery.  In 2005,
the Company extended its Universal Fixation System for craniomaxillofacial
surgery with the addition of a facial trauma module.  This introduction follows
the addition, in 2004, of a cranial/neurological application system and a
distal radius fixation system for the hand surgery market.  In 2003, the
Company extended the Universal Fixation System with the launch of the Midface
System.  Also in 2003, BoneSource Classic was introduced, representing an
advance in Stryker's BoneSource line of products to include HA.  In addition, the Profyle System offers a wide range of
titanium plates and screws for hand surgery.


OP-1

More than two
decades ago, Stryker saw the potential that orthobiologic products held for
orthopaedics in an aging world and began a long-term investment in OP-1, a
proprietary, recombinant version of a signaling protein with multiple tissue
regeneration properties.  Initial interest focused on the bone growth
properties of OP-1.  OP-1 was originally discovered by Creative BioMolecules,
Inc. (a company that subsequently merged into Curis, Inc.) with which Stryker
funded a long-term development collaboration with a vision to develop the first
molecules to stimulate tissue regeneration. Stryker's first therapeutic
product, OP-1 Implant, is composed of recombinant human OP-1 and a
bioresorbable collagen matrix.  OP-1 is a natural protein that the human body
makes to induce bone formation. In preclinical studies, OP-1 induced the
formation of new bone when implanted into bony defect sites. Stryker was the
first company to enter clinical studies with a bone morphogenic protein, BMP-7
(or OP-1). Studies have been performed in two challenging clinical indications:
first, in nonunion fractures of long bones, and second, in revision
posterolateral spine fusion.

In
2001, Stryker received approval for a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) from
the FDA.  This approval in the United States is for the use of OP-1 Implant as
an alternative to autograft in recalcitrant long-bone nonunions where use of
autograft is not feasible and alternative treatments have failed.  An HDE, as defined
by the FDA, is for a product intended to benefit patients by treating or
diagnosing a disease or condition that affects fewer than 4,000 individuals per
year in the United States.  As of December 31, 2005, Stryker had more than 700
hospital Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals for OP-1 Implant in patients
in the United States under this HDE.

The
Company has received market approvals from regulators in Europe, Australia and
Canada for the indication of nonunion fractures of the tibia that failed prior
to autograft treatment or when autograft treatment is not feasible; for the
treatment of long-bone nonunions secondary to trauma for the purpose of
initiating new bone formation; or for the clinical indication of long-bone nonunions. 
The
Company filed a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) with the European
Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA) for certain OP-1 uses, and the MAA was accepted for filing in July 1999.  On December 14, 2000, the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP) in Europe voted unanimously to recommend market
authorization for OP-1 Implant (marketed in Europe under the name Osigraft) for
the indication of nonunions of the tibia that failed prior autograft treatment
or when autograft is not feasible.  Final European approval was obtained for
this indication in May 2001.  A New Drug Application with the Therapeutic Goods
Administration (TGA) in Australia was filed in December 1999, and in February
2001 the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) recommended the granting
of marketing authorization for OP-1 for treatment of long-bone nonunions
secondary to trauma for the purpose of initiating new bone formation.  Approval
from the TGA was received in April 2001.  In February 2002, the Company
received approval to market OP-1 in Canada for the clinical indication of
long-bone nonunions. Most recently, Switzerland granted approval to market a
form of OP-1 in 2004 for the clinical indication of nonunion tibial fractures.

With
this unique set of global approvals, the Company began to market OP-1.  During
the past 4 years, the increase in the number of patients treated has
demonstrated the success of the sales effort and the trust that surgeons have
developed in the product based on favorable patient outcomes.

In
the United States, Stryker Biotech received a further HDE in May 2004 for
revision posterolateral spine fusion following the completion of a pilot
clinical study that indicated possible benefit of a new formulation of OP-1,
known as OP-1 Putty, for this application.  As of December 31, 2005,
Stryker had more than 400 hospital IRB approvals for OP-1 Putty in the United
States under this HDE.

Demand
for OP-1 Implant and OP-1 Putty continued to increase during each quarter of
2005.  Stryker is committed to the further development of OP-1 for spinal
indications, including spinal stenosis.  This degenerative condition, which is
widespread in the over-65 population, causes severe pain in the lower back and
legs as a result of abnormal movement in the lower spine.  Spinal fusion is
used to stabilize the spine and reduce stenotic pain.  Fusing the spine with
OP-1 can eliminate the need for painful additional surgery to harvest bone from
the patient's hip to use in the fusion process.


Currently,
the Company is conducting a multicenter pivotal trial in the United States and
Canada for posterolateral spine fusion using the new product, OP-1 Putty, to
treat degenerative spondylolisthesis.  In 2003 the Company completed enrollment
in this trial.  The final 2-year follow-up evaluation of the 297 enrolled
patients was completed at the end of 2005, and the data from this study is
being evaluated and would be part of an anticipated PMA filing planned for the
first half of 2006.

Stryker
is also interested in exploiting the cartilage regeneration properties of OP-1
and has successfully completed preclinical studies showing that OP-1 can
stimulate new cartilage formation and increase disc height in animal models of
degenerative disc disease.  In 2005, Stryker filed its first Investigational
New Drug (IND) application with the FDA to treat degenerative disc disease with
OP-1 in a dose-ranging study in humans.

MedSurg Equipment

MedSurg
Equipment products include surgical equipment; surgical navigation systems;
endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; and patient handling
and emergency medical equipment.  These products are designed and manufactured
by Stryker Instruments, Stryker Endoscopy and Stryker Medical.

The
Stryker Instruments and Stryker Endoscopy product portfolios include
micro-powered tools and instruments that are used in orthopaedics, functional
endoscopic sinus surgery, neurosurgery, spinal surgery and plastic surgery.  The
Total Performance System (TPS) is a universal surgical system that can be
utilized within several medical specialties.  The TPS U2 Drill and TPS Burs are
designed for use by spine surgeons and neurosurgeons, while the TPS MicroDriver
and TPS Sagittal Saw are designed for use by sports physicians and plastic
surgeons.  The Elite attachment line with a proprietary extendable bar system
and Saber Drill for ENT surgery further extend the TPS system in spine, neurosurgery
and ENT applications.  The TPS System also powers Stryker Endoscopy Shaver
Systems.

Surgical Equipment

Through
Stryker Instruments, the Company offers a broad line of surgical, neurological,
ENT and interventional pain equipment that is used by all surgical specialties
for drilling, burring, rasping or cutting bone in small bone orthopaedics,
neurosurgical, spine and ENT procedures; wiring or pinning bone fractures; and
preparing hip or knee surfaces for the placement of artificial implants.  Stryker
Instruments also manufactures an array of different attachments and cutting
accessories for use by orthopaedic, neurological and small-bone specialists.

In the
fourth quarter of 2005, Stryker acquired PlasmaSol.  PlasmaSol has developed a
technology that should allow Stryker to provide sterilization equipment for use
with certain of its MedSurg Equipment products.  The Company is currently
working to advance the technology towards a commercial application prior to
obtaining necessary approvals from the FDA for sale of the final product.

The
introduction of the Maestro drill in 2005 expanded Stryker's line of micro
powered instruments for spine, neurology and ENT applications.  Employing the
pneumatic technology that is the preference of many surgeons in these
specialties, the Maestro drill leverages the Company's TPS and CORE platforms
by using the same cutting attachments.

In
2004, Stryker launched the CORE electric console for use with its line of CORE powered instruments.  The CORE platform console is a technological advancement on the
precision and versatility offered by the TPS console platform and offers
integrated irrigation, multi-handpiece functionality and a standardized user
interface.

In
2003, Stryker launched the CORE platform of micro-powered surgical instruments
in the U.S. market.  This platform includes specialty-driven handpieces,
including those for spine and neurosurgery procedures, providing increased
power and torque, greater speed and precision cutting.  The CORE platform is a technological advancement on the precision and versatility offered by the TPS
platform.


Stryker
Instruments also produces products that are utilized in conjunction with joint
replacement surgery.  In 2004, Stryker introduced the Revolution Cement Mixing
System, representing an improved design over its existing Advanced Cement
Mixing System.  The Revolution system is designed to provide one solution for
mixing all surgical cements, in addition to offering mixing efficacy, safety
and ease of use.  Interpulse is a disposable, self-contained pulsed lavage
system that is used by physicians to cleanse the surgical site during total
joint arthroplasty.  The ConstaVac CBC II Blood Conservation System is a
postoperative wound drainage and blood reinfusion device that enables joint
replacement patients to receive their own blood rather than donor blood.

In
2005, the Company advanced its postsurgical technology with the introduction of
the Block Aid PainPump System.  This device enables one product to meet the
needs of both site specific pain management and surgical site regional
anesthesia.  The Company also markets the PainPump2, a disposable system that
offers electronically controlled flow rates of pain medication directly to the
surgical site to help manage a patient's postoperative discomfort. This
innovative design allows the physician to program the pump and provides a
patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) option, previously unavailable to the market
in a disposable pump.  In 2003, Stryker made product improvements to the
PainPump2, allowing the pump to be programmed to extend continuous peripheral
nerve blockage during surgery and provide non-narcotic pain management
following the procedure.

As
part of a broad surgical product portfolio, Stryker works closely with
hospitals and other health-care organizations to promote safety for patients
and medical staff.  In 2005, Stryker introduced its next-generation Sterishield
T5 Personal Protection System, which advances its market-leading helmet, hood
and gown to help provide protection for operating room personnel from
infection, cross contamination and harmful microorganisms.  This system employs
advanced user-cooling features and provides the option for integrated
communication and lighting systems.  The Neptune Waste Management System
represents Stryker's leading product for waste management in the operating
room.  The self-contained device, first introduced in 2000 and consistently
improved, collects and disposes of fluid and smoke waste from surgical
procedures, minimizing the need for operator intervention and, therefore, the
risk of exposure to these waste products.  In 2004, the Company introduced the
Neptune Bronze platform, which provides a low-cost alternative to its operating
room waste management solution.

Through
Stryker Instruments, the Company offers SpinePlex, a variation of its surgical Simplex
bone cement for applications in both vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty.  In 2004,
Stryker also introduced a next-generation radiofrequency system for chronic
pain management that greatly enhances the user interface while simplifying the
system operation.   In 2002, Stryker acquired the Dekompressor product line from Pain Concepts Inc. The Dekompressor is a single-use disposable
device indicated for the percutaneous removal of disc nucleus material,
offering an early, less invasive approach to mitigating back and leg pain
associated with contained lumbar herniations.  This important advance in lumbar
disc pain management, along with Stryker's offerings in Percutaneous Cement
Delivery and Radiofrequency Denervation, allows Stryker to focus on the
Interventional Pain Management marketplace.

Surgical Navigation
Systems

Through
Stryker Instruments, the Company offers a broad line of surgical navigation
systems that offer surgeons in several specialties the ability to use
electronic imaging to see more clearly, align instruments better and accurately
track where the instruments are relative to the patient's anatomy during
surgical procedures.  During 2005 the Company launched a number of new products
across multiple surgical specialties to better serve the surgical navigation
marketplace.  To serve the knee implant market, eNact Knee 3.1 software was
introduced, further simplifying the procedure via reactive workflow by leveraging
Stryker's Smart Instrumentation and Camera technology.  This unique feature promotes
greater surgical efficiency because the software automatically reacts to the
surgeon's individualized procedural workflow.  To serve the implant
instrumentation market, the Company introduced the OrthoLock Anchoring System,
which allows for less invasive procedures and provides the surgeon a choice
between two and three pin tracker anchoring.  Also introduced was the Ortho
Grip Knee Pointer, which allows the surgeon to utilize an ergonomically
designed pistol grip instrument during the implant registration process.  Stryker also released two major advancements in its Neuro portfolio with Neuro
2.0 software and the Shunt Placement Tool.  Neuro 2.0 provides the surgeon with
the option of utilizing the Company's Mask technology to register the patient
without traditional fiducial markers and increases surgical efficiency by


significantly reducing intraoperative patient registration time.  The Shunt
Placement Tool provides a higher degree of accuracy for one of the most common
neurosurgical procedures by utilizing a dedicated instrument and corresponding
software designed specifically for the procedure.  In Spine Navigation, Spine
1.2 software was released for support of complex spine procedures, such as
multiple-level scoliosis repair, requiring intraoperative 3D CT data.  Also in
2005, a portable laptop Navigation system was introduced that has a smaller
footprint in the surgical suite, is easily portable, is cost efficient and
offers the functionality and technological advantages of Stryker's System II Cart.

The
Company launched the Navigation System II Cart and Camera as well as Hip 2.0,
Uni-knee, and Knee 3.0 for use with the Stryker Navigation System in 2004.  All
of these new product offerings are imageless platforms incorporating more
intuitive hardware and software functions that result in increased ease of use,
less invasive procedures and reduced surgical time.

Endoscopic, Communications
and Digital Imaging Systems

Stryker Endoscopy
produces and markets medical video-imaging and communications equipment and
instruments for arthroscopy, general surgery and urology.  Stryker Endoscopy
has established a position of leadership in the production of medical imaging
video technology and accessories for minimally invasive surgery, as well as
communications equipment to facilitate local and worldwide sharing of medical
information between operating rooms, doctors' offices and teaching institutions. 
Products include medical video cameras, digital documentation equipment,
digital image and viewing software, arthroscopes, laparoscopes, powered
surgical instruments, sports medicine instrumentation, radio frequency ablation
systems, irrigation fluid management systems, i-Suite operating room solutions
and state-of-the-art equipment for telemedicine and enterprise-wide
connectivity.  Stryker's line of rigid scopes, which range in diameter from 1.9
millimeters to 10 millimeters, contains a series of precision lenses as well as
fiber optics that, when combined with Stryker's high-definition (HD) camera
systems, allow the physician to view internal anatomy with a high degree of
clarity.

In 2005, the
Company acquired eTrauma.  The acquisition expanded the Company's endoscopic
and medical video imaging equipment product offerings by adding eTrauma's
proprietary Picture Archive and Communications System (PACS) image management
and viewing software.  The PACS software was complemented by the 2005 launch of
OrthoPad, Stryker's electronic medical records software.

In 2004, Stryker
introduced the next-generation 3-chip camera, the 1088HD, bringing
high-definition video to the operating room.  To accommodate the recording of
high-definition images, the Company introduced the Stryker Digital Capture (SDC) HD digital documentation system.  Another milestone was the introduction of best-in-class
scope technology with the U-500 FlexVision flexible ureteroscope.  Stryker also
launched its Formula shaver system, which is small, light and equipped with
radio frequency identification (RFID), facilitating communication between the
blade and console.

In 2003, Stryker
extended its market-leading 988 Digital 3-Chip camera by introducing a fully
autoclavable model for more efficient sterilization.  The 3-Chip cameras
continue to provide multispecialty video imaging through several product
generations.  In addition, the Company introduced the Stryker Integrated
Delivery Network (SIDNE), a voice-activated operating room network, in 2003.

Patient Handling and
Emergency Medical Equipment

Stryker
Medical is a leader in the stretcher products segment, offering a wide variety
of stretchers customized to fit the needs of acute care and specialty surgical
care facilities.  In 2004, Stryker Medical launched a completely new concept in
stretcher design, the M-Series Stretcher.  With a focus on patient safety and
product mobility, the M-Series features Stryker's Glideaway siderails, which provide
maximum coverage when raised and a zero-transfer-gap when lowered; a 700-pound
weight capacity; an integrated transfer board; and four-wheel, steel-ring
brakes for stability. The M-Series provides customers with three different
mobility options to suit their transportation needs: a fifth wheel for enhanced
steering, Big Wheel technology for increased maneuverability and the
self-propelled Zoom technology.  All three mobility options provide a safe and
comfortable surface for patients while reducing the risk of back injury for
hospital staff.


Stryker
also produces beds and accessories that are designed to fit the unique needs of
specialty departments within the acute care environment.  In 2005, Stryker
introduced the XPRT nonintegrated sleep surface with low air loss, percussion
and rotational functions to aid in the prevention and treatment of certain
ulcers and pulmonary care.  To better serve the emergency medical market,
Stryker introduced the revolutionary POWER-PRO ambulance cot in 2005.  Its
advanced electronic/hydraulic lift system enables emergency medical professionals
to effortlessly raise and lower the cot with the press of a button, which helps
mitigate caregiver back injuries.

In
2004, Stryker introduced the LD304 birthing bed, which features a removable
foot section with the unique Lock-Rite system.  Also introduced in 2004 was the
Go Bed II medical/surgical bed that features low bed-height for safe patient
ingress and exit.  The Go Bed II also offers the optional Chaperone
center-of-gravity bed-exit system with Zone Control to help prevent patient
falls.  Zone Control is a feature that enables the caregiver to adjust the
sensitivity of the bed-exit system to accommodate different patient needs.
Stryker has a complete line of ICU beds for critical care and step-down units. 
The beds incorporate advanced features that facilitate patient care, such as
in-bed scales that accurately weigh the patient regardless of bed position and
a radiolucent surface that facilitates chest x-rays without moving the patient
from the bed.  The Company's legacy of innovation in the prehospital market
continued in 2004 with the launch of the MX-PRO BT ambulance cot with a weight
capacity of 850 pounds for use in the emergency medical services transport
market.  To facilitate patient transport up and down stairs, Stryker offers the
STAIR-PRO series of stair chairs.

Other

The Other
category includes Physical Therapy Services.  Physiotherapy Associates provides
physical, occupational and speech therapy services to patients recovering from
orthopaedic or neurological illness and injury through a network of 488
outpatient physical therapy centers in 28 states and the District of Columbia. 
Physiotherapy Associates works closely with referring physicians to design and
execute rehabilitation protocols with the goal of quick recoveries for injured
workers, athletes and other patients.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

Most
of the Company's products and product improvements have been developed
internally.  The Company maintains close working relationships with physicians
and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist in product
research and development.  New and improved products play a critical role in
the Company's sales growth.  The Company continues to place emphasis on the
development of proprietary products and product improvements to complement and
expand its existing product lines.  The Company has a decentralized research
and development focus, with manufacturing locations responsible for new product
development and product improvements.  Research, development and engineering personnel
at the manufacturing locations maintain relationships with staff at distribution
locations and with customers to understand changes in the market and product
needs.

Total
expenditures for product research, development and engineering were $279.8
million in 2005,  $211.0 million in 2004 and $180.2 million in 2003.  Research,
development and engineering expenses represented 5.7% of sales in 2005,
compared with 5.0% of sales in both 2004 and 2003.   The higher spending level is
the result of the Company's continued focus on new product development for
anticipated future product launches and continued investments in new
technologies, together with, beginning in the third quarter of 2004, spending
associated with the continued development of products acquired in the SpineCore
acquisition.  Recent new product introductions in the Orthopaedic Implants and
MedSurg segments are more fully described under the caption "

Product Sales

" on pages 4 through 14 of this
report.

information regarding the Company's international and domestic operations and
sales appears in "

Note 12 - Segment and Geographic Data

"
on pages 57 through 59 of this report.

The
Company's business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of
orthopaedic implant surgeries is lower during the summer months.

COMPETITION

The
Company is one of five leading competitors in the United States for orthopaedic
reconstructive products.  The four other leading competitors are DePuy
Orthopaedics, Inc. (a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson), Zimmer Holdings,
Inc., Biomet, Inc., and Smith & Nephew plc.  While competition abroad
varies from area to area, the Company believes it is also a leading player in
the international markets with these same companies as its principal competitors.

In the trauma
implant segment, Stryker is one of five leaders competing principally with
Synthes-Stratec, Smith & Nephew Orthopaedics (a division of Smith &
Nephew plc), Zimmer Holdings, Inc., and DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc.

In
the spinal implant segment, the Company is one of four leaders, including the
principal competitors Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Inc. (a subsidiary of Medtronic,
Inc.), DePuy Spine, Inc. (a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson), and
Synthes-Stratec.

In
the micro implant segment, Stryker is one of four leaders, together with the
principal competitors Synthes-Stratec, Walter Lorenz Surgical, Inc. (a
subsidiary of Biomet, Inc.), and KLS Martin L.P.

Several
companies are engaged in the research and development of products for the
repair of hard and soft tissues that would compete with the Company's OP-1
product.  Medtronic Sofamor Danek has received FDA approval for its recombinant
bone morphogenetic protein ("rhBMP-2") for certain spine, trauma and
orthopaedic indications including the treatment of acute, open fractures of the
tibial shaft and spinal fusion surgeries.  A number of companies currently
provide various other therapies, including allografts, bone fillers and
electrical stimulation devices for the treatment, repair or replacement of bone
and joint tissue.  The Company believes that its OP-1 product, which is
approved for limited trauma and spine indications in certain markets and is
currently in clinical trials for other indications, would ultimately compete
with these products and with traditional therapies, such as autograft and
allograft.


In
the surgical equipment segment, Stryker is one of three leaders, together with
the principal domestic competitors Medtronic Midas Rex, Inc. (a subsidiary of
Medtronic, Inc.), and Linvatec, Inc. (a subsidiary of Conmed Corporation).  These companies are also competitors in
the international segments, along with Aesculap-Werke AG (a division of B.
Braun Melsungen AG), a large European manufacturer.

In
the surgical navigation segment, Stryker is one of six principal competitors
including Medtronic Surgical Navigation Technologies (a division of Medtronic,
Inc.), BrainLAB Inc. (a subsidiary of BrainLAB AG), Aesculap AG & Co. KG (a division of B. Braun Melsungen
AG), Radionics, Inc. (a subsidiary of Tyco International Ltd.), and GE Medical
Systems Navigation and Visualization, Inc. (a subsidiary of General Electric
Company).

In
the arthroscopy segment, the Company is one of four leaders, together with the
principal competitors Smith & Nephew Endoscopy (a division of Smith &
Nephew plc), Linvatec, Inc., and Arthrex, Inc.  In the laparoscopic imaging
products segment, the Company is one of four leaders, together with the
principal competitors Karl Storz GmbH & Co. (a German company), ACMI Corporation and Olympus Optical Co. Ltd. (a Japanese company).

The
Company's primary competitor in the patient handling segment is Hill-Rom
Company, Inc. (a division of Hillenbrand Industries, Inc.).  In the specialty
stretcher segment, the primary competitors are Hausted, Inc. (a subsidiary of Steris Corporation), Hill-Rom Company,
Inc., and Midmark Hospital Products Group (a subsidiary of Ohio Medical
Instrument Company, Inc.).  In the emergency medical services segment,
Ferno-Washington, Inc., is the Company's principal competitor.

In
the United States outpatient physical and occupational rehabilitation segment,
the Company's primary competitors are independent, therapist-owned practices
and hospital-based services, in addition to other national rehabilitation
companies, including Healthsouth
Corporation and NovaCare Rehabilitation (a division of Select Medical
Corporation).

The principal
factors that the Company believes differentiate it in these highly competitive
market segments and enable it to compete effectively are innovation,
reliability, service and reputation.  The Company is not able to predict the
effect that continuing efforts to reduce health-care expenses generally and
hospital costs in particular will have on the future sales of its products or
its competitive position.  (See "

Regulation
and Product Quality

.")  The Company believes that its competitive
position in the future will depend to a large degree on its ability to develop
new products and make improvements to existing products.  While the Company
does not consider patents a major factor in its overall competitive success,
patents and trademarks are significant to the extent that a product or
attribute of a product represents a unique design or process.  Patent or
trademark protection of such products restricts competitors from duplicating
these unique designs and features.  Stryker seeks to obtain patent protection
on its products whenever possible.  The Company currently owns approximately 820
United States patents and 1,330 international patents.

MANUFACTURING AND SOURCES OF SUPPLY

The
Company's manufacturing processes consist primarily of precision machining,
metal fabrication and assembly operations; the forging and investment casting
of cobalt chrome; and the finishing of cobalt chrome and titanium.  In
addition, the Company is the sole manufacturer of its OP-1 product. 
Approximately 9% of the Company's cost of sales in 2005 represented finished
products that were purchased complete from outside suppliers.  The Company also
purchases parts and components, such as forgings, castings, gears, bearings,
casters and electrical components, and uses outside sources for certain
finishing operations, such as plating, hardening and coating of machined
components and sterilization of certain products.  The principal raw materials
used by the Company are stainless steel, aluminum, cobalt chrome and titanium
alloys.  In all, purchased parts and components from outside sources were
approximately 44% of the total cost of sales in 2005.

While
the Company relies on single sources for certain purchased materials and
services, it believes alternate sources are available if needed.  The Company
has not experienced any significant difficulty in the past in obtaining the
materials necessary to meet its production schedules.


Substantially
all products manufactured by the Company are stocked in inventory, while
certain products manufactured within the Company's MedSurg segment are
assembled to order.

REGULATION AND PRODUCT QUALITY

The
Medical Device Amendments of 1976 to the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act;
the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990; and regulations issued or proposed
thereunder provide for regulation by the FDA of the design, manufacture and marketing
of medical devices, including most of the Company's products.

The
FDA's Quality System regulations set forth standards for the Company's product
design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records
and provide for inspections of the Company's facilities by the FDA.  There are
also certain requirements of state, local and foreign governments that must be
complied with in the manufacturing and marketing of the Company's products. 
The Company believes that the manufacturing and quality control procedures it
employs meet the requirements of these regulations.

Most
of the Company's new products fall into FDA classifications that require
notification of and review by the FDA before marketing, submitted as a 510(k). 
The Company's FlexiCore and CerviCore artificial disc products and OP-1
products require extensive clinical testing, consisting of safety and efficacy
studies, followed by PMA applications for specific surgical indications.

Stryker also is subject to the laws that govern the manufacture and distribution
of medical devices of each country in which the Company manufactures or sells
products.  The member states of the European Union (EU) have adopted the
European Medical Device Directives, which create a single set of medical device
regulations for all EU member countries.  These regulations require companies
that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in EU member countries
to obtain Community European (CE) marks for their products.  Stryker has authorization
to apply the CE mark to substantially all of its products.  The Company's OP-1
product has been considered a drug under the regulations for Europe, Australia
and Japan.

The
Company's Physiotherapy Associates, Inc., subsidiary is subject to various
federal and state regulations regarding the provision of physical therapy
services.  The primary entities administering these regulations are the Centers
for Medicare & Medicaid Services, CHAMPUS, state workers compensation
agencies, state insurance commissioners and state licensing agencies.

Initiatives
sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector to
limit the growth of health-care costs, including price regulation and
competitive pricing, are ongoing in markets where the Company does business. 
It is impossible to predict at this time the long-term impact of such
cost-containment measures on the Company's future business.

EMPLOYEES

At
December 31, 2005, the Company had 17,265 employees worldwide, including 6,041
involved in manufacturing, warehousing and distribution operations; 4,873 in
sales and marketing; 1,087 in research, development and engineering; 3,545
providing physical, occupational and speech therapy; and the balance in general
management and administration.  Certain international employees are covered by
collective bargaining agreements that are updated annually.  The Company
believes that its employee relations are satisfactory.

RISK FACTORS

The following
information contains specific risks that could potentially impact the Company's
business, financial condition or operating results.  The Company may be subject
to additional risks not currently known to the Company or those which the
Company deems immaterial that may also impact its business operations.

The
Company's inability to maintain adequate working relationships with healthcare
professionals could have a negative impact on the Company's future operating
results.

The Company
maintains close working relationships with respected physicians and medical
personnel in hospitals and universities who assist in product research and
development.  The Company continues to place emphasis on the development
of proprietary products and product improvements to complement and expand its
existing product lines.  If the Company is unable maintain these good
relationships it could decrease the Company's ability to market and sell new
and improved products which could unfavorably affect future operating results.

The Company's inability
to continue to hire and retain key employees could have a negative impact on
the Company's future operating results.

The talent and drive of the
Company's employees is a key factor in the success of its business.  The
Company's sales, technical and other key personnel play an integral role in the
developing, marketing and selling of new and existing products.  If the Company
is unable to recruit, hire, develop and retain a talented, competitive work
force it may not be able to meet its strategic business objectives.

Stricter pricing
guidelines for the Orthopaedic Implants industry could have a negative impact
on the Company's future operating results.

Initiatives sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and
the private sector to limit the growth of health-care costs, including price
regulation and competitive pricing, are ongoing in markets where the Company
does business.  The Company could see a negative impact on its operating
results due to increased pricing pressure in the United States, Japan, and
certain other markets.  Governments, hospitals and other third party payers
could reduce the amount of approved reimbursements for the Company's Orthopaedic Implants.  Reductions in reimbursement
levels or coverage or other cost-containment measures could unfavorably affect
the Company's future operating results.

The Company's operating
results could be negatively impacted by changes in its excess and obsolete
inventory reserves.

The Company maintains
reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential
inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current carrying costs.
The markets in which the Company operates are highly competitive, with new
products and surgical procedures introduced on an ongoing basis.  Such
marketplace changes may cause some of the Company's products to become
obsolete.  The Company makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of
the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete
inventories based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates
and expected future trends.  If actual product life cycles, product demand or
acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by
management, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which could unfavorably
affect future operating results.

The Company's operating
results could be negatively impacted if it is unable to capitalize on research
and development spending.

The Company has spent a significant
amount of time and resources on research and development projects in order to develop
and validate new and innovative products.  The Company believes these projects
will result in the manufacturing of new products and will create additional
future sales.  However, factors including regulatory delays, safety concerns,
or patent disputes could slow down the introduction or marketing of new
products.  Additionally, current and future clinical trials, including those
for OP-1 and SpineCore products, may have unanticipated issues that arise prior
to regulatory approval that could delay or cease a product's development.  The


Company may experience an unfavorable impact on its operating results if it is
unable to capitalize on those efforts by attaining the proper FDA approval or
is unable to successfully market these new products.

The Company's operating
results could be negatively impacted by future product liability claims, unfavorable
court decisions or legal settlements.

The Company is a defendant in
various proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of
business, including product liability and other matters.  Such matters are
subject to many uncertainties, and outcomes are not predictable with
assurance.  To partially mitigate losses arising from unfavorable outcomes in
such matters, the Company purchases third-party insurance coverage subject to
normal deductibles and loss limitations.  While the Company believes its
current insurance coverage is adequate to mitigate losses arising from such
matters, its future operating results may be unfavorably impacted by any
settlement payments.  Likewise, the Company may incur significant legal
expenses regardless of whether it is found to be liable.  In addition, such
product liability settlements may negatively impact the Company's ability to
obtain cost-effective third-party insurance coverage in future periods.

In December 2003, the Company
announced that it and its subsidiary Physiotherapy Associates, Inc., received a
subpoena from the United States Attorney's Office in Boston, Massachusetts, in
connection with a Department of Justice investigation of Physiotherapy
Associates' billing and coding practices.  In March 2005, the Company announced
that it received a subpoena from the United States Department of Justice
requesting documents for the period January 2002 through the present relating
to "any and all consulting contracts, professional service agreements, or
remuneration agreements between Stryker Corporation and any orthopedic surgeon,
orthopedic surgeon in training, or medical school graduate using or considering
the surgical use of hip or knee joint replacement/reconstruction products
manufactured or sold by Stryker Corporation."  The Company is fully cooperating
with the Department of Justice regarding these matters.  As a result of these
investigations, the Company's future operating results could be negatively
impacted by settlements of these matters.

The Company's operating
results could be negatively impacted by economic, political or other
developments in countries in which the Company does business.

Future operating results
could be negatively impacted by unstable economic, political and social
conditions including but not limited to fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates, political instability, or changes in the interpretation of or
creation of new laws and regulations in each of the countries the Company
conducts business, including the United States.  Additionally, the Company
operates in multiple tax jurisdictions and must determine the appropriate
allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions based on current
interpretations of complex income tax regulations.  Tax audits associated with
the allocation of income and other complex issues may result in significant tax
adjustments that could negatively impact the Company's future operating
results.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Executive
Level Overview

Stryker
Corporation (the Company or Stryker) is one of the world's leading medical
technology companies with the most broadly based range of products in
orthopaedics and a significant presence in other medical specialties.  Stryker
works with respected medical professionals to help people lead more active and
more satisfying lives.  The Company's products include implants used in joint
replacement, trauma, craniomaxillofacial and spinal surgeries; biologics; surgical,
neurologic, ear, nose & throat and interventional pain equipment;
endoscopic, surgical navigation, communications and digital imaging systems; as
well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment.  Stryker also
provides outpatient physical therapy services in the United States.

The
Company segregates its operations into two reportable business segments:
Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  The Orthopaedic Implants segment
sells orthopaedic reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma, spinal and
micro implant systems, bone cement and the bone growth factor OP-1.  The
MedSurg Equipment segment sells surgical equipment; surgical navigation
systems; endoscopic, communications, and digital imaging systems; as well as
patient handling and emergency medical equipment.  The Other category includes
Physical Therapy Services and corporate administration, interest expense and
interest income.

Domestic
sales accounted for 65% of total revenues in 2005.  Most of the Company's
products are marketed directly to more than 6,000 hospitals and to doctors and
other health-care facilities by approximately 2,800 sales and marketing
personnel in the United States.  Stryker primarily maintains separate and
dedicated sales forces for each of its principal product lines to provide focus
and a high level of expertise to each medical specialty served.

International
sales accounted for 35% of total revenues in 2005.  The Company's products are
sold in more than 100 countries through both Company-owned sales subsidiaries
and branches and third-party dealers and distributors.

The
Company's business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of
orthopaedic implant surgeries is lower during the summer months.

In the fourth
quarter of 2005, the Company completed the repatriation of $722 million of
foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act (the
Act).  The Act provided a temporary incentive for United States companies to
repatriate accumulated income earned in foreign jurisdictions at a reduced
income tax cost.  Additional details, including the financial statement impact
resulting from the repatriation of funds, are included in

Results of Operations

.

In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company acquired, by merger, all of the
outstanding stock of PlasmaSol Corp. (PlasmaSol).  PlasmaSol has developed
a technology that should allow Stryker to provide sterilization equipment for
use with certain of its MedSurg Equipment products.  The cost of the
transaction totaled approximately $17.5 million including an upfront cash
payment plus the assumption of certain liabilities.

In
the first quarter of 2005, the Company acquired, by merger, eTrauma.com Corp.
(eTrauma) for approximately $50.0 million in cash plus certain transaction
costs.  The acquisition expanded the Company's digital imaging equipment
product offerings within its MedSurg Equipment segment by adding eTrauma's
proprietary Picture Archive and Communications Systems (PACS) image management
and viewing software.

In
the third quarter of 2004, the Company completed its acquisition, by merger, of
all of the outstanding stock of SpineCore, Inc. (SpineCore), for an upfront
payment of $120.0 million in cash plus certain transaction costs.  SpineCore is
a developer of artificial lumbar and cervical discs.  Terms of the transaction
also include milestone and royalty payments of up to an additional $240.0
million upon the achievement of commercialization of SpineCore's products in
the United States, which is not expected to occur before 2008.  This
acquisition is


expected to enhance the Company's presence in the spinal implant
market, an important growth area within its Orthopaedic Implants segment.

Additional
details, including the financial statement impacts resulting from these
acquisitions, are included in

Results of
Operations

.

Outlook for 2006

The
Company's outlook for 2006 continues to be optimistic regarding underlying
growth rates in orthopaedic procedures and the Company's broadly based range of
products in orthopaedics and other medical specialties, despite the potential
for increased pricing pressure on Orthopaedic Implants products in the United
States, Japan and certain other foreign markets.  The Company projects diluted
earnings per share of $2.02 in 2006, including the recognition of the cost of
employee stock options as described in

Other Matters

. 
The projection represents a 21% increase over adjusted restated diluted net
earnings per share of $1.67 in 2005 calculated as follows:

Results of Operations

.

The financial
forecast for 2006 includes a net sales increase in the range of 11% to 14% as a
result of growth in shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment and
higher revenue from Physical Therapy Services, offset by unfavorable foreign
currency exchange rate movements.  If foreign currency exchange rates hold near
current levels, the Company anticipates an unfavorable impact on net sales of
approximately 2% to 3% in the first quarter of 2006 and an unfavorable impact
on net sales of approximately 1% to 2% for the full year of 2006.  Excluding
the effect of foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects annual net
sales growth in the range of 12% to 15% in 2006, which is comparable to the 14%
sales growth, excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rates, reported
for the full year of 2005.

2005 Compared with 2004

Stryker
Corporation's net sales increased 14% in 2005 to $4,871.5 million from
$4,262.3 million in 2004.  Net sales grew by 12% as a result of increased
unit volume and changes in product mix, 1% related to higher selling prices and
1% due to acquisitions.

Domestic sales were
$3,165.6 million for 2005, representing an increase of 15% as a result of
higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment and higher
revenue from Physical Therapy Services.  International sales were $1,705.9
million for 2005, representing an increase of 13% as a result of higher
shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  The impact of foreign
currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable
by $11.5 million for 2005.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency,
international sales increased 12% in 2005.

Worldwide
sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $2,855.1 million for 2005, representing an
increase of 11% as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive, trauma,
spinal and micro implant systems; bone cement; and the bone growth factor
OP-1.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of Orthopaedic Implants
increased 11% for the year.

Hip Implant Systems:

Sales of hip implant systems increased 4% during
the year, and also 4% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, due
to growth in the Trident hip system in Europe and the Pacific region and in
Accolade cementless hip products and Restoration Modular Hip System revision
hips in the United States, partially offset by lower sales of the Trident
ceramic-on-ceramic hip system and hip fracture products in the United States.

Knee Implant Systems:

Sales of knee implant systems increased 14%
during the year, 13% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, due
to strong growth in the recently launched Triathlon Knee System in the United
States, Europe and the Pacific region as well as the Scorpio knee system in
Europe, Japan and the Pacific region.


Trauma Implant
Systems:

Sales of trauma implant systems increased 15% during
the year, 16% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as a result
of the full-scale launch of the Gamma3 Hip Fracture System in the United
States, Japan and Europe in the second half of 2004.  Strong growth in the
Company's T2 Nailing System, both in the United States and internationally,
also drove trauma sales growth in 2005.

Spinal Implant Systems:

Sales of spinal implant systems increased 17%
during the year, and also 17% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange
rates, primarily due to strong sales growth of interbody devices in the United
States led by sales of the recently launched AVS spacer products as well as
solid worldwide growth in cervical and thoraco-lumbar product sales.

Micro Implant Systems:

Sales of micro implant systems increased 12%
during the year, and also 12% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange
rates, as a result of strong worldwide sales of implant products for hand
indications and solid domestic sales of products for neuro indications.

Worldwide
sales of MedSurg Equipment were $1,753.8 million for 2005, representing an
increase of 21% as a result of higher shipments of surgical equipment; surgical
navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as
well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment.  Excluding the impact
of foreign currency, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 20% for the year.

Surgical Equipment and Surgical Navigation Systems:

Sales of surgical
equipment and surgical navigation systems increased 16% during the year, and
also 16% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, due to strong
worldwide sales growth in the System 5 heavy-duty powered systems,
interventional pain products, SteriShield personal protection systems and
surgical navigation products as well as strong sales growth in the Neptune
operating waste management system in the United States.

Endoscopic, Communications
and Digital Imaging Systems:

Sales of
endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems increased 24% during the
year, and also 24% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as a
result of strong growth in medical video imaging equipment, led by growth of
digital imaging equipment and the 1088 High Definition Camera, and strong
growth in general surgery products in the United States, partially offset by
slower growth in arthroscopy in the United States resulting from the
discontinuance of allograft products during the year.

Patient Handling and Emergency Medical Equipment:

Sales of patient
handling and emergency medical equipment increased 23% during the year, 22%
excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, due to strong sales
growth in hospital and maternity beds and emergency medical equipment in the
United States and solid growth in stretcher sales in the United States.

Physical
Therapy Services revenues were $262.6 million for 2005, representing an
increase of 7% with all of the growth coming from new physical therapy centers.

Cost
of sales represented 35.2% of sales in 2005 compared with 35.4% in 2004.  The
lower cost of sales percentage in 2005 is partially due to increased average
selling prices for the Company's products and lower excess and obsolete
inventory costs associated with discontinued products partially offset by
faster sales growth in the lower margin MedSurg Equipment segment and higher
growth in royalty costs relative to sales growth.

Research,
development and engineering expenses represented 5.7% of sales in 2005 compared
with 5.0% in 2004.  These expenses increased 33% in 2005 to $279.8 million.  The
higher spending level is the result of the Company's continued focus on new
product development for anticipated future product launches and continued
investments in new technologies, together with, beginning in the third quarter
of 2004, spending associated with the continued development of products acquired
from SpineCore.  New product introductions in 2005 in the Orthopaedic Implants
segment included X3 Polyethylene, the Company's next-generation highly crosslinked polyethylene featuring a higher level of strength and wear
reduction in both hip and knee replacements, and the posterior-stabilized
version of the Triathlon Knee System in the United States, Europe, Canada and
the Pacific region.  Within the
MedSurg Equipment segment, new product introductions in 2005 included the
Maestro drill which expanded the Company's line of micro powered instruments
for spine; neurology; and ear, nose and throat applications.


Selling, general
and administrative expenses increased 10% in 2005 and represented 37.2% of
sales compared with 38.8% in 2004.  The decrease in selling, general and
administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2005 is due to lower meeting
costs and slower growth in advertising costs and insurance premiums relative to
the Company's growth in net sales.  These decreases are partially offset by an
increase in sales commission expense as a result of the 14% growth in net sales
in 2005 in addition to higher amortization expense associated with loaner
instrument sets.

The purchased
in-process research and development charge of $15.9 million recorded in the
fourth quarter of 2005 relates to the acquisition of PlasmaSol, a private,
development-stage company.  At the date of the acquisition, the
sterilization technology acquired had not yet been approved for sale by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and, therefore, had not yet reached
technological feasibility.  The purchase price of $17.5 million was
preliminarily allocated to assets acquired primarily for deferred tax assets
associated with acquired net operating losses and purchased in-process research
and development based on their fair value at the date of acquisition.  The
purchased in-process research and development charge of $120.8 million recorded
in the third quarter of 2004 relates to the acquisition of SpineCore, a private,
development-stage company.  At the date of the acquisition, the artificial
lumbar and cervical spinal disc implant technologies acquired were in
preliminary stages of clinical studies in the United States and had not yet
reached technological feasibility.  The upfront payment of $120.0 million,
plus certain transaction costs, was allocated to assets acquired, purchased
in-process research and development and liabilities assumed based on their
estimated fair value at the date of acquisition.

Interest expense, which is included in other income
(expense), increased to $7.7 million in 2005 from $6.8 million in 2004,
primarily as a result of increased borrowings in Europe to complete the
repatriation of foreign earnings in the fourth quarter of 2005.  Interest
income, which is included in other income (expense), increased to $13.3 million
in 2005 from $4.7 million in 2004, primarily due to increased cash and
marketable securities balances throughout the year.

The effective
income tax rate was 32.7% for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 35.0% for
the year ended December 31, 2004.  The reported effective income tax rate for
2005 reflects a charge of $27.4 million to recognize the income tax expense and
related liability associated with the repatriation of $722 million of foreign
earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act completed in
the fourth quarter.  The reported effective income tax rate for 2005 also
reflects the nondeductibility, for income tax purposes, of the $15.9 million
purchased in-process research and development charge associated with the
PlasmaSol acquisition.  The reported effective income tax rate for the year
ended December 31, 2004 reflects the nondeductibility, for income tax purposes,
of the $120.8 million purchased in-process research and development charge
associated with the SpineCore acquisition.  Excluding the impact of income
taxes on the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005 and the impact of the
purchased in-process research and development charges in 2005 and 2004, the Company's
effective income tax rate was reduced to 29.5% in 2005 compared with 30.0% in
2004, primarily as a result of increased manufacturing in lower tax
jurisdictions.

Net earnings in
2005 increased 45% to $675.2 million from $465.7 million in 2004; basic net
earnings per share increased 44% to $1.67 in 2005 from $1.16 in 2004; and
diluted net earnings per share increased 44% to $1.64 in 2005 from $1.14 in
2004.

Excluding the
impacts of the charges to write off purchased in-process research and development
in 2005 and 2004 and to recognize income tax expense associated with the
repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005, adjusted net earnings increased 23%
to $718.5 million in 2005 from $586.5 million in 2004.  Adjusted basic net
earnings per share increased 22% to $1.78 in 2005 from $1.46 in 2004, and
adjusted diluted net earnings per share increased 22% to $1.75 in 2005 from
$1.43 in 2004.

This adjusted
financial measure does not replace the presentation of the Company's reported
financial results stated under generally accepted accounting principles
(GAAP).  The Company has provided this supplemental non-GAAP financial measure
because it provides meaningful information regarding the Company's results on a
consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented.  Management uses
this non-GAAP financial measure for reviewing the operating results of its
business segments and for analyzing potential future business trends in
connection with its budget process.  In addition, the Company believes investors
will utilize this information to evaluate period-to-period results and to
better understand potential future operating results.  The


Company encourages
investors and other users of these financial statements to review its
Consolidated Financial Statements and other publicly filed reports in their
entirety and not to rely solely on any single financial measure.

2004 Compared with 2003

Stryker
Corporation's net sales increased 18% in 2004 to $4,262.3 million from
$3,625.3 million in 2003.  Net sales grew by 13% as a result of increased
unit volume and changes in product mix, 3% due to changes in foreign currency
exchange rates and 2% related to higher selling prices.

Domestic sales were
$2,753.0 million for 2004, representing an increase of 18% as a result of
higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment and higher
revenue from Physical Therapy Services.  International sales were $1,509.3
million for 2004, representing an increase of 17% as a result of higher
shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  The impact of foreign
currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable
by $120.8 million for 2004.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency,
international sales increased 7% in 2004.

Worldwide
sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $2,562.5 million for 2004, representing an
increase of 17% as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive, trauma,
spinal and micro implant systems; bone cement; and the bone growth factor
OP-1.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of Orthopaedic Implants
increased 13% for the year.

Hip Implant Systems:

Sales of hip implant systems increased 14% during
the year, 9% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  Sales
growth for hip products slowed during 2004 primarily due to tougher comparables
resulting from the launch of the Trident ceramic-on-ceramic hip system in the
United States in the second quarter of 2003.

Knee Implant Systems:

Sales of knee implant systems increased 18%
during the year, 14% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, due
to strong growth in Scorpio and Duracon knee systems in the United States.

Trauma Implant Systems:

Sales of trauma implant systems increased 17%
during the year, 11% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as a
result of the full-scale launch of the Gamma3 Hip Fracture System in the United
States, Japan and Europe in 2004.  Strong growth in the Company's T2
Nailing System, both in the United States and internationally, also drove trauma
sales growth in 2004.


Spinal Implant Systems:

Sales of spinal implant systems increased 18% during
the year, 15% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily
due to strong sales growth of cervical and interbody products in the United
States.

Micro Implant Systems:

Sales of micro implant systems increased 16%
during the year, 12% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as a
result of strong sales of implant products for hand indications and solid
domestic sales of implant products for neuro indications.

Worldwide
sales of MedSurg Equipment were $1,454.9 million for 2004, representing an
increase of 20% as a result of higher shipments of surgical equipment; surgical
navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as
well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment.  Excluding the impact
of foreign currency, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 18% for the year.

S

urgical Equipment and Surgical Navigation Systems:

Sales of surgical
equipment and surgical navigation systems increased 17% during the year, 15%
excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, due to strong sales
growth in heavy-duty powered instruments, interventional pain products and
surgical navigation systems both domestically and in Europe.

Endoscopic, Communications and Digital Imaging Systems:

Sales of
endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems increased 21% during the
year, 20% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as a result of
solid growth in digital imaging equipment and sports medicine products in the
United States.

Patient Handling and Emergency Medical Equipment:

Sales of patient
handling and emergency medical equipment increased 25% during the year, 23%
excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, due to strong growth in
hospital beds and emergency medical equipment both domestically and in the
international markets.

Physical
Therapy Services revenues were $244.9 million for 2004, representing an
increase of 10%, with 6% of the growth resulting from new physical therapy
centers and 4% of the increase coming from higher revenues at existing centers.

Cost of sales represented 35.4% of sales in 2004 compared with
36.2% in 2003.  The lower cost of sales percentage in 2004 is partially due to
increased average selling prices for the Company's products and improved
manufacturing efficiencies at several of the Company's manufacturing and
distribution facilities, including its Mahwah, New Jersey, manufacturing and
distribution facility, and lower purchase prices of raw materials, including
cobalt chromium and titanium alloys.

Research,
development and engineering expenses represented 5.0% of sales in both 2004 and
2003.  These expenses increased 17% in 2004 to $211.0 million.  The higher
spending level is the result of final development spending in advance of the
Company's product launches in 2004 and continued focus on new product
development for anticipated future product launches, together with, beginning
in the third quarter of 2004, spending associated with the continued
development of products acquired from SpineCore.  New product introductions in
2004 in the Orthopaedic Implants segment included the Restoration Modular Hip
System in the United States and Europe; the Triathlon Knee System in the United
States and Europe; the Scorpio NRG knee and CentPillar hip systems in Japan; a worldwide launch of the OASYS posterior cervical
fixation system; and a full-scale launch of the Gamma3 Hip Fracture System in
the United States, Japan and Europe.  The Triathlon Knee System represents the
Company's evolutionary design developed to more closely reproduce natural knee
motion and to provide mobility with stability through more than 150 degrees of
flexion.  Within the MedSurg Equipment segment, new product introductions in 2004
included a new video platform with the 1088 High Definition Camera, the
first fully digital, high-definition, progressive-scan medical video camera, and the new M-Series stretcher,
designed to fit the needs of acute care and specialty surgical care facilities.

Selling, general
and administrative expenses increased 17% in 2004 and represented 38.8% of
sales compared with 39.1% in 2003.  The 17% increase in selling, general and
administrative expenses is partially due to an increase in sales commission expense
as a result of the 18% increase in net sales in 2004, increased meeting costs
and higher amortization expense associated with loaner instrument sets.  In
addition, the Company incurred


a $12.1 million increase in insurance costs
during 2004 resulting from increased premiums charged by third-party insurers
and its wholly owned captive insurance company established in 2003 as more
fully described in

Other Matters

.

The purchased in-process research
and development charge of $120.8 million recorded in the third quarter of 2004
relates to the acquisition of SpineCore.

Interest expense,
which is included in other income (expense), declined to $6.8 million in 2004
from $22.6 million in 2003, primarily as a result of lower outstanding debt
balances.

The effective
income tax rate was 35.0% in 2004.  The reported effective income tax rate for
2004 reflects the nondeductibility, for income tax purposes, of the purchased
in-process research and development charge associated with the SpineCore
acquisition.  Excluding the effect of this nondeductible charge, the Company's
effective income tax rate was reduced to 30.0% in 2004 compared with 30.5% in
2003, primarily as a result of increased manufacturing in lower tax jurisdictions.

Net earnings in
2004 increased 3% to $465.7 million from $453.5 million in 2003; basic net
earnings per share increased 2% to $1.16 in 2004 from $1.14 in 2003; and
diluted net earnings per share increased 3% to $1.14 in 2004 from $1.11 in
2003.

Excluding the
impact of the $120.8 million purchased in-process research and development
charge recorded in 2004, adjusted net earnings increased 29% to $586.5 million
in 2004 from $453.5 million in 2003.  Adjusted basic net earnings per share
increased 28% to $1.46 in 2004 from $1.14 in 2003, and adjusted diluted net
earnings per share increased 29% to $1.43 in 2004 from $1.11 in 2003.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company's
working capital at December 31, 2005 increased $592.2 million to $1,621.3
million from $1,029.1 million at December 31, 2004.  The increase in working
capital resulted from growth in the Company's overall business and the use of
cash earnings to fund increases in accounts receivable, inventories and prepaid
expenses.  Accrued liabilities increased in 2005 as a result of the growth in
the business, higher obligations for acquisitions, sales commissions,
royalties, dividends and increases in other accrued liabilities.  Accounts
receivable days sales outstanding was 54 days at December 31, 2005 compared
with 58 days at December 31, 2004.  Days sales in inventory decreased 8 days to
114 days at December 31, 2005 from 122 days at December 31, 2004.  The decrease
in days sales outstanding and days sales in inventory at December 31, 2005 is
primarily due to improved asset management.


The Company
generated cash of $863.8 million from operations in 2005 compared with $593.3
million in 2004.  The increase in cash from operations in 2005 compared with
the prior year is primarily due to higher net earnings in 2005 and the
elimination of amounts outstanding under the accounts receivable securitization
facility representing an operating cash usage of $150.0 million in 2004 along
with the improvements in days sales outstanding and days sales in inventory.

In 2005, the
Company used cash of $271.7 million for capital expenditures, including $50.9
million for the expansion of the company's manufacturing facility in Lebanon,
New Hampshire; $41.5 million related to the implementation of ERP systems at
multiple manufacturing and distribution facilities; $27.3 million for the
construction of the Company's new manufacturing facilities in Portage,
Michigan; and $20.1 million for the Company's new manufacturing facility in Neuchâtel,
Switzerland.  In addition, the Company used cash of $59.7 million for
acquisitions and $36.2 million for the payment of dividends; it also purchased
and sold marketable securities.  These securities, which are classified as
available-for-sale investments in accordance with the provisions of Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 115,

Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

, totaled $565.3 million at
December 31, 2005.

In the first quarter of 2005, the Company acquired
eTrauma for approximately $50.0 million in cash plus certain transaction
costs.  The acquisition of eTrauma was accounted for using the purchase method
of accounting.  The results of operations for the acquired business are
included in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of
the acquisition and did not materially impact the Company's reported operating
results.  Pro forma consolidated results of operations would not differ
significantly as a result of the eTrauma acquisition.

The purchase price for eTrauma has been preliminarily
allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their
estimated fair value at the date of acquisition.  Based on the preliminary
purchase price allocation, $22.0 million was allocated to identifiable
intangibles, to be amortized over their remaining lives of 5 to 8 years, and
$31.6 million was allocated to goodwill.  Immediately
after the acquisition was consummated, management of the Company began to
implement an integration plan to combine Stryker and eTrauma.  In conjunction
with the integration plan, the Company recorded additional purchase liabilities
for severance and related costs of $0.3 million, which were included in the
purchase price allocation.

The Company had
$491.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and $565.3 million in marketable
securities at December 31, 2005.  The Company also had outstanding borrowings
totaling $231.6 million at that date.  Current maturities of long-term debt at
December 31, 2005 were $47.4 million.  The Company believes its cash on hand
and marketable securities, as well as anticipated cash flows from operations,
will be sufficient to fund future operating capital requirements; future
manufacturing facility construction and other capital expenditures; future
business and product line acquisitions to supplement its current product
offerings; loaner instrumentation for surgical implants in support of new
product launches; and required debt repayments.

In
November 2005, the Company established a $1,000.0 million Unsecured Credit Facility,
which replaced the previously outstanding $750.0 million Unsecured Credit
Facility.  The new facility, which expires in November 2010, includes a senior
term loan with an original principal amount of €190.0 million and a senior
5-year nonamortizing, revolving credit agreement with a maximum amount of
$1,000.0 million, less any outstanding amount of the senior term loan.  A total
of €190.0 million was drawn under the senior term loan to facilitate the
repatriation of foreign earnings and remains outstanding at December 31, 2005.

Should additional funds be required, the Company had $842.1 million of
additional borrowing capacity available under all of its existing credit
facilities, including the Company's $1,000.0 million Unsecured Credit Facility. 
In addition, the Company had $200.0 million of eligible accounts receivable that
could be sold through its accounts receivable securitization facility at
December 31, 2005.


The Company's
future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than 1
year, including agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of
business, are summarized as follows (in millions):

Critical Accounting
Policies

The preparation
of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements and accompanying notes.  Management evaluates these estimates and
assumptions on an ongoing basis.  Estimates are based on historical experience,
when available, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are
not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Management
believes that of its significant accounting policies (see Note 1 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements), an understanding of the following critical
accounting policies is important in obtaining an overall understanding of the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The
Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in
the collection of accounts receivable.  The Company makes estimates regarding
the future ability of its customers to make required payments based on
historical credit experience and expected future trends.  If actual customer financial
conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional accounts
receivable write-offs may be necessary, which could unfavorably affect future
operating results.

Inventory Reserves

The
Company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the
potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current
carrying costs.  The markets in which the Company operates are highly
competitive, with new products and surgical procedures being introduced on an ongoing
basis.  Such marketplace changes may cause some of the Company's products to
become obsolete.  The Company makes estimates regarding the future
recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for
excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience, expiration of
sterilization dates and expected future trends.  If actual product life cycles,
product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable
than projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required,
which could unfavorably affect future operating results.


Income Taxes

The
Company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the
United States.  Accordingly, management must determine the appropriate allocation
of income to each of these jurisdictions.  Tax audits associated with the
allocation of this income and other complex issues, including inventory
transfer pricing and product royalty arrangements, may require an extended
period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes
to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax
rates.  Because tax adjustments in certain jurisdictions can be significant,
the Company records accruals representing management's best estimate of the
probable resolution of these matters.  These income tax accruals are included
within the income taxes liability in the consolidated balance sheets.  To the
extent additional information becomes available, such accruals are adjusted to
reflect the revised estimated probable outcome.

Other Matters

The Company
distributes its products throughout the world.  As a result, the Company's
financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in
foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign
markets.  The Company's operating results are primarily exposed to changes in
exchange rates among the United States dollar and the Japanese yen and European
currencies, in particular the euro and the British pound.  When the United
States dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the dollar value of sales
denominated in foreign currencies increases.  When the United States dollar
strengthens, the opposite situation occurs.  The Company
manufactures its products in the United States, France, Germany, Ireland,
Switzerland, Canada and Puerto Rico and incurs the costs to manufacture in the
applicable local currencies.  This worldwide deployment of factories serves to
partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the
Company's cost of sales.

The Company enters into forward currency exchange
contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions
denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting risk to the Company
that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates.  These nonfunctional
currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables
arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products.  The periods of
the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the
exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the
measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional
currencies.

At December 31,
2005, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to
purchase $131.6 million and sell $92.1 million of various currencies
(principally United States dollars and euros) with maturities ranging
principally from 30 to 180 days.  The estimated fair value of forward currency
exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end
spot rates as adjusted by current forward points.  A hypothetical 10% change in
exchange rates for these currencies would change the December 31, 2005 fair
value by approximately $0.2 million.  The Company is exposed to credit loss in
the event of nonperformance by counterparties on its outstanding forward
currency exchange contracts but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of
the counterparties.

The Company has certain investments in net assets in
international locations that are not hedged.  These investments are subject to
translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currencies that are
deferred and recorded as a separate component of shareholders' equity.  For the
year ended December 31, 2005, the weakening of foreign currencies relative to
the U.S. dollar decreased the value of these investments in net assets, and the
related deferred gain in shareholders' equity, by $192.9 million to $17.0
million.

The
Company is partially self-insured for product liability claims and utilizes a
wholly owned captive insurance company in the United States to manage its
self-insured retention limits.  The captive insurance company provides
insurance reserves for estimated liabilities for product claims incurred but
not reported based on actuarially determined liabilities.  The actuarial
valuations are based on historical information along with certain assumptions
about future events.


In December 2003,
the Company announced that it and its subsidiary Physiotherapy Associates, Inc.,
received a subpoena from the United States Attorney's Office in Boston, Massachusetts, in connection with a Department of Justice investigation of
Physiotherapy Associates' billing and coding practices.  In March 2005, the
Company announced that it received a subpoena from
the United States Department of Justice requesting documents for the period
January 2002 through the present relating to "any and all consulting
contracts, professional service agreements, or remuneration agreements between
Stryker Corporation and any orthopedic surgeon, orthopedic surgeon in training,
or medical school graduate using or considering the surgical use of hip or knee
joint replacement/reconstruction products manufactured or sold by Stryker
Corporation."  The Company is fully cooperating with the Department
of Justice regarding these matters.

In
December 2004, the FASB issued a revision to Statement No. 123,

Share-Based
Payment

.  This revision supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB)
Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

, and its
related implementation guidance.  On April 14, 2005, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a new rule
allowing companies to delay the required adoption date of the revised Statement
to their first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005.  Based on this ruling, the Company will adopt the provisions of the revised Statement effective January 1, 2006 rather than July 1, 2005 as initially required by the revised Statement.  The revised Statement requires companies to recognize
the cost of stock options based on the grant-date fair value determined under their
employee stock option plans over the period during which the recipient is
required to provide services in exchange for the options, typically the vesting
period.  The Company plans to adopt the provisions of the revised Statement
using the modified-retrospective transition method provided in the revised Statement. 
Under this method, the Company will restate all prior periods presented on a
consistent basis, based on the pro forma expense previously disclosed under
Statement No. 123.  As a result, the Company's net earnings for 2005, 2004
and 2003 will be reduced by $31.6 million, $25.7 million and $19.1 million,
respectively, or $.08, $.06, and $.04 per diluted share, respectively.  The
Company does not believe the adoption of the revised Statement will have a
material impact on the trend of net earnings or net earnings per share.

FINANCIAL
	STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Board of Directors and
Shareholders of Stryker Corporation

:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Stryker
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005.  Our audits also
included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2.  These
financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Stryker Corporation
and subsidiaries at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the consolidated results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.  Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule,
when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the effectiveness of Stryker Corporation's internal control

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Stryker Corporation and Subsidiaries

December 31, 2005

NOTE 1

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Business

: Stryker Corporation (the "Company" or "Stryker")
develops, manufactures and markets implants used in joint replacement, trauma,
craniomaxillofacial and spinal surgeries; biologics; surgical, neurologic, ear,
nose & throat and interventional pain equipment; endoscopic, surgical
navigation, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient
handling and emergency medical equipment.  Stryker also provides outpatient
physical therapy services in the United States.

Principles of
Consolidation

: The Consolidated
Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned
subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions.

Revenue Recognition

: A significant portion of the Company's Orthopaedic
Implants revenue is generated from consigned inventory maintained at hospitals
or with field representatives.  For these products, revenue is recognized at
the time the Company receives appropriate notification that the product has
been used or implanted.  The Company records revenue from MedSurg Equipment
product sales when title and risk of ownership have been transferred to the customer,
which is typically upon shipment to the customer.  For its Physical Therapy
Services line of business, the Company records revenue when the services have
been rendered.  The Company records estimated sales returns, discounts and
other applicable adjustments as a reduction of net sales in the same period
revenue is recognized.

Shipping and Handling of
Products

: Amounts billed to customers
for shipping and handling of products are included in net sales.  Costs
incurred related to shipping and handling of products are included in cost of
sales.

Use of Estimates

: The preparation of these Consolidated Financial
Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires Company management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and
accompanying notes.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currency
Translation

: The functional
currencies for substantially all of the Company's international affiliates are
their local currencies.  Accordingly, the financial statements of these
international affiliates are translated into United States dollars using
current exchange rates for balance sheets and average exchange rates for statements
of earnings and cash flows.  Unrealized translation adjustments are included in
accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) in shareholders' equity. 
Transaction gains and losses, such as those resulting from the settlement of
nonfunctional currency receivables or payables, are included in net earnings.

Cash Equivalents,
Marketable Securities and Other Investments

: Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with a maturity of 3
months or less when purchased.  Marketable securities consist of marketable
debt securities and certificates of deposit classified as available-for-sale.  Other investments, included within other assets in the consolidated balance
sheets, consist of mutual funds, classified as trading, that are acquired to
offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation
arrangements and are expected to be used to settle these liabilities.  In 2004,
other investments also included marketable equity securities classified as
available-for-sale.

The
Company's marketable securities and other investments are stated at fair value
based on quoted market prices.  Adjustments to the fair value of marketable
securities and other investments that are classified as available-for-sale are
recorded as increases or decreases, net of income taxes, within accumulated
other comprehensive gain (loss) in shareholders' equity.  Adjustments to the
fair value of other investments that are classified as trading are recorded in
earnings as offsets to the related changes in liabilities under deferred
compensation arrangements.  The amortized cost of marketable debt securities
classified as available-for-sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums and
discounts to maturity computed under the effective interest method.


Such
amortization is included in other income (expense).  In addition, interest and realized
gains and losses are included in other income (expense).  The cost of
securities sold is based on the specific identification method.

Accounts Receivable

: Accounts receivable consists of trade and other
miscellaneous receivables.  The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful
accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable.  The
Company makes estimates regarding the future ability of its customers to make
required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future
trends.

Accounts Receivable
Securitization

: The Company has an
accounts receivable securitization facility pursuant to which certain
subsidiaries of the Company sell, on an ongoing basis, all of their domestic
accounts receivable to Stryker Funding Corporation (SFC), a wholly owned
special-purpose subsidiary of the Company, which in turn may sell, without
recourse, up to an aggregate of a $200.0 million undivided percentage ownership
interest in such receivables to bank-administered multiseller commercial paper
conduits.  Creditors of SFC have a claim to its assets before any equity
becomes available to the Company.

There
were no amounts of undivided percentage ownership interests in accounts
receivable sold by SFC under the facility as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. 
Accounts receivable sold are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet as
reductions of accounts receivable in the period sold.  The amount of
receivables available to be sold is subject to change monthly, based on the
level of defined eligible receivables less defined customary reductions for
servicing, dilution and loss reserves.  The Company's retained interest in
accounts receivable held by SFC, which is in the form of a subordinated note,
represents an overcollateralization of any undivided interest sold.  This
retained interest totaled $347.1 million and $320.3 million at December 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively.  Discount expense associated with the
securitization facility, including the conduit's financing cost of issuing its
commercial paper, was $0.7 million in 2005, $1.3 million in 2004 and $2.6
million in 2003 and is included in selling, general and administrative
expenses.

Inventories

: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or
market.  Cost for approximately 80% of inventories is determined using the
first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method.  Cost for certain domestic inventories
is determined using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) cost method.  The FIFO cost
for all inventories approximates replacement cost.

The
Company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the
potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current
carrying costs.  The markets in which the Company operates are highly
competitive, with new products and surgical procedures being introduced on an
ongoing basis.  Such marketplace changes may cause the Company's products to
become obsolete.  The Company makes estimates regarding the future
recoverability of the cost of these products and records a provision for excess
and obsolete inventories based on historical experience, expiration of
sterilization dates and expected future trends.

Property, Plant and
Equipment

: Property, plant and
equipment is stated at cost.  Depreciation is computed by either the
straight-line or declining-balance method over the estimated useful lives of 3
to 30 years for buildings and improvements and 3 to 10 years for machinery and
equipment.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

: Goodwill represents the excess of
purchase price over fair value of tangible net assets of acquired businesses
after amounts allocated to other intangible assets.  Other intangible assets
include developed technology, which is amortized on a straight-line basis over
20 years, and customer relationships (which reflect expected continued customer
patronage), trademarks and patents, which are amortized on a straight-line
basis over 4 to 40 years (weighted average life of 14 years for other
intangible assets).

Loaner Instrumentation

: Loaner instrumentation represents the net book value
of loaner instruments for surgical implants provided to customers by the
Company.  Loaner instrumentation is amortized on a straight-line basis over a
3-year period.  Amortization expense for loaner instrumentation is included in
selling, general and administrative expenses.


Income Taxes

: The Company accounts for income taxes using the
liability method.  Under this method, deferred income tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and
tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax
rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to
reverse.  Deferred income tax expense (credit) represents the change in net
deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year.

The Company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions both inside and
outside the United States and tax authorities in these jurisdictions regularly
perform audits of the Company's tax filings.  Accordingly, management must
determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions
based on current interpretations of complex income tax regulations.  Tax audits
associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues,
including inventory transfer pricing and product royalty arrangements, may
require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax
adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between
jurisdictions with different tax rates.  Because tax adjustments in certain
jurisdictions can be significant, the Company records accruals representing
management's best estimate of the probable resolution of these matters.  These
income tax accruals are included within the income taxes liability in the
consolidated balance sheets.  To the extent additional information becomes
available, such accruals are adjusted to reflect the revised estimated probable
outcome.

Derivative Financial
Instruments

: The Company uses
derivative financial instruments to manage the economic impact of fluctuations
in currency exchange rates.  The Company enters into forward currency exchange
contracts to manage these economic risks.  From 1998 through December 2003, the
Company entered into interest rate swap contracts with various maturity dates
to manage the economic impact of fluctuations in interest rates.

The
Company follows the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
Statement No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities

, as amended by Statements No. 137 and No. 138, in accounting for
its derivative financial instruments.  The Statements require the Company to
recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.  Derivatives that
are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through earnings.  If a
derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the
fair value of the derivative are either offset against the changes in fair
value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or
recognized in accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) until the hedged item
is recognized in earnings (see Note 2).

Legal and Other Contingencies:

The Company is
involved in various proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal
course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor,
intellectual property and other matters.  The potential future outcomes of
these matters are outside of management's complete control and will generally
not be known for prolonged periods of time.  In certain of the legal
proceedings, the claimants seek damages, as well as other compensatory relief,
which could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements.  In
legal matters for which management has sufficient information to reasonably
estimate the Company's future obligations, a liability representing
management's best estimate of the probable cost for the resolution of these
legal matters is recorded.  The estimates are based on consultation with outside
counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies.

Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Gain (Loss)

: The
components of accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) are as follows (in
millions):


Stock Options

: At December 31, 2005, the Company has key employee
and director stock option plans, which are described more fully in Note 8.  The
Company follows Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25,

Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees

, in accounting for its stock option plans. 
Under Opinion No. 25, no compensation expense is recognized because the
exercise price of the Company's stock options equals the market price of the
underlying stock on the measurement date (date of grant).  Had compensation
expense for the Company's stock-based compensation plans been determined based
on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under those plans consistent
with the method of FASB Statement No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation

, the Company's net earnings and net earnings per share would
have been as follows (in millions):

The
weighted-average fair value per share of options granted during 2005, 2004 and
2003, estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model, was $17.45, $16.83 and $15.19, respectively.  The fair value of options
granted was estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions:

In December 2004,
the FASB issued a revision to Statement No. 123,

Share-Based Payment

. 
This revision supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 and its related implementation
guidance.  On April 14, 2005, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a new rule allowing
companies to delay the required adoption date of the revised Statement to their
first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005.  Based on this ruling, the Company will adopt the provisions of the revised Statement effective January 1, 2006 rather than July 1, 2005 as initially required by the revised Statement.  The revised Statement requires companies to recognize
the cost of stock options based on the grant-date fair value determined under their
employee stock option plans over the period during which the recipient is
required to provide services in exchange for the options, typically the vesting
period.  The Company plans to adopt the provisions of the revised Statement
using the modified-retrospective transition method provided in the revised Statement. 
Under this method, the Company will restate all prior periods presented on a
consistent basis, based on the pro forma expense previously disclosed under
Statement No. 123.  The pro forma effect of adopting this Statement is
disclosed above and is not expected to have a material impact on the trend of
net earnings or net earnings per share.

Reclassifications:

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to
conform with the presentation used in 2005.


NOTE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT

The
following is a summary of the Company's investments (in millions):

The
net carrying value and estimated fair value of available-for-sale debt
securities at December 31, 2005, by contractual maturity, are as follows (in
millions):

Interest
income, which is included in other income (expense), totaled $13.3 million in
2005, $4.7 million in 2004 and $3.1 million in 2003.

The Company
enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of
currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies,
thereby limiting risk to the Company that would otherwise result from changes
in exchange rates.  These nonfunctional currency exposures relate principally
to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of
manufactured products.  The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond
to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses
included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the
nonfunctional currencies.  All forward
currency exchange contracts are marked-to-market each period with resulting
gains (losses) included in other income (expense) in the consolidated
statements of earnings.

At
December 31, 2005, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange
contracts to purchase $131.6 million and sell $92.1 million of various
currencies (principally United States dollars and euros) with maturities
ranging from 30 to 180 days.  At December
31, 2004, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to
purchase $137.7 million and sell $173.1 million of various currencies
(principally United


States dollars and euros) with maturities ranging
principally from 30 to 180 days.  The estimated fair value of forward currency
exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end
spot rates as adjusted by current forward points and is recorded as a component
of accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. 
At December 31, 2005, the Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance by counterparties on its outstanding forward currency exchange
contracts but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties.

From 1998 through
2003, the Company entered into interest rate
swap agreements that effectively converted a portion of its variable-rate
borrowings to a fixed-rate basis, thus reducing the impact of changes in
interest rates on interest expense during that period.  The swap agreements
fixed the Company's base rate on $250.0 million of its variable-rate
borrowings during 2003 at an average rate of 5.58%.  Pursuant to FASB Statement No. 133, as amended, the Company
recognized a gain of $9.2 million attributable to changes in the fair value of
interest rate swap agreements as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
gain (loss) in 2003.  Interest rate differentials paid as a result of
interest rate swaps were recognized as an adjustment of interest expense
related to the designated borrowings.

Prior
to 2004, the Company had used yen-denominated floating-rate borrowings to
protect a portion of the value of its investment in its subsidiary in Japan.  All yen-denominated borrowings previously outstanding were fully repaid during
2003.  Realized and unrealized gains and losses from this hedge were not
included in the consolidated statements of earnings, but were recorded as
foreign currency translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive
gain (loss) in shareholders' equity.  A net loss of $2.1 million attributable
to the yen-denominated floating-rate borrowings hedge was recorded as a foreign
currency translation adjustment in 2003.

INVENTORIES

Inventories are summarized as
follows (in millions):

NOTE 4

ACQUISITIONS

In
the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company acquired, by merger, all of the
outstanding stock of PlasmaSol Corp. (PlasmaSol), a private, development-stage
company.  PlasmaSol is a developer of a technology that should allow Stryker to
provide sterilization equipment for use with certain of its MedSurg Equipment
products.  The cost of the transaction totaled approximately $17.5 million
including an upfront cash payment plus the assumption of certain liabilities. 
The results of operations for PlasmaSol are included in the Company's
Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of the acquisition and did not
materially impact the Company's reported operating results.  Pro forma
consolidated results of operations would not differ significantly as a result
of the PlasmaSol acquisition.

The
purchase price has been allocated to assets acquired primarily for deferred tax
assets associated with acquired net operating losses and purchased in-process
research and development based on their estimated fair value at the date of
acquisition.  The amount of the purchase price allocated to purchased
in-process research and development resulted in a charge of $15.9 million, or
$.04 per diluted share, against the Company's 2005 operating results.  At the
date of acquisition, the sterilization technology acquired had not yet been
approved for


sale by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and,
therefore, had not yet reached technological feasibility.  The amount written
off as purchased in-process research and development was not deductible for
income tax purposes in the United States.

In the first quarter of 2005, the Company acquired
eTrauma.com Corp. (eTrauma) for approximately $50.0 million in cash plus
certain transaction costs.  The acquisition expanded the Company's digital
imaging equipment product offerings within its MedSurg Equipment segment by
adding eTrauma's proprietary Picture Archive and Communications Systems (PACS)
image management and viewing software.  The acquisition of eTrauma was
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.  The results of
operations for the acquired business are included in the Company's Consolidated
Financial Statements from the date of the acquisition and did not materially
impact the Company's reported operating results.  Pro forma consolidated
results of operations would not differ significantly as a result of the eTrauma
acquisition.

The purchase
price has been preliminarily allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition.  Based
on the preliminary purchase price allocation, $22.0 million was allocated to
identifiable intangibles, to be amortized over their remaining lives of 5 to 8
years, and $31.6 million was allocated to goodwill, which is not deductible for
income tax purposes in the United States.  Immediately
after the acquisition was consummated, management of the Company began to
implement an integration plan to combine Stryker and eTrauma.  In conjunction
with the integration plan, the Company recorded additional purchase liabilities
for severance and related costs of $0.3 million, which were included in the
purchase price allocation.

In
the third quarter of 2004, the Company completed its acquisition, by merger, of
all of the outstanding stock of SpineCore, Inc. (SpineCore), for an upfront
payment of $120.0 million in cash plus certain transaction costs.  The
acquisition of SpineCore, a developer of artificial lumbar and cervical spinal
disc implant technologies, is expected to enhance the Company's presence in the
spinal implant market, an important growth area within its Orthopaedic Implants
segment.  SpineCore's operating results are included in the Company's
Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of the acquisition and are not
material to the Company's operating results.  Pro forma consolidated results of operations would not differ
significantly as a result of the SpineCore acquisition.

The
purchase price has been allocated to assets acquired, purchased in-process
research and development and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair
value at the date of acquisition.  The amount of the purchase price allocated
to purchased in-process research and development resulted in a charge of $120.8
million, or $.29 per diluted share, against the Company's 2004 operating
results.  At the date of the transaction, the spinal implant technologies acquired were in
preliminary stages of clinical studies in the United States and had not yet
reached technological feasibility.  The amount written off as purchased
in-process research and development was not deductible for income tax purposes
in the United States.

Terms of the
transaction also include potential milestone and royalty payments of up to an
additional $240.0 million upon commercialization of SpineCore's products in the
United States, which is not expected to occur before 2008.

In 2003, the Company recorded a $6.5 million charge
related to a trademark impairment resulting from a branding initiative adopted
by the Company in that period.  The branding initiative is intended to improve
the Company's customers' and other stakeholders' overall awareness of Stryker's
capabilities.  The charge reduced the book value of a trademark within the
Orthopaedic Implants segment to its fair value as determined by using a
discounted cash flow model.  The charge is included in intangibles amortization
in the 2003 consolidated statement of earnings.

In
November 2005, the Company established a $1,000.0 million Unsecured Credit
Facility, which replaced the previously outstanding $750.0 million Unsecured
Credit Facility.  The new facility, which expires in November 2010, includes a
senior term loan with a principal amount of €190.0 million and a senior 5-year
nonamortizing, revolving credit agreement with a maximum amount of $1,000.0
million, less any outstanding amount under the senior term loan.  The Company
may increase the credit facility maximum limit in $100.0 million increments up
to an additional $500.0 million upon acceptance by the existing lender group or
additional lenders.  A total of €190.0 million was drawn under the senior term
loan to facilitate the repatriation of foreign earnings and remains outstanding
at December 31, 2005.


The
Unsecured Credit Facility requires a facility fee ranging from 0.04% to 0.15%
on the aggregate commitment of the credit facility, depending on the Company's
debt rating.  The credit facility includes a $500.0 million multicurrency
sublimit, under which yen and euro can be borrowed, a $100.0 million swing line
sublimit and a $100.0 million letter of credit sublimit.  The credit facility
bears interest at a base rate, as defined, plus an applicable margin ranging
from 0.12% to 0.475%, depending on the Company's debt rating.  The senior term
loan bears interest at a base rate, as defined, plus an applicable margin
ranging from 0.16% to 0.625%, depending on the Company's debt rating.

During
2005, the weighted average interest rate, excluding required fees, for all
borrowings under the current and previously existing credit and term loan
facilities was 2.7%.  The Unsecured Credit Facility requires the Company to
comply with certain financial and other covenants.  The Company was in
compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2005.  In addition to the
Unsecured Credit Facility, the Company has lines of credit, issued by various
financial institutions, available to fund the Company's day-to-day operating
needs.

Maturities
of debt for the five years succeeding 2005 are: 2006 - $47.4 million; 2007 -
$48.2 million; 2008 - $47.3 million; 2009 - $47.3 million; and 2010 - $41.4
million.

The carrying
amounts of the Company's long-term debt approximate their fair values, based on
the quoted interest rates for similar types and amounts of borrowing
agreements.

Interest paid on
debt, including required fees, was $8.1 million in 2005, $6.0 million in 2004
and $22.9 million in 2003; these amounts approximate interest expense, which is
included in other income (expense).

NOTE

CAPITAL
STOCK

On
April 20, 2004, the Company's shareholders approved an amendment to Section A
of Article III of the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation to increase
its authorized shares of common stock to 1 billion from 500 million shares.

On
April 20, 2004, the Company's Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock
split, effective May 14, 2004, for shareholders of record on May 3, 2004.  All
share and per share data have been adjusted to reflect the stock split as
though it had occurred at the beginning of all periods presented.


The
Company has key employee and director stock option plans under which options
are granted at an exercise price not less than fair market value of the
underlying common stock at the date of grant.  The options are granted for

vests ratably on the first five anniversary dates of the grant, provided that
the recipient is still employed by the Company.  The aggregate market value of
the restricted stock at the date of issuance of $3.4 million, as measured at
the quoted price of the Company's common stock, has been recorded as deferred
stock-based compensation, a separate component of shareholders' equity, and is
being amortized over the 5-year vesting period.

NET EARNINGS PER SHARE

The following table sets forth the computation of
basic and diluted net earnings per share (in millions, except per share

Options to
purchase 3.4 million shares of common stock were outstanding during the second
quarter of 2005, and 6.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2005, but were
not included in the computation of diluted net earnings per share because the exercise
prices of the options were greater than the average market price of common
shares for those periods.

RETIREMENT PLANS

Certain
of the Company's subsidiaries have both funded and unfunded defined benefit
plans covering some or all of their employees.  All of the defined benefit
plans have projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets.  The Company

The Company has assumed an average long-term expected
return on defined benefit plan assets of 6.3% as of December 31, 2005.  The
expected return is determined by applying the target allocation in each asset
category of plan investments to the anticipated return for each asset category
based on historical and projected returns.

The weighted-average allocation of plan assets by
asset category is as follows:

The investment strategy for the Company's defined
benefit plans is both to meet the liabilities of the plans as they fall due and
to maximize the return on invested assets within appropriate risk tolerances. 
Reflected below are target investment allocation ranges for the plans at
December 31, 2005:


The Company anticipates contributing approximately
$9.2 million to its defined benefit plans in 2006.

of the Company's retirement plan expenses was funded with Stryker common stock
totaling $6.3 million in 2005, $5.4 million in 2004 and $4.8 million in 2003. 
The use of Stryker common stock represents a noncash operating activity that is
not reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows.  The amount of
Stryker common stock held by the Company's defined contribution retirement
plans totaled $71.2 million (approximately 1.6 million shares) and $78.4
million (approximately 1.6 million shares) as of December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.  The value of Stryker common stock as a percentage of total
defined contribution retirement plan assets was 13% as of December 31, 2005 and
17% as of December 31, 2004.

NOTE 11

INCOME TAXES

In the fourth
quarter of 2004, the President of the United States signed the American Jobs
Creation Act (the Act).  The Act provided a temporary incentive for United States companies to repatriate accumulated income earned in foreign jurisdictions by
providing an 85% dividends-received deduction for certain dividends from
controlled corporations.

In the third quarter of 2005, the Company's Board of
Directors approved a plan to repatriate $722 million of foreign earnings under
the provisions of the Act.  The repatriation plan was completed in the fourth
quarter of 2005, and the Company recorded a charge of $27.4 million, or $.07
per diluted share, to recognize the income tax expense and related liability in
the United States associated with the repatriation.  The repatriated funds have
been invested pursuant to an approved Domestic Reinvestment Plan that conforms
to the Act.

Earnings before income taxes consist of the following
(in millions):

The
components of the provision for income taxes follow (in millions):


A
reconciliation of the United States statutory income tax rate to the Company's
effective income tax rate follows:

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.  Valuation
allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely
than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.  The tax effect of
significant temporary differences, which comprise the Company's deferred income
tax assets and liabilities, is as follows (in millions):

Net operating loss carryforwards totaling
approximately $39.7 million at December 31, 2005 are available to reduce future
taxable earnings of certain domestic and foreign subsidiaries.


Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are
included in the consolidated balance sheets as follows (in millions):

At December 31, 2005, tax authorities in several tax jurisdictions
both inside and outside the United States were conducting routine audits of the
Company's income tax returns filed in prior years.  These audits are generally
designed to determine if individual tax authorities are in agreement with the
Company's interpretations of complex income tax regulations regarding the
allocation of income to the various tax jurisdictions.  During 2005, the
Company did not reach resolution on any significant outstanding tax audit and,
therefore, increased its income tax accruals related to the Company's best
estimate of the probable resolution of these tax positions by approximately
$65.0 million.

No
provision has been made for United States federal and state income taxes or
foreign taxes that may result from future remittances of the undistributed
earnings ($1,165.0 million at December 31, 2005) of foreign subsidiaries
because it is expected that such earnings will be reinvested overseas
indefinitely.  Determination of the amount of any unrecognized deferred income
tax liability on these unremitted earnings is not practicable.

Total
income taxes paid, net of refunds received, were $247.8 million in 2005, $235.8
million in 2004 and $189.5 million in 2003.

NOTE 12

SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

The
Company segregates its operations into two reportable business segments:
Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  The Orthopaedic Implants segment
sells orthopaedic reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma, spinal and
micro implant systems; bone cement; and the bone growth factor OP-1.  The
MedSurg Equipment segment sells surgical equipment; surgical navigation
systems; endoscopic, communications, and digital imaging systems; as well as
patient handling and emergency medical equipment.  The Other category includes
Physical Therapy Services and corporate administration, interest expense and
interest income.

Effective
January 1, 2004, the Company changed its business segment reporting to include
the financial results of micro implant systems within its Orthopaedic Implants
reportable segment rather than within its MedSurg Equipment reportable
segment.  The Company believes these products are better aggregated with its
other Orthopaedic Implants based on similarities in manufacturing and marketing
practices and customer base.  Prior year results have been reclassified to
correspond with this change in reporting.

The
Company's reportable segments are business units that offer different products
and services and are managed separately because each business requires
different manufacturing, technology and marketing strategies.  The accounting
policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of
significant accounting policies.  The Company measures the financial results of
its reportable segments using an internal performance measure that excludes the
additional income taxes on the repatriation of foreign earnings recognized in
2005 and the purchased in-process research and development charges recognized
in 2005 and 2004.  Identifiable assets are those assets used exclusively in the
operations of each business segment or are allocated when used jointly.  Corporate assets are principally cash and cash equivalents; marketable
securities; and property, plant and equipment.

NOTE 14

CONTINGENCIES

The
Company is involved in various proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in
the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor,
intellectual property and other matters.  Such matters are subject to many
uncertainties, and outcomes are not predictable with assurance.  The Company
records amounts for losses that are deemed to be probable and subject to
reasonable estimate.  However, the Company does not anticipate material losses
as a result of these proceedings beyond amounts already provided in the
accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.

In
December 2003, the Company announced that its subsidiary Physiotherapy
Associates, Inc., and Stryker received a subpoena from the United States
Attorney's Office in Boston, Massachusetts, in connection with a Department of
Justice investigation of Physiotherapy Associates' billing and coding
practices.  In March 2005, the Company announced that it received a subpoena
from the United States Department of Justice requesting documents relating to
"any and all consulting contracts, professional service agreements, or
remuneration agreements between Stryker Corporation and any orthopedic surgeon,
orthopedic surgeon in training, or medical school graduate using or considering
the surgical use of hip or knee joint replacement/reconstruction products
manufactured or sold by Stryker Corporation."  The Company is fully
cooperating with the Department of Justice regarding these matters.

Pursuant
to certain of the Company's credit and lease agreements, the Company has
provided financial guarantees to third parties in the form of indemnification
provisions.  These provisions indemnify the third parties for costs, including
but not limited to adverse judgments in lawsuits and the imposition of
additional taxes due to either a change in the tax law or an adverse
interpretation of the tax law.  The terms of the guarantees are equal to the
terms of the related credit or lease agreements.  The Company is not able to
calculate the maximum potential amount of future payments it could be required
to make under these guarantees, as the potential payment is dependent on the
occurrence of future unknown events (e.g., changes in United States or foreign
tax laws).

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

- An
evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e)) as of December 31, 2005 was carried out under the supervision
and with the participation of the Company's management, including the President
and Chief Executive Officer and the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
(the Certifying Officers).  Based on that evaluation, the
Certifying Officers concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and
procedures are effective to bring to the attention of the Company's management
the relevant information necessary to permit an assessment of the need to
disclose material developments and risks pertaining to the Company's business
in its periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  There was
no change to the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the
quarter ended December 31, 2005 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely
to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Management's
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

- The management of Stryker Corporation is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f).  Stryker
Corporation's internal control system is designed to provide reasonable
assurance to the Company's management and Board of Directors regarding the
preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.

Stryker
Corporation's management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 under the supervision
and with the participation of the Certifying Officers.  In making this
assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission in

Internal Control-Integrated
Framework

.  Based on that assessment, management believes that, as of
December 31, 2005, the Company's internal control over financial reporting is
effective.

Stryker
Corporation's independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young
LLP, has issued an attestation report on management's assessment of the
Company's internal control over financial reporting.  This report appears on
the following page.

Other
Matters

- The Company has begun the
process of implementing new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems at
certain of its divisions.  An ERP system is a fully-integrated set of programs
and databases that incorporate order processing, production planning and
scheduling, purchasing, accounts receivable and inventory management and
accounting.  During the first quarter of 2006, the Company's Orthopaedics and Spine
divisions began to transition to their new ERP systems.  The Company
anticipates its Endoscopy division will begin to transition to its new ERP
system in the third quarter of 2006.  In connection with these ERP system
implementations, the Company will update its internal controls over financial
reporting, as necessary, to accommodate modifications to its business processes
and accounting procedures.  The Company does not believe that these ERP system
implementations will have an adverse effect on the Company's internal control
over financial reporting.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Stryker Corporation

:

We have audited
management's assessment, included in the accompanying Management Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Stryker Corporation and
subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).  The Company's
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on management's assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audit
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company's internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, management's assessment that Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO
criteria.  Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2005, based on the COSO criteria.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of
Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the
related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders' equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005, and
our report dated February 3, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
