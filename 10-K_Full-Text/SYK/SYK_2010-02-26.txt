PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS.

GENERAL

Stryker Corporation (the Company or Stryker) is one of the world’s leading medical technology companies with the most broadly based
range of products in orthopaedics and a significant presence in other medical specialties. Stryker works with respected medical professionals to help people lead more active and more satisfying lives. The Company’s products include implants
used in joint replacement, trauma, spinal and craniomaxillofacial surgeries; surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems, endoscopic and communications systems; patient handling and emergency medical equipment as well as other medical device
products used in a variety of medical specialties. Stryker was incorporated in Michigan in 1946 as the successor company to a business founded in 1941 by Dr. Homer H. Stryker, a leading orthopaedic surgeon and the inventor of several
orthopaedic products.

Stryker’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including its annual
report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, are accessible free of charge at www.stryker.com within the “Investor—SEC Filings & Ownership Reports” link.

In 2009 the Company acquired Ascent Healthcare Solutions, Inc. for $525 million in an all cash transaction. In 2007 the Company completed
the sale of its outpatient physical therapy business, Physiotherapy Associates, for $150 million in cash less certain indebtedness. Physiotherapy Associates’ operating results are reported as discontinued operations for the year ended
December 31, 2007.

PRODUCT SALES

The Company segregates its operations into two reportable business segments: Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The Orthopaedic Implants segment sells orthopaedic reconstructive (hip and knee),
trauma and spinal implant systems and other related products. The MedSurg Equipment segment sells surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems; endoscopic and communications systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment.
The following amounts and percentages represent domestic/international and business segment net sales during each of the three years ended December 31 (dollars in millions):

Additional financial information regarding the Company’s operating segments and geographic
areas can be found under the captions

Results of Operations

in Item 7 of this report and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

Approximately 77% of the Company’s sales in 2009 and 74% in both 2008 and 2007 consisted of products with short lives, such as
reconstructive, trauma, craniomaxillofacial and spinal implant systems (while implants



have a long useful life to the patient, they have a one-time use to the hospital); disposables and expendable tools; and parts and service revenues, including service and repair charges. The
balance of sales in each of the years came from products that could be considered capital equipment, having useful lives in excess of one year.

The Company’s backlog of firm orders is not considered material to an understanding of its business.

Orthopaedic Implants

Orthopaedic Implants are designed and manufactured by Stryker Orthopaedics, Stryker
Osteosynthesis, Stryker Spine and Stryker Biotech and consist of such products as implants used in joint replacement, trauma, craniomaxillofacial and spinal surgeries; bone cement; and the bone growth factor OP-1. Artificial joints are made of
cobalt chromium, titanium alloys, ceramics or ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene and are implanted in patients whose natural joints have been damaged by arthritis, osteoporosis, other diseases or injury. Many of Stryker’s technologically
advanced reconstructive implants are suited to minimally invasive surgery (MIS) procedures that are intended to reduce soft-tissue damage and pain while hastening return to function. The Company supports surgeons with technology, procedural
development and specialized instrumentation as they develop new MIS techniques.

Hip Implant Systems

Through Stryker Orthopaedics, the Company offers a variety of hip implant systems for the global reconstructive market. The ABG Hip System,
Partnership Hip System, Secur-Fit Hip System, Omnifit Hip System, Accolade Hip System, Centpillar Hip System, Trident Acetabular Hip System, ADM Mobile Bearing Hip System, Rejuvenate Modular Primary Hip System, Cormet Hip Resurfacing System and
Restoration Hip System are all comprehensive systems of hip implants and associated instrumentation designed to provide physicians and patients with reliable clinical results across the continuum of care, while enhancing value and operating room
efficiency for the hospital.

During 2009 significant clinical milestones for the Company were met, including 40 years of
clinical history with the Exeter Hip System, 25 years of clinical history with the Dall-Miles Cable System, more than 20 years of clinical history with the Omnifit HA stem, and more than 10 years clinical history with Accolade TMZF Hip System.
Stryker is committed to following clinical outcomes and recognizes that long-term clinical results are an important factor in the Company’s ability to market hip implants.

Stryker was the first company to receive clearance from the FDA to commercially release for sale in the United States a hip implant with
hydroxylapatite (HA) surface treatment. HA is a naturally occurring calcium phosphate material that demonstrates a high level of biocompatibility due to its resemblance to bone. The Company’s global clinical experience with HA-coated hip stems
now extends over 20 years, and reported clinical performance continues to equal or exceed that of comparable hip stems reported in the scientific literature.

Primary Femoral Hip Systems:

In 2009 Stryker introduced the Rejuvenate
Modular Primary Hip System, the latest evolution in the Company’s OmniFit and Secur-Fit hip systems. The Rejuvenate Modular Primary Hip System offers surgeons unparalleled options for personalizing the implant to each patient’s anatomy.
The Rejuvenate System is designed to optimize anatomic restoration by providing options that offer enhanced stability, proven modularity and introperative flexibility. The modular design enables the surgeon to independently manage stem size, leg
length, version and offset to recreate the patient’s anatomy, restore biomechanics and, consequently, minimize the risk of dislocation.

The Accolade TMZF Hip System has demonstrated strong clinical results for more than 10 years, with 2009 marking the first introduction of the product into Japan. Recognized for simplicity, and flexible to
accommodate all surgical approaches and navigation, the Accolade TMZF System is a tapered wedge implant, based on a broach only technique.



The ABG II Modular Hip System, released in Europe in 2007, represents the next generation of
design based on the ABG monolithic stem that has had positive clinical experience for more than 10 years. This modular primary hip stem provides the opportunity to recreate patient anatomy through independent sizing of the stem and neck. Versatile
instrumentation also accommodates surgeon preference for a navigated procedure or direct anterior surgical approach.

The
Company’s Exeter Total Hip System is based on a collarless, highly polished, double-tapered femoral design that reduces shear stresses and increases compression at the cement/bone interface.

Primary Acetabular Systems:

The Company’s advanced bearing system, Low Friction Ion Treatment (LFIT) Anatomic Femoral Heads with X3 polyethylene liners represents a significant advance in hip-bearing technology through the combination of Stryker’s LFIT
technology and X3 advanced bearing technology. The femoral heads are anatomically sized for more natural hip performance. In 2007 the Company further expanded its anatomic femoral head offerings with the introduction of the Biolox Delta Ceramic
Anatomic head for even greater options to reduce wear and potentially increase implant longevity. X3 advanced bearing technology is the Company’s highly crosslinked polyethylene, which demonstrates enhanced material characteristics in
laboratory testing, including improved strength, reduced wear and oxidation resistance. This second generation bearing option offers a significant technological advance for both hip and knee replacements.

The Company received premarket approval (PMA) from the FDA in 2003 for its ceramic-on-ceramic hip replacement system, the Trident Ceramic
Acetabular Insert, for patients in the United States. Stryker Orthopaedics has successfully launched the Trident ceramic insert in the United States, Europe, Australia and Canada. The Trident insert has demonstrated low wear clinically, and it is
protected and strengthened by a patented titanium sleeve.

In 2009 the Company introduced the Primary Tritanium Shell in Latin
America, Australia, and Europe following a US launch in 2008. Introduction of this highly porous surface into the primary hip market provides an enhanced fixation acetabular solution that was previously not available for primary use.

Hip Fracture Hip Systems:

Stryker offers a broad array of femoral stem options and bearings to accommodate the hip fracture patient including the Accolade HFx stem and the UHR bipolar head.

Revision Hip Systems:

The Restoration Modular Revision Hip System offers
surgeons performing revision surgeries flexibility in treating complex hip stem revisions and restoring patient biomechanics. The Restoration Modular Revision Hip System also takes advantage of Stryker’s long clinical history with HA by
incorporating PureFix HA coating on many components. The Restoration Modular Revision Hip System complements the Company’s existing Restoration HA and Restoration plasma spray (PS) monolithic revision systems.

The Company’s Trident Tritanium Acetabular Shell contains a highly porous surface that closely resembles the structure of bone. This
shell is designed for revision surgery and contains multiple screw holes to achieve bone fixation and initial stability.

Resurfacing Hip
Systems:

In 2007 the Company began selling the Cormet Hip Resurfacing System in the United States pursuant to an exclusive
10-year marketing and distribution agreement with Corin Group PLC following the initial launch of



another hip resurfacing product in certain international markets. These products represent a less invasive option for younger patients who have the potential for enhanced stability and range of
motion. In hip resurfacing procedures, very little bone is removed from the femoral head, the femoral neck is preserved and the femoral canal is spared.

Knee Implant Systems

The Company offers three major knee implant systems:
Triathlon, Scorpio and the Global Modular Replacement System (GMRS).

The Triathlon Knee System represents the Company’s
evolutionary design that has been developed to more closely reproduce natural knee motion and is designed to provide mobility with stability through more than 150 degrees of flexion. The Triathlon Knee instrumentation is designed to improve
operating room efficiency through a streamlined, integrated system providing options and flexibility to meet surgeons’ varying preferences and multiple surgical techniques. In 2008, Stryker continued to expand the Triathlon brand with the
Trtiathlon Partial Knee Resurfacing (PKR) offering in the uni-condylar market segment. The PKR incorporates the single radius design to provide the potential for better ligament balancing. PKR also offers value and efficiency in the femoral
component design by only requiring one femoral cutting block for preparation of all sizes of femoral components. In 2007 Stryker introduced the condylar stabilizing (CS) ultra-congruent insert for the Triathlon Knee System. The Triathlon CS insert
is a high-performance insert designed to provide patients with more natural motion and the potential for greater implant longevity. The Company also offers the X3 advanced bearing technology as well as anterior referencing instruments for use with
the Triathlon Knee System. The Company also offers a posteriorly stabilized (PS) version of the Triathlon knee and a cruciate-retaining (CR) version.

The GMRS is a global product that offers a comprehensive solution for severe bone loss in oncology, trauma and revision surgery patients. GMRS has tibial and femoral components, including a total femur,
and a modular rotating hinge knee. The system employs both titanium and cobalt chrome alloys for strength and lightness of weight, together with the superior flexibility of the hinge. The MRS, the predecessor to the GMRS, was the first modular
segmental replacement system when it was introduced in 1988. These system components have maintained a leadership position in this market segment since their introduction.

The Scorpio knee implant design is based on the epicondylar axis of the knee. This patented approach addresses significant clinical issues,
such as improved patient rehabilitation and midflexion stability, through an increase in the patella-femoral moment arm and a single anterior-posterior radius. The Scorpio HA CR product is designed to minimize polyethylene wear and the Scorpio HA PS
product features a minimally invasive open box design and maximized stability. The ScorpioFlex, which is available for both posterior cruciate-retaining and cruciate-substituting indications, is specifically designed for patients who have the
ability and motivation to return to high-flexion activities such as gardening and golfing.The Scorpio NRG provides additional kinematic benefits over ScorpioFlex, including increased rotational allowance, an articulating design for deeper flexion
and greater extension allowance without impingement. In 2007 the Scorpio NRG with X3 advanced bearing technology was launched. This new version of the Scorpio NRG is designed to lower wear rates compared with standard inserts. The Scorpio System is
supported by the Passport instrumentation system, which was designed to provide intraoperative flexibility and precision as well as a simple, cost-effective approach to total knee replacement surgery.

Other Joint Replacement Products

The Company develops and markets shoulder and elbow replacement implants, as well as associated instrumentation. The Solar Shoulder portfolio provides surgeons with increased intra-operative flexibility to restore the patient’s
shoulder functionality and pain relief. These products are marketed worldwide under the ReUnion and Solar brands.



Bone Cement

Simplex bone cement, a material used to secure cemented implants to bone, was first approved for orthopaedic use in the United States in 1971 and is the most widely used bone cement in the world. The
Company manufactures and provides several variations of Simplex bone cement to meet specific patient needs. Simplex has nearly 50 years of clinical history, the longest of any bone cement, with more than 400 published clinical papers.

Trauma Implant Systems

Through Stryker Osteosynthesis, the Company develops, manufactures and markets trauma, extremities and deformity correction systems. These systems include Intramedullary (IM) and cephlomedullary nails, locked and non-locked plating, hip
fracture solutions and external fixation systems, as well as bone substitutes that are used primarily for the treatment of traumatic injuries.

The Company’s internal fixation portfolio includes a full array of IM & cephlomedullary nails; hip fracture solutions, including compression hip screws, canulated screws, as well as
anatomically designed plates and screws in both titanium and stainless steel. These products provide a restorative option prior to joint reconstruction. These products are marketed worldwide as leading brands such as Gamma3, Asnis III, AxSOS,
VariAx, HydroSet, and T2.

The Company’s external fixation portfolio includes products such as Hoffmann II MRI, Hoffmann
Xpress, Monotube Triax mono-lateral, as well as the Hoffmann II Hybrid (TenXor) circular fixation systems. These systems are used to construct frames for bone stabilization that are either definitive or as a temporary step in the treatment process
associated with damage control orthopaedics. Hoffmann systems have been defined by their ease of assembly with “snap-fit” couplers. The use of a proprietary Vectran coating on the bars makes Hoffmann II MRI an MRI compatible solution.

The Company also offers a product portfolio for the treatment of fractures and injuries of the extremities. These products
include fracture specific locked plating for the wrist, shoulder and foot, as well as bone substitutes and external fixation systems. These are all designed to treat the unique nature of upper extremity injuries. These products are marketed
worldwide under the brands VariAx, AxSOS, and Hoffmann.

The VariAx Distal Radius System offers surgeons a comprehensive
solution for the treatment of wrist fractures. These titanium plates are anatomically designed and offer poly-axial SmartLock technology. SmartLock enables surgeons to place either locking or non-locking screws at angles of up to 15-degrees, which
allows the surgeon to target specific bone fragments for fixation. The VariAx Hand Plating and Foot Plating Systems were launched in 2008 and expanded the treatable indications for the wrist (hand) and for the hind, mid and fore foot, all under the
same poly-axial SmartLock platform.

Spinal Implant Systems

Through Stryker Spine, the Company develops, manufactures and markets spinal implant products including cervical, thoracolumbar and interbody
systems used in spinal injury, deformity and degenerative therapies. Spinal implant products include plates, rods, screws, connectors, spacers and cages, along with proprietary implant instrumentation.

In 2009 the Company introduced the Xia 3 Sacral Iliac system that completes the thoracolumbar system and makes it one of the most
comprehensive platforms on the market. Also in 2009, the Company introduced the Dynatran-Dynamic/Translational Anterior Cervical Plate which expands the Company’s presence in the cervical space with its unique locking mechanism. In 2008
the Company introduced the Radius Thoracolumbar Spinal Implant System. The Radius system provides a non-threaded wedgelock locking mechanism designed to



reduce the potential for false locking and cross-threading and to increase the speed, ease and reliability of connecting rods to screws. Also in 2008, the Company launched Xia 3, the next
generation of its thoracolumbar spinal implant system and THOR, its anterior lumbar plating system that incorporates a proprietary screw locking technology. In 2007 the Company introduced the Mantis minimally invasive access system for posterior
instrumented spinal fusion and the Reflex Zero Profile anterior cervical plating system. The Company also offers the VLIFT vertebral body replacement system consisting of a preassembled, cylindrically shaped titanium cage with a distractible or
retractable center. The hollow core of the cage allows for packing bone graft. The Company’s AVS AS and AL Spacers are used as vertebral body support devices in anterior procedures. Other product lines include the OASYS fixation system that
serves the posterior cervical fusion market, the Reflex Hybrid anterior cervical plate and the AVS PL and TL vertebral spacer systems.

Craniomaxillofacial (CMF) Implant Systems

Through Stryker Osteosynthesis, the Company develops, manufactures
and markets plating systems and related implants and products for craniomaxillofacial surgery. These products include plating systems, dura substitutes, bone substitutes, electrosurgical microdissection needles and surgical instruments. They are
primarily used in the fixation of fractures due to sudden injury as well as in the correction of congenital deformities. These products are marketed under such names as the Universal Fixation System, Colorado Needle, DuraMatrix-Onlay, Leibinger
Instruments and HydroSet.

OP-1/BMP-7

Stryker’s OP-1 Implant is composed of recombinant human OP-1 and a bioresorbable collagen matrix. Stryker has received two approvals for a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) from the FDA. An HDE, as
defined by the FDA, is for a product intended to benefit patients by treating or diagnosing a disease or condition that affects fewer than 4,000 individuals per year in the United States. The first is for the use of OP-1 Implant as an alternative to
autograft in recalcitrant long-bone nonunions where use of autograft is not feasible and alternative treatments have failed. The second is for revision posterolateral spine fusion using a new formulation of OP-1 known as OP-1 Putty. In March 2009,
the FDA Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Devices Advisory Panel voted not to recommend that the Company receive broad-based marketing approval for its OP-1 Putty.

Stryker filed a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) with the European Medicines Evaluation Agency for the posterolateral lumbar spine fusion indication in 2006 under the name Opgenra. In 2008 the
Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use in Europe recommended this indication for approval. The Opgenra product has not yet been launched in Europe.

In 2006 Stryker filed an investigational device exemption (IDE) application with the FDA to start a pilot clinical study in transforaminal lumbar interbody fusions using OP-1 Putty. The IDE was approved
and patient recruitment was completed in 2008.

Stryker is also interested in exploring the cartilage regeneration properties
of BMP-7 and has successfully completed preclinical studies showing that BMP-7 can stimulate new cartilage formation and increase disc height in animal models of degenerative disc disease. In 2005 Stryker filed its first Investigational New Drug
(IND) application with the FDA to treat degenerative disc disease with a new injectable form of BMP-7 in a dose-ranging study in humans. In 2008 the Company completed enrollment in this Phase I dose-ranging clinical safety study for the first time
use of BMP-7 to treat the disc. In 2006 Stryker filed an IND application with the FDA to treat osteoarthritis in the knee with the injectable form of BMP-7. Following FDA concurrence in 2007, the Company proceeded with patient enrollment in the
Phase I clinical study, which was completed in 2008. Based on the results of that study, a Phase II protocol has been submitted to the FDA with the intention of beginning a clinical trial in the same indication in 2010.

The Company is in the process of reviewing its strategic alternatives for the use of OP-1.



MedSurg Equipment

MedSurg Equipment products include surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems; endoscopic and communications systems and patient handling and emergency medical equipment. These products are
designed and manufactured by Stryker Instruments, Stryker Endoscopy and Stryker Medical.

Surgical Equipment and Surgical Navigation
Systems

Through Stryker Instruments, the Company offers a broad line of surgical, neurologic, ENT and interventional spine
equipment that is used in surgical specialties for drilling, burring, rasping or cutting bone in small-bone orthopaedics, neurosurgical, spine and ENT procedures; wiring or pinning bone fractures; and preparing hip or knee surfaces for the placement
of artificial implants. Stryker Instruments also manufactures an array of different attachments and cutting accessories for use by orthopaedic, neurologic and small-bone specialists.

The System 6 heavy duty, large-bone power system represents the Company’s primary heavy-duty, cordless product offering. This system,
which includes several attachments, is more powerful and has a longer battery life than its predecessor. The System 6 Rotary Handpieces provide multiple options to surgeons by allowing both high-speed drilling and high-torque reaming in one
handpiece. System 6 Heavy Duty Saws provide increased torque for a faster and more efficient cut.

In 2009 Stryker introduced
the RemB micro electric system, combining the Company’s Consolidated Operating Room Equipment (CORE) platform with lightweight, specialized handpieces, allowing surgeons to work effectively with greater precision and control. This versatile
system is an evolution in the Company’s offering of powered surgical instruments designed to remove and reshape bone in a wide variety of medical specialties including hand surgery, podiatry, orthopaedic foot and ankle surgery and extremity
trauma surgery. The Maestro drill represents Stryker’s line of micro powered instruments for spine, neurology and ENT applications. Employing the pneumatic technology that is the preference of many surgeons in these specialties, the Maestro
drill leverages the Company’s Total Performance System (TPS) and CORE platforms by using the same cutting attachments. The Stryker Bone Mill, launched in 2008, further leverages the CORE platform and is designed for use in spine, orthognathic
and orthopaedic primary and revision joint procedures. The Bone Mill provides the ability to morselize both autograph and allograft bone quickly and efficiently and provide consistent granulation of bone in 3 sizes depending on the need of the
surgeon. In 2007 Stryker introduced the CORE Sumex drill, designed for use in ENT procedures, to leverage the Company’s CORE platform. The Sumex drill utilizes electronic torque feedback to increase RPM’s when the drill is engaged in more
demanding tasks. In addition, the Sumex drill incorporates a tapered front end to allow for better surgeon line of sight.

The
Company’s Stryker Precision Oscillating Tip Saw is an innovative saw incorporating a stationary cartridge blade shaft with an oscillating tip in contrast with standard surgical saws with oscillating blades. This feature gives surgeons the
opportunity for greater accuracy while simplifying cuts and reducing the potential for soft tissue damage and facilitating less invasive procedures. This saw represents an advance in procedural simplification, offering customers the potential for
time and cost savings by reducing the number of steps in the surgical process.

Stryker Instruments also produces disposable
products that are utilized in conjunction with joint replacement surgery. These products include the Revolution Cement Mixing System, designed to provide one solution for mixing all surgical cements, in addition to offering mixing efficacy, safety
and ease of use; the InterPulse, a self-contained pulsed lavage system used by surgeons to cleanse the surgical site during total joint arthroplasty; and the ConstaVac CBC II Blood Conservation System, a postoperative wound drainage and blood
reinfusion device that enables joint replacement patients to receive their own blood rather than donor blood.

To serve the
postsurgical technology market, the Company offers the PainPump2 and BlockAid products that are designed for continuous nerve block applications and enable the delivery of a local anesthetic to specific neurologic anatomy. The pumps facilitate
peri-operative pain control by allowing physicians to program the



pump and offer a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) option of non-narcotic medication to manage break-through pain. The Blockaid also offers a reprogramming feature, previously unavailable
to the market in a disposable, single-use pump.

To promote safety for patients and medical staff, Stryker works closely with
hospitals and other healthcare organizations to develop a broad product portfolio. In 2009 the Company introduced the Flyte personal protection system, the latest version of Stryker’s Sterishield line of personal protection products combining
improved comfort and support with higher levels of protection against contamination, exposure to infectious bodily fluids and transfer of microorganisms and particulate matter. Additionally, Flyte’s integrated helmet with illumination
represents enhancements aimed towards improving the surgical environment.

The Neptune Waste Management System represents
Stryker’s leading product for liquid waste management in the operating room. The self-contained device, first introduced in 2000 and consistently improved, collects and disposes of fluid and smoke waste from surgical procedures, minimizing the
need for operator intervention and, therefore, the risk of exposure to these waste byproducts. In 2008 Stryker introduced the Neptune 2 Waste Management platform. This next-generation system allows for increased fluid collection capacity while
enhancing end user system preferences based on surgical procedures.

Through Stryker Instruments, the Company offers a broad
line of surgical navigation systems that give surgeons in several specialties the ability to use electronic imaging to see more clearly, better align instruments and more accurately track where the instruments are relative to a patient’s
anatomy during surgical procedures. The Company offers the Navigation System II Cart, the eNlite suitcase system, which creates a smaller footprint in the operating room while retaining the full functionality of all software programs offered on the
Navigation System II Cart, and the Navigation iSuite, a fully integrated navigation system housed in the ceiling and walls of an existing operating room. All of these product offerings are either image based or imageless platforms, incorporating
intuitive Smart hardware and software functionality, and a highly accurate digital infrared camera that result in greater ease of use, less invasive procedures, and reduced surgical time.

Endoscopic and Communications Systems

Stryker Endoscopy develops, manufactures and markets medical video-imaging and communications equipment and instruments for arthroscopy, general surgery and urology. Stryker Endoscopy has established a
position of leadership in the production of medical video-imaging technology and accessories for minimally invasive surgery, as well as communications equipment to facilitate local and worldwide sharing of medical information among operating rooms,
doctors’ offices and teaching institutions. Products include medical video cameras, digital documentation equipment, digital image and viewing software, arthroscopes, laparoscopes, powered surgical instruments, sports medicine instrumentation,
radio frequency ablation systems, irrigation fluid management systems, i-Suite operating room solutions and state-of-the-art equipment for telemedicine and enterprise-wide connectivity. Stryker’s line of rigid scopes, which range in diameter
from 1.9 millimeters to 10 millimeters, contains a series of precision lenses as well as fiber optics that, when combined with Stryker’s high-definition (HD) camera systems, allow the physician to view internal anatomy with a high degree of
clarity.

In 2009 Stryker introduced the 1288 HD Camera, the next generation of Stryker 3-chip HD medical video camera. This
latest version has HD 1080p resolution with wireless high definition transmission to the new Stryker WiSe wide screen monitor system. This new camera system provides superior image quality compared to previous camera systems and usability through
customized programmable buttons. This product provides surgical teams with improved visibility during endoscopic procedures, which can improve overall surgical and patient outcomes. In conjunction with the launch of the 1288 HD Camera, Stryker also
introduced the L-9000 lightsource. This new lightsource includes proprietary LED technology that provides the customer with a cooler and longer lasting bulb. Also introduced was the IDEAL EYES line of HD arthroscopes and laparoscopes. To accommodate
the recording of HD images, the Company offers the SDC HD digital documentation system. The Company also offers its Formula shaver system, which is small, light and equipped with radio frequency identification (RFID), facilitating communication
between the blade and console.



In 2008 Stryker introduced the High Definition Digital Radiography (HDDR) 3000, a space
efficient and multifunctional direct digital radiography system designed to accommodate the demanding requirements of modern orthopaedic practices. The HDDR 3000 features a Q-arm design with the x-ray tube always centered to the detector for fast,
precise and convenient patient positioning. The system efficiently performs all general radiographic procedures with a single detector.

In 2007 the Company launched the Stryker Digital Capture (SDC) Ultra, an all-in-one medical imaging information management system allowing for patient scheduling, video capture and storage, DVD burning
and other capabilities. The SDC Ultra archives surgical images and videos on its 250-gigabyte internal hard drive. This system also allows for the recording of all surgical footage in high-definition video. Through dual-channel input support, the
SDC Ultra can capture images and video independently on two separate video channels, in synchronized mode or in picture-in-picture format.

Also in 2007 Stryker introduced the 45L PneumoSure insufflator that provides exceptional performance with enhanced safety and reliability. This new insufflator is designed to handle the needs of
today’s dynamic surgical environment and includes two additional modes for bariatric and vessel harvesting. The 45L PneumoSure insufflator offers real-time pressure sensing for increased accuracy during a procedure. Its ability to maintain
pneumoperitoneum under the most extreme conditions, coupled with a fully integrated color touch screen, allows for increased ease of use.

Patient Handling and Emergency Medical Equipment

Stryker Medical is a leader in the patient handling equipment
segment, offering a wide variety of stretchers customized to fit the needs of acute care and specialty surgical care facilities with a focus on providing a safe and comfortable surface for patients while reducing the risk of back injury for hospital
staff. The Company offers the M-Series Stretcher, which has become the standard in patient mobility. The M-Series Stretcher incorporates the Company’s BackSmart side rail design elements, reducing the risk of back injury for caregivers; the
Zoom Motorized Drive System, virtually eliminating push force; Big Wheel technology, reducing start-up force by up to 50 percent and increasing maneuverability; and a 700-pound weight capacity. The Company’s Glide Lateral Air Transfer System
allows two caregivers to easily transfer even the largest patients while reducing the risk for caregiver back injury by lifting and floating the patient on a cushion of air.

Stryker Medical also develops and manufactures beds and accessories that are designed to meet the unique needs of specialty departments
within the acute care environment. In 2008 the Company introduced the redesigned S3 Med/Surg Hospital Bed, the first redesign since its original 1994 introduction, combining a retractable frame with the Company’s BackSmart ergonomically
designed side rails and featuring an open architecture to accept any standard support surface. The S3 offers the Chaperone center-of-gravity bed-exit system with Zone Control to help prevent patient falls, as well as iBed Awareness, an exclusive
technology that monitors safe patient bed positions and alerts caregivers in the event that the desired, safe bed configuration is altered. In 2007 the Company introduced the InTouch, the first high-acuity care bed to combine advanced technology,
intuitive operation and BackSmart ergonomics to the benefit of both patients and caregivers. In 2009 the Company introduced the Impression non-powered support surface designed to improve pressure redistribution, enhance patient comfort and provide
enhanced moisture management similar to that achieved by powered support surfaces. Stryker has a complete line of intensive care unit (ICU) beds for critical care and step-down units. The beds incorporate advanced features that facilitate patient
care, such as in-bed scales that accurately weigh the patient regardless of bed position and a radiolucent surface that facilitates chest x-rays without moving the patient from the bed. Stryker’s XPRT support surface, with low air loss,
percussion and rotational therapy, aids in the prevention and treatment of certain skin ulcers and pulmonary care.

To serve
the worldwide pre-hospital market, the Company offers a line of manually operated and powered ambulance cots and cot-to-ambulance fastening systems. In addition, Stryker offers the Stair-PRO stair chairs with Stair-TREAD track systems that
facilitate patient transport up and down stairs. The Company’s Power-PRO



ambulance cot incorporates an advanced battery-powered hydraulic lift system that enables emergency medical professionals to raise and lower the cot with the press of a button. The use of
Stair-PRO and the Power-PRO helps prevent caregiver back injuries. Stryker expanded the Power-PRO line with a version customized to carry transport incubators on both inter-facility and intra-facility transports and with a version customized for
ambulances that use hydraulic tail lifts or ramps that are popular in the United Kingdom.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

Most of the Company’s products and product improvements have been developed internally. The Company maintains close working
relationships with physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist in product research and development. New and improved products play a critical role in the Company’s sales growth. The Company continues to place
emphasis on the development of proprietary products and product improvements to complement and expand its existing product lines. The Company has a decentralized research and development focus, with manufacturing locations responsible for new
product development and product improvements. Research, development and engineering personnel at the various manufacturing locations maintain relationships with staff at distribution locations and with customers to understand changes in the market
and product needs.

Total expenditures for product research, development and engineering were $336.2 million in 2009, $367.8
million in 2008 and $375.3 million in 2007. Research, development and engineering expenses represented 5.0% of sales in 2009, compared with 5.5% in 2008 and 6.3% in 2007. The spending level in 2009 decreased due to the Company’s tight control
on discretionary spending as well as the Company’s focus of certain research and development resources on compliance initiatives. Recent new product introductions in the Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment segments are more fully
described under the caption

Product Sales

.

In addition to internally developed products, the Company invests in
technologies developed by third parties that have the potential to expand the markets in which the Company operates. In 2009 the Company acquired Ascent Healthcare Solutions, Inc. (Ascent) the market leader in the reprocessing and remanufacturing of
medical devices in the U.S. The acquisition of Ascent is expected to enhance the Company’s presence in a variety of product offerings in its MedSurg Equipment segment and allow for cost savings to its customers. During 2009, the Company
acquired certain additional companies that are expected to enhance the Company’s product offerings to its customers within its Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment business segments.

MARKETING

Domestic sales
accounted for 64% of total revenues in 2009. Most of the Company’s products are marketed directly to doctors, hospitals and other healthcare facilities through dedicated sales forces for each of its principal product lines to provide focus and
a high level of expertise to each medical specialty served.

International sales accounted for 36% of total revenues in 2009.
The Company’s products are sold in more than 100 countries through local dealers and direct sales efforts. Stryker distributes its products through sales subsidiaries and branches with offices located in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium,
Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Serbia and Montenegro, Singapore, South
Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom. Stryker exports products to dealers and to customers in Africa, Bangladesh, the Balkans, China, the CIS (former Soviet Union), Cyprus, Czech
Republic, Hungary, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Latin America, the Middle East, Paraguay, the Philippines, Slovakia, Thailand, Turkey, Uruguay and Vietnam. Additional information regarding the Company’s international and domestic
operations and sales appears in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

The
Company’s business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of orthopaedic implant surgeries is lower during the summer months.



COMPETITION

The Company is one of five leading competitors in the United States for orthopaedic reconstructive products. The four other leading competitors are DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (a subsidiary of
Johnson & Johnson), Zimmer Holdings, Inc., Biomet, Inc., and Smith & Nephew plc. While competition abroad varies from area to area, the Company believes it is also a leading player in the international markets with these same
companies as its principal competitors.

In the trauma implant segment, Stryker is one of five leaders competing principally
with Synthes, Inc., Smith & Nephew Orthopaedics (a division of Smith & Nephew plc), Zimmer Holdings, Inc., and DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc.

In the spinal implant segment, the Company is one of five leaders, competing principally with Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Inc. (a subsidiary of Medtronic, Inc.), DePuy Spine, Inc. (a subsidiary of
Johnson & Johnson), Synthes, Inc., and Zimmer Holdings, Inc.

In the craniomaxillofacial implant segment, Stryker is
one of four leaders, competing principally with Synthes, Inc., Biomet Microfixation, LLC (a subsidiary of Biomet, Inc.), and KLS Martin L.P.

Several companies are engaged in the research and development of products for the repair of hard and soft tissues that, if approved, would compete with the Company’s OP-1 product. Medtronic Sofamor
Danek has received FDA approval for its recombinant bone morphogenetic protein (“rhBMP-2”) for certain spine, trauma and orthopaedic indications, including the treatment of acute, open fractures of the tibial shaft and spinal fusion
surgeries. A number of companies currently provide various other therapies, including allografts, bone fillers and electrical stimulation devices for the treatment, repair or replacement of bone and joint tissue. The Company believes that its OP-1
product, which is approved for limited trauma and spine indications in certain markets and is currently in clinical trials for other indications, will ultimately compete with these products and with traditional therapies, such as autograft and
allograft.

In the surgical equipment segment, Stryker is one of three leaders, competing principally with Medtronic, Inc.,
and Conmed Linvatec, Inc. (a subsidiary of C

ONMED

Corporation). These companies are also competitors in the international segments, along with Aesculap-Werke AG (a division of B. Braun Melsungen AG), a large European manufacturer.

In the surgical navigation segment, Stryker is one of six principal competitors, including Medtronic Surgical Navigation
Technologies (a division of Medtronic, Inc.), BrainLAB Inc. (a subsidiary of BrainLAB AG), A

ESCULAP

AG & Co. KG (a division of B. Braun Melsungen AG), Radionics, Inc. (a subsidiary of Integra LifeSciences Corporation), and GE
Medical Systems Navigation and Visualization, Inc. (a subsidiary of General Electric Company).

In the arthroscopy segment,
the Company is one of four leaders, together with the principal competitors Smith & Nephew Endoscopy (a division of Smith & Nephew plc), Conmed Linvatec, Inc., and Arthrex, Inc. In the laparoscopic imaging products segment, the
Company is one of three leaders, together with the principal competitors, Karl Storz GmbH & Co. (a German company) and Olympus Optical Co. Ltd. (a Japanese company).

The Company’s primary competitor in the patient handling segment is Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc. In the specialty stretcher segment, the
primary competitors are Hausted, Inc. (a subsidiary of S

TERIS

Corporation), Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc., and Midmark Hospital Products Group (a subsidiary of Ohio Medical Instrument Company, Inc.). In the emergency medical services
segment, Ferno-Washington, Inc. is the Company’s principal competitor.

The principal factors that the Company believes
differentiate it in the highly competitive market segments in which it operates and enable it to compete effectively are innovation, reliability, service and reputation. The



Company believes that its competitive position in the future will depend to a large degree on its ability to develop new products and make improvements to existing products. While the Company
does not consider patents a major factor in its overall competitive success, patents and trademarks are significant to the extent that a product or an attribute of a product represents a unique design or process. Patent protection of such products
restricts competitors from duplicating these unique designs and features. Stryker seeks to obtain patent protection on its products whenever appropriate for protecting its competitive advantage. The Company currently owns approximately 1,145 United
States patents and 1,470 international patents.

MANUFACTURING AND SOURCES OF SUPPLY

The Company’s manufacturing processes consist primarily of precision machining, metal fabrication and assembly operations; the forging
and investment casting of cobalt chrome; and the finishing of cobalt chrome and titanium. In addition, the Company is the sole manufacturer of its OP-1 product. Approximately 12% of the Company’s cost of sales in 2009 represented finished
products that were purchased complete from outside suppliers. The Company also purchases parts and components, such as forgings, castings, gears, bearings, casters and electrical components, and uses outside sources for certain finishing operations,
such as plating, hardening and coating of machined components and sterilization of certain products. The principal raw materials used by the Company are stainless steel, aluminum, cobalt chrome and titanium alloys. In all, purchased parts and
components from outside sources were approximately 41% of the total cost of sales in 2009.

While the Company relies on single
sources for certain purchased materials and services, it believes alternate sources are available if needed. The Company has not experienced any significant difficulty in the past in obtaining the materials necessary to meet its production
schedules.

Substantially all products manufactured by the Company are stocked in inventory, while certain products
manufactured within the Company’s MedSurg Equipment segment are assembled to order.

REGULATION AND PRODUCT QUALITY

The Medical Device Amendments of 1976 to the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990, together with
regulations issued or proposed thereunder, provide for regulation by the FDA of the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices, including most of the Company’s products.

The FDA’s Quality System regulations set forth standards for the Company’s product design and manufacturing processes, require the
maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of the Company’s facilities by the FDA. There are also certain requirements of state, local and foreign governments that must be complied with in the manufacturing and marketing of the
Company’s products.

In 2009 the Company received a warning letter from the FDA related to compliance issues for one of
its CMF implant products that was previously sold through its CMF distribution facility in Portage, Michigan. In 2008 the Company received a warning letter from the FDA related to quality systems and compliance issues at its OP-1 implant
manufacturing facility in Hopkinton, Massachusetts. In 2007 the Company received two warning letters from the FDA regarding compliance with certain quality system specifications at its reconstructive implant manufacturing facilities: one letter for
its facility in Cork, Ireland and another for its facility in Mahwah, New Jersey. In October 2009, the FDA informed the Company that the warning letter related to its OP-1 implant manufacturing facility had been resolved following a productive
reinspection earlier in 2009. The Company takes these matters very seriously and continues to fully cooperate with the FDA to address their observations at the other facilities.

Most of the Company’s new products fall into FDA classifications that require notification of and review by the FDA before marketing,
submitted as a 510(k). The Company’s FlexiCore and CerviCore artificial disc products and OP-1 products require extensive clinical testing, consisting of safety and efficacy studies, followed by PMA applications for specific surgical
indications.



Stryker also is subject to the laws that govern the manufacture and distribution of medical
devices of each country in which the Company manufactures or sells products. The member states of the European Union (EU) have adopted the European Medical Device Directives, which create a single set of medical device regulations for all EU member
countries. These regulations require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in EU member countries to obtain CE Marking for their products. Stryker has authorization to apply the CE Marking to substantially all of its
products. The Company’s OP-1 product has been considered a drug under the regulations for Europe, Australia and Japan.

Initiatives sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare expenses generally and hospital costs in particular, including price regulation and competitive pricing, are ongoing
in markets where the Company does business. It is not possible to predict at this time the long-term impact of such cost-containment measures on the Company’s future business.

EMPLOYEES

At December 31, 2009, the Company had 18,582 employees worldwide.
Certain international employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are updated annually. The Company believes that its employee relations are satisfactory.

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT

Information regarding the executive officers
of the Company appears under the caption “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance” in Item 10 of this report.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS.

The
following information contains specific risks that could potentially impact the Company’s business, financial condition or operating results. The Company may be subject to additional risks that are not currently known to the Company or those
which the Company deems immaterial that may also impact its business operations.

The Company’s inability to maintain adequate
working relationships with healthcare professionals could have a negative impact on the Company’s future operating results.

The Company maintains close working relationships with respected physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities who assist in product research and development. The Company continues to
place emphasis on the development of proprietary products and product improvements to complement and expand its existing product lines. If the Company is unable to maintain these good relationships, its ability to market and sell new and improved
products could decrease and future operating results could be unfavorably affected.

The Company’s inability to continue to hire
and retain key employees could have a negative impact on the Company’s future operating results.

The talent and
drive of the Company’s employees are key factors in the success of its business. The Company’s sales, technical and other key personnel play an integral role in the development, marketing and selling of new and existing products. If the
Company is unable to recruit, hire, develop and retain a talented, competitive work force, it may not be able to meet its strategic business objectives.



Stricter pricing guidelines for the medical technology industry could have a negative impact on the
Company’s future operating results.

Initiatives sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the
private sector to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation and competitive pricing, are ongoing in markets where the Company does business. The Company could experience a negative impact on its operating results due to
increased pricing pressure in the United States, Japan and certain other markets. Governments, hospitals and other third party payers could reduce the amount of approved reimbursements for the Company’s products. Reductions in reimbursement
levels or coverage or other cost-containment measures could unfavorably affect the Company’s future operating results.

The
Company’s operating results could be negatively impacted by changes in its excess and obsolete inventory reserves.

The Company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current carrying costs. The markets in which the Company operates are highly competitive,
and new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis. Such marketplace changes may cause some of the Company’s products to become obsolete. The Company makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of
these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends. If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product
introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.

The Company’s operating results could be negatively impacted if it is unable to capitalize on research and development spending.

The Company has spent a significant amount of time and resources on research and development projects in order to develop and validate new
and innovative products. The Company believes these projects will result in the commercialization of new products and will create additional future sales. However, factors including regulatory delays, safety concerns or patent disputes could delay
the introduction or marketing of new products. Additionally, unanticipated issues may arise in connection with current and future clinical studies that could delay or terminate a product’s development prior to regulatory approval. The Company
may experience an unfavorable impact on its operating results if it is unable to capitalize on those efforts by attaining the proper FDA approval or to successfully market new products.

The Company’s operating results could be negatively impacted by future changes in the allocation of income to each of the income tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates.

The Company operates in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States. Income tax
authorities in these jurisdictions regularly perform audits of the Company’s income tax filings. Accordingly, management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions based on current interpretations of
complex income tax regulations. Income tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues, including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing and product royalty arrangements, may require an extended period of time
to resolve and may result in significant income tax adjustments. If changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates, such adjustments could have a material unfavorable impact on the Company’s
income tax expense and net earnings in future periods.



The Company’s operating results could be negatively impacted by future product liability claims,
unfavorable court decisions, regulatory compliance or legal settlements.

The Company is a defendant in various
proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including product liability and other matters. In addition, the Company may incur significant legal expenses regardless of whether it is found to be liable. Such matters
are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable with assurance. To partially mitigate losses arising from unfavorable outcomes in such matters, the Company purchases third-party insurance coverage subject to certain deductibles
and loss limitations. While the Company believes its current insurance coverage is adequate to mitigate losses arising from such matters, its future operating results may be unfavorably impacted by any settlement payments or losses beyond the
amounts of insurance carried. In addition, such product liability matters may negatively impact the Company’s ability to obtain cost-effective third-party insurance coverage in future periods.

Substantially all of the Company’s products are subject to regulation by the FDA and other governmental authorities both inside and
outside of the United States. If the Company were to fail to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements, it may be subject to a range of sanctions including, but not limited to, warning letters, monetary fines, product recalls and the
suspension of product manufacturing. Such sanctions, if implemented, could have a material, unfavorable impact on the Company’s future operating results.

The Company’s operating results could be negatively impacted by economic, political or other developments in countries in which the Company does business.

The Company distributes its products throughout the world. As a result, the Company’s future operating results could be negatively
impacted by unstable economic, political and social conditions, including but not limited to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, political instability or changes in the interpretation or creation of laws and regulations, including tax
laws and regulations, in each of the countries where the Company conducts business, including the United States.

the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. The outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time. In certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek damages, as well as other
compensatory relief, which could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements. In legal matters for which management has sufficient information to reasonably estimate the Company’s future obligations, a liability representing
management’s best estimate of the probable cost, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded. The estimates are based on consultation
with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies.

FINANCIAL AND STATISTICAL DATA

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

Throughout this discussion, references are made to the following financial measures: “constant currency,” “adjusted net
earnings,” “adjusted basic net earnings per share,” “adjusted diluted net earnings per share,” “adjusted net earnings from continuing operations,” “adjusted basic net earnings per share from continuing
operations” and “adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations.” These financial measures are an alternative representation of Stryker Corporation’s (the Company or Stryker) past and potential future
operational performance and do not replace the presentation of the Company’s reported financial results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company has provided these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures because
they provide meaningful information regarding the Company’s results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of its business segments,
for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with its budget process and bases certain annual bonus plans on these non-GAAP financial measures. In order to measure the Company’s sales performance on a constant currency basis, it
is necessary to remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which affects the comparability and trend of sales. Constant currency results are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency
exchange rates. In order to measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, the Company excludes the patent litigation gain and the income tax expenses associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings recorded in 2009, the
restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and 2008, and the intangible asset impairment charge recorded in 2007, each of which affects the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings. Additional details regarding the nature,
determination and financial statement impact of these items are included in

Results of Operations

. In addition, the Company believes investors will utilize this information to evaluate period-to-period results on a comparable basis and to
better understand potential future operating results. The Company encourages investors and other users of these financial statements to review its Consolidated Financial Statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely
solely on any single financial measure.

Executive Level Overview

Stryker is one of the world’s leading medical technology companies with the most broadly based range of products in orthopaedics and a
significant presence in other medical specialties. Stryker works with respected medical professionals to help people lead more active and more satisfying lives. The Company’s products include implants used in joint replacement, trauma and
spinal surgeries; surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems; endoscopic and communications systems; patient handling and emergency medical equipment as well as other medical device products used in a variety of medical specialties.



Domestic sales accounted for 64% of total revenues in 2009. Most of the Company’s
products are marketed directly to doctors, hospitals and other healthcare facilities by approximately 4,100 sales and marketing personnel in the United States. Stryker primarily maintains separate and dedicated sales forces for each of its principal
product lines to provide focus and a high level of expertise to each medical specialty served.

International sales accounted
for 36% of total revenues in 2009. The Company’s products are sold in more than 100 countries through Company-owned sales subsidiaries and branches as well as third-party dealers and distributors.

The Company’s business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of orthopaedic implant surgeries is lower during the
summer months.

In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company acquired Ascent Healthcare Solutions, Inc. (Ascent), the market
leader in the reprocessing and remanufacturing of medical devices in the United States, for $525.0 million in an all cash transaction. In addition, the Company settled an outstanding patent infringement lawsuit and received $62.5 million pursuant to
a confidential settlement. The Company also repatriated $787.0 million of foreign earnings to the United States which was used in part to fund the acquisition of Ascent. In the third quarter of 2009, the Company decided to terminate certain
third-party agreements at the Company’s EMEA Division, to simplify the organization structure at its Biotech, EMEA, Japan and Canada divisions and to discontinue selling certain products within its Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg business
segments. Additional details, including the financial statement impact of these transactions, are included in

Results of Operations

and

Liquidity and Capital Resources

.

In 2009 a federal grand jury in the District of Massachusetts returned an indictment charging Stryker Biotech LLC and certain current and
former employees of Stryker Biotech with wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), distribution of a misbranded device and false statements to the FDA. The Company still hopes to be able to reach a fair and just
resolution of this matter. Conviction of these charges could result in significant monetary fines and Stryker Biotech’s exclusion from participating in federal and state healthcare programs, which could have a material affect on Stryker
Biotech’s business. However, the ultimate resolution of these matters is not reasonably estimatable at this time. The Company understands that certain former Stryker Biotech employees have pled guilty to charges in connection with this matter.
In 2009 the FDA Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Devices Advisory Panel voted not to recommend that the Company receive marketing approval for its OP-1 Putty. The Company is reviewing its strategic alternatives for OP-1, which could be impacted by the
ultimate resolution of the indictment.

In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company decided to simplify the structure of its
Japanese distribution business and to substantially reduce development efforts associated with the product technologies acquired from Sightline Technologies Ltd. (Sightline) in 2006. Unanticipated issues arose that delayed the regulatory approval
and commercialization efforts of new products associated with the product technologies acquired. Additional details, including the financial statement impact resulting from those decisions, are included in

Results of Operations.



Results of Operations

The table below outlines the components of net earnings from continuing operations from the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a percentage of net sales and the year-to-year percentage change in
dollar amounts:

The Company segregates its operations into two reportable business segments: Orthopaedic Implants
and MedSurg Equipment. The Orthopaedic Implants segment includes orthopaedic reconstructive (hip and knee), trauma, craniomaxillofacial and spinal implant systems and other related products. The MedSurg Equipment segment includes surgical equipment
and surgical navigation systems; endoscopic and communications systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment.

The table below sets forth domestic/international and product line sales information (in millions):



The tables below set forth additional geographical sales growth information for significant
products within the Company’s Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment segments on both a reported basis and a constant currency basis:

2009 Compared with

The Company’s net sales increased to $6,723.1 million in 2009 from $6,718.2 million in 2008. Net sales grew by
2% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

The Company’s domestic sales were $4,317.4 million for 2009, representing an increase of 1%, as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants partially offset by lower shipments of MedSurg
Equipment. International sales were $2,405.7 million for 2009, representing a decrease of 1%. The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was unfavorable by $110.1 million for 2009. On a constant currency
basis, international sales increased 3% in 2009 as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.



Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $4,119.7 million for 2009, representing an
increase of 4%. On a constant currency basis, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 6% in 2009 as a result of higher shipments of hips, knees, trauma, craniomaxillofacial and spinal implant systems.

Sales of hip implant systems increased 2% in 2009 (5% on a constant currency basis). In the United States, sales
growth was driven by Trident hip products, X3 Polyethylene hip products, Accolade cementless hip products and Restoration Modular Hip System revision hip products. Sales growth in several hip systems, including X3 Polyethylene and Accolade
cementless hip products in Europe, Canada and the Latin America and Pacific regions and Trident in Japan, also contributed to the Company’s constant currency sales growth in 2009.

Knee Implant Systems:

Sales of knee implant systems increased 4% in 2009 (6% on a constant currency basis) due to strong sales growth
in the Triathlon Knee System in the United States, Europe, Japan, Canada and the Pacific region and solid sales growth in the Scorpio Knee System in the Latin America region.

Trauma Implant Systems:

Sales of trauma implant systems increased 5% in 2009 (6% on a constant currency basis) as a result of sales
growth in the Gamma 3 Hip Fracture System and the SPS Calcaneal Foot Plating System in the United States, Europe, Canada, Latin America and Pacific regions as well as sales growth in the Company’s VariAx Distal Radius System in Europe, Canada
and the Latin America region. Strong sales growth in the HydroSet injectable bone substitute product in the United States, Canada and the Pacific region also contributed to the Company’s constant currency sales growth in 2009.

Spinal Implant Systems:

Sales of spinal implant systems increased 10% in 2009 (11% on a constant currency basis). The increase was
driven by strong worldwide sales growth of thoracolumbar implant systems, interbody devices and cervical implants in the United States, Europe and the Latin America and Pacific regions.

Craniomaxillofacial Implant Systems:

Sales of craniomaxillofacial (CMF) implant systems increased 8% in 2009 (9% on a constant
currency basis) primarily due to strong sales growth of products for neurological indications in the United States, Japan, Canada and the Latin America and Pacific regions. Sales growth of the HydroSet injectable bone substitute products in the
United States, Europe Canada and the Pacific region also contributed to the Company’s constant currency sales growth.

Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $2,603.4 million for 2009, representing a decrease of 5%. The general economic slowdown in the United States resulted in a significant and rapid contraction in hospital capital budgets that
depressed demand for certain MedSurg Equipment products. The severe weakening of the economy caused the Company’s hospital customers to reduce capital purchases, which generate about 60% of sales within the MedSurg Equipment segment, to a
degree not previously experienced in prior recessionary periods. On a constant currency basis, sales of MedSurg Equipment decreased 4% in 2009 as higher shipments of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems were offset by lower shipments
of endoscopic and communication systems as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment.

Surgical Equipment
and Surgical Navigation Systems:

Sales of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems increased 1% in 2009 (2% on a constant currency basis) due to worldwide sales growth in operating room equipment as well as sales growth in powered
surgical products in the United States, Europe, Japan and the Latin America region and sales growth in interventional pain products in the United States, Japan and the Pacific region.

Endoscopic and Communications Systems:

Sales of endoscopic and communications systems decreased 2% in 2009 (1% decrease on a constant
currency basis) due to lower sales of medical video imaging equipment products and image portal products in the United States partially offset by worldwide sales growth in arthroscopy and general surgery products as well as sales growth in
communications products in Japan and the Latin America and Pacific regions and medical video imaging equipment in Europe, Japan and the Latin America and Pacific regions.



Patient Handling and Emergency Medical Equipment:

Sales of patient handling and
emergency medical equipment decreased 22% in 2009 (20% decrease on a constant currency basis) due to lower worldwide sales of hospital bed products and stretchers in the United States, Europe, Canada and the Pacific and Latin America regions,
partially offset by sales growth in stretchers in Japan and emergency medical equipment in the United States.

Cost of sales
represented 32.5% of sales in 2009 compared with 31.7% in 2008. The increase in the cost of sales percentage is primarily due to increased spending for compliance initiatives, higher excess and obsolete inventory costs associated with the
Orthopaedic Implants businesses as well as higher unabsorbed costs due to lower production levels.

Research, development and
engineering expenses represented 5.0% of sales in 2009 compared with 5.5% in 2008. The spending level in 2009 decreased by 9% to $336.2 million due to tight control on discretionary spending as well as the Company’s continued focus of certain
research and development resources on compliance initiatives. New product introductions in 2009 for the Orthopaedic Implants segment included the Rejuvenate Modular Primary Hip system; the VariAx elbow plating system and the Xia Uniplanar Titanium
Spinal System. Within the MedSurg equipment segment, new product introductions in 2009 included the 1288 HD Camera, the Impression non-powered support surface, the Flyte Suit personal protection system and the RemB micro electric system.

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 5% in 2009 and represented 37.3% of sales compared with 39.1% in 2008. In 2009 the
Company settled an outstanding patent infringement lawsuit and received $62.5 million pursuant to a confidential settlement agreement. This gain represented a reduction to selling, general and administrative expenses. The remaining decrease in
selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2009 is due to tight control on discretionary spending that more than offset increased legal settlement costs, net of insurance recoveries, recorded for certain product liability
claims.

In 2009 the Company recorded $67.0 million ($48.4 million net of income taxes) in restructuring charges related to
decisions to terminate certain third-party agent agreements at the Company’s EMEA Division, to simplify the organization structure at its Biotech, EMEA, Japan and Canada divisions and to discontinue selling certain products within its
Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment segments. In 2008 the Company recorded $34.9 million ($21.7 million net of income taxes) in restructuring charges related to the decisions to simplify the structure of the Company’s Japanese
distribution business and to substantially reduce development efforts associated with Sightline product technologies acquired in 2006.

Interest and marketable securities income, which is included in other income (expense), decreased to $53.9 million in 2009 from $97.7 million in 2008 primarily as a result of lower average yields on the Company’s investments.

The Company’s effective income tax rate on earnings for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 31.8% compared to an
effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 of 27.4%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2009 reflects the impact of restructuring charges of $48.4 million (net of $18.6 million income tax
benefits), the patent litigation gain of $42.9 million (net of $19.6 million income tax expenses) and the impact of the $67.1 million income tax expenses associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings of $787.0 million. The effective income
tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 reflects the impact of the restructuring charges of $21.7 million (net of $13.2 million income tax benefits). In addition to these factors, the Company’s reported effective income tax rates for
the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 are lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily as a result of manufacturing in lower income tax jurisdictions.

Net earnings decreased 4% in 2009 to $1,107.4 million from $1,147.8 million in 2008. Basic net earnings per share decreased 1% in 2009 to
$2.79 from $2.81 in 2008, and diluted net earnings per share decreased to $2.77 in 2009 from $2.78 in 2008.



Excluding the impact of the patent litigation gain, the income tax charge associated with
the repatriation of foreign earnings and the restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and 2008, adjusted net earnings increased 1% in 2009 to $1,180.0 million from $1,169.5 million in 2008. Adjusted basic net earnings per share increased 4% in 2009 to
$2.97 from $2.87 in 2008 and adjusted diluted net earnings per share increased 4% in 2009 to $2.95 from $2.83 in 2008.

The
reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):

The weighted-average basic and diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of these
non-GAAP financial measures are the same as the weighted-average shares outstanding used in the calculation of the reported per share amounts.

2008 Compared with 2007

The Company’s net sales increased 12% in 2008 to $6,718.2 million from $6,000.5
million in 2007. Net sales grew by 11% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix and by 1% due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

The Company’s domestic sales were $4,282.2 million for 2008, representing an increase of 11%, as a result of higher shipments of
Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. International sales were $2,436.0 million for 2008, representing an increase of 13%. The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $84.7 million for
2008. On a constant currency basis, international sales increased 9% in 2008 as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.

Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $3,967.5 million for 2008, representing an increase of 11%. On a constant currency basis, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 9% in 2008 as a result of
higher shipments of reconstructive, trauma, spinal and craniomaxillofacial implant systems and bone cement.



Hip Implant Systems:

Sales of hip implant systems increased 3% in 2008 (1% on a
constant currency basis). In the United States, sales growth was driven by increased sales of the Cormet Hip Resurfacing product and sales growth in X3 Polyethylene and Accolade cementless hip products, partially offset by declines in other hip
systems. Sales growth in several hip systems, including Accolade, X3 Polyethylene and ABG II in Europe and Secur-Fit in Japan and the Pacific region, also contributed to the Company’s constant currency sales growth in 2008.

Knee Implant Systems:

Sales of knee implant systems increased 14% in 2008 (13% on a constant currency basis) due to strong sales
growth in the Triathlon Knee System in the United States, Europe, Canada and the Pacific region and solid sales growth in the Scorpio Knee System in Japan and the Latin America region.

Trauma Implant Systems:

Sales of trauma implant systems increased 18% in 2008 (14% on a constant currency basis) as a result of
strong worldwide sales growth in the Gamma3 Hip Fracture System and the SPS Calcaneal Foot Plating System and strong sales growth in the Company’s T2 Nailing System in the United States, Canada and the Pacific region. Strong sales growth in the
HydroSet injectable bone substitute product in the United States and the Pacific region also contributed to the Company’s constant currency sales growth in 2008.

Spinal Implant Systems:

Sales of spinal implant systems increased 19% in 2008 (18% on a constant currency basis). The increase was driven by strong worldwide sales growth of thoracolumbar implant
systems, interbody devices and cervical implants.

Craniomaxillofacial Implant Systems:

Sales of craniomaxillofacial
implant systems increased 16% in 2008 (15% on a constant currency basis) primarily due to strong sales growth of products for neurological indications and craniomaxillofacial implants and the HydroSet injectable bone substitute product in the United
States and the Pacific region.

Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $2,750.7 million for 2008, representing an increase
of 14%. On a constant currency basis, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 13% in 2008 as a result of higher shipments of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient
handling and emergency medical equipment.

Surgical Equipment and Surgical Navigation Systems:

Sales of surgical
equipment and surgical navigation systems increased 17% in 2008 (15% on a constant currency basis) due to strong worldwide sales growth in powered surgical and operating room equipment as well as solid sales growth in interventional pain products in
the United States and the Pacific region.

Endoscopic and Communications:

Sales of endoscopic and
communications systems increased 9% in 2008 (8% on a constant currency basis) as a result of strong worldwide sales growth in arthroscopy and general surgery as well as strong international sales growth of medical video imaging equipment, led by the
1188 HD camera and complimentary products, partially offset by lower sales of medical video imaging equipment in the United States. Strong sales growth in communication products, led by the SwitchPoint Infinity 2, in the United States and Canada
also contributed to the Company’s constant currency sales growth.

Patient Handling and Emergency Medical Equipment:

Sales of patient handling and emergency medical equipment increased 18% in 2008 (17% on a constant currency basis) due to strong sales growth of hospital bed products in the United States and the Latin America region and stretchers and emergency
medical equipment in the United States and Europe.

Cost of sales represented 31.7% of sales in 2008 compared with 31.1% in
2007. The increase in the cost of sales percentage is primarily due to increased compliance initiative spending and higher commodity and freight costs.



Research, development and engineering expenses represented 5.5% of sales in 2008 compared
with 6.3% in 2007. As anticipated, the spending level in 2008 decreased by 2% to $367.8 million as the Company implemented a more normalized level of spending for these costs compared to prior periods as well as the Company’s focus of certain
research and development resources on compliance initiatives, which has slowed down some research and development projects and reduced outside contractor spending on certain projects. New product introductions in 2008 for the Orthopaedic Implants
segment included the Tritanium Primary Hip System; the Triathlon TS Revision Knee System; the Triathlon Partial Knee Resurfacing System; the Asnis Screw System; the VariAx Hand and Foot Trauma Systems; and the Xia III Thoracolumbar Spinal System.
Within the MedSurg Equipment segment, new product introductions in 2008 included the S3 Med/Surg Hospital Bed and the Neptune 2 Waste Management System.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 10% in 2008 and represented 39.1% of sales compared with 39.9% in 2007. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of
sales in 2008 is due to tight control of discretionary spending in the second half of 2008 partially offset by increases in sales-related costs and costs associated with compliance activities.

In 2008 the Company recorded $34.9 million ($21.7 million net of income taxes) in restructuring charges related to the decisions to simplify
the structure of the Company’s Japanese distribution business and to substantially reduce development efforts associated with Sightline product technologies acquired in 2006. In 2007 the Company recorded a $19.8 million charge ($12.7 million
net of income taxes) to write off patents associated with intervertebral body fusion cage products. The impairment followed a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) decision to downgrade certain intervertebral body fusion products to Class II
devices, along with a weak market for sales of these specific products. As a result, the Company performed a discounted cash flow analysis over the remaining life of the patented technologies and determined that the charge was required.

Interest and marketable securities income, which is included in other income (expense), increased to $97.7 million in 2008 from $85.5
million in 2007 primarily as a result of increased average cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances in 2008 compared to 2007. Interest expense, which is included in other income (expense), increased to $30.5 million in 2008 from
$22.2 million in 2007, primarily as a result of interest expense associated with unresolved income tax positions.

The
Company’s effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 27.4% compared to an effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007 of 28.0%. The effective income tax
rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 reflects the impact of the restructuring charges of $21.7 million (net of $13.2 million income tax benefits). The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflects the impact
of the intangible asset impairment charge of $12.7 million (net of $7.1 million income tax benefit). In addition to these factors, the Company’s reported effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are lower
than the U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily as a result of manufacturing in lower income tax jurisdictions.

Net
earnings from continuing operations increased 16% in 2008 to $1,147.8 million from $986.7 million in 2007. Basic net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 17% in 2008 to $2.81 from $2.41 in 2007, and diluted net earnings per share
from continuing operations increased 17% in 2008 to $2.78 from $2.37 in 2007.

Excluding the impact of the restructuring
charges recorded in 2008 and the charge to reflect the intangible asset impairment in 2007, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased 17% in 2008 to $1,169.5 million from $999.4 million in 2007. Adjusted basic net earnings per share
from continuing operations increased 18% in 2008 to $2.87 from $2.44 in 2007, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 18% in 2008 to $2.83 from $2.40 in 2007.



The reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are as follows (in millions, except
per share amounts):

The weighted-average basic and diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of these
non-GAAP financial measures are the same as the weighted-average shares outstanding used in the calculation of the reported per share amounts.

Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2007 included a gain of $25.7 million (net of income taxes), or $0.06 per diluted share, to reflect the divestiture of the Company’s outpatient
physical therapy business, Physiotherapy Associates, and net earnings from discontinued operations of $5.0 million, or $0.01 per diluted share.

Net earnings increased 13% in 2008 to $1,147.8 million from $1,017.4 million in 2007. Basic net earnings per share increased 13% in 2008 to $2.81 from $2.48 in 2007, and diluted net earnings per share
increased 14% in 2008 to $2.78 from $2.44 in 2007.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company’s working capital at December 31, 2009 increased $893.0 million to $4,410.2 million from $3,517.2 million at
December 31, 2008. The increase in working capital resulted from cash earnings, increases in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses partially offset by the use of cash to fund dividend payments and acquisitions. The increase in working
capital is also due to the reclassification of auction rate securities (ARS) from non-current assets to current assets within the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2009, as more fully described below. Accounts receivable days sales
outstanding was 56 days at December 31, 2009 and 59 days at December 31, 2008. Days sales in inventory decreased by 10 days to 145 days at December 31, 2009 from 155 days at December 31, 2008. Days sales in inventory at
December 31, 2009 is lower than the December 31, 2008 level primarily due to lower levels of inventory resulting from a slowdown in sales as well as higher excess and obsolete inventory costs associated with the Orthopaedic Implants
businesses.

The Company generated cash of $1,460.7 million from operations in 2009 compared with $1,175.9 million in 2008.
The increase in cash from operations in 2009 is primarily due to a reduction in inventories, slower growth in accounts receivable and increases in income taxes payable.



In 2009 the Company used cash of $131.3 million for capital expenditures. In addition, the
Company used cash of $198.4 million for the payment of dividends and $570.2 million of cash to fund acquisitions. The Company also purchased and sold marketable securities, which are classified as available-for-sale investments in accordance with
the provisions of the

Investments-Debt and Equity Securities Topic

of the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (Codification).

The Company had $658.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2,296.1 million in current marketable securities at December 31, 2009.
The Company had outstanding borrowings totaling $18.0 million at that date, all of which were classified as current obligations. The Company believes its cash on hand and marketable securities, proceeds from the January 2010 note offering as more
fully described below as well as anticipated cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to fund future operating capital requirements; future manufacturing facility construction and other capital expenditures; future business and product line
acquisitions to supplement its current product offerings; loaner instrumentation for surgical implants in support of new product launches; required debt repayments and the payment of dividends.

On January 15, 2010, the Company sold $500.0 million of senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2015 (the “2015 Notes”)
and $500.0 million of senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2020 (the “2020 Notes”). The 2015 Notes will bear interest at 3.00% per year and, unless previously redeemed, will mature on January 15, 2015. The 2020 Notes will
bear interest at 4.375% per year and, unless previously redeemed, will mature on January 15, 2020. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including
acquisitions, stock repurchases and other business opportunities.

Should additional funds be required, the Company had
$1,049.2 million of additional borrowing capacity available under all of its existing credit facilities as of December 31, 2009, including the Company’s $1,000.0 million 5-year nonamortizing, revolving Unsecured Credit Facility that
expires in November 2010.

The Company’s additional borrowing capacity, along with the expected expiration period of the
commitments, is summarized as follows (in millions):

The Company reviews
declines in the fair value of its investments classified as available-for-sale for impairment in accordance with the provisions of the

Investments-Debt and Equity Securities Topic

of the FASB Codification in order to determine whether the
decline in fair value is an other-than-temporary impairment. Other-than-temporary impairments of available-for-sale marketable securities are recorded in earnings.

Beginning in February 2008, liquidity issues in the global credit markets resulted in the failure of auctions for all of the ARS investments held by the Company, as the amount of securities submitted for
sale in those auctions exceeded the amount of purchase bids. To date, the Company has collected all interest receivable on outstanding ARS when due and expects to continue to do so in the future. Due to current market conditions, the ARS investments
have continued to experience failed auctions. These failed auctions result in a lack of liquidity in the securities but do not affect the underlying collateral of the securities. The Company does not anticipate that the lack of liquidity in its ARS,
even for an extended period of time, will affect its ability to finance its operations, including its expansion programs and planned capital expenditures. The Company continues to monitor efforts by the financial markets to find alternative means
for restoring the liquidity of these investments.

As of December 31, 2009, the Company held $156.3 million, at par
value, of ARS investments. In 2008 the Company entered into an ARS Rights agreement (Rights) with UBS Financial Services Inc. (UBS), one of its investment providers, whereby the Company received the right to sell its ARS at par value to UBS at any
time



during the period June 30, 2010 through July 2, 2012. These Rights are nontransferable securities registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (U.S. SEC). As a
result of accepting the ARS Rights, the Company has released UBS and its employees/agents from all claims except claims for consequential damages directly or indirectly relating to UBS’s marketing and sale of ARS and agreed not to serve as a
class representative or receive benefits under any class action settlement or investor fund. The Company has elected to apply the fair value option to its ARS Rights pursuant to the provisions of the

Financial Instruments Topic

of the FASB
Codification. As a result of this election, in the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2009, the Company recorded a loss of $11.0 million in other income (expense) to recognize the change in fair value estimate of its ARS Rights; the loss
was offset by a corresponding gain in the fair value estimate of the related trading marketable securities. The Company intends to exercise its ARS Rights described above when it becomes due and has, therefore, reclassified the ARS as current
marketable securities within its Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2009.

The Company’s future
contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than 1 year, including agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business, are summarized as follows (in millions):

As further described in Note 12 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2009 the Company’s defined benefit pension plans are in an underfunded status of $85.1 million. Due to the rules affecting tax-deductible contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are
offered and the impact of future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and the potential for changes in legislation in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the future periods,
beyond 2010, in which contributions to fund defined benefit pension plans will be made. As further described in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2009, the Company has recorded a liability for unresolved
income tax positions of $292.7 million. Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the amount or the future periods in which income tax payments to settle these
unresolved income tax positions will be made.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Estimates are based on historical experience, when available, and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Management believes that, of its significant accounting policies (see
Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), an understanding of the following critical accounting policies is important in obtaining an overall understanding of the Consolidated Financial Statements.



Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable. The Company makes
estimates regarding the future ability of its customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends. If actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional
accounts receivable write offs may be necessary, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.

Inventory Reserves

The Company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its
products at prices in excess of current carrying costs. The markets in which the Company operates are highly competitive and new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis. These marketplace changes may cause some of the
Company’s products to become obsolete. The Company makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience, expiration of
sterilization dates and expected future trends. If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could
unfavorably affect future operating results.

Income Taxes

The Company operates in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States. Accordingly, management must determine
the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions. Income tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues, including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing and product royalty arrangements,
may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates. Because income tax adjustments in certain
jurisdictions can be significant, the Company records accruals representing management’s best estimate of the probable resolution of these matters. To the extent additional information becomes available, such accruals are adjusted to reflect
the revised estimated probable outcome.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

In 2009 the Company adopted the provisions of the

Business Combinations Topic

of the FASB Codification

.

This topic
significantly changes the principles and requirements for how an acquisition is recognized and measured in financial statements, including the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. This topic also provides guidance for
recognizing and measuring goodwill acquired in a business combination and requires disclosures to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. The additional disclosure
requirements regarding the

Business Combinations Topic

of the FASB Codification are included in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In 2008 the Company adopted the provisions of the

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic

of the FASB Codification for financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis. This
topic applies to all financial assets and financial liabilities that are being measured and reported on a fair value basis, establishes a framework for measuring fair value of assets and liabilities and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. There was no impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of the adoption of this topic. The additional disclosure requirements regarding fair value measurements are included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. In 2009 the Company adopted the non-financial assets and liabilities guidance of the

Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures Topic

that were previously deferred.

In 2008 the Company adopted the provisions of the

Financial Instruments Topic

of the FASB Codification

.

This topic allows
companies the option to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value. Such election, which may be applied on an instrument by instrument basis, is typically irrevocable once elected. The Company has elected to apply the fair value option to
its ARS Rights agreement as more fully described in

Liquidity and Capital Resources

.



Other Matters

The Company distributes its products throughout the world. As a result, the Company’s financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as weak economic conditions or changes in
foreign currency exchange rates. The Company’s operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the U.S. dollar, European currencies, in particular the euro and the British pound, the Japanese yen, the Australian
dollar and the Canadian dollar. When the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the dollar value of sales denominated in foreign currencies increases. When the U.S. dollar strengthens, the opposite situation occurs. The Company develops and
manufactures its products in the United States, Canada, China, France, Germany, Ireland, Puerto Rico and Switzerland and incurs costs in the applicable local currencies. This worldwide deployment of facilities serves to partially mitigate the impact
of currency exchange rate changes on the Company’s cost of sales.

The Company enters into forward currency exchange
contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting risk to the Company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. These nonfunctional currency
exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products as well as, in 2009, intercompany loans associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings. The periods of the
forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies. All forward currency
exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value each period, with resulting gains (losses) included in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

At December 31, 2009, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $2,041.1 million and sell $280.5
million of various currencies (principally U.S. dollars and euros) with maturities ranging from 4 to 106 days. At December 31, 2008, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $412.5 million and sell $288.4
million of various currencies (principally U.S. dollars and euros) with maturities ranging from 2 to 110 days. The estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end spot rates as
adjusted by current forward points. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would change the December 31, 2009 fair value by approximately $79.1 million. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance by counterparties on its outstanding forward currency exchange contracts but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties.

The Company has certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged. These investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currency exchange
rates. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar increased the value of these investments in net assets and the related foreign currency translation adjustment gain in
shareholders’ equity by $73.8 million to $277.5 million from $203.7 million at December 31, 2008.

In 2009 the
Company received a subpoena from the Attorney General of New Jersey requesting various documents related to the financial interests and arrangements of physicians participating in certain clinical trials for or on behalf of the Company. The Company
is evaluating the scope of the subpoena and its response. The Attorney General of New Jersey reportedly issued similar subpoenas to other major medical device manufacturing companies.

In 2009 a federal grand jury in the District of Massachusetts returned an indictment charging Stryker Biotech LLC and certain current and
former employees of Stryker Biotech with wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), distribution of a misbranded device and false statements to the FDA. The Company still hopes to be able to reach a fair and just
resolution of this matter. Conviction of these charges could result in significant monetary fines and Stryker Biotech’s exclusion from participating in federal and state health care programs, which could have a material affect on Stryker
Biotech’s business. However, the ultimate resolution of these matters is not reasonably estimatable at this time. The Company understands that certain former Stryker Biotech employees have pled guilty to charges in connection with this matter.



In 2009 the Company received a warning letter from the U.S. FDA related to compliance issues
for one of its craniomaxillofacial (CMF) implant products that was previously sold through its CMF distribution facility in Portage, Michigan. In 2008 the Company received a warning letter from the FDA related to quality systems and compliance
issues at its OP-1 implant manufacturing facility in Hopkinton, Massachusetts. In 2007 the Company received two warning letters from the FDA regarding compliance with certain quality system specifications at its reconstructive implant manufacturing
facilities: one letter for its facility in Cork, Ireland and another for its facility in Mahwah, New Jersey. In October 2009, the FDA informed the Company that the warning letter related to its OP-1 implant manufacturing facility had been resolved
following a productive reinspection earlier in 2009. The Company takes these matters very seriously and continues to fully cooperate with the FDA to address their observations at the other facilities.

In 2007 the Company announced that it reached a resolution with the U.S. Attorney’s office for the District of New Jersey in connection
with a previously announced investigation relating to “any and all consulting contracts, professional service agreements, or remuneration agreements between Stryker Corporation and any orthopedic surgeon, orthopedic surgeon in training, or
medical school graduate using or considering the surgical use of hip or knee joint replacement/reconstruction products manufactured or sold by Stryker Corporation.” The resolution was in the form of a non-prosecution agreement for an 18-month
period that ended on March 27, 2009. During the term of the agreement, the Company’s Orthopaedics subsidiary was subject to oversight by a federal monitor, as appointed by the U.S. Attorney, regarding compliance with certain standards and
procedures in connection with the retention and payment of orthopaedic surgeon consultants related to reconstructive products and the provision of certain benefits to such surgeons. Subsequent to entering into the non-prosecution agreement, the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (HHS) issued a civil subpoena to the Company in seeking to determine whether the Company violated various laws by paying consulting fees and providing other things of value to
orthopedic surgeons and healthcare and educational institutions as inducements to use Stryker’s orthopedic medical devices in procedures paid for in whole or in part by Medicare. The Company produced numerous documents and other materials to
HHS in response to the subpoena and had been working with HHS to attempt to narrow the scope of the requested production. In 2008 the U.S. Department of Justice and HHS sought judicial enforcement of the subpoena and a court agreed to enforce it in
January 2009. At the same time, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey dismissed the Company’s complaint, which had asked the court to quash the subpoena and sought other appropriate relief on the grounds that the subpoena was
overbroad and oppressive.

In 2007 the Company disclosed that the U.S. SEC made an informal inquiry of the Company regarding
possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in connection with the sale of medical devices in certain foreign countries. Subsequently, in 2008, the Company received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice, Criminal Division,
requesting certain documents for the period since January 1, 2000 in connection with the U.S. SEC inquiry. The Company is fully cooperating with the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. SEC regarding these matters.

The Company is partially self-insured for product liability claims and utilizes a wholly owned captive insurance company in the United
States to manage its self-insured retention limits. The captive insurance company provides insurance reserves for estimated liabilities for product claims incurred but not reported based on actuarially determined liabilities. The actuarial
valuations are based on historical information along with certain assumptions about future events.

ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Stryker Corporation

:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2009. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the consolidated
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2009 the Company changed its method of accounting for business combinations with the adoption of the guidance originally issued in FASB
Statement No. 141(R),

Business Combinations

(codified in FASB ASC Topic 805,

Business Combinations

).

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Stryker Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 26, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2009

NOTE 1

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Business

: Stryker Corporation (the Company or Stryker) is one of the world’s leading medical technology companies with the most broadly based range of products in orthopaedics and a significant presence in other medical
specialties. Stryker works with respected medical professionals to help people lead more active and more satisfying lives. The Company’s products include implants used in joint replacement, trauma, and spinal surgeries; surgical equipment and
surgical navigation systems; endoscopic and communications systems; patient handling and emergency medical equipment as well as other medical device products used in a variety of medical specialties.

Principles of Consolidation

: The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries after
elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions.

Use of Estimates

: The preparation of these Consolidated
Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires Company management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying
notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

: A significant portion of the
Company’s Orthopaedic Implants revenue is generated from consigned inventory maintained at hospitals or with field representatives. The Company retains title to all inventory held on consignment at hospitals or with field locations until the
Company receives appropriate notification that the product has been used or implanted at which time revenue is recognized. The Company records revenue from Orthopaedic Implants not held on consignment and MedSurg Equipment product sales when title
and risk of ownership have been transferred to the customer, which is typically upon shipment to the customer. The Company records estimated sales returns, discounts, rebates and other sales incentives as a reduction of net sales in the same period
revenue is recognized. Estimates of sales returns are recorded for anticipated product returns based on historical sales and returns information. Estimates of sales discounts, rebates and other sales incentives are recorded based on contractual
terms, historical experience and trend analysis.

Shipping and Handling of Products

: Amounts billed to customers for
shipping and handling of products are included in net sales. Costs incurred related to shipping and handling of products are included in cost of sales.

Foreign Currency Translation

: The functional currencies for substantially all of the Company’s international affiliates are their local currencies. Accordingly, the financial statements of
these international affiliates are translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates for balance sheets and average exchange rates for statements of earnings and cash flows. Unrealized translation adjustments are included in accumulated
other comprehensive gain (loss) in shareholders’ equity. Transaction gains and losses, such as those resulting from the settlement of nonfunctional currency receivables or payables, are included in net earnings.

Financial Instruments

: The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts
receivable, other investments, accounts payable, debt and foreign currency exchange contracts. The Company’s estimates of fair value for financial instruments approximate their carrying amounts as of December 31, 2009 and 2008.

The Company adopted the provisions of the

Financial Instruments

and the

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topics

of
the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (Codification) in 2008. The required disclosures regarding the fair value of financial instruments are included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



Stryker Corporation and Subsidiaries

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

December 31, 2009

Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased. Marketable securities consist of marketable debt securities and certificates of deposit and mutual
funds. Mutual funds are acquired to offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements and are expected to be used to settle these liabilities. Pursuant to the Company’s investment policy, all individual
marketable security investments must have a minimum credit quality of single A (per Standard & Poor’s or Fitch) or A2 (per Moody’s Corporation) at the time of acquisition, while the overall portfolio of marketable securities must
maintain a minimum average credit quality of double A (per Standard & Poor’s or Fitch) or Aa (per Moody’s Corporation). In the event of a rating downgrade below the minimum credit quality subsequent to purchase, the marketable
security investment is evaluated to determine the appropriate action to take to minimize the overall risk to the Company’s marketable security investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2009, approximately 1% of the Company’s
investments in marketable securities had a credit quality rating of less than single A (per Standard & Poor’s or Fitch) and A2 (per Moody’s Corporation).

The Company follows the provisions of the

Investments-Debt and Equity Securities Topic

of the FASB Codification in accounting for its
marketable securities, which are classified as available-for-sale and trading securities. This topic requires the Company to recognize all marketable securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Company’s marketable
securities are stated at fair value pursuant to the requirements of the

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic

of the FASB Codification. Adjustments to the fair value of marketable securities that are classified as available-for-sale
are recorded as increases or decreases, net of income taxes, within accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) in shareholders’ equity and adjustments to the fair value of marketable securities that are classified as trading are recorded in
earnings. The amortized cost of marketable debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts to maturity computed under the effective interest method. Such amortization is included in other income (expense) along with interest
and realized gains and losses. The cost of securities sold is determined by the specific identification method.

The Company
reviews declines in the fair value of its investments classified as available-for-sale for impairment in accordance with the provisions of the

Investments-Debt and Equity Securities Topic

of the FASB Codification in order to determine whether
the decline in fair value is an other-than-temporary impairment. Other-than-temporary impairments of available-for-sale marketable securities are recorded in earnings.

The Company follows the provisions of the

Derivatives and Hedging Topic

of the FASB Codification, which requires the Company to recognize all derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair
value. The Company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting risk to the Company that would otherwise result from changes
in exchange rates. These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products. The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to
the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies. All forward currency exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value
each period, with resulting gains (losses) included in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Accounts Receivable

:

Accounts receivable consists of trade and other miscellaneous receivables. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable. The
Company makes estimates regarding the future ability of its customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends. Accounts receivable are written off when all reasonable collection efforts are
exhausted.



Stryker Corporation and Subsidiaries

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

December 31, 2009

Accounts Receivable Securitization

: The Company did not extend its $100 million accounts receivable securitization facility agreement upon its expiration on April 24, 2009. There were no
amounts of undivided percentage ownership interests in accounts receivable sold by Stryker Funding Corporation, a wholly owned special-purpose subsidiary of the Company, under the facility as of December 31, 2008 or at any time thereafter.

Inventories

: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost for approximately 84% of inventories is
determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method. Cost for certain domestic inventories is determined using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) cost method. The FIFO cost for all inventories approximates replacement cost.

The Company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in
excess of current carrying costs. The markets in which the Company operates are highly competitive, and new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis. Such marketplace changes may cause some of the Company’s products
to become obsolete. The Company makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and
expected future trends.

Property, Plant and Equipment

: Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation
is computed by either the straight-line or declining-balance method over the estimated useful lives of 3 to 30 years for buildings and improvements and 3 to 10 years for machinery and equipment.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets:

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of tangible net assets of
acquired businesses after amounts allocated to other intangible assets. Other intangible assets include developed technology, which is amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years and customer relationships (which reflect expected continued
customer patronage), trademarks and patents, which are amortized on a straight-line basis over 4 to 40 years (weighted-average life of 15 years for other intangible assets).

Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets Impairment Tests:

The

Intangibles-Goodwill and Other Topic

of the FASB Codification requires
companies to test goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis. The Company performs the annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year using a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made
regarding market conditions and the Company’s future profitability. The Company also performs impairment tests of goodwill and other intangible and long-lived assets during interim periods upon the occurrence of certain events or changes in
circumstance as defined in the

Property, Plant, and Equipment

and

Presentation of Financial Statements Topics

of the FASB Codification.

Loaner Instrumentation

: Loaner instrumentation represents the net book value of loaner instruments for surgical implants provided to customers by the Company. Loaner instrumentation is amortized on
a straight-line basis over a 3-year period. Amortization expense for loaner instrumentation is included in selling, general and administrative expenses.



Stryker Corporation and Subsidiaries

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

December 31, 2009

Stock Options:

At December 31, 2009, the Company had key employee and director stock option plans, which are described more fully in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Pursuant
to the provisions of the

Compensation-Stock Compensation Topic

of the FASB Codification, the Company measures the cost of employee stock options based on the grant-date fair value and recognizes that cost over the period during which a
recipient is required to provide services in exchange for the options, typically the vesting period. The weighted-average fair value per share of options granted during 2009, 2008 and 2007, estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model, was $13.09, $19.87 and $21.90, respectively. The fair value of options granted was estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions:

The
risk-free interest rate for periods within the expected life of options granted is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Expected stock price volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company’s stock.
The expected option life, representing the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding, is based on historical option exercise and employee termination data. The Company recognizes the cost of stock options using the
straight-line method over their vesting periods.

Income Taxes

: The Company accounts for income taxes using the
liability method pursuant to the provisions of the

Income Taxes Topic

of the FASB Codification. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and income tax bases
of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted income tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax credit represents the change in net deferred income tax assets and
liabilities during the year. Interest expense and penalties incurred associated with unresolved income tax positions are included in other income (expense) pursuant to the provisions of the

Income Taxes Topic

of the FASB Codification.

The Company operates in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States. Income tax authorities
in these jurisdictions regularly perform audits of the Company’s income tax filings. Accordingly, management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions based on current interpretations of complex income
tax regulations. Income tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues, including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing and product royalty arrangements, may require an extended period of time to resolve and
may result in significant income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates.

Legal and Other Contingencies:

The Company is involved in various proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor and
intellectual property, and other matters that are more fully described in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time. In certain of the legal proceedings,
the claimants seek damages, as well as other compensatory relief, which could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements. In legal matters for which management has sufficient information to reasonably estimate the Company’s
future obligations, a liability representing management’s best estimate of the probable cost, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, for the resolution of these legal matters is
recorded. The estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies.

December 31, 2009

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Gain (Loss)

:

The components of accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) are as follows (in millions):

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

: In 2009 the Company adopted the provisions of the FASB
Statement No. 168,

The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles—a replacement of FASB Statement No. 162

. This Statement establishes the FASB Codification as the source
of authoritative U.S. GAAP, together with rules and interpretive releases of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (U.S. SEC), under authority of federal securities laws. All existing accounting standards are superseded as described in this
statement. All other accounting literature not included in the FASB Codification is nonauthoritative.

In 2009 the Company
adopted the provisions of the

Business Combinations Topic

of the FASB Codification

.

This topic significantly changes the principles and requirements for how an acquisition is recognized and measured in a company’s financial
statements including the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. This topic also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring goodwill acquired in a business combination and required disclosures to enable users of the financial
statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. The additional disclosure requirements regarding

Business Combinations Topic

of the FASB Codification are included in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

In 2009 the Company adopted the provisions of the

Derivatives and Hedging Topic

of the FASB Codification.
This topic requires enhanced disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities to enable investors to better understand a company’s use of derivative instruments and their effect on a company’s financial position, financial
performance, and cash flows. The enhanced disclosures regarding derivative instruments and hedging activities are included in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In 2009 the Company adopted FASB’s guidance on

Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or
Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions that are Not Orderly

(included in the

Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures Topic

of the FASB Codification) and

Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary
Impairments

(included in the

Investment—Debt and Equity Securities Topic

of the FASB Codification)

.

This new guidance provides additional application rules and enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements and impairments
of securities and clarifies the objective and method of fair value measurement even when there has been a significant decrease in market activity for the asset being measured. In addition, this guidance establishes a new model for measuring
other-than-temporary impairments for debt securities, including establishing criteria for when to recognize a write-down through earnings. The required disclosures regarding the fair value of financial instruments are included in Note 2 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.



Stryker Corporation and Subsidiaries

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

December 31, 2009

In 2009 the Company adopted the FASB’s guidance on

Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plant Assets

(included in the

Compensation-Retirements Benefits Topic

of the
FASB Codification). This guidance requires enhanced employer’s disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. The required disclosures about plan assets are included in Note 12 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

In 2009 the Company adopted the provisions of the

Subsequent Events Topic

, as amended, of the
FASB Codification. This topic establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the date that the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. The required
disclosures are included in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

: In
2009 the FASB issued the

Improvement to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities Topic

of the FASB Codification. The topic requires a qualitative approach to identifying a controlling financial interest in a
variable interest entity (VIE), and requires ongoing assessment of whether an entity is a VIE and whether an interest in a VIE makes the holder the primary beneficiary of the VIE. This topic is effective for the Company beginning on January 1,
2010. The Company does not expect the adoption of the topic to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

In 2010 the FASB issued an update to the

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic

“

Improving Disclosures About Fair Value Measurements”

of the FASB Codification that requires reporting entities to make new
disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair-value measurements including significant transfers into and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair-value measurements, and information on purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis in the
reconciliation of Level 3 fair-value measurements. The update to the

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic

“

Improving Disclosures About Fair Value Measurements”

of the FASB Codification is effective for annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for Level 3 reconciliation disclosures, which are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2010. The Company does not expect the adoption of the update to have a
material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

Reclassifications:

Certain prior year amounts have been
reclassified to conform with the presentation used in 2009. In 2009 the Company disclosed payments of restructuring charges separately in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

NOTE 2

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, other investments,
accounts payable, debt and foreign currency exchange contracts. The Company’s estimates of fair value for financial instruments approximate their carrying amounts as of December 31, 2009.



Stryker Corporation and Subsidiaries

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

December 31, 2009

Pursuant to the requirements of the

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic

of the FASB Codification

,

the Company’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a
recurring basis are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:

The
following describes the methods the Company uses to estimate the fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities:

Cash
and cash equivalents:

The Company considers the carrying values of these financial instruments to approximate fair value
for these financial instruments because of the short period of time between origination of the instruments and their expected realization.

Available-for-sale marketable securities:

The Company’s Level 2 available-for-sale marketable securities
primarily include U.S. government and agency securities, foreign government debt securities, asset-backed debt securities, commercial paper, corporate debt securities, and certificates of deposit. The Company’s Level 2 available-for-sale
marketable securities values are determined using prices for recently traded financial instruments with similar underlying terms as well as directly or indirectly observable inputs, such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at
commonly quoted intervals. The Company’s Level 3 available-for-sale marketable securities include corporate debt securities. The Company’s Level 3 available-for-sale marketable securities valuations are based on the income approach,
specifically discounted cash flow analyses that utilize significant inputs based on the Company’s estimates and assumptions. Using this approach, estimates for timing and amount of cash flows and expected holding periods of the securities were
used and the expected future cash flows were calculated over the expected life of each security and were discounted to a single present value using an estimated market required rate of return.

Trading marketable securities and Auction-Rate Securities (ARS) Rights:

The Company’s Level 1 trading marketable securities consist of mutual funds and are valued using a market approach based on quoted prices for the specific mutual fund from transactions in active
exchange markets.

The Company’s Level 3 trading marketable securities include investments in auction-rate securities
(ARS), the majority of which are triple A rated (per Standard & Poor’s) and collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Education. The interest rates of these ARS investments are reset through an auction
process, most commonly at intervals of 7, 28 and 35 days.



Stryker Corporation and Subsidiaries

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

December 31, 2009

Beginning in February 2008, liquidity issues in the global credit markets resulted in the failure of auctions for all of the ARS investments held by the Company, as the amount of securities submitted for
sale in those auctions exceeded the amount of purchase bids. As of December 31, 2009, the Company held $156.3 million, at par value, of ARS investments. In 2008 the Company entered into an ARS Rights agreement (Rights) with UBS Financial
Services Inc. (UBS), one of its investment providers, whereby the Company received the right to sell its ARS at par value to UBS at any time during the period from June 30, 2010 through July 2, 2012. These ARS Rights are
nontransferable securities registered with the U.S. SEC. The Company has elected to apply the fair value option to its ARS Rights pursuant to the provisions of the

Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Topic

of the
FASB Codification. As a result of this election, in the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2009, the Company recorded a loss of $11.0 million in other income (expense) to recognize the change in fair value estimate of its ARS Rights. This
loss was offset by a corresponding gain in the fair value estimate of the related trading marketable securities. In 2008 the Company recorded a gain of $28.0 million in other income (expense), and a corresponding non-current asset within the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Simultaneously, the Company transferred the ARS investments, at their fair value of $138.8 million, from available-for-sale to trading marketable securities. As a result of this transfer, the Company recognized a loss of
$28.0 million in other income (expense), reflecting a reversal of the related temporary valuation allowance that was previously recorded within accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) in shareholders’ equity.

As a result of the illiquidity in the market for ARS investments, the Company has estimated the fair value of its ARS and ARS Rights using a
Level 3 valuation methodology. The Company’s Level 3 valuations of its ARS and ARS Rights are based on the income approach, specifically discounted cash flow analyses that utilize significant inputs based on the Company’s estimates
and assumptions. The discounted cash flow analyses included the following assumptions at December 31, 2009: current coupon rates, expected maturity and current discount rates. The current coupon rates are based on forecasted interest rates,
specifically the 3 month U.S. Treasury bill plus the applicable coupon spread, generally 120 basis points. The expected maturity assumption is based on the weighted average remaining term for the underlying student loans financed by the trusts that
issued the ARS. Based on available information, the expected maturity reflects a 17 year assumption. The current discount rates reflect a base rate, a credit spread and an illiquidity premium. The base rate corresponds to the 3month Libor, which is
also the base rate that matches the credit spread. The credit spread is consistent with triple A rated investments collateralized by student loans that are guaranteed by the U.S. Government under the Federal Family Education Loan Program. The
illiquidity premium estimate is a proxy for additional return required in holding illiquid assets. The Company’s valuation was supported by a broker pricing valuation that incorporates transaction details, such as contractual terms,
maturity, timing and anticipated amounts of future cash flows, as well as assumptions about liquidity and credit valuation adjustments by marketplace participants at December 31, 2009. These adjustments are subject to future changes as the
underlying market conditions and marketplace sources change.

Foreign currency exchange contracts:

The Company values foreign currency exchange contracts using a market approach based on foreign currency exchange rates obtained from active
markets. The estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points. At December 31, 2009, the fair value carrying amount of the
Company’s forward currency exchange contracts assets and liabilities were $8.3 million and $6.2 million, respectively.

The gross unrealized losses and fair value of the
Company’s investments with unrealized losses that are not deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, aggregated by investment category and length of time that the individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, at
December 31, 2009 are as follows (in millions):

The unrealized losses on the Company’s
investments in corporate and asset backed and U.S. agency debt securities were primarily caused by increases in interest yields as a result of continued challenging conditions in the global credit markets. While many of these investments have been
downgraded by rating agencies since their initial purchase, less than 1% of the Company’s investments in corporate and asset-backed debt securities had a credit quality rating of less than single A (per Standard & Poor’s or
Fitch). Because the Company does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity, the Company does
not consider those investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2009.

The unrealized losses on the
Company’s investments in foreign government debt securities were also caused by interest rate increases. Because the decline in market value is attributable to changes in interest rates and because the Company does not intend to sell the
investments and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider those investments to be
other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2009.

Pursuant to the Company’s investment policy, all individual
marketable security investments must have a minimum credit quality of single A (per Standard & Poor’s or Fitch) or A2 (per Moody’s Corporation) at the time of acquisition, while the overall portfolio of marketable securities must
maintain a minimum average credit quality of double A (per Standard & Poor’s or Fitch) or Aa (per Moody’s Corporation). In the event of a rating downgrade below the minimum credit quality subsequent to purchase, the marketable
security investment is evaluated to determine the appropriate action to take to minimize the overall risk to the Company’s marketable

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING STRATEGIES

The Company follows the provisions of the

Derivatives and Hedging Topic

of the FASB Codification, which requires the Company to recognize all derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair
value.

The Company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on
transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting risk to the Company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. These currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from
intercompany purchases of manufactured products as well as, in 2009, intercompany loans associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings. The duration of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the anticipated period the
intercompany receivables and payables remain outstanding. The Company does not designate these contracts as hedges; therefore, all forward currency exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value each period, with resulting gains and losses
included in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as an offset to the gains and losses recognized on the intercompany receivables and payables. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, recognized
foreign currency transaction losses included in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings were $1.1 million and $6.0 million, respectively.

At December 31, 2009, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $2,041.1 million and sell $280.5 million of various currencies (principally U.S. dollars and euros)
with original maturities ranging from 4 to 106 days. The maximum length of time over which the Company is limiting its exposure to the reduction in value of nonfunctional receivables and payables through foreign currency exchange contracts is
through March 31, 2010. At December 31, 2008, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $412.5 million and sell $288.4 million of various currencies (principally U.S. dollars and euros) with maturities
ranging from 2 to 110 days.

At December 31, 2009, the fair value carrying amount of the Company’s forward currency
exchange contracts asset and liabilities were $8.3 million and $6.2 million, respectively, and was included as a component of prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. The estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance by counterparties on its outstanding forward currency exchange contracts but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of its counterparties.

ACQUISITIONS

On December 31, 2009, the Company acquired Ascent Healthcare Solutions, Inc. (Ascent), the market
leader in the reprocessing and remanufacturing of medical devices in the United States, in an all cash transaction for $525.0 million. The acquisition of Ascent is expected to enhance the Company’s product offerings as well as provide cost
savings opportunities to its customers in its MedSurg Equipment segment. The Ascent acquisition did not have any effect on the Company’s consolidated net sales and operating income for 2009. Ascent had sales of $133.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2009 and sales of $109.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.

During 2009 the Company
acquired certain additional companies that are expected to enhance the Company’s product offerings to its customers within its Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment business segments. These acquisitions did not have a material effect on
the Company’s consolidated net sales and operating income for 2009.

The acquisitions described above were accounted for
pursuant to the requirements of the

Business Combinations Topic

of the FASB Codification. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a result of the acquisitions were included in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
December 31, 2009. Pro forma consolidated results of operations would not differ significantly as a result of these acquisitions.

The purchase price for each of the acquisitions described above was preliminarily allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The fair value
assigned to identifiable intangible assets acquired was determined primarily by using the income approach. The excess purchase price over the value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. Purchased
identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives. With respect to the Ascent acquisition, the estimated useful lives range between 11 and 15 years; for all other
acquisitions, the estimated useful lives range between 2 and 11 years.

For all acquisitions, the preliminary allocation of
the purchase price was based upon a preliminary valuation, and the Company’s estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period as valuations are finalized. The table below represents the allocation of the preliminary
purchase price to the acquired net assets of Ascent and all other acquisitions completed in 2009 (in millions):



Stryker Corporation and Subsidiaries

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

December 31, 2009

Goodwill associated with
the acquisition of Ascent was $329.1 million and was $58.4 million for all other acquisitions. The factors that contributed to the recognition of goodwill included securing synergies that are specific to the Company’s business and not available
to other market participants, which are expected to increase revenues and profits; acquisition of a talented workforce; and cost savings opportunities.

In 2004 the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of SpineCore, Inc. (SpineCore), a developer of artificial lumbar and cervical discs for an upfront payment of $120.0 million in cash plus certain
transaction costs. Terms of the transaction also include potential milestone and royalty payments of up to an additional $240.0 million upon commercialization of SpineCore’s products in the United States. The potential milestone payments are
expected to be capitalized at their fair values as intangible assets at the time of payment. Current products under development include the FlexiCore lumbar artificial disc and the CerviCore cervical artificial disc.

The Company believes that the technologies acquired in the SpineCore acquisition will result in the introduction of new products and
additional future sales. However, unanticipated issues may arise that could further delay or terminate a product’s development prior to regulatory approval or commercialization, which could have an unfavorable impact on the Company’s
operating results. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had not encountered significant issues and expects completion of the development and initial U.S. commercialization of the FlexiCore lumbar artificial disc and the CerviCore cervical
artificial disc following receipt of all required regulatory approvals.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In 2007 the Company sold its outpatient physical therapy
business, Physiotherapy Associates, for $150.0 million in cash less certain indebtedness. The sale of Physiotherapy Associates allowed the Company to focus its efforts on the medical technology market. The sale of Physiotherapy Associates resulted
in a gain of $25.7 million (net of $15.0 million income tax expense), or $0.06 per diluted share. Net sales from discontinued operations and net earnings from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $107.4 million and
$5.0 million, respectively.

RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

In 2009 the Company initiated a number of restructuring projects focused on shifting resources to those areas where the Company has the
greatest opportunities for growth and streamlining operations to drive operating leverage. In 2008 the Company made decisions to simplify the structure of its Japanese distribution business and to substantially reduce development efforts associated
with product technologies purchased in the Sightline Technologies Ltd. acquisition in 2006. The Company recorded restructuring charges in 2009 and 2008 consisting of the following items (in millions):

2009 Charges:

The $30.3 million agent conversion charges represent costs associated with the termination of certain third-party agent agreements at the
Company’s Europe, Middle East, Africa (EMEA) Division. This initiative is intended to provide the Company greater control over its distribution channels as well as improve customer focus and selling efficiency. The $18.3 million asset
impairment charges are associated with the Company’s decision to discontinue selling certain products within its Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment business segments and relates primarily to identifiable intangible assets. The
discontinued product lines are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s future operating results. The $12.9 million severance and related costs charge represents workforce reduction employment-related severance costs for
approximately 120 employees resulting from the Company’s decision to simplify the organization structure at its Biotech, EMEA, Japan and Canada divisions. The $5.5 million contractual obligations and other charges represent costs associated
with the termination of various supplier contracts as well as other incidental costs related to the discontinued product lines.

Charges

:

The $22.3 million asset impairment charges represent the excess of net book value over fair market value for
assets to be disposed of by sale, primarily related to sales offices and warehousing and distribution facilities in Japan. The $8.5 million charge represents employment-related severance costs for 84 employees. The $4.1 million contractual
obligations and other charges represent costs associated with the termination of various supplier contracts as well as other incidental costs.

The Company also has a $1,000.0 million Unsecured Credit Facility (Facility). The Facility, which expires in November 2010, includes a senior 5-year nonamortizing, revolving credit agreement with a
maximum amount of $1,000.0 million. The Company may increase the Facility maximum limit in $100.0 million increments up to an additional $500.0 million upon acceptance by the existing lender group or additional lenders. No amounts were outstanding
under the Unsecured Credit Facility as of December 31, 2009 and 2008.

The Unsecured Credit Facility requires a facility
fee ranging from 0.04% to 0.15% on the aggregate commitment of the Facility, depending on the Company’s debt rating. The Facility includes a $500.0 million multicurrency sublimit, under which yen and euro can be borrowed; a $100.0 million swing
line sublimit; and a $100.0 million letter of credit sublimit. The Facility bears interest at a base rate, as defined, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.12% to 0.475%, depending on the Company’s debt rating.

During 2009 the weighted-average interest rate, excluding required fees, for all borrowings was 4.3%. The Facility requires the Company to comply with certain financial and other covenants. The Company
was in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2009. In addition to the Facility, the Company has lines of credit, issued by various financial institutions, available to fund the Company’s day-to-day operating needs. At
December 31, 2009, the Company had $1,049.2 million of additional borrowing capacity available under all of its existing credit facilities.

The carrying amounts of the Company’s debt approximate their fair values, based on the quoted interest rates for similar types and amounts of borrowing agreements.

Interest paid on debt, including required fees, was $5.3 million in 2009, $5.7 million in 2008 and $6.5 million in 2007 and approximates
amounts reflected in interest expense, which is included in other income (expense).

CAPITAL STOCK

In December 2009 the
Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $750.0 million of its common stock. The manner, timing and amount of any purchases will be determined by the Company’s management based on their evaluation of market
conditions, stock price and other factors and will be subject to regulatory considerations. Purchases may be made from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The Company had not made any stock repurchases
relative to the $750.0 million repurchase program as of December 31, 2009.

In October 2009 the Company’s Board of
Directors modified the Company’s dividend policy to adopt a quarterly payment schedule in lieu of an annual dividend. In conjunction with this modification, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash transition dividend of $0.10 per
share. The transition dividend increased the total dividends paid in 2009 to $0.50 per share, up 52% from the $0.33 per share paid in 2008. In addition, in December 2009 the Company’s Board of Directors declared its first quarterly dividend of
$0.15 per share payable January 29, 2010 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 30, 2009.

During 2008 the Company repurchased 17.4 million shares of common stock in the open market at a cost of $1,000.0 million pursuant to the repurchase programs authorized by the Company’s Board of Directors. Shares repurchased under
the share repurchase programs are available for general corporate purposes, including offsetting dilution associated with stock option and other equity-based employee benefit plans

Deferred income taxes reflect the net income tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying

owned entities operating in Ireland. The Company believes it followed the applicable tax law and Treasury regulations and will vigorously defend these income tax positions. If the IRS were ultimately to prevail with respect to its proposed
adjustments, such adjustments could have a material unfavorable impact on the Company’s income tax expense and net earnings in future periods.

Interest expense and penalties included in other income (expense) were $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Accrued interest and penalties included in accrued expenses and other
liabilities were $58.7 million and $52.6 million at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively.

It is
reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change due to one or more of the following events in the next twelve months: expiring statutes, audit activity, tax payments, competent authority proceedings related
to transfer pricing, or final decisions in matters that are the subject of controversy in various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate, including cost sharing and product royalty arrangements. The Company is not able to reasonably estimate the
amount or the future periods in which changes in unrecognized tax benefits may be required.

SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

The Company segregates its operations into two reportable business segments: Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The Orthopaedic
Implants segment includes orthopaedic reconstructive (hip and knee), trauma and spinal implant systems and other related products. The MedSurg Equipment segment includes surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems; endoscopic and
communications systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. The Other category includes corporate administration, interest expense, interest and marketable securities income and share-based compensation, which includes
compensation related to both employee and director stock option and restricted stock grants.

The Company’s reportable
segments are business units that offer different products and services and are managed separately because each business requires different manufacturing, technology and marketing strategies. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as
those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company measures the financial results of its reportable segments using an internal performance measure that excludes the
patent litigation gain and the income tax expenses associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings recorded in 2009, the restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and 2008 and the intangible asset impairment charge recorded in 2007. Identifiable
assets are those assets used exclusively in the operations of each business segment or allocated when used jointly. Corporate assets are principally cash and cash equivalents; marketable securities and property, plant and equipment. The identifiable
assets of the MedSurg Equipment segment at December 31, 2009 include the acquired assets of Ascent Healthcare Solutions, Inc.

CONTINGENCIES

In 2009 the Company received a subpoena from the Attorney General of New Jersey requesting various documents related to the financial
interests and arrangements of physicians participating in certain clinical trials for or on behalf of the Company. The Company is evaluating the scope of the subpoena and its response. The Attorney General of New Jersey reportedly issued
similar subpoenas to other major medical device manufacturing companies.

In 2009 a federal grand jury in the District of
Massachusetts returned an indictment charging Stryker Biotech LLC and certain current and former employees of Stryker Biotech with wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), distribution of a misbranded device and
false statements to the FDA. The Company still hopes to be able to reach a fair and just resolution of this matter. Conviction of these charges could result in significant monetary fines and Stryker Biotech’s exclusion from participating in
federal and state health care programs, which could have a material affect on Stryker Biotech’s business. However, the ultimate resolution of these matters is not reasonably estimatable at this time. The Company understands that certain former
Stryker Biotech employees have pled guilty to charges in connection with this matter.

In 2009 the Company received a warning
letter from the U.S. FDA related to compliance issues for one of its craniomaxillofacial (CMF) implant products that was previously sold through its CMF distribution facility in Portage, Michigan. In 2008 the Company received a warning letter from
the FDA related to quality systems and compliance issues at its OP-1 implant manufacturing facility in Hopkinton, Massachusetts. In 2007 the Company received two warning letters from the FDA regarding compliance with certain quality system
specifications at its reconstructive implant manufacturing facilities: one letter for its facility in Cork, Ireland and another for its facility in Mahwah, New Jersey. In October 2009, the FDA informed the Company that the warning letter related to
its OP-1 implant manufacturing facility had been resolved following a productive reinspection earlier in 2009. The Company takes these matters very seriously and continues to fully cooperate with the FDA to address their observations at the other
facilities.

In 2007 the Company announced that it reached a resolution with the U.S. Attorney’s office for the District
of New Jersey in connection with a previously announced investigation relating to “any and all consulting contracts, professional service agreements, or remuneration agreements between Stryker Corporation and any orthopedic surgeon, orthopedic
surgeon in training, or medical school graduate using or considering the surgical use of hip or knee joint replacement/reconstruction products manufactured or sold by Stryker Corporation.” The resolution was in the form of a non-prosecution
agreement for an 18-month period that ended on March 27, 2009.

During the term of the agreement, the Company’s Orthopaedics
subsidiary was subject to oversight by a federal monitor, as appointed by the U.S. Attorney, regarding compliance with certain standards and procedures in connection with the retention and payment of orthopaedic surgeon consultants related to
reconstructive products and the provision of certain benefits to such surgeons. Subsequent to entering into the non-prosecution agreement, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (HHS) issued a civil subpoena to
the Company in seeking to determine whether the Company violated various laws by paying consulting fees and providing other things of value to orthopedic surgeons and healthcare and educational institutions as inducements to use Stryker’s
orthopedic medical devices in procedures paid for in whole or in part by Medicare. The Company produced numerous documents and other materials to HHS in response to the subpoena and had been working with HHS to attempt to narrow the scope of the
requested production. In 2008 the U.S. Department of Justice and HHS sought judicial enforcement of the subpoena and a court agreed to enforce it in January 2009. At the same time, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey dismissed the
Company’s complaint, which had asked the court to quash the subpoena and sought other appropriate relief on the grounds that the subpoena was overbroad and oppressive.

December 31, 2009

In 2007 the Company disclosed that the U.S. SEC made an informal inquiry of the Company regarding possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in connection with the sale of medical devices in
certain foreign countries. Subsequently, in 2008, the Company received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice, Criminal Division, requesting certain documents for the period since January 1, 2000 in connection with the U.S. SEC inquiry.
The Company is fully cooperating with the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. SEC regarding these matters.

Pursuant to
certain of the Company’s credit and lease agreements, the Company has provided financial guarantees to third parties in the form of indemnification provisions. These provisions indemnify the third parties for costs, including but not limited to
adverse judgments in lawsuits and the imposition of additional income taxes due to either a change in the tax law or an adverse interpretation of the tax law. The terms of the guarantees are equal to the terms of the related credit or lease
agreements. The Company is not able to calculate the maximum potential amount of future payments it could be required to make under these guarantees, as any potential payment is dependent on the occurrence of future unknown events (e.g., changes in
U.S. or foreign tax laws).

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

On January 15, 2010, the Company sold $500.0 million of senior unsecured notes due
January 15, 2015 (the “2015 Notes”) and $500.0 million of senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2020 (the “2020 Notes”). The 2015 Notes will bear interest at 3.00% per year and, unless previously redeemed, will
mature on January 15, 2015. The 2020 Notes will bear interest at 4.375% per year and, unless previously redeemed, will mature on January 15, 2020. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for working capital and
other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, stock repurchases and other business opportunities.

On
January 15, 2010, a class action lawsuit against the Company was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of those who purchased the Company’s common stock between January 25, 2007 and
November 13, 2008, inclusive. The lawsuit seeks remedies under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company is evaluating the scope of the claim and intends to defend itself vigorously.

Pursuant to the

Subsequent Events Topic

of the FASB Codification, the Company evaluated subsequent events after December 31,
2009 and concluded that no material transactions occurred subsequent to that date that provided additional evidence about conditions that existed at or after December 31, 2009 that require adjustment to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures—

An evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2009 was carried out under the supervision and with the
participation of the Company’s management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (the “Certifying Officers”). Based on that evaluation, the Certifying Officers concluded
that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting—

There was no change to the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2009 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting

—The management of Stryker Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Stryker Corporation’s internal
control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.

Stryker Corporation’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2009. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

. Based on that assessment, management
believes that, as of December 31, 2009, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.

Stryker Corporation’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. This report appears
on the following page.

Other Matters

—The Company is in the process of implementing new Enterprise Resource
Planning (ERP) systems at certain of its divisions. An ERP system is a fully-integrated set of programs and databases that incorporate order processing, production planning and scheduling, purchasing, accounts receivable and inventory management and
accounting. The Company’s Europe division continues to transition to its new ERP system. In connection with this ERP system implementation, the Company will update its internal controls over financial reporting, as necessary, to accommodate
modifications to its business processes and accounting procedures. The Company does not believe that this ERP system implementation will have an adverse effect on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Stryker Corporation:

We have audited Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on
criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Stryker Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies
and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

In our opinion, Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the COSO criteria

.

We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of
earnings, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009 of Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries, and our report dated February 26, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
