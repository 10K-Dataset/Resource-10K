    “schedules,” “estimates,”
    “budgets” and similar expressions are intended to
    identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are
    not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain
    risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond
    the company’s control and are difficult to predict.
    Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially
    from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking
    statements. The reader should not place undue reliance on these
    forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of

    Petroleum Exporting Countries; the potential liability for
    remedial actions or assessments under existing or future
    environmental regulations and litigation; significant investment
    or product changes under existing or future environmental
    statutes, regulations and litigation; the potential liability
    resulting from other pending or future litigation; the
    company’s future acquisition or disposition of assets and

General
    Development of Business

Summary
    Description of Chevron

Chevron Corporation,* a Delaware corporation, manages its
    investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides
    administrative, financial, management and technology support to
    U.S. and international subsidiaries that engage in fully
    integrated petroleum operations, chemicals operations, mining
    operations, power generation and energy services. Exploration
    and production (upstream) operations consist of exploring for,
    developing and producing crude oil and natural gas and also
    marketing natural gas. Refining, marketing and transportation
    (downstream) operations relate to refining crude oil and
    converting natural gas into finished petroleum products;
    marketing crude oil and the many products derived from
    petroleum; and transporting crude oil, natural gas and petroleum
    products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail
    car. Chemicals operations include the manufacture and marketing
    of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and
    fuel and lubricant oil additives.

A list of the company’s major subsidiaries is presented on
    pages

E-23

and

E-24.

As
    of December 31, 2009, Chevron had approximately
    64,000 employees (including about 4,000 service station
    employees). Approximately 31,500 employees (including about
    3,500 service station employees), or 49 percent, were
    employed in U.S. operations.

Overview
    of Petroleum Industry

Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced
    by many factors, and individual petroleum companies have little
    control over some of them. Governmental policies, particularly
    in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment, have a
    significant impact on petroleum activities, regulating how
    companies are structured and where and how companies conduct
    their operations and formulate their products and, in some
    cases, limiting their profits directly. Prices for crude oil,
    natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally
    determined by supply and demand for these commodities. However,
    some governments impose price controls on refined products such
    as gasoline or diesel fuel. The members of the Organization of
    Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) are typically the
    world’s swing producers of crude oil, and their production
    levels are a major factor in determining worldwide supply.
    Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is
    largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global
    economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to
    other energy sources also play a significant part. Seasonality
    is not a primary driver of changes in the company’s
    quarterly earnings during the year.

Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and
    petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and
    chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. Chevron
    competes with fully integrated major global petroleum companies,
    as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the
    acquisition of crude-oil and natural-gas leases and other
    properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop
    and operate those properties. In its downstream business,
    Chevron also competes with fully integrated major petroleum
    companies and other independent refining, marketing and
    transportation entities and national petroleum companies in the
    sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many
    national and international markets.

Operating
    Environment

Refer to pages FS-2 through FS-9 of this

Form 10-K

in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the
    company’s current business environment and outlook.

*

Incorporated in Delaware in
    1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the company adopted
    the name Chevron Corporation in 1984 and ChevronTexaco
    Corporation in 2001. In 2005, ChevronTexaco Corporation changed
    its name to Chevron Corporation. As used in this report, the
    term “Chevron” and such terms as “the
    company,” “the corporation,” “our,”
    “we” and “us” may refer to Chevron
    Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or
    all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated otherwise, it
    does not include “affiliates” of Chevron —
    i.e., those companies accounted for by the equity method
    (generally owned 50 percent or less) or investments
    accounted for by the cost method. All of these terms are used
    for convenience only and are not intended as a precise
    description of any of the separate companies, each of which
    manages its own affairs.



Chevron
    Strategic Direction

Chevron’s primary objective is to create stockholder value
    and achieve sustained financial returns from its operations that
    will enable it to outperform its competitors. In the upstream,
    the company’s strategies are to grow profitably in core
    areas, build new legacy positions and commercialize the
    company’s equity natural-gas resource base while growing a
    high-impact global gas business. In the downstream, the
    strategies are to improve returns and selectively grow, with a
    focus on integrated value creation. The company also continues
    to invest in renewable-energy technologies, with an objective of
    capturing profitable positions.

(b)

Description
    of Business and Properties

The upstream, downstream and chemicals activities of the company
    and its equity affiliates are widely dispersed geographically,
    with operations in North America, South America, Europe, Africa,
    the Middle East, Asia and Australia. Tabulations of segment
    sales and other operating revenues, earnings and income taxes
    for the three years ending December 31, 2009, and assets as
    of the end of 2009 and 2008 — for the United States
    and the company’s international geographic
    areas — are in Note 11 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements beginning on

page FS-40.

Similar comparative data for the company’s investments in
    and income from equity affiliates and property, plant and
    equipment are in Notes 12 and 13 on pages FS-43 through
    FS-45.

Capital
    and Exploratory Expenditures

Total expenditures for 2009 were $22.2 billion, including
    $1.6 billion for the company’s share of
    equity-affiliate expenditures. In 2008 and 2007, expenditures
    were $22.8 billion and $20 billion, respectively,
    including the company’s share of affiliates’
    expenditures of $2.3 billion in both periods.

Of the $22.2 billion in expenditures for 2009, about
    three-fourths, or $17.1 billion, was related to upstream
    activities. Approximately the same percentage was also expended
    for upstream operations in 2008 and 2007. International upstream
    accounted for about 80 percent of the worldwide upstream
    investment in 2009 and about 70 percent in 2008 and 2007,
    reflecting the company’s continuing focus on opportunities
    available outside the United States.

In 2010, the company estimates capital and exploratory
    expenditures will be $21.6 billion, including
    $1.6 billion of spending by affiliates. About
    80 percent of the total, or $17.3 billion, is budgeted
    for exploration and production activities, with
    $13.2 billion of that amount for projects outside the
    United States.

Refer also to a discussion of the company’s capital and
    exploratory expenditures on

page FS-12.

Volumes

represent Chevron’s share of production by affiliates,
including Tengizchevroil (TCO) in Kazakhstan and Petroboscan,
Petroindependiente and Petropiar in Venezuela.


Volumes

include natural gas consumed in operations of 521 million
and 520 million cubic feet per day in 2009 and 2008,
respectively.

Worldwide oil-equivalent production, including volumes from oil
    sands (refer to footnote 2 above), was 2.7 million barrels
    per day, up about 7 percent from 2008. The increase was
    mostly associated with the

start-up

of
    the Blind Faith and Tahiti fields in the U.S. Gulf of
    Mexico in late 2008 and the second quarter 2009, respectively,
    the commencement of operations in the third quarter 2008 at the
    Agbami Field in Nigeria, and the expansion at Tengiz in
    Kazakhstan. Refer to the “Results of Operations”
    section beginning on

page FS-6

for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the

2007-2009

changes in production for crude oil and natural gas liquids, and
    natural gas.

The company estimates that its average worldwide oil-equivalent
    production in 2010 will be approximately 2.73 million
    barrels per day. This estimate is subject to many uncertainties,
    including quotas that may be imposed by OPEC, the price effect
    on production volumes calculated under cost-recovery and
    variable-royalty provisions of certain contracts, changes in
    fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations,
    delays in project

start-ups,

fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets, and
    production that may have to be shut in due to weather
    conditions, civil unrest,



changing geopolitics or other disruptions to operations. Future
    production levels also are affected by the size and number of
    economic investment opportunities and, for new large-scale
    projects, the time lag between initial exploration and the
    beginning of production. Refer to the “Review of Ongoing
    Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas,”
    beginning on page 9, for a discussion of the company’s
    major crude-oil and natural-gas development projects.

Average
    Sales Prices and Production Costs per Unit of
    Production

Refer to Table IV on

page FS-69

for the company’s average sales price per barrel of crude
    oil, condensate and natural gas liquids and per thousand cubic

for a tabulation of the company’s proved net crude-oil and
    natural-gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of
    2007 and each year-end from 2007 through 2009, and an
    accompanying discussion of major changes to proved reserves by
    geographic area for the three-year period ending
    December 31, 2009. During 2009, the company provided
    crude-oil and natural-gas reserves estimates for 2008 to the
    Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration (EIA)
    that agree with the 2008 reserve volumes in Table V. This
    reporting fulfilled the requirement that such estimates be
    consistent with, and not differ more than 5 percent from,
    the information furnished to the Securities and Exchange
    Commission (SEC) in the company’s 2008 Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

During 2010, the company will file estimates of crude-oil and
    natural-gas reserves with the Department of Energy, EIA,
    consistent with the 2009 reserve data reported in Table V.

Delivery
    Commitments

The company sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing
    operations under a variety of contractual obligations. Most
    contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based
    on production from specified properties, but some natural-gas
    sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable
    quantities, as discussed below.

In the United States, the company has no fixed and determinable
    delivery commitments to third-parties or affiliates.

Outside the United States, the company is contractually
    committed to deliver to third parties a total of
    821 billion cubic feet of natural gas from 2010 through
    2012 from Australia, Colombia, Denmark and the Philippines. The
    sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas that are
    generally referenced to the prevailing market price for crude
    oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of
    delivery. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts
    from quantities available from production of the company’s
    proved developed reserves in Australia, Colombia, Denmark and
    the Philippines.

Development
    Activities

Refer to Table I on

page FS-64

are presented below. The comments include references to
    “total production” and “net production,”
    which are defined under “Production” in
    Exhibit 99.1 on

page E-42.

The discussion that follows references the status of proved
    reserves recognition for significant long-lead-time projects not
    yet on production and for projects recently placed on
    production. Reserves are not discussed for recent discoveries
    that have yet to advance to a project stage or for mature areas
    of production that do not have individual projects requiring
    significant levels of capital or exploratory investment. Amounts
    indicated for project costs represent total project costs, not
    the company’s share of costs for projects that are less
    than wholly owned.



Chevron has production and exploration activities in most of the
    world’s major hydrocarbon basins. The company’s
    upstream strategy is to grow profitably in core areas, build new
    legacy positions and commercialize the company’s equity
    natural-gas resource base while growing a high-impact global gas
    business. The map at left indicates Chevron’s primary areas
    of production and exploration.

a)

United
    States

Upstream activities in the United States are concentrated in
    California, the Gulf of Mexico, Louisiana, Texas, New Mexico,
    the Rocky Mountains and Alaska. Average net oil-equivalent
    production in the United States during 2009 was
    717,000 barrels per day.

In California, the company has significant production in the
    San Joaquin Valley. In 2009, average net oil-equivalent
    production was 211,000 barrels per day, composed of
    191,000 barrels of crude oil, 91 million cubic feet of
    natural gas and 5,000 barrels of natural gas liquids.
    Approximately 84 percent of the crude-oil production is
    considered heavy oil (typically with API gravity lower than 22
    degrees).

Average net oil-equivalent production during 2009 for the
    company’s combined interests in the Gulf of Mexico shelf
    and deepwater areas, and the onshore fields in the region was
    243,000 barrels per day. The daily oil-equivalent
    production comprised 149,000 barrels of crude oil,
    484 million cubic feet of natural gas and
    14,000 barrels of natural gas liquids.

During 2009, Chevron was engaged in various development and exploration activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The 75 percent-owned and operated Blind Faith development, which achieved first oil in the fourth quarter 2008, reached maximum total production of 70,000 barrels per day of oil-equivalent in 2009. Blind Faith has an estimated production life of 20 years.

At the 58 percent-owned and operated Tahiti Field, first oil was achieved in the second quarter 2009. Maximum total production of 135,000 barrels per day of oil-equivalent was achieved in the third quarter 2009. A second development phase is under evaluation, including additional development drilling and a probable waterflood, with a final investment decision planned formid-2010. The waterflood includes water injection topsides

equipment, subsea equipment and water injection wells. Tahiti
    has an estimated production life of 30 years. As of the end
    of 2009, proved reserves had been recognized for the first
    development phase of the Tahiti Field.

The company is participating in the ultra-deepwater Perdido
    Regional Development. The project encompasses the installation
    of a producing host facility to service multiple fields,
    including Chevron’s 33.3 percent-owned Great White,
    60 percent-owned Silvertip and 57.5 percent-owned
    Tobago. Chevron has a 37.5 percent interest in the Perdido
    Regional Host. All of these fields and the production facility
    are partner-operated. Activities during 2009 included
    installation of the topsides on the spar, installation of
    umbilicals,

hook-up

and
    commissioning of the facility systems, and ongoing development
    drilling. First oil is expected in the first half of 2010, with
    the facility designed to handle 130,000 barrels of
    oil-equivalent per day. The project has an expected life of
    approximately 25 years. Proved reserves have been
    recognized for the project.



The company has a 60 percent-owned and operated interest in
    Big Foot. Two successful appraisal wells have been drilled, the
    most recent in the first quarter 2009. The company also acquired
    the rights to an adjacent block during 2009. The project entered
    front-end engineering and design (FEED) in October 2009 and a
    final investment decision is expected in late 2010. Total
    maximum production from the project is expected to be
    63,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day. At the end of
    2009, proved reserves had not been recognized.

The Caesar and Tonga partnerships for properties located in a
    number of blocks in the Green Canyon area have formed a unit
    agreement for the area, with Chevron having a 20.3 percent
    nonoperated working interest. A final investment decision on the
    joint Caesar-Tonga project was made in the first quarter 2009.
    Development plans include four wells and a subsea tie-back to a
    nearby third-party production facility. Two development
    sidetracks were completed during the year. Proved reserves have
    been recognized for the project and first oil is expected in
    2011.

The Jack and St. Malo fields are located within 25 miles of
    each other and are being considered for joint development.
    Chevron has a 50 percent-owned interest in Jack and a
    51 percent-owned interest in St. Malo, following the
    anticipated acquisition of an additional 9.8 percent equity
    interest in St. Malo in March 2010. Both fields are company
    operated. The project entered FEED in May 2009 and a final
    investment decision is expected in late 2010. The facility is
    planned to have an initial design capacity of
    150,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day and

start-up

is
    expected in 2014. At the end of 2009, proved reserves had not
    been recognized.

Deepwater exploration activities in 2009 and early 2010 included
    participation in 10 exploratory wells — five wildcat,
    three appraisal and two delineation. Exploratory work included
    the following:

•

Buckskin — 55 percent-owned and operated. A
    successful wildcat discovery was announced in February 2009. The
    first appraisal well is scheduled to begin drilling in the
    second quarter 2010.

•

Knotty Head — 25 percent nonoperated working
    interest. The first appraisal well began drilling in October
    2009 at this 2005 discovery.

•

Puma — 21.8 percent nonoperated working interest.
    An appraisal well completed drilling in early 2009. Leases were
    relinquished in mid-2009.

•

Tubular Bells — 30 percent nonoperated working
    interest. Studies to screen and evaluate future development
    alternatives were continuing at the end of 2009.

At the end of 2009, the company had not recognized proved
    reserves for any of the exploration projects discussed above.

Besides the activities connected with the development and
    exploration projects in the Gulf of Mexico, the company also has
    contracted capacity of 1 billion cubic feet per day at the
    third-party Sabine Pass liquefied natural gas (LNG)
    regasification terminal in Louisiana. The

20-year

capacity reservation agreement became effective in July 2009 and
    enables import of natural gas for the North America market. In
    September 2009, Chevron began to utilize a portion of the
    reserved capacity under this agreement.

Chevron has also contracted 1.6 billion cubic feet per day
    of capacity in a third-party pipeline system connecting the
    Sabine Pass LNG terminal to the natural-gas pipeline grid. The
    new pipeline, which was placed in service in July 2009, provides
    access to two major salt dome storage fields and 10 major
    interstate pipeline systems, including an interconnect with
    Chevron’s Sabine Pipeline, which connects to the Henry Hub.
    An interconnect to Chevron’s Bridgeline Pipeline is
    scheduled to be completed in the third quarter 2010. The Henry
    Hub interconnects to nine interstate and four intrastate
    pipelines and is the pricing point for natural gas futures
    contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Outside California and the Gulf of Mexico, the company manages
    operations across the mid-continental United States and Alaska.
    During 2009, the company’s U.S. production outside
    California and the Gulf of Mexico averaged 263,000 net
    oil-equivalent barrels per day, composed of 94,000 barrels
    of crude oil, 824 million cubic feet of natural gas and
    31,000 barrels of natural gas liquids.

In the Piceance Basin in northwestern Colorado, additional
    production came on line in September 2009 from the
    company’s 100 percent-owned and operated natural-gas
    development. Development drilling, which began in 2007,
    surpassed 190 wells in 2009, with 81 completed wells
    available to supply natural gas to the central processing
    facility. Construction of compression and dehydration facilities
    to produce 65 million cubic feet per day of natural gas was
    completed in the third quarter 2009. Future work is expected to
    be completed in multiple stages. The full development plan
    includes drilling more than 2,000 wells from multi-well
    pads over the next 30 to 40 years. Proved reserves for
    subsequent stages of the project had not been recognized at
    year-end 2009.



b)

Africa

In Africa, the company is engaged in exploration and production
    activities in Angola, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo,
    Nigeria and Republic of the Congo. Net oil-equivalent production
    in Africa averaged 433,000 barrels per day during 2009.

Angola:

Chevron holds company-operated working interests in offshore Blocks 0 and 14 and nonoperated working interests in offshore Block 2 and the onshore Fina Sonangol Texaco (FST) area. Net production from these operations in 2009 averaged 150,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day.

The company operates the 39.2 percent-owned Block 0, which averaged 105,000 barrels per day of net liquids production in 2009. The Block 0 concession extends through 2030.

Initial production from the northern portion of the Mafumeira Field in Block 0 occurred in July 2009, and total maximum crude-oil production of 42,000 barrels per day was achieved in first quarter 2010. Front-end engineering and design (FEED) started in January 2010 on Mafumeira Sul, a project to develop the southern portion of the Mafumeira Field. A final investment decision is expected in 2011. Maximum production from Mafumeira Sul is expected to be 95,000 barrels of crude oil per day. At year
- -end 2009, no proved reserves had been recognized for this project.

In the Greater Vanza/Longui Area of Block 0, development
    concept selection was under way and continued into 2010. FEED is
    planned for 2011. FEED activities continued on the south
    extension of the N’Dola Field development. At year-end
    2009, no proved reserves had been recognized for these projects.

Four gas management projects in Block 0 are expected to
    eliminate routine flaring of natural gas by injecting excess
    natural gas into various reservoirs. The Takula Flare and Relief
    Modification Project and the Cabinda Gas Plant Project entered
    service in June 2009 and December 2009, respectively. These
    projects are expected to reduce flaring by up to 60 million
    cubic feet per day. Work continued on the Nemba Enhanced
    Secondary Recovery and Flare Reduction Project and the Malongo
    Flare and Relief Modification Project, which are scheduled for

start-up

in
    the fourth quarter 2010 and in 2011, respectively.

Also in Block 0, a successful two-well exploration and
    appraisal program was completed. The exploration well was
    completed in March 2009, and the appraisal well was completed in
    May 2009. Drilling began on another exploration well in November
    2009 and was completed in the first quarter 2010. The results
    are under evaluation.

In the 31 percent-owned Block 14, net production in
    2009 averaged 33,000 barrels of liquids per day from the
    Benguela Belize — Lobito Tomboco development and the
    Kuito, Tombua and Landana fields. Development and production
    rights for the various fields in Block 14 expire between
    2027 and 2029.

Development of the Tombua and Landana fields continued in 2009.
    First production occurred in August 2009 from new production
    facilities that were installed in late 2008. Proved developed
    reserves were recognized at start of production. Development
    drilling is expected to continue, with maximum total daily
    production of 100,000 barrels of crude oil anticipated in
    2011.

During 2009, studies to evaluate development alternatives for
    the Lucapa Field continued. The project is expected to enter
    FEED in the fourth quarter 2010. A successful appraisal well was
    completed in the fourth quarter 2009 in the Malange area. As of
    the end of 2009, development of the Negage Field was suspended
    until cooperative arrangements between Angola and Democratic
    Republic of the Congo could be finalized. At the end of 2009,
    proved reserves had not been recognized for these projects.

The 39.2 percent-owned and operated Malongo Terminal Oil
    Export project was completed in November 2009. The new export
    system more than doubled export capacity from the area, which
    includes Blocks 0 and 14. In the 20 percent-owned
    Block 2 and the 16.3 percent-owned FST areas, combined
    production during 2009 averaged 3,000 barrels of net
    liquids per day.



Equity Affiliate Operations:

In addition to the
    exploration and producing activities in Angola, Chevron has a
    36.4 percent ownership interest in the Angola LNG affiliate
    that began construction in early 2008 of an onshore natural gas
    liquefaction plant located in Soyo, Angola. The plant is
    designed to process more than 1 billion cubic feet of
    natural gas per day. Construction continued on schedule during
    2009 with plant

start-up

scheduled for 2012. The life of the LNG plant is estimated to be
    in excess of 20 years. Proved reserves have been recognized
    for the producing operations associated with this project.

Angola — Republic of the Congo Joint Development
    Area:

Chevron operates and holds a 31.3 percent
    interest in the Lianzi Development Area located between Angola
    and Republic of the Congo. In late 2008, the development project
    entered FEED, which continued through 2009. No proved reserves
    have been recognized for Lianzi.

Republic of the Congo:

Chevron has a
    31.5 percent nonoperated working interest in the Nkossa,
    Nsoko and Moho-Bilondo exploitation permits and a
    29.3 percent nonoperated working interest in the Kitina
    exploitation permit, all of which are offshore. The development
    and production rights for Nkossa, Nsoko and Kitina expire in
    2027, 2018 and 2019, respectively. Net production from the
    Republic of the Congo fields averaged 21,000 barrels of
    oil-equivalent per day in 2009.

In May 2009, a successful exploration well was drilled in the
    Moho-Bilondo exploitation permit area. Development alternatives
    were being evaluated during 2009. The Moho-Bilondo subsea
    development project, which started production in 2008, is
    expected to achieve maximum total production of
    90,000 barrels of crude oil per day in the third quarter
    2010. Chevron’s development and production rights for
    Moho-Bilondo expire in 2030.

Democratic Republic of the Congo:

Chevron has a
    17.7 percent nonoperated working interest in an offshore
    concession. Daily net production in 2009 averaged
    3,000 barrels of oil-equivalent.

Chad/Cameroon:

Chevron participates in a project to
    develop crude-oil fields in southern Chad and transport the
    produced volumes by pipeline to the coast of Cameroon for
    export. Chevron has a 25 percent nonoperated working
    interest in the producing operations and an approximate
    21 percent interest in two affiliates that own the
    pipeline. Average daily net production from the Chad fields in
    2009 was 27,000 barrels of oil-equivalent. In September
    2009, first production was achieved at the Timbre Field in the
    Doba area. The Chad producing operations are conducted under a
    concession that expires in 2030.

Libya:

After an unsuccessful exploration well was
    completed, the company elected to relinquish its
    100 percent interest in the onshore Block 177
    exploration license in the fourth quarter 2009.

Nigeria:

Chevron holds a 40 percent interest in 13 concessions in the onshore and near-offshore region of the Niger Delta. The company operates under a joint-venture arrangement in this region with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, which owns a 60 percent interest. The company also owns varying interests in deepwater offshore blocks. In 2009, the company’s net oil-equivalent production in Nigeria averaged 232,000 barrels per day, composed of 225,000 barrels of liquids and 48 million cubic feet of natural gas.

In deepwater Oil Mining Lease (OML) 127 and OML 128, the 68.2 percent-owned and operated Agbami Field reached maximum total liquids production of 250,000 barrels per day in August 2009, following completion of development drilling. In December 2009, a subsequent 10-well development program was initiated and is expected to offset field decline. The leases that contain the Agbami Field expire in 2023 and 2024.

Also in the deepwater area, t
he Aparo Field in OML 132 and OML 140 and the Bonga SW Field in offshore OML 118 share a common geologic structure and are planned to be jointly developed under a proposed unitization agreement. Work continued in 2009 on a final unitization agreement between Chevron and

partners in OML 118. At the end of 2009, no proved reserves were
    recognized for this project.



Chevron operates and holds a 95 percent interest in the
    deepwater Nsiko discovery on OML 140. Development activities
    continued in 2009, with FEED expected to start after commercial
    terms are resolved. At the end of 2009, the company had not
    recognized proved reserves for this project.

The company also holds a 30 percent nonoperated working
    interest in the deepwater Usan project in OML 138. The
    development plans involve subsea wells producing to a floating
    production, storage and offloading vessel. Development drilling
    started in June 2009. Production

start-up

is
    scheduled for 2012, and maximum total production of
    180,000 barrels of crude oil per day is expected to be
    achieved within one year of

start-up.

Total costs for the project are estimated at $8.4 billion.
    Usan has an estimated production life of 20 years. Proved
    reserves have been recognized for this project.

Chevron participated in one successful deepwater exploration
    well during 2009 in Oil Prospecting License (OPL) 223. The
    company has a 30 percent nonoperated working interest in
    the license. At the end of 2009, proved reserves had not been
    recognized for the exploration project.

In the Niger Delta, construction on the Phase 3A expansion of
    the Escravos Gas Plant (EGP) was completed in late 2009 and
    start of production is expected in March 2010. EGP Phase 3A
    scope includes offshore natural-gas gathering and compression
    infrastructure and the addition of a second natural-gas
    processing facility. The modifications are designed to increase
    processing capacity from 285 million to 680 million
    cubic feet of natural gas per day and increase LPG and
    condensate export capacity from 15,000 to 58,000 barrels
    per day. EGP Phase 3A is designed to process natural gas from
    the Meji, Delta South, Okan and Mefa fields. The anticipated
    life of EGP Phase 3A is 25 years. Phase 3B of the EGP
    project is designed to gather natural gas from eight offshore
    fields and to compress and transport natural gas to onshore
    facilities beginning in 2012. The engineering, procurement,
    construction, and installation contract for the pipelines was
    awarded and work commenced in late 2009. Proved reserves have
    been recognized for these projects.

The 40 percent-owned and operated Onshore Asset Gas
    Management project is designed to restore approximately
    125 million cubic feet per day of natural-gas production
    from certain onshore fields that have been shut in since 2003
    due to civil unrest. Natural gas from these fields is sold in
    the Nigerian domestic gas market. The main

on-site

construction contracts are expected to be awarded in the second
    quarter 2010.

Refer to page 25 for a discussion of the planned

gas-to-liquids

facility at Escravos.

Equity Affiliate Operations:

Chevron holds a
    19.5 percent interest in the OKLNG Free Zone Enterprise
    (OKLNG) affiliate, which will operate the Olokola LNG project.
    OKLNG plans to build a multi-train natural-gas liquefaction
    facility and marine terminal located northwest of Escravos. At
    the end of 2009, timing of the final investment decision remains
    uncertain. The company has not recognized proved reserves
    associated with this project.

Refer to “Pipelines” under “Transportation
    Operations” beginning on page 26 for a discussion of
    the West African Gas Pipeline operations.



c)  Asia

Major producing countries in Asia include Azerbaijan,
    Bangladesh, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, the Partitioned Zone located
    between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and Thailand. During 2009, net
    oil-equivalent production averaged 1,044,000 barrels per
    day in Asia.

Azerbaijan:

Chevron holds a 10.3 percent nonoperated working interest in the Azerbaijan International Operating Company (AIOC), which produces crude oil in the Caspian Sea from the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) project. Chevron also has an 8.9 percent interest in the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) affiliate, which transports AIOC production by pipeline from Baku, Azerbaijan, through Georgia to Mediterranean deepwater port facilities in Ceyhan, Turkey. (Refer to “Pipelines” under “Transportation Operations” beginning on page 26 for a discussion of BTC operations.)

In 2009, the company’s daily net production from AIOC averaged 30,000 barrels of oil-equivalent. The final investment decision on the next development phase is expected in the first half 2010. AIOC operations are conducted under a

30-year

production-sharing contract (PSC) that expires in 2024.

Kazakhstan:

Chevron holds a 20 p
ercent nonoperated working interest in the Karachaganak project, which is being developed in phases. During 2009, Karachaganak net oil-equivalent production averaged 69,000 barrels per day, composed of 42,000 barrels of liquids and 161 million cubic feet of natural gas. In 2009, access to the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) and Atyrau-Samara (Russia) pipelines enabled approximately 184,000 barrels per day (33,000 net barrels) of Karachaganak liquids to be sold at world-market

prices. The remaining liquids were sold into Russian markets.
    During 2009, work continued on a fourth train that is designed
    to increase total export of processed liquids by
    56,000 barrels per day. The fourth train is expected to

start-up

in
    2011.

During 2009, Chevron and its partners continued to evaluate
    alternatives for a Phase III development of Karachaganak.
    Timing for the recognition of Phase III proved reserves is
    uncertain and depends on finalizing a project design and
    achieving project milestones. Karachaganak operations are
    conducted under a

40-year

PSC
    that expires in 2038.

Equity Affiliate Operations:

The company
    holds a 50 percent interest in Tengizchevroil (TCO), which
    is operating and developing the Tengiz and Korolev crude-oil
    fields, located in western Kazakhstan, under a

40-year

concession that expires in 2033. Chevron’s net
    oil-equivalent production in 2009 from these fields averaged
    274,000 barrels per day, composed of 226,000 barrels
    of crude oil and natural gas liquids and 289 million cubic
    feet of natural gas.

In 2009, TCO continued

ramp-up

of
    the Sour Gas Injection (SGI) and Second Generation Plant (SGP)
    facilities. The SGI facility injects approximately one-third of
    the sour gas separated from the crude oil back into the
    reservoir. The injected gas maintains higher reservoir pressure
    and displaces oil towards producing wells. TCO is evaluating
    options for another expansion project based on SGI/SGP
    technologies.

During 2009, the majority of TCO’s crude-oil production was
    exported through the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) pipeline
    that runs from Tengiz in Kazakhstan to tanker-loading facilities
    at Novorossiysk on the Russian coast of the Black Sea. The
    balance was shipped via other export routes, which included
    shipment via tanker to Baku for transport by the BTC pipeline to
    Ceyhan or by rail to Black Sea ports. (Refer to
    “Pipelines” under “Transportation
    Operations” beginning on page 26 for a discussion of
    CPC operations.)



Turkey:

Chevron holds a 25 percent nonoperated
    working interest in the Silopi licenses in southeast Turkey,
    which is on trend with production in Iraq’s northern Zagros
    Fold Belt. An exploration well in the Lale prospect completed
    drilling in the first quarter 2010, and is under evaluation.

Bangladesh:

Chevron holds interests in three
    operated PSCs covering onshore Blocks 12, 13 and 14 and
    offshore Block 7. The company has a 98 percent
    interest in Blocks 12, 13 and 14. Government approval of a
    2009 farm-out in Block 7 was received in February 2010,
    reducing the company’s interest from 88 percent to
    43 percent. The farm-out was to GS Caltex, a 50
    percent-owned affiliate of the company. Net oil-equivalent
    production from these operations in 2009 averaged
    66,000 barrels per day, composed of 387 million cubic
    feet of natural gas and 2,000 barrels of liquids. In 2009,
    a final investment decision was achieved after the government
    approved the development of a compression project that is
    expected to support additional production starting in 2012 from
    the Bibiyana, Jalalabad and Moulavi Bazar natural-gas fields.
    Proved reserves have been recognized for this project. The
    government also approved an amendment to the PSC for
    Blocks 13 and 14 that allows the company to acquire
    additional

3-D

seismic
    over the Jalalabad Field. Also in 2009, the company acquired
    seismic data on Block 7. Evaluation and data processing is
    under way, and an exploration well is planned to be completed by
    2011.

Cambodia:

Chevron operates the

1.2 million-acre

(4,709 sq-km) Block A, located offshore in the Gulf of Thailand,
    and expects to reduce its ownership to 30 percent pending
    government approval of the farm-out that is anticipated in the
    second quarter 2010. In 2009, commercial evaluation of the
    prospects continued. The company was granted an extension for
    the Block A exploration period to the third quarter 2010 in
    exchange for the obligation to drill three exploration wells.
    Information gained from the drilling program is expected to
    provide improved definition of the resource in the block. Proved
    reserves had not been recognized as of the end of 2009.

Myanmar:

Chevron has a 28.3 percent nonoperated
    working interest in a PSC for the production of natural gas from
    the Yadana and Sein fields offshore in the Andaman Sea. The
    company also has a 28.3 percent interest in a pipeline
    company that transports the natural gas from Yadana to the
    Myanmar-Thailand border for delivery to power plants in
    Thailand. Most of the natural gas is purchased by
    Thailand’s PTT Public Company Limited (PTT). The
    company’s average net natural gas production in 2009 was
    76 million cubic feet per day. During 2009, the platform
    for a compression project was completed. Project

start-up

is
    expected in 2011.

Thailand:

Chevron has operated and nonoperated working interests in several different offshore blocks. The company’s net oil-equivalent production in 2009 averaged 198,000 barrels per day, composed of 65,000 barrels of crude oil and condensate and 794 million cubic feet of natural gas. All of the company’s natural-gas production is sold to PTT under long-term sales contracts.

Operated interests are in Pattani and other fields with ownership interests ranging from 35 percent to 80 percent in Blocks 10 through 13, B12/27, B8/32, 9A, G4/43 and G4/48. Blocks B8/32 and 9A produce crude oil and natural gas from eight operating areas, and Blocks 10 through 13 and B12/27 produce crude oil, condensate and natural gas from 16 operating areas.

Chevron has a 16 percent nonoperated working interest in
    Blocks 14A, 15A, 16A, G9/48 and G8/50, known collectively
    as the Arthit Field.

During 2009, construction at the 69.8 percent-owned and
    operated Platong Gas II project continued. The project is
    designed to add 420 million cubic feet per day of
    processing capacity in 2012. Proved reserves have been
    recognized for this project. Concessions for Blocks 10
    through 13 expire in 2022.

During 2009, 14 exploration wells were drilled in the Gulf of
    Thailand, 13 were successful and one nonoperated well in the
    Arthit Field was unsuccessful. Two

3-D

seismic
    surveys and geological studies for Block G4/50 were also
    completed in 2009. At the end of 2009, proved reserves had not
    been recognized for these activities. Three exploratory wells in
    Block G4/50 are planned for the second quarter 2010. For Blocks
    G6/50 and G7/50, one exploration well is scheduled in each block
    for completion by the third quarter 2010. In addition, Chevron
    holds exploration interests in a number of blocks that are
    currently inactive, pending resolution of border issues between
    Thailand and Cambodia.



Vietnam:

The company operates off the southwest
    coast and has a 42.4 percent interest in a PSC that
    includes Blocks B and 48/95, and a 43.4 percent interest in
    another PSC for Block 52/97. In August 2009, Chevron
    reduced its ownership interest in a third operated PSC to
    20 percent in Block B122 offshore eastern Vietnam. No
    production occurred in these areas during 2009.

In the blocks off the southwest coast, the Vietnam Gas Project
    is aimed at developing an area in the Malay Basin to supply
    natural gas to state-owned Petrovietnam. The project includes
    installation of wellhead and hub platforms, a floating storage
    and offloading vessel, field pipelines and a central processing
    platform. The project is expected to enter front-end engineering
    and design (FEED) in the first quarter 2010, and a final
    investment decision is expected in 2011. Maximum total
    production is planned to be about 500 million cubic feet of
    natural gas per day. At the end of 2009, proved reserves had not
    been recognized for this project.

In conjunction with the Vietnam Gas Project, a
    Petrovietnam-operated pipeline will be required to support the
    offshore development. Chevron will have a 28.7 percent
    interest in the pipeline, which is planned to transport natural
    gas from the offshore development to customers in southern
    Vietnam.

During the year, the company continued to analyze well results
    and seismic processing from Block B and Block 52/97. In
    Block 122,

2-D

seismic
    data processing and geologic studies were completed. An
    exploration well is planned for 2011. Proved reserves had not
    been recognized as of the end of 2009. Future activity in
    Block 122 may be affected by an ongoing territorial
    dispute between Vietnam and China.

China:

Chevron has one operated and three nonoperated working interests in several areas. Net oil-equivalent production from the nonoperated areas in 2009 averaged 19,000 barrels per day, composed of 17,000 barrels of crude oil and condensate and 16 million cubic feet of natural gas.

The company holds a 49 percent-owned and operated interest in the Chuandongbei area in the onshore Sichuan Basin, where the company entered into a

30-year

PSC effective February 2008 to develop natural-gas resources. Project plans included two sour-gas purification plants with an aggregate design capacity of 740 million cubic feet per day. During 2009, general infrastructure for the plant site and well pads progressed. Development drilling and the construction and installation of additional processing facilities and gathering systems are expected to start in 2010. Proved reserves have been recognized for this project. The PSC for Chuandongbei e
xpires in 2038.

In the South China Sea, the company has nonoperated working interests of 32.7 percent in Blocks 16/08 and 16/19 located in the Pearl River Delta Mouth Basin, 24.5 percent in the QHD-32-6 Field in Bohai Bay, and 16.2 percent in the unitized and producing BZ

25-1

and BZ

19-4

crude-oil fields in Bohai Bay Block 11/19. In

November 2009, a storm damaged the floating production, storage
    and offloading (FPSO) vessel utilized by the company’s
    nonoperated assets in Block 11/19. Temporary and permanent
    recovery options are under development and production is
    expected to fully resume in 2012.

The joint development of the HZ25-3 and HZ25-1 crude-oil fields
    in Block 16/19 continued through the end of 2009. First
    production was delayed from the third quarter 2009 and is
    expected to be fully restored in the fourth quarter 2010
    following damage to the FPSO vessel caused by a typhoon that
    struck the area in September 2009.

In 2009, Chevron relinquished its nonoperated working interest
    in four exploration blocks in the Ordos Basin. Government
    approval is expected in mid-2010.



Indonesia:

Chevron’s operated interests in
    Indonesia are managed by several wholly owned subsidiaries,
    including PT Chevron Pacific Indonesia (CPI). CPI holds operated
    interests of 100 percent in the Rokan and Siak PSCs and
    90 percent in the MFK (Mountain Front Kuantan) PSC. Other
    subsidiaries operate four PSCs in the Kutei Basin, located
    offshore East Kalimantan, and one PSC in the East Ambalat Block,
    located offshore northeast Kalimantan. These interests range
    from 80 percent to 100 percent. Chevron also has
    nonoperated working interests in a joint venture in Block B in
    the South Natuna Sea and in the NE Madura III Block inthe
    East Java Sea Basin. Chevron’s interests in these PSCs
    range from 25 percent to 40 percent.

The company’s net oil-equivalent production in 2009 from
    all of its interests in Indonesia averaged 243,000 barrels
    per day. The daily oil-equivalent rate comprised
    199,000 barrels of liquids and 268 million cubic feet
    of natural gas. The largest producing field is Duri, located in
    the Rokan PSC. Duri has been under steamflood operation since
    1985 and is one of the world’s largest steamflood
    developments. The North Duri Development is divided into
    multiple expansion areas. The first expansion in Area 12 started
    steam injection in June 2009. Maximum total daily production
    from Area 12 is estimated at 34,000 barrels of crude oil in
    2012. A final investment decision regarding North Duri Area 13
    is expected by year-end 2010. The Rokan PSC expires in 2021.

Chevron advanced its development plans for the Gendalo and Gehem
    deepwater natural-gas fields located in the Kutei Basin. FEED
    started in December 2009, with completion dependent upon
    achieving project milestones and receipt of government
    approvals. The Bangka deepwater natural-gas project was
    progressed during the year under a revised, lower-cost
    development plan. The project is expected to enter FEED in the
    second quarter 2010. Under the terms of the PSCs for both
    projects, the company’s 80 percent-owned and operated
    interest is expected to be reduced to 72 percent in 2010
    with the farm-in of an Indonesian company. At the end of 2009,
    the company had not recognized proved reserves for either of
    these projects.

Also in the Kutei Basin, first production at the Seturian Field
    occurred in September 2009, which is providing natural gas to a
    state-owned refinery. During 2009, evaluation of the
    50 percent-owned and operated Sadewa project in the Kutei
    Basin was suspended.

A drilling campaign continued through 2009 in South Natuna Sea
    Block B to provide additional supply for long-term natural-gas
    sales contracts with additional development drilling planned for
    2010. The North Belut development project achieved first
    production in November 2009. The South Belut development project
    was under review during the year.

A two-well exploration program was conducted in the Central
    Sumatra Basin in 2009. One commercial discovery was made in the
    Rokan Block, and a second well in the Siak Block resulted in a
    dry hole. Chevron’s working interests in two exploration
    blocks in western Papua, West Papua I and West Papua III, are
    expected to be reduced to 51 percent interests in 2010.
    Completion of geological studies for those blocks was ongoing at
    year-end 2009, and

2-D

seismic
    acquisition is planned for the second half 2010.

In West Java, Chevron operates the wholly owned Salak geothermal
    field with a total power-generation capacity of
    377 megawatts. Also in West Java, Chevron holds a
    95 percent interest in a power generation company that
    operates the Darajat geothermal contract area with a total
    capacity of 259 megawatts. Chevron also operates a
    95 percent-owned

300-megawatt

cogeneration facility in support of CPI’s operation in
    North Duri, Sumatra.



Partitioned Zone (PZ):

Chevron holds a

30-year

agreement with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to operate on behalf of the Saudi government its 50 percent interest in the petroleum resources of the onshore area of the PZ between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Under the agreement, the company has rights to this 50 percent interest in the hydrocarbon resource and pays royalty and taxes on the associated volumes produced until 2039.

During 2009, the company’s average net oil-equivalent production was 105,000 barrels per day, composed of 101,000 barrels of crude oil and 21 million cubic feet of natural gas. In June 2009, steam injection was initiated in the second phase of a steamflood pilot project.

The pilot is an application of steam injection into a carbonate
    reservoir and, if successful, could significantly increase heavy
    oil recovery. The Central Gas Utilization Project was initiated
    in 2009 to assess alternatives to increase natural-gas
    utilization and eliminate routine flaring. A final investment
    decision is expected in 2011. No reserves have been recognized
    for these projects.

Philippines:

The company holds a 45 percent
    nonoperated working interest in the Malampaya natural-gas field
    located 50 miles (80 km) offshore Palawan Island. Net
    oil-equivalent production in 2009 averaged 27,000 barrels
    per day, composed of 137 million cubic feet of natural gas
    and 4,000 barrels of condensate. Chevron also develops and
    produces geothermal resources under an agreement with the
    Philippine government. Chevron expects to sign a new

25-year

contract with the government by the end of 2010 to operate the
    steam fields, which supply geothermal resources to the 637
    megawatt geothermal facilities.

d)  Other

“Other” is composed of Australia, Argentina, Brazil,
    Colombia, Trinidad and Tobago, Venezuela, Canada, Greenland,
    Denmark, Faroe Islands, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland and the
    United Kingdom. Net oil-equivalent production from countries
    included in this section averaged 484,000 barrels per day
    during 2009. In addition, the company’s share of production
    from oil sands (for upgrading into synthetic oil) from the
    Athabasca Oil Sands Project in Canada was 26,000 barrels
    per day.

Australia:

During 2009, the average net oil-equivalent production from Chevron’s interests in Australia was 108,000 barrels per day, composed of 35,000 barrels of liquids and 434 million cubic feet of natural gas.

Chevron has a 16.7 percent nonoperated working interest in the North West Shelf (NWS) Venture offshore Western Australia. Daily net production from the project during 2009 averaged 26,000 barrels of crude oil and condensate, 433 million cubic feet of natural gas, and 5,000 barrels of LPG. Approximately 70 percent of the natural gas was sold in the form of LNG to major utilities in Japan, South Korea and China, primarily under long-term contracts. The remaining natural gas was sold to the Western Australia domestic market.

The NWS Venture continues to progress two major capital projects that achieved final investment decision in 2008. Fabrication of platform topsides for the North Rankin 2 project commenced in June 2009. The proj
ect is designed to recover remaining low-pressure natural gas from the North Rankin and Perseus natural-gas fields to meet gas supply needs and includes necessary tie-ins to, and refurbishment of, the North Rankin A platform. Upon completion, both platforms are



designed to be operated as a single integrated facility. The
    project is scheduled to start production in 2013. Proved
    reserves have been recognized for the project.

The NWS Venture is also advancing plans to extend the period of
    crude-oil production. The NWS Oil Redevelopment Project is
    designed to replace the present floating production, storage and
    offloading vessel and a portion of existing subsea
    infrastructure that services production from the Cossack,
    Hermes, Lambert and Wanaea offshore fields. In 2009, work
    commenced on conversion of the replacement vessel. The project
    is expected to

start-up

in
    early 2011 and extend production past 2020. The concession for
    the NWS Venture expires in 2034.

On Barrow and Thevenard islands off the northwest coast of
    Australia, Chevron operates crude-oil producing facilities that
    had combined net production of 4,000 barrels per day in
    2009. Chevron’s interests in these operations are
    57.1 percent for Barrow and 51.4 percent for Thevenard.

Also off the northwest coast of Australia, Chevron holds
    significant equity interests in the large natural-gas resource
    of the Greater Gorgon Area. The company initially held a
    50 percent ownership interest across most of the area and
    is the operator of the Gorgon Project. Chevron and its
    joint-venture partners are proceeding with the combined
    development of Gorgon and nearby natural-gas fields as one
    large-scale project. Environmental approval from the Australian
    Commonwealth Government was issued in August 2009. In September
    2009, the company announced the final investment decision and
    total estimated project costs for the first phase of development
    of $37 billion (AU$ 43 billion). The
    project’s scope includes a three-train,
    15 million-metric-ton-per-year LNG facility; a carbon
    sequestration project; and a domestic natural-gas plant. Natural
    gas for the project is expected to be supplied from the Gorgon
    and Io/Jansz fields.

In 2009, long-term, binding agreements were finalized with four
    Asian customers for the delivery of about 4.4 million
    metric tons per year of LNG from the Gorgon Project. Equity
    sales agreements with three of the customers reduced
    Chevron’s interest in the project to 47.3 percent at
    the end of 2009. Nonbinding Heads of Agreements (HOA) for
    delivery of an additional 2.1 million metric tons per year
    of LNG were also signed with three additional Asian customers in
    2009 and early 2010. Negotiations continue to finalize binding
    sales agreements, which would bring LNG delivery commitments to
    a combined total of about 90 percent of Chevron’s
    share of LNG from the project. During 2009, the company
    recognized proved reserves for the Greater Gorgon Area fields
    included in the project. First production of natural gas from
    these fields is expected in 2014. The project’s estimated
    economic life exceeds 40 years from the time of

start-up.

Development of the company’s majority-owned and operated
    Wheatstone and Iago fields, located offshore Western Australia,
    continued with the project entering front-end engineering and
    design (FEED) in July 2009. Chevron operates the project and
    plans to supply natural gas to its 75 percent-owned and
    operated LNG facilities from two 100 percent-owned licenses
    comprising the majority of the Wheatstone Field and part of the
    nearby Iago Field. In October 2009, agreements were signed with
    two companies to join the Wheatstone Project as combined
    25 percent LNG facility owners and suppliers of natural gas
    for the project’s first two LNG trains. In December 2009
    and January 2010, nonbinding HOAs were signed with two Asian
    customers to take delivery of 4.9 million tons of LNG per
    year from the project, representing about 60 percent of the
    total LNG available from the foundation project. In addition,
    under these same HOAs the parties would acquire a combined
    16.8 percent nonoperated working interest in the Wheatstone
    Field licenses and a 12.6 percent interest in the
    foundation natural-gas processing facilities at the final
    investment decision. At the end of 2009, the company had not
    recognized proved reserves for this project.

In the Browse Basin, the company continued engineering and
    survey work on two potential development concepts for the
    Brecknock, Calliance and Torosa fields. At the end of 2009,
    proved reserves had not been recognized.

In May 2009, the company announced the successful completion of
    a well at the Clio prospect to further explore and appraise the
    66.7 percent-owned Block WA-205-P. In 2009 and early 2010,
    the company also announced natural-gas discoveries at the
    Kentish Knock prospect in the 50 percent-owned Block
    WA-365-P, the Achilles and Satyr prospects in the
    50 percent-owned Block WA-374-P and the Yellowglen prospect
    in the 50 percent-owned WA-268-P Block. All prospects are
    Chevron-operated. At the end of 2009, proved reserves had not
    been recognized.



Argentina:

Chevron holds operated interests in eight concessions in the Neuquen Basin. Working interests range from 18.8 percent to 100 percent. Net oil-equivalent production in 2009 averaged 38,000 barrels per day, composed of 33,000 barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and 27 million cubic feet of natural gas. The company also holds a 14 percent interest in the Oleoductos del Valle S.A. pipeline. In 2009, Chevron sold its oil and gas concession in the Austral Basin and its interest in the Confluencia Field in the Neuquen Basin.

Brazil:

Chevron holds working interests in three deepwater blocks in the Campos Basin. Chevron also holds a nonoperated working interest in one block in the Santos Basin. Net oil-equivalent production in 2009 averaged 2,000 barrels per day.

The Frade Field, located in the Campos Basin, achieved first oil in June 2009. Chevron is the operator and has a 51.7 percent interest in the field. Additional
 development drilling is under way, with an estimated maximum total production of 72,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day. The concession that includes the Frade project expires in 2025.

In the partner-operated Campos Basin Block BC-20, two areas — 37.5 percent-owned Papa-Terra and 30 percent-owned Maromba — were retained for developmentfollowing the end of the exploration phase of this block. The Papa-Terra project progressed through FEED, and a

final investment decision was made in January 2010. The project
    operator estimates total costs of $5.2 billion and expects
    first production in 2013. The facility is expected to be capable
    of producing up to 140,000 barrels of crude oil per day.
    Evaluation of design options for Maromba continued into 2010. At
    the end of 2009, proved reserves had not been recognized for
    these projects.

In the Santos Basin, evaluation of investment options continued
    into 2010 for the 20 percent-owned and partner-operated
    Atlanta and Oliva fields. At the end of 2009, proved reserves
    had not been recognized for these fields.

Colombia:

The company operates the offshore Chuchupa
    and the onshore Ballena and Riohacha natural-gas fields as part
    of the Guajira Association contract. In exchange, Chevron
    receives 43 percent of the production for the remaining
    life of each field and a variable production volume from a
    fixed-fee Build-Operate-Maintain-Transfer agreement based on
    prior Chuchupa capital contributions. Daily net production
    averaged 245 million cubic feet of natural gas in 2009.

Trinidad and Tobago:

Company interests include
    50 percent ownership in three partner-operated blocks in
    the East Coast Marine Area offshore Trinidad, which includes the
    Dolphin and Dolphin Deep producing natural-gas fields and the
    Starfish discovery. Chevron also holds a 50 percent
    operated interest in the Manatee area of Block 6(d). Net
    production in 2009 averaged 199 million cubic feet of
    natural gas per day. Incremental production associated with a
    new domestic sales agreement commenced at Dolphin in the third
    quarter 2009.

Venezuela:

The company operates in two exploratory
    blocks offshore Plataforma Deltana, with working interests of
    60 percent in Block 2 and 100 percent in
    Block 3. Chevron also holds a 100 percent operated
    interest in the Cardon III exploratory block, located north
    of Lake Maracaibo in the Gulf of Venezuela. Petróleos de
    Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), Venezuela’s national crude-oil and
    natural-gas company, has the option to increase its ownership in
    each of the three company-operated blocks up to 35 percent
    upon declaration of commerciality. In February 2010, a
    Chevron-led consortium was selected to participate in a
    heavy-oil project composed of three blocks in the Orinoco Oil
    Belt of eastern Venezuela. The consortium is expected to acquire
    a 40 percent interest in the project, with PDVSA holding
    the remaining interest.

The Loran Field in Block 2 is projected to provide the
    initial supply of natural gas for Delta Caribe LNG (DCLNG) Train
    1, Venezuela’s first LNG train. A DCLNG framework agreement
    was signed in 2008, which provides Chevron with



a 10 percent nonoperated interest in the first train and
    the associated offshore pipeline. An interim operating agreement
    governing activities prior to a final investment decision was
    signed by Chevron and its Train 1 partners in March 2009. In May
    2009, the company relinquished part of Block 3 and retained
    the portion containing the 2005 Macuira natural-gas discovery.
    An unsuccessful exploration well was drilled in the
    Cardon III block in 2009. The company plans to continue to
    evaluate exploration potential in the Cardon III block in
    2010. At the end of 2009, proved reserves had not been
    recognized in these exploratory blocks.

Equity Affiliate Operations:

Chevron also holds
    interests in two affiliates located in western Venezuela and in
    one affiliate in the Orinoco Belt. Chevron has a 30 percent
    interest in the Petropiar affiliate that operates the Hamaca
    heavy-oil production and upgrading project located in
    Venezuela’s Orinoco Belt, a 39.2 percent interest in
    the Petroboscan affiliate that operates the Boscan Field in the
    western part of the country, and a 25.2 percent interest in
    the Petroindependiente affiliate that operates the LL-652 Field
    in Lake Maracaibo. The company’s share of average net
    oil-equivalent production during 2009 from these operations was
    54,000 barrels per day, composed of 51,000 barrels of
    crude oil and natural gas liquids and 23 million cubic feet
    of natural gas.

Canada:

Company activities in Canada include nonoperated working interests of 26.9 percent in the Hibernia Field and 26.6 percent in the Hebron Field, both offshore eastern Canada, and 20 percent in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project (AOSP) and operated interests of 60 percent in the Ells River Oil Sands Project. Excluding volumes mined at AOSP, average net oil-equivalent production during 2009 was 28,000 barrels per day, composed of 27,000 barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and 4 million cubic feet of natural gas.

Substantially all of this production was from the Hibernia Field, where the working interest owners are also pursuing development of the Hibernia Southern Extension (HSE). Development of the HSE nonunitized area was approved by the provincial regulator in 2009, and the first producing well for the project was completed at year-end.

In February 2010, binding agreements were signed with the
    Government of Newfoundland and Labrador on the development of
    the HSE unitized area, providing Chevron with a
    23.6 percent nonoperated working interest in the unitized
    area.

For Hebron, agreements were reached during 2008 with the
    Government of Newfoundland and Labrador that allow development
    activities to begin. At the end of 2009, proved reserves had not
    been recognized for this project.

At AOSP, the company’s production from oil sands (for
    upgrading into synthetic oil) averaged 26,000 barrels per
    day during 2009. The first phase of an expansion project is
    under way and is expected to increase total production from oil
    sands by 100,000 barrels per day. The expansion would
    increase total AOSP design capacity to more than
    255,000 barrels per day in late 2010. The projected cost of
    this expansion is $14.3 billion.

The Ells River project consists of heavy-oil leases of more than
    85,000 acres (344 sq km). The area contains significant
    volumes with potential for recovery by using Steam Assisted
    Gravity Drainage, an industry-proven technology that employs
    steam and horizontal drilling to extract the production from oil
    sands through wells rather than through mining operations.
    Additional field appraisal activity is not planned in the
    near-term. At the end of 2009, proved reserves had not been
    recognized.

The company also holds exploration leases in the Mackenzie Delta
    and Beaufort Sea region, including a 34 percent nonoperated
    working interest in the offshore Amauligak discovery. Three
    exploration wells were drilled on company leases in the
    Mackenzie Delta region in 2009, and assessment of development
    concept alternatives for Amauligak continues. The company holds
    additional exploration acreage in eastern Labrador and the
    Orphan Basin. In 2009, the company was also successful in
    acquiring a western Canada lease position to explore for shale
    gas. At the end of 2009, proved reserves had not been recognized
    for any of these areas.



Greenland:

Processing of the

2-D

seismic
    survey acquired over License 2007/26 in Block 4 offshore
    West Greenland in 2008 continued in 2009, and evaluation will
    commence in the first-half 2010. Chevron has a 29.2 percent
    nonoperated working interest in this exploration license.

Denmark:

Chevron has a 15 percent working interest in the partner-operated Danish Underground Consortium (DUC), which produces crude oil and natural gas from 15 fields in the Danish North Sea. Net oil-equivalent production in 2009 from DUC averaged 55,000 barrels per day, composed of 35,000 barrels of crude oil and 119 million cubic feet of natural gas. DUC development activity in the region includes the ongoing Halfdan Phase IV project, which achieved first production in July 2009.

Faroe Islands:

Chevron withdrew from License 008 in 2009, but continues to assess exploration opportunities in the area.

Netherlands:

Chevron operates and holds interests ranging from 34.1 percent to 80 percent in eight blocks in the Dutch sector of the North Sea. In 2009, the company’s net oil-equivalent production from the five producing blocks was 9,000 barrels per day, composed of 2,000 barrels of crude oil and 41 
;million cubic feet of natural gas. In 2009 Chevron divested its 48 percent interest in the L11/b license.

Norway:

The company holds a 7.6 percent
    interest in the partner-operated Draugen Field. The
    company’s net production averaged 5,000 barrels of

Average crude oil distillation capacity utilization during 2009
    was 91 percent, compared with 87 percent in 2008,
    largely a result of improved utilization at the refineries in
    Mississippi, Canada and Thailand. At the U.S. fuel
    refineries, crude oil distillation capacity utilization averaged
    96 percent in 2009, compared with 95 percent in 2008,
    and cracking and coking capacity utilization averaged
    85 percent and 86 percent in 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. Cracking and coking units are the primary
    facilities used in fuel refineries to convert heavier feedstocks
    into gasoline and other light products.

The company’s refineries in the United States, the United
    Kingdom, Canada, South Africa and Australia produce low-sulfur
    fuels. During 2009, GS Caltex, the company’s
    50 percent-owned affiliate, continued construction on a new
    heavy-oil hydrocracker designed to increase high-value product
    yield and lower feedstock costs at the Yeosu, South Korea



complex. Project completion is expected in 2010. Modifications
    were completed in 2009 that enable the company’s
    50 percent-owned Singapore Refining Company’s refinery
    to meet regional specifications for clean diesel fuels.

At the Pascagoula Refinery, construction progressed on a
    continuous catalytic reformer that is expected to improve
    refinery reliability. Planning continued for a premium base-oil
    facility at the company’s Pascagoula Refinery. The facility
    is being designed to produce approximately 25,000 barrels
    per day of premium base oil for use in manufacturing
    high-performance lubricants, such as motor oils for consumer and
    commercial applications. At the refinery in El Segundo,
    California, design, engineering and construction work advanced
    during 2009 on projects that will reduce feedstock costs and
    improve yields.

At the beginning of 2009, Chevron held a 5 percent interest
    in Reliance Petroleum Limited, a company formed by Reliance
    Industries Limited to construct a new refinery in Jamnagar,
    India. During the year, the company sold its 5 percent
    interest to Reliance Industries Limited.

Chevron processes imported and domestic crude oil in its
    U.S. refining operations. Imported crude oil accounted for
    about 85 percent and 88 percent of Chevron’s
    U.S. refinery inputs in 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Gas-to-Liquids

In Nigeria, Chevron and the Nigerian National Petroleum
    Corporation are developing a

33,000 barrel-per-day

gas-to-liquids

facility at Escravos designed to process 325 million cubic
    feet per day of natural gas supplied from the Phase 3A expansion
    of the Escravos Gas Plant (EGP). At the end of 2009,
    construction was under way with two

gas-to-liquids

reactors and the process modules delivered to the site. Chevron
    has a 75 percent interest in the plant, which is expected
    to be operational by 2012. The estimated cost of the plant is
    $5.9 billion. Refer also to page 14 for a discussion
    on the EGP Phase 3A expansion.

In the United States, the company markets under the Chevron and
    Texaco brands. At year-end 2009, the company supplied directly
    or through retailers and marketers approximately 9,600 Chevron-
    and Texaco-branded motor vehicle service stations, primarily in
    the mid-Atlantic, southern and western states. Approximately 500
    of these outlets are company-owned or -leased stations. The
    company plans to discontinue, by mid-2010, sales of Chevron- and
    Texaco-branded motor fuels in the mid-Atlantic and other eastern
    states, where the company sold to retail customers through
    approximately 1,100 stations and to commercial and industrial
    customers through supply arrangements. Sales in these markets
    represent approximately 8 percent of the company’s
    total U.S. retail fuels sales volumes. Additionally, in
    January 2010, the company sold the rights to the Gulf trademark
    in the United States and its territories that it had previously
    licensed for use in the U.S. Northeast and Puerto Rico.

Outside the United States, Chevron supplied directly or through
    retailers and marketers approximately 12,400 branded service
    stations, including affiliates. In British Columbia, Canada, the
    company markets under the Chevron brand. The company markets in
    the United Kingdom, Ireland, Latin America and the Caribbean
    using the Texaco brand. In the Asia-Pacific region, southern
    Africa, Egypt and Pakistan, the company uses the Caltex brand.

The company also operates through affiliates under various brand
    names. In South Korea, the company operates through its
    50 percent-owned affiliate, GS Caltex, and in Australia
    through its 50 percent-owned affiliate, Caltex Australia
    Limited.

In 2009, the company completed the sale of businesses in Brazil,
    Haiti, Nigeria, Benin, Cameroon, Republic of the Congo,
    Côte d’Ivoire, Togo, Kenya, Uganda, India, Italy, Peru
    and Chile. The company retained its lubricants business in
    Brazil. In addition, the company sold its interest in about 465
    individual service-station sites in various other countries,
    including the United States. The majority of these sites
    continue to market company-branded gasoline through new supply
    agreements.

The company also manages other marketing businesses globally.
    Chevron markets aviation fuel at more than 875 airports. The
    company also markets an extensive line of lubricant and coolant
    products under brand names that include Havoline, Delo, Ursa,
    Meropa and Taro.

    international crude-oil and natural-gas production function.


Includes the company’s share of chemical pipelines managed
    by the 50 percent-owned Chevron Phillips Chemical Company
    LLC.

During 2009, work progressed on a project that is designed to
    expand capacity by about 2 billion cubic feet at the
    Keystone natural-gas storage facility near Midland, Texas, which
    would bring the total capacity of the facility to nearly
    7 billion cubic feet. The project completion is anticipated
    in the second quarter 2010.



Work commenced in late 2009 to bring the Cal-Ky Pipeline, which
    was decommissioned in 2002, back into crude-oil service as a
    supply line for the Pascagoula Refinery. This crude-oil pipeline
    is also expected to provide additional outlets for the
    company’s equity production. The pipeline is expected to
    return to service in 2011. The company is also leading the
    evaluation and negotiations associated with a 136 mile,

24-inch

pipeline from the proposed Jack and St. Malo production facility
    to Green Canyon 19 in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. In December
    2009, the company sold its interest in the western portion of
    the Texaco Expanded NGL Distribution System and its
    64 percent ownership interest in Southcap Pipeline Company,
    which included Chevron’s 13.4 percent ownership
    interest in the Capline Pipeline.

Chevron has a 15 percent interest in the Caspian Pipeline
    Consortium (CPC) affiliate. CPC operates a crude-oil export
    pipeline from the Tengiz Field in Kazakhstan to the Russian
    Black Sea port of Novorossiysk. During 2009, CPC transported an
    average of approximately 743,000 barrels of crude oil per
    day, including 597,000 barrels per day from Kazakhstan and
    146,000 barrels per day from Russia. In December 2009,
    partners approved the Expansion Project Implementation Plan,
    which is expected to increase the pipeline capacity to
    1.4 million barrels per day. A final investment decision is
    expected in late 2010.

The company has an 8.9 percent interest in the
    Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) affiliate that owns and operates a
    pipeline that primarily transports crude oil produced by
    Azerbaijan International Operating Company (AIOC) (owned
    10.3 percent by Chevron) from Baku, Azerbaijan, through
    Georgia to deepwater port facilities in Ceyhan, Turkey. The BTC
    pipeline has a crude-oil capacity of 1.2 million barrels
    per day and transports the majority of the AIOC production.
    Another production export route for crude oil is the Western
    Route Export Pipeline, wholly owned by AIOC, with capacity to
    transport 145,000 barrels per day from Baku, Azerbaijan, to
    the marine terminal at Supsa, Georgia.

Chevron is the largest shareholder, with a 37 percent
    interest, in the West African Gas Pipeline Company Limited
    affiliate, which constructed, owns and operates the

421-mile

(678-km)

West African Gas Pipeline. The pipeline is designed to supply
    Nigerian natural gas to customers in Benin, Ghana and Togo for
    industrial applications and power generation. Compression
    facilities are expected to be installed in the second quarter
    2010 that are designed to increase capacity to 170 million
    cubic feet per day.

Tankers:

All tankers in Chevron’s controlled
    seagoing fleet were utilized during 2009. At any given time
    during 2009, the company had 42 deep-sea vessels chartered on a
    voyage basis, or for a period of less than one year.

    marine and automotive engines.

Other
    Businesses

Mining

Chevron’s

U.S.-based

mining company produces and markets coal and molybdenum. Sales
    occur in both U.S. and international markets.

The company owns and is the operator of a surface coal mine in
    Kemmerer, Wyoming, an underground coal mine, North River,
    in Alabama, and a surface coal mine in McKinley, New Mexico. The
    company continues to actively market for sale its coal reserves
    at the North River Mine and elsewhere in Alabama. The decision
    was made in late 2009 to suspend production at the McKinley
    Mine, and conduct reclamation activities in 2010. The company
    also owns a 50 percent interest in Youngs Creek Mining
    Company LLC, which was formed to develop a coal mine in northern
    Wyoming. Coal sales from wholly owned mines in 2009 were
    10 million tons, down about 1 million tons from 2008.

At year-end 2009, Chevron controlled approximately
    193 million tons of proven and probable coal reserves in
    the United States, including reserves of low-sulfur coal.
    The company is contractually committed to deliver between
    7 million and 9 million tons of coal per year through
    the end of 2012 and believes it will satisfy these contracts
    from existing coal reserves.



In addition to the coal operations, Chevron owns and operates
    the Questa molybdenum mine in New Mexico. At year-end 2009,
    Chevron controlled approximately 53 million pounds of
    proven molybdenum reserves at Questa. Underground development
    and production plans at Questa were scaled back in 2009 in
    response to weakening prices for molybdenum.

Power
    Generation

Chevron’s power generation business has interests in 13
    power assets with a total operating capacity of more than 3,100
    megawatts, primarily through joint ventures in the United States
    and Asia. Twelve of these are efficient combined-cycle and
    gas-fired cogeneration facilities that utilize waste heat
    recovery to produce electricity and support industrial thermal
    hosts. The thirteenth facility is a wind farm, located in
    Casper, Wyoming, that began operating in late 2009. The
    100 percent-owned and operated Casper Wind Farm is a
    small-scale wind power facility designed to optimize the
    efficient use of a decommissioned refinery site for delivery of
    clean, renewable energy to the local utility provider.

The company has major geothermal operations in Indonesia and the
    Philippines and is investigating several advanced solar
    technologies for use in oil-field operations as part of its
    renewable-energy strategy. For additional information on the
    company’s geothermal operations and renewable energy
    projects, refer to page 18 and “Research and
    Technology” below.

Chevron

    environment and safety. The information technology organization
    integrates computing, telecommunications, data management,
    security and network technology to provide a standardized
    digital infrastructure and enable Chevron’s global
    operations and business processes.

Chevron Technology Ventures (CTV) manages investments and
    projects in emerging energy technologies and their integration
    into Chevron’s core businesses. As of the end of 2009, CTV
    continued to explore technologies such as next-generation
    biofuels and advanced solar.

Chevron’s research and development expenses were
    $603 million, $702 million and $510 million for
    the years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Some of the investments the company makes in the areas described
    above are in new or unproven technologies and business
    processes, and ultimate technical or commercial successes are
    not certain. The company’s overall investment in this area
    is not significant to the company’s consolidated financial
    position.

Environmental
    Protection

Virtually all aspects of the company’s businesses are
    subject to various U.S. federal, state and local
    environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and to
    similar laws and regulations in other countries. These
    regulatory requirements continue to change and increase in both
    number and complexity and to govern not only the manner in which
    the company conducts its operations, but also the products it
    sells. Most of the costs of complying with the many laws and
    regulations pertaining to its operations are, or are expected to
    become, embedded in the normal costs of conducting business.

In 2009, the company’s U.S. capitalized environmental
    expenditures were approximately $887 million, representing
    approximately 15 percent of the company’s total
    consolidated U.S. capital and exploratory expenditures.
    These environmental expenditures include capital outlays to
    retrofit existing facilities as well as those associated with
    new



facilities. The expenditures relate mostly to air- and
    water-quality projects and activities at the company’s
    refineries, oil and gas producing facilities, and marketing
    facilities. For 2010, the company estimates U.S. capital
    expenditures for environmental control facilities will be
    approximately $831 million. The future annual capital costs
    are uncertain and will be governed by several factors, including
    future changes to regulatory requirements.

Chevron expects an increase in environment-related regulations,
    including those that are intended to address concerns about
    greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change, in the
    countries where it has operations. For instance, under
    California’s Global Warming Solutions Act enacted in 2006,
    the California Air Resources Board (CARB), charged with
    implementing the law, has adopted a new low-carbon fuel standard
    intended to reduce the carbon intensity of transportation fuels,
    which is expected to apply beginning in 2011. Additionally, CARB
    is expected to propose regulations to implement the “cap
    and trade” emissions regulation provisions of the law, for
    adoption in the second half 2010. The effect of any such
    regulation on the company’s business is uncertain.

Refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations on pages FS-16 through FS-17
    for additional information on environmental matters and their
    impact on Chevron and on the company’s 2009 environmental
    expenditures, remediation provisions and year-end environmental
    reserves. Refer also to Item 1A. Risk Factors on pages 30
    through 32 for a discussion of greenhouse gas regulation and

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Chevron is a major fully integrated petroleum company with a
    diversified business portfolio, a strong balance sheet, and a
    history of generating sufficient cash to fund capital and
    exploratory expenditures and to pay dividends. Nevertheless,
    some inherent risks could materially impact the company’s
    financial results of operations or financial condition.

Chevron
    is exposed to the effects of changing commodity
    prices.

Chevron is primarily in a commodities business with a history of
    price volatility. The single largest variable that affects the
    company’s results of operations is the price of crude oil,
    which can be influenced by general economic conditions and
    geopolitical risk.

During extended periods of historically low prices for crude
    oil, the company’s upstream earnings and capital and
    exploratory expenditure programs will be negatively affected.
    Upstream assets may also become impaired. The impact on
    downstream earnings is dependent upon the supply and demand for
    refined products and the associated margins on refined-product
    sales.

The
    scope of Chevron’s business will decline if the company
    does not successfully develop resources.

The company is in an extractive business; therefore, if Chevron
    is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it
    produces with good prospects for future production or through
    acquisitions, the company’s business will decline. Creating
    and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many
    factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore,
    develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling success; ability to
    bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion
    on budget and schedule; and efficient and profitable operation
    of mature properties.

The
    company’s operations could be disrupted by natural or human
    factors.

Chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes
    inhospitable regions. The company’s operations and
    facilities are therefore subject to disruption from either
    natural or human causes, including hurricanes, floods and other
    forms of severe weather, war, civil unrest and other political
    events, fires, earthquakes, explosions and system failures, any
    of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to
    people or the natural environment.



Chevron’s
    business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation
    or government action.

The company produces, transports, refines and markets materials
    with potential toxicity, and it purchases, handles and disposes
    of other potentially toxic materials in the course of the
    company’s business. Chevron operations also produce
    byproducts, which may be considered pollutants. Often these
    operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the
    company may have limited influence and control. Any of these
    activities could result in liability arising from private
    litigation or government action, either as a result of an
    accidental, unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions
    on the effects of the company’s operations on human health
    or the environment. In addition, to the extent that societal
    pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is
    possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to
    the company’s causation of or contribution to the asserted
    damage or to other mitigating factors.

Political
    instability could harm Chevron’s business.

The company’s operations, particularly exploration and
    production, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and
    political environments in the various countries in which it
    operates. As has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by
    governments to increase public ownership of the company’s
    partially or wholly owned businesses or to impose additional
    taxes or royalties.

In certain locations, governments have imposed restrictions,
    controls and taxes, and in others, political conditions have
    existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the
    company’s continued presence in those countries. Internal
    unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a
    government and the company or other governments may affect the
    company’s operations. Those developments have, at times,
    significantly affected the company’s related operations and
    results and are carefully considered by management when
    evaluating the level of current and future activity in such
    countries. At December 31, 2009, 26 percent of the
    company’s net proved reserves were located in Kazakhstan.
    The company also has significant interests in Organization of
    Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)-member countries including
    Angola, Nigeria and Venezuela and in the Partitioned Zone
    between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Twenty-two percent of the
    company’s net proved reserves, including affiliates, were
    located in OPEC countries at December 31, 2009.

Regulation
    of greenhouse gas emissions could increase Chevron’s
    operational costs and reduce demand for Chevron’s
    products.

Continued political attention to issues concerning climate
    change, the role of human activity in it and potential
    mitigation through regulation could have a material impact on
    the company’s operations and financial results.

International agreements and national or regional legislation
    and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse emissions are
    currently in various stages of discussion or implementation. For
    instance, the Kyoto Protocol, Australia’s proposed
    legislation and California’s Global Warming Solutions Act,
    along with other actual or pending federal, state and provincial
    regulations, envision a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions
    through market-based regulatory programs, technology-based or
    performance-based standards or a combination of them. The
    company is subject to existing greenhouse gas emissions limits
    in jurisdictions where such regulation is currently effective,
    including the European Union and New Zealand.

In December 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
    (EPA) issued a final endangerment finding for greenhouse gases,
    which specifically found that emissions of six greenhouse gases
    threaten the public health and welfare and that greenhouse gases
    from new motor vehicles and engines also contribute to such
    pollution. These findings do not themselves impose regulatory
    requirements. However, the agency is currently in the process of
    promulgating greenhouse gas emission standards for light-duty
    vehicles and regulations that would require certain stationary
    source facilities that exceed an as-yet undetermined threshold
    to obtain permits in advance, which permits could require
    implementation of so-called “best available control
    technologies.” In June 2009, the U.S. House of
    Representatives approved the American Clean Energy and Security
    Act. This is known as the Waxman-Markey bill, which includes
    provisions for a

cap-and-trade

program, aimed at controlling and reducing emissions of
    greenhouse gases in the United States. At this time it is not
    possible to predict whether or when the U.S. Senate may act
    on climate change legislation, how any bill approved by the
    Senate will be reconciled with the Waxman-Markey legislation or
    whether any federal legislation will supersede the EPA’s
    regulatory actions.

These and other greenhouse gas emissions-related laws, policies
    and regulations, may result in substantial capital, compliance,
    operating and maintenance costs. The level of expenditure
    required to comply with these laws and regulations is uncertain
    and is expected to vary by jurisdiction depending on the laws
    enacted in each jurisdiction, the company’s activities in
    it and market conditions. The company’s exploration and
    production of crude oil, natural gas and



various minerals such as coal; the upgrading of production from
    oil sands into synthetic oil; power generation; the conversion
    of crude oil and natural gas into refined products; the
    processing, liquefaction and regasification of natural gas; the
    transportation of crude oil, natural gas and related products
    and consumers’ or customers’ use of the company’s
    products result in greenhouse gas emissions that could well be
    regulated. Some of these activities, such as consumers’ and
    customers’ use of the company’s products, as well as
    actions taken by the company’s competitors in response to
    such laws and regulations, are beyond the company’s control.

The effect of regulation on the company’s financial
    performance will depend on a number of factors, including, among
    others, the sectors covered, the greenhouse gas emissions
    reductions required by law, the extent to which Chevron would be
    entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or need to
    purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through
    auctions, the price and availability of emission allowances and
    credits, and the impact of legislation or other regulation on
    the company’s ability to recover the costs incurred through
    the pricing of the company’s products. Material price
    increases or incentives to conserve or use alternative energy
    sources could reduce demand for products the company currently
    sells and adversely affect the company’s sales volumes,
    revenues and margins.

Changes
    in management’s estimates and assumptions may have a
    material impact on the company’s consolidated financial
    statements and financial or operations performance in any given
    period.

In preparing the company’s periodic reports under the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including its financial
    statements, Chevron’s management is required under
    applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and
    assumptions as of a specified date. These estimates and
    assumptions are based on management’s best estimates and
    experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk
    and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as
    circumstances change and additional information becomes known.
    Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by
    management include measurement of benefit obligations for
    pension and other postretirement benefit plans; estimates of
    crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves; accruals for
    estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; and
    impairments to property, plant and equipment. Changes in
    estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the
    assumptions, such as changes in the company’s business
    plans, general market conditions or changes in commodity prices,
    could affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities or expenses.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

Ecuador

Chevron is a defendant in a civil lawsuit
    before the Superior Court of Nueva Loja in Lago Agrio, Ecuador,
    brought in May 2003 by plaintiffs who claim to be
    representatives of certain residents of an area where an oil
    production consortium formerly had operations. The lawsuit
    alleges damage to the environment from the oil exploration and
    production operations, and seeks unspecified damages to fund
    environmental remediation and restoration of the alleged
    environmental harm, plus a health monitoring program. Until
    1992, Texaco Petroleum Company (Texpet), a subsidiary of Texaco
    Inc., was a minority member of this consortium with
    Petroecuador, the Ecuadorian state-owned oil company, as the
    majority partner; since 1990, the operations have been conducted
    solely by Petroecuador. At the conclusion of the consortium and
    following an independent third-party environmental audit of the
    concession area, Texpet entered into a formal agreement with the
    Republic of Ecuador and Petroecuador for Texpet to remediate
    specific sites assigned by the government in proportion to
    Texpet’s ownership share of the consortium. Pursuant to
    that agreement, Texpet conducted a three-year remediation
    program at a cost of $40 million. After certifying that the
    sites were properly remediated, the government granted Texpet
    and all related corporate entities a full release from any and
    all environmental liability arising from the consortium
    operations.

Based on the history described above, Chevron believes that this
    lawsuit lacks legal or factual merit. As to matters of law, the
    company believes first, that the court lacks jurisdiction over
    Chevron; second, that the law under which plaintiffs



bring the action, enacted in 1999, cannot be applied
    retroactively; third, that the claims are barred by the statute
    of limitations in Ecuador; and, fourth, that the lawsuit is also
    barred by the releases from liability previously given to Texpet
    by the Republic of Ecuador and Petroecuador. With regard to the
    facts, the company believes that the evidence confirms that
    Texpet’s remediation was properly conducted and that the
    remaining environmental damage reflects Petroecuador’s
    failure to timely fulfill its legal obligations and
    Petroecuador’s further conduct since assuming full control
    over the operations.

In April 2008, a mining engineer appointed by the court to
    identify and determine the cause of environmental damage, and to
    specify steps needed to remediate it, issued a report
    recommending that the court assess $8 billion, which would,
    according to the engineer, provide financial compensation for
    purported damages, including wrongful death claims, and pay for,
    among other items, environmental remediation, health care
    systems, and additional infrastructure for Petroecuador. The
    engineer’s report also asserted that an additional
    $8.3 billion could be assessed against Chevron for unjust
    enrichment. The engineer’s report is not binding on the
    court. Chevron also believes that the engineer’s work was
    performed and his report prepared in a manner contrary to law
    and in violation of the court’s orders. Chevron submitted a
    rebuttal to the report in which it asked the court to strike the
    report in its entirety. In November 2008, the engineer revised
    the report and, without additional evidence, recommended an
    increase in the financial compensation for purported damages to
    a total of $18.9 billion and an increase in the assessment
    for purported unjust enrichment to a total of $8.4 billion.
    Chevron submitted a rebuttal to the revised report, which the
    court dismissed. In September 2009, following the disclosure by
    Chevron of evidence that the judge participated in meetings in
    which businesspeople and individuals holding themselves out as
    government officials discussed the case and its likely
    outcome

,

the judge presiding over the case petitioned to
    be recused. In late September 2009, the judge was recused, and
    in October 2009, the full chamber of the provincial court
    affirmed the recusal, resulting in the appointment of a new
    judge. Chevron filed motions to annul all of the rulings made by
    the prior judge, but the new judge denied these motions. The
    court has completed most of the procedural aspects of the case
    and could render a judgment at any time. Chevron will continue a
    vigorous defense of any attempted imposition of liability.

In the event of an adverse judgment, Chevron would expect to
    pursue its appeals and vigorously defend against enforcement of
    any such judgment; therefore, the ultimate outcome —
    and any financial effect on Chevron — remains
    uncertain. Management does not believe an estimate of a
    reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss) can be made in
    this case. Due to the defects associated with the
    engineer’s report, management does not believe the report
    has any utility in calculating a reasonably possible loss (or a
    range of loss). Moreover, the highly uncertain legal environment
    surrounding the case provides no basis for management to
    estimate a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss).

Government Proceedings

In November 2008, the California Air Resources Board (CARB)
    proposed a civil penalty against the company’s Sacramento,
    California, terminal for alleged violations between August and
    December 2007 of CARB’s regulations governing the minimum
    concentration of additives in gasoline. Due to a computer
    programming error, the Sacramento terminal’s automatic
    dispensers had failed to inject additive detergent into a
    gasoline line.

In November 2008, CARB proposed a civil penalty against the
    company’s Richmond, California, refinery for a notice of
    violation relating to gasoline that was not properly certified
    as to composition. The company corrected the composition
    certificates for the gasoline without requiring any change to
    the composition of the gasoline. In July 2009, CARB issued the
    refinery a notice of violation relating to an error in gasoline
    blending that caused the product composition certifications to
    be in error. The composition certifications were corrected
    without requiring any change to the gasoline. Discussions with
    CARB officials relating to all of these matters took place in
    the fourth quarter 2009 and continue in 2010.

In July 2009, the Hawaii Department of Health (“DOH”)
    alleged that Chevron is obligated to pay stipulated civil
    penalties exceeding $100,000 in conjunction with commitments the
    company undertook to install and operate certain air pollution
    abatement equipment at its Hawaii Refinery pursuant to Clean Air
    Act settlement with the United States Environmental Protection
    Agency and DOH. The company has disputed many of the allegations.

Refer to the “Results of Operations” section beginning on page FS-6 for a discussion of
financial results by major operating area for the three years ended December 31, 2009.

Business Environment and Outlook

Chevron is a global energy company with significant business activities in the following
countries: Angola, Argentina, Australia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Brazil, Cambodia, Canada, Chad,
China, Colombia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Myanmar, the
Netherlands, Nigeria, Norway, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the
Philippines, Republic of the Congo, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Thailand, Trinidad and
Tobago, the United Kingdom, the United States, Venezuela and Vietnam.

Earnings of the company depend largely on the profitability of its upstream (exploration and
production) and downstream (refining, marketing and transportation) business segments. The single
biggest factor that affects the results of operations for both segments is movement in the

price of crude oil. In the downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined
products. The overall trend in earnings is typically less affected by results from the company’s
chemicals business and other activities and investments. Earnings for the company in any period may
also be influenced by events or transactions that are infrequent or unusual in nature.

The company’s operations, especially upstream, can also be affected by changing economic,
regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates, including the
United States. Civil unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the
company or other governments may impact the company’s operations or investments. Those developments
have at times significantly affected the company’s operations and results and are carefully
considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such
countries.

To sustain its long-term competitive position in the upstream business, the company must
develop and replenish an inventory of projects that offer attractive financial returns for the
investment required. Identifying promising areas for exploration, acquiring the necessary rights to
explore for and to produce crude oil and natural gas, drilling successfully, and handling the many
technical and operational details in a safe and cost-effective manner are all important factors in
this effort. Projects often require long lead times and large capital commitments. From time to
time, certain governments have sought to renegotiate contracts or impose additional costs on the
company. Governments may attempt to do so in the future. The company will continue to monitor these
developments, take them into account in evaluating future investment opportunities, and otherwise
seek to mitigate any risks to the company’s current operations or future prospects.

The company also continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not
expected to provide sufficient long-term value or to acquire assets or operations complementary to
its asset base to help augment the company’s financial performance and growth. Refer to the
“Results of Operations” section beginning on FS-6 for discussions of net gains on asset sales
during 2009. Asset dispositions and restructurings may also occur in future periods and could
result in significant gains or losses.

In recent years, Chevron and the oil and gas industry at large experienced an increase in
certain costs that exceeded the general trend of inflation in many areas of the world. This
increase in costs affected the company’s operating expenses and capital programs for all business
segments, but particularly for upstream. Softening of these cost pressures started in late 2008 and
continued through most of 2009. Costs began to level out in the fourth quarter 2009. The company
continues to actively manage its schedule of work,

FS-2


contracting, procurement and supply-chain activities to effectively manage costs. (Refer to the
“Upstream” section below for a discussion of the trend in crude-oil prices.)

The company continues to closely monitor developments in the financial and credit markets, the
level of worldwide economic activity and the implications to the company of movements in prices for
crude oil and natural gas. Management is taking these developments into account in the conduct of
daily operations and for business planning. The company remains confident of its underlying
financial strength to address potential challenges presented in this environment. (Refer also to
the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section beginning on FS-11.)

Comments related to earnings trends for the company’s major business areas are as
follows:

Upstream

Earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry price levels for
crude oil and natural gas. Crude-oil and natural-gas prices are subject to external
factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global
economic conditions, industry inventory levels, production quotas imposed by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel
prices, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military
conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. Moreover, any of these factors could also inhibit
the company’s production capacity in an affected region. The company monitors developments closely
in the countries in which it operates and holds investments, and attempts to manage risks in
operating its facilities and businesses. Besides the impact of the fluctuation in prices for crude
oil and natural gas, the longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function
of other factors, including the company’s ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude
oil and natural gas, changes in fiscal terms of contracts and changes in tax laws and regulations.

Price levels for capital and exploratory costs and operating expenses associated with the
production of crude oil and

natural gas can also be subject to external factors beyond the company’s control. External factors
include not only the general level of inflation but also commodity prices and prices charged by the
industry’s material and service providers, which can be affected by the volatility of the
industry’s own supply-and-demand conditions for such materials and services. Capital and
exploratory expenditures and operating expenses also can be affected by damage to production
facilities caused by severe weather or civil unrest.

The chart at left shows the trend in benchmark prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude
oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas. Industry price levels for crude oil continued to be volatile
during 2009, with prices for WTI ranging from $34 to $81 per barrel. The WTI price averaged $62 per
barrel for the full-year 2009, compared to $100 in 2008. The decline in prices from 2008 was
largely associated with a weakening in global economic conditions and a reduction in the demand for
crude oil and petroleum products. As of mid-February 2010, the WTI price was about $77.

A differential in crude-oil prices exists between high-quality (high-gravity, low-sulfur)
crudes and those of lower-quality

(low-gravity, high-sulfur). The amount of the differential in any
period is associated with the supply of heavy crude available versus the demand that is a function
of the number of refineries that are able to process this lower-quality feedstock into light
products

(motor gasoline, jet fuel, aviation gasoline and diesel fuel). The differential remained
narrow through 2009 as production declines in the industry have been mainly for lower-quality
crudes.

Chevron produces or shares in the production of heavy crude oil in California, Chad,
Indonesia, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, Venezuela and in certain fields in
Angola, China and the United Kingdom

sector of the North Sea. (See page FS-10 for the company’s average U.S. and international
crude-oil realizations.)

In contrast to price movements in the global market for crude oil, price changes for natural
gas in many regional markets are more closely aligned with supply-and-demand conditions in those
markets. In the United States, prices at Henry Hub averaged about $3.80 per thousand cubic feet
(MCF) during 2009, compared with almost $9 during 2008. At December 31, 2009, and as of

mid-February 2010, the Henry Hub spot price was about $5.70 and $5.50 per MCF, respectively.
Fluctuations in the price for natural gas in the United States are closely associated with customer
demand relative to the volumes produced in North America and the level of inventory in underground
storage. Weaker U.S. demand in 2009 was associated with the economic slowdown.

Certain international natural-gas markets in which the company operates have different supply,
demand and regulatory circumstances, which historically have resulted in lower average sales prices
for the company’s production of natural gas in these locations. Chevron continues to invest in
long-term projects in these locations to install infrastructure to produce and liquefy natural gas
for transport by tanker to other markets where greater demand results in higher prices.
International natural-gas realizations averaged about $4.00 per MCF during 2009, compared with
about $5.20 per MCF during 2008. Unlike prior years, these realizations compared favorably with
those in the United States during 2009, primarily as a result of the deterioration of U.S.
supply-and-demand conditions resulting from the economic slowdown. (See page FS-10 for the
company’s average natural gas realizations for the U.S. and international regions.)

The company’s worldwide net oil-equivalent production in 2009 averaged 2.70 million barrels
per day. About one-fifth of the company’s net oil-equivalent production in 2009 occurred in the
OPEC-member countries of Angola, Nigeria and Venezuela and in the Partitioned Zone between Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait. For the year 2009, the company’s net oil production was reduced by an average of
20,000 barrels per day due to quotas imposed by OPEC. All of the imposed curtailments took place
during the first half of the year. At the December 2009 meeting, members of OPEC supported
maintaining production quotas in effect since December 2008.

The company estimates that oil-equivalent production in 2010 will average approximately 2.73
million barrels per day. This estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including
additional quotas that may be imposed by OPEC, price effects on production volumes calculated under
cost-recovery and

variable-royalty

provisions of certain contracts, changes in fiscal terms or
restrictions on the scope of company operations, delays in project startups, fluctuations in demand
for natural gas in various markets, weather conditions that may shut in production, civil unrest,
changing

geopolitics, or other disruptions to operations. The outlook for future production levels is also
affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and, for new large-scale
projects, the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production. Investments in
upstream projects generally begin well in advance of the start of the associated crude-oil and
natural-gas production. A significant majority of Chevron’s upstream investment is made outside the
United States.

Refer to the “Results of Operations” section on pages FS-6 through FS-7 for additional
discussion of the company’s upstream business.

Refer to Table V beginning on page FS-69 for a tabulation of the company’s proved net oil and
gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of 2007 and each year-end from 2007 through 2009,
and an accompanying discussion of major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the
three-year period ending

December 31, 2009.

Downstream

Earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining and
marketing of products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil and feedstocks
for chemical manufacturing. Industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the
global and regional

supply-and-demand balance for refined products and by changes in the price of
crude oil used for refinery feedstock. Industry margins can also be influenced by refined-product
inventory levels, geopolitical events, cost of materials and services, refinery maintenance
programs and disruptions at refineries resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather,
fires or other operational events.

Other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and
efficiency of the company’s refining and marketing network and the effectiveness of the crude-oil
and product-supply functions. Profitability can also be affected by the volatility of
tanker-charter rates for the company’s shipping operations, which are driven by the industry’s
demand for crude-oil and product tankers. Other factors beyond the company’s control include the
general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the company’s refinery and distribution
network.

The company’s most significant marketing areas are the West Coast of North America, the U.S.
Gulf Coast, Latin America, Asia, southern Africa and the United Kingdom. Chevron operates or has
significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas except Latin America. The
company completed sales of marketing businesses during 2009 in certain countries in Latin America
and Africa. The company plans to discontinue, by mid-2010, sales of Chevron- and Texaco-branded motor fuels in
the mid-Atlantic and other eastern states, where the company sold to retail customers
through approximately 1,100 stations and to commercial and industrial customers through supply
arrangements. Sales in these markets

FS-4


represent approximately 8 percent of the company’s total U.S. retail fuel sales volumes. Additionally, in
January 2010, the company sold the rights to the Gulf trademark in the United States and its
territories that it had previously licensed for use in the U.S. Northeast and Puerto Rico.

The company’s refining and marketing margins in 2009 were generally weak due to
challenging industry conditions, including a sharp drop in global demand reflecting the economic
slowdown, excess refined-product supplies and surplus refining capacity. Given these conditions, in
January 2010 the company announced to its employees that high-level evaluations of Chevron’s
refining and marketing organizations had been completed. These evaluations concluded that the
company’s downstream organization should be restructured to improve operating efficiency and
achieve sustained improvement in financial performance. Details of the restructuring will be
further developed over the next three to six months and may include exits from additional markets,
dispositions of assets, reductions in the number of employees and other actions, which may result
in gains or losses in future periods.

Refer to the “Results of Operations” section on pages FS-7 and FS-8 for additional discussion
of the company’s downstream operations.

Chemicals

Earnings in the petrochemicals business are closely tied to global chemical demand,
industry inventory levels and plant capacity utilization. Feedstock and fuel costs, which tend to
follow crude-oil and natural-gas price movements, also influence earnings in this segment.

Refer to the “Results of Operations” section on page FS-8 for additional discussion of
chemical earnings.

Operating Developments

Key operating developments and other events during 2009 and early 2010 included the
following:

Upstream

Angola

Production began at the 39.2 percent-owned and operated Mafumeira Norte offshore
project in Block 0 and the

31 percent-owned

and operated deepwater Tombua-Landana project in Block
14. Mafumeira Norte is expected to reach maximum total daily production of 42,000 barrels of crude
oil in the third quarter 2010, and the Tombua-Landana project is expected to reach its maximum
total production of approximately 100,000 barrels of crude oil per day in 2011. The company also
discovered crude oil offshore in the 39.2 percent-owned and operated Block 0 concession, extending
a trend of earlier discoveries in the Greater Vanza/Longui Area.

Australia

The company and its partners reached final investment decision to proceed with the
development of the Gorgon Project, located offshore Western Australia, in which Chevron has a 47.3
percent-owned and operated interest as of December 31, 2009. In addition, the company finalized
long-term sales agreements for delivery of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the Gorgon Project with
four Asian customers, three of which also acquired an ownership interest in the project. Nonbinding
Heads of Agreement (HOAs) with three additional Asian customers were also signed in late 2009 and

early 2010 for delivery of LNG from the project. Negotiations continue to finalize binding
sales agreements, which would bring LNG delivery commitments to a combined total of about 90
percent of Chevron’s share of LNG from the project.

The company awarded front-end engineering and design contracts for the first phase of the
Wheatstone natural gas project, also located offshore northwest Australia. The 75
percent-owned and

operated facilities will have LNG processing capacity of 8.6 million metric tons
per year and a

co-located domestic natural-gas plant. The facilities will support development of
Chevron’s interests in the Wheatstone Field and nearby Iago Field. Agreements were signed with two
companies to join the Wheatstone Project as combined 25 percent owners and suppliers of natural gas
for the project’s first two LNG trains. In addition, nonbinding HOAs were signed with two Asian
customers to take delivery of 4.9 million metric tons per year of LNG from the project (about 60 percent of
the total LNG available from the foundation project) and to acquire a 16.8 percent equity interest in the Wheatstone Field licenses and a 12.6 percent
interest in the foundation natural gas processing facilities at the final investment decision.

In May 2009 the company announced the successful

completion of a well at the Clio prospect to
further explore and appraise the 66.7 percent-owned Block WA-205-P. In 2009 and early 2010, the
company also announced natural-gas discoveries at the Kentish Knock prospect in the 50
percent-owned Block WA-365-P, the Achilles and Satyr prospects in the 50 percent-owned Block
WA-374-P and the Yellowglen prospect in the 50 percent-owned
WA-268-P Block. All prospects are
Chevron-operated. Proved reserves have not been recognized for these discoveries.

Brazil

Production started at the 51.7 percent-owned and operated deepwater Frade Field, which
is projected to attain maximum total production of 72,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day in 2011.
Also, in early 2010 a final investment decision was reached to develop the 37.5 percent-owned,
partner-operated Papa-Terra Field, where first production is expected in 2013. Project facilities are designed
with a capacity to handle up to 140,000 barrels of crude oil per day.

Republic of the Congo

Crude oil was discovered in the northern portion of the 31.5
percent-owned, partner-operated Moho-Bilondo deepwater permit area. This discovery follows two
others made in 2007 in the same permit area.

Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Venezuela

In February 2010, a Chevron-led consortium was named the operator of a heavy-oil
project composed of three blocks in the Orinoco Oil Belt of eastern Venezuela.

United States

First oil was achieved at the 58 percent-owned and operated Tahiti Field in the
deepwater Gulf of Mexico, reaching maximum total production of 135,000 barrels of oil-equivalent
per day. The company also discovered crude oil at the Chevron-operated and 55 percent-owned
Buckskin prospect in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The first appraisal well is scheduled to begin
drilling in the second quarter 2010.

Downstream

The company sold businesses during 2009 in Brazil, Haiti, Nigeria, Benin, Cameroon, Republic
of the Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Togo, Kenya, Uganda, India, Italy, Peru and Chile.

Other

Common Stock Dividends

The quarterly common stock dividend increased by 4.6 percent in July
2009, to $0.68 per share. 2009 was the 22nd consecutive year that the company increased its annual
dividend payment.

Common Stock Repurchase Program

The company did not acquire any shares during 2009 under its $15
billion repurchase program, which began in 2007 and expires in September 2010. As of December 31,
2009, 119 million common shares had been acquired under this program for $10.1 billion.

Results of Operations

Major Operating Areas

The following section presents the results of operations for the company’s
business segments – upstream, downstream and chemicals – as well as for “all other,” which
includes mining, power generation businesses, the various companies and departments that are
managed at the corporate level, and the company’s investment in Dynegy prior to its sale in May
2007. Earnings are also presented for the U.S. and international geographic areas of the upstream
and downstream business segments. (Refer to Note 11, beginning on page FS-40, for a discussion of
the company’s “reportable segments,” as defined in accounting standards for segment reporting
(Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 280)). This section should also be read in conjunction with

U.S upstream earnings of $2.2 billion in 2009 decreased $4.9 billion from 2008. Lower
prices for crude oil and natural gas reduced earnings by about $5.2 billion between periods, and
gains on asset sales declined by approximately $900 million. Partially offsetting these effects was
a benefit of about $1.3 billion resulting from an increase in net oil-equivalent production. An
approximate $600 million benefit to income from lower operating expenses was more than offset by
higher depreciation expense. The benefit from

lower operating expenses was largely associated with absence of charges for damages related to
the 2008 hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.

U.S upstream earnings of $7.1 billion in 2008 increased $2.6 billion from 2007. Higher average
prices for crude oil and natural gas increased earnings by $3.1 billion between periods. Also
contributing to the higher earnings were gains of approximately $1 billion on asset sales,
including a $600 million gain on an

asset-exchange transaction. Partially offsetting these benefits
were adverse effects of about $1.6 billion associated with lower

oil-equivalent

production and
higher operating expenses, which included approximately $400 million of expenses resulting from
damage to facilities in the Gulf of Mexico caused by hurricanes.

The company’s average realization for crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2009 was $54.36 per
barrel, compared with $88.43 in 2008 and $63.16 in 2007. The average natural-gas realization was
$3.73 per thousand cubic feet in 2009, compared with $7.90 and $6.12 in 2008 and 2007,
respectively.

FS-6


Net oil-equivalent production in 2009 averaged 717,000 barrels per day, up 6.9 percent from
2008 and down 3.5 percent from 2007. The increase between 2008 and 2009 was mainly due to the
start-up of the Blind Faith Field in late 2008 and the Tahiti Field in the
second quarter 2009. The decrease between 2007 and 2008 was mainly due to normal field
declines and the adverse impact of the hurricanes. The net liquids component of oil-equivalent
production for 2009 averaged 484,000 barrels per day, up approximately 15 percent from 2008 and 5
percent compared with 2007. Net natural-gas production averaged 1.4 billion cubic feet per day in
2009, down approximately 7 percent from 2008 and about 18 percent from 2007.

International upstream earnings of $8.2 billion in 2009 decreased $6.4 billion from 2008.
Lower prices for crude oil and natural gas reduced earnings by $7.0 billion, while foreign-currency
effects and higher operating and depreciation expenses decreased income by a total of $2.2 billion.
Partially offsetting these items were benefits of $2.3 billion resulting from an increase in sales
volumes of crude oil and about $500 million associated with asset sales and tax items related to
the Gorgon Project in Australia.

Earnings of $14.6 billion in 2008 increased $4.3 billion from 2007. Higher prices for crude
oil and natural gas increased earnings by $4.9 billion. Partially offsetting the benefit of higher
prices was an impact of about $1.8 billion associated with a reduction of

crude-oil sales volumes
due to timing of certain cargo liftings and higher depreciation and operating expenses.
Foreign-currency effects benefited earnings by $873 million in 2008, compared with a reduction to
earnings of $417 million in 2007.

The company’s average realization for crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2009 was $55.97 per
barrel, compared with $86.51 in 2008 and $65.01 in 2007. The average natural-gas realization was
$4.01 per thousand cubic feet in 2009, compared with $5.19 and $3.90 in 2008 and 2007,
respectively.

Net oil-equivalent production of 1.99 million barrels per day in 2009 increased about 7
percent and 6 percent from 2008 and 2007, respectively. The volumes for each year included
production from oil sands in Canada. Absent the impact of prices on certain production-sharing and
variable-royalty agreements, net

oil-equivalent production increased 4 percent in 2009 and 3
percent in 2008, when compared with prior years’ production.

The net liquids component of oil-equivalent production was 1.4 million barrels per day in
2009, an increase of approximately 11 percent from 2008 and 5 percent from

2007. Net natural-gas production of 3.6 billion cubic feet per day in 2009 was down 1 percent and
up 8 percent from 2008 and 2007, respectively.

U.S downstream operations lost $273 million in 2009, an earnings decrease of
approximately $1.6 billion from 2008. A decline in refined product margins resulted in
 a negative earnings variance of $1.7 billion.

 Partially offsetting were lower operating expenses, which benefited
earnings by $300 million. Earnings of $1.4 billion in 2008 increased about $400 million from 2007
due mainly to improved

margins on
the sale of refined products and gains on derivative commodity instruments. Operating
expenses were higher between 2007 and 2008.

Sales volumes of refined products were 1.40 million barrels per day in 2009, a decrease of 1
percent from 2008. The decline was associated with reduced demand for jet fuel and fuel oil,
principally associated with the downturn in the U.S. economy. Sales volumes of refined products
were 1.41 million barrels per day in 2008, a decrease of 3 percent from 2007. Branded gasoline
sales volumes of 617,000 barrels per day in 2009 were up about 3 percent and down 2 percent from
2008 and 2007, respectively.

International downstream earnings of $838 million in 2009 decreased about $1.2 billion from
2008. An approximate $2.6 billion decline between periods was associated with weaker margins on the
sale of gasoline and other refined products and the absence

of gains recorded in 2008 on commodity derivative instruments. Foreign-currency effects produced a
negative variance of $400 million. Partially offsetting these items was a $1.0 billion benefit from
lower operating expenses associated mainly with contract labor,
professional services and transportation costs and about a $550 million increase in gains on asset
sales primarily in certain countries in Latin America and Africa. Earnings in 2008 of $2.1 billion
decreased nearly $500 million from 2007. Earnings in 2007 included gains of approximately $1
billion on the sale of assets, which included

 marketing assets in the Benelux region of Europe and an interest in a  refinery.
 The $500 million other improvement between years was associated primarily
with a benefit from gains on derivative commodity instruments that was only partially offset by the
impact of lower margins from sales of

refined products. Foreign-currency
effects increased earnings by $193 million in 2008, compared with $62 million in 2007.

Refined-product sales volumes were 1.85 million barrels per day in 2009, about 8 percent lower
than in 2008 due mainly to the effects of asset sales and lower demand. Refined-product sales
volumes were 2.02 million barrels per day in 2008, about level with 2007.

The chemicals segment includes the company’s Oronite subsidiary and the 50 percent-owned
Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem). In 2009, earnings were $409 million, compared with
$182 million and $396 million in 2008

and 2007, respectively. For CPChem, the earnings improvement
from 2008 to 2009 reflected lower utility and manufacturing costs as well as the absence of an
impairment recorded in 2008. These benefits were partially offset by
lower margins on the sale of commodity chemicals. For Oronite, earnings increased in 2009 due to
higher margins on sales of lubricant and fuel additives, the effect of which more than offset the
impact of lower sales volumes. In 2008, segment earnings were $182 million, compared with $396
million in 2007. Earnings declined in 2008 due to lower sales volumes of commodity chemicals by
CPChem. Higher expenses for planned maintenance activities also contributed to the earnings
decline. Earnings also declined for Oronite due to lower volumes and higher operating expenses.

in 2008 included net unfavorable corporate tax items and increased costs of environmental
remediation. Foreign-currency effects also contributed to the increase in net charges from 2007 to
2008. Results in 2007 included a $680 million gain on the sale of the company’s investment in
Dynegy common stock and a loss of approximately $175 million associated with the early redemption

Kazakhstan as a result of lower prices for crude oil. Downstream-related affiliate earnings were
lower by approximately $1.0 billion primarily due to weaker margins and an unfavorable swing in
foreign-currency effects. Income from equity affiliates increased in 2008 from 2007 largely due to

Effective income tax rates were 43 percent in 2009, 44 percent in 2008 and 42 percent in
2007. The rate was lower in 2009 than in 2008 mainly due the effect in 2009 of deferred tax
benefits and relatively low tax rates on asset sales, both related to an international upstream
project. In addition, a greater proportion of before-tax income was earned in 2009 by equity
affiliates than in 2008. (Equity-affiliate income is reported as a single amount on an

after-tax
basis on the Consolidated Statement of Income.) Partially offsetting these items was the effect of
a greater proportion of income earned in 2009 in tax jurisdictions with higher tax rates. The rate
was higher in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to a greater proportion of income earned in tax
jurisdictions with higher income tax rates. In addition, the 2007 period included a relatively low
effective tax rate on the sale of the company’s investment in Dynegy common stock and the sale of
downstream assets in Europe. Refer also to the discussion of income taxes in Note 15 beginning on

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities

Total balances were $8.8 billion and $9.6
billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities in 2009
was $19.4
billion, compared with $29.6 billion in 2008 and $25.0 billion in 2007.

Cash provided by operating activities was net of contributions to employee pension plans of
approximately $1.7 billion, $800 million and $300 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
Cash provided by investing activities included proceeds and deposits related to asset sales of $2.6
billion in 2009, $1.5 billion in 2008 and $3.3 billion in 2007.

Restricted cash of $123 million and
$367 million associated with various capital-investment projects at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively, was invested in short-term marketable securities and recorded as “Deferred charges
and other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Dividends

Dividends paid to common stockholders were approximately $5.3 billion in 2009, $5.2
billion in 2008 and $4.8 billion in 2007. In July 2009, the company increased its quarterly common
stock dividend by 4.6 percent to $0.68 per share.

Debt and capital lease obligations

Total debt and capital lease obligations were $10.5 billion
at December 31, 2009, up from $8.9 billion at year-end 2008.

The $1.6 billion increase in total
debt and capital lease obligations during 2009 included the net effect of a $5 billion public bond
issuance, a $350 million issuance of tax-exempt Gulf Opportunity Zone bonds, a $3.2 billion
decrease in commercial paper, and a $400 million payment of principal for Texaco Capital Inc. bonds
that matured in January 2009. The company’s debt and capital lease obligations due within one year,
consisting primarily of commercial paper and the current portion of long-term debt, totaled $4.6
billion at

December 31, 2009, down from $7.8 billion at year-end 2008. Of these amounts, $4.2 billion and
$5.0 billion were reclassified to long-term at the end of each period, respectively. At year-end
2009, settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital in
2010, as the company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities,
to refinance them on a long-term basis.

At year-end 2009, the company had $5.1 billion in committed credit facilities with various
major banks, which permit the refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term basis. These
facilities support commercial paper borrowing and also can be used for general corporate purposes.
The company’s practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on
substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management believes appropriate. Any borrowings
under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on London Interbank
Offered Rate or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms
reflecting the company’s strong credit rating. No borrowings were outstanding under these
facilities at December 31, 2009. In addition, the company has an automatic shelf registration
statement that expires in March 2010 for an unspecified amount of nonconvertible debt securities
issued or guaranteed by the company. The company intends to file a new
shelf registration statement when the current one expires.

The company has outstanding public bonds issued by Chevron Corporation,
Chevron Corporation Profit Sharing/ Savings Plan Trust Fund, Texaco Capital Inc. and Union Oil
Company of California. All of these securities are the obligations of, or guaranteed by, Chevron
Corporation and are rated AA by Standard and Poor’s Corporation and Aa1 by Moody’s Investors
Service. The company’s U.S. commercial paper is rated A-1+ by Standard and Poor’s and P-1 by
Moody’s. All of these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade securities.

The company’s future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, the
capital-spending program and cash that may be generated from asset dispositions. The company
believes that it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements and
that during periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for refined
products and commodity chemicals, it has the flexibility to increase borrowings and/or modify
capital-spending plans to continue paying the common stock dividend and maintain the company’s
high-quality debt ratings.

Common stock repurchase program

In September 2007, the company authorized the acquisition of
up to $15 billion of its common shares at prevailing prices, as permitted by securities laws and
other legal requirements and subject to market conditions and other factors. The program is for a
period of up to three years (expiring in 2010) and may be discontinued at any time. The company
did not acquire any shares during 2009 and does not plan to acquire any shares in the first
quarter 2010. From the inception of the program, the company has acquired 119 million shares at a
cost of $10.1 billion.

Capital and exploratory expenditures

Total expenditures for 2009 were $22.2 billion,
including $1.6 billion for the company’s share of equity-affiliate expenditures and $2 billion for
the extension of an upstream concession. In 2008 and 2007, expenditures were $22.8 billion and
$20.0 billion, respectively, including the company’s share of affiliates’ expenditures of

$2.3
billion in both periods.

Of the $22.2 billion of expenditures in 2009, about

three-fourths, or $17.1 billion, is
related to upstream activities. Approximately the same percentage was also expended for upstream
operations in 2008 and 2007. International upstream accounted for about 80 percent of the worldwide upstream investment in 2009 and about

percent in 2008 and 2007, reflecting the company’s continuing focus on opportunities available
outside the United States.

The company estimates that in 2010, capital and exploratory expenditures will be $21.6
billion, including $1.6 billion of spending by affiliates. About 80 percent of the total, or $17.3
billion, is budgeted for exploration and production activities, with $13.2 billion of this amount
for projects outside the United States. Spending in 2010 is primarily targeted for exploratory
prospects in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and major development projects in Angola, Australia, Brazil,
Canada, China, Nigeria, Thailand and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Also included is funding for base
business improvements and focused appraisals in core hydrocarbon basins.

Worldwide downstream spending in 2010 is estimated at $3.4 billion, with about $1.6 billion
for projects in the

United States. Major capital outlays include projects under construction at refineries in the
United States and South Korea and construction of gas-to-liquids facilities in support of
associated upstream projects.

Investments in chemicals, technology and other corporate businesses in 2010 are budgeted at
$900 million. Technology investments include projects related to unconventional hydrocarbon
technologies, oil and gas reservoir management, and gas-fired and renewable power generation.

Noncontrolling interests

The company had noncontrolling interests of $647 million and $469
million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Distributions to noncontrolling interests
totaled $71 million and $99 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Pension Obligations

In 2009, the company’s pension plan contributions were $1.7 billion
(including $1.5 billion to the U.S. plans and $200 million to the international plans). The
company estimates contributions in 2010 will be approximately $900 million ($600 million for the
U.S. plans and $300 million for the international plans). Actual contribution amounts are
dependent upon investment returns, changes in pension obligations, regulatory environments and
other economic factors. Additional funding may ultimately be required if investment returns are
insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations. Refer also to the discussion of pension
accounting in “Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions,” beginning on page FS-18.

The company’s guarantee of approximately $600 million is associated with certain payments
under a terminal use agreement entered into by a company affiliate. The terminal is expected to be
operational by 2012. Over the approximate 16-year term of the guarantee, the maximum guarantee
amount will be reduced over time as certain fees are paid by the affiliate. There are numerous
cross-indemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of any
amounts paid under the guarantee. Chevron has recorded no liability for its obligation under this
guarantee.

Indemnifications

The company provided certain indemnities of contingent liabilities of Equilon
and Motiva to Shell and Saudi Refining, Inc., in connection with the February 2002 sale of the
company’s interests in those investments. The company would be required to perform if the
indemnified liabilities become actual losses. Were that to occur, the company could be required to
make future payments up to $300 million. Through the end of 2009, the company had paid $48 million
under these indemnities and continues to be obligated for possible additional indemnification
payments in the future.

The company has also provided indemnities relating to contingent environmental liabilities
related to assets origi-

nally contributed by Texaco to the Equilon and Motiva joint ventures and environmental
conditions that existed prior to the formation of Equilon and Motiva or that occurred during
the period of Texaco’s ownership interest in the joint ventures. In general, the environmental
conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to December
2001. Claims had to be asserted by February 2009 for Equilon indemnities and must be asserted
no later than February 2012 for Motiva indemnities. Under the terms of these indemnities, there
is no maximum limit on the amount of potential future payments. In February 2009, Shell
delivered a letter to the company purporting to preserve unmatured claims for certain Equilon
indemnities. The letter itself provides no estimate of the ultimate claim amount. Management
does not believe this letter or any other information provides a basis to estimate the amount,
if any, of a range of loss or potential range of loss with respect to either the Equilon or the
Motiva indemnities. The company posts no assets as collateral and has made no payments under
the indemnities.

The amounts payable for the indemnities described in the preceding paragraph are to be net of
amounts recovered from insurance carriers and others and net of liabilities recorded by
Equilon or Motiva prior to September 30, 2001, for any applicable incident.

In the acquisition of Unocal, the company assumed certain indemnities relating to
contingent environmental liabilities associated with assets that were sold in 1997. The
acquirer of those assets shared in certain environmental remediation costs up to a maximum
obligation of $200 million, which had been reached at December 31, 2009. Under the
indemnification agreement, after reaching the $200 million obligation, Chevron is solely
responsible until April 2022, when the indemnification expires. The environmental conditions or
events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to the sale of the assets
in 1997.

Although the company has provided for known obligations under this indemnity that are
probable and reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future costs may be material to
results of operations in the period in which they are recognized. The company does not expect
these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity.

Long-Term Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments, Including Throughput and
Take-or-Pay Agreements

The company and its subsidiaries have certain other contingent
liabilities relating to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including
throughput and take-or-pay agreements, some of which relate to suppliers’ financing
arrangements. The agreements typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage
capacity, drilling rigs, utilities, and petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary
course of the company’s business. The aggregate approximate amounts of required payments under
these various commitments are: 2010 – $7.5 billion; 2011
– $4.3 billion; 2012 – $1.4
billion; 2013 – $1.4 billion; 2014 – $1.0 billion; 2015 and after – $4.1 billion. A portion
of these commitments may ultimately be shared with project

partners. Total payments under the agreements were approximately $8.1 billion in 2009, $5.1
billion in 2008 and $3.7 billion in 2007.

Does not include amounts related to the company’s income tax liabilities associated
with uncertain tax positions. The company is unable to make reasonable estimates for the
periods in which these liabilities may become payable. The company does not expect settlement
of such liabilities will have a material effect on its results of operations, consolidated
financial position or liquidity in any single period.


$4.2 billion of short-term debt that the company expects to refinance is
included in long-term debt. The repayment schedule above reflects the projected repayment of
the entire amounts in the 2011–2012 period.


Does not include obligations to purchase the company’s share of natural gas liquids
and regasified natural gas associated with operations of the 36.4 percent-owned Angola LNG
affiliate. The LNG plant is expected to commence operations in 2012 and is designed to produce
5.2 million metric tons of LNG and related natural gas liquids per year. Volumes and prices
associated with these purchase obligations are neither fixed nor determinable.

Financial and Derivative Instruments

The market risk associated with the company’s portfolio of financial and derivative
instruments is discussed below. The estimates of financial exposure to market risk discussed below
do not represent the company’s projection of future market changes. The actual impact of future
market changes could differ materially due to factors discussed elsewhere in this report, including
those set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, of the company’s 2009 Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

Derivative Commodity Instruments

Chevron is exposed to market risks related to the price
volatility of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas
and refinery feedstocks.

The company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on a portion of
its activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase, sale and
storage of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids and feedstock for company
refineries.

The company also uses derivative commodity instruments for limited trading purposes. The results of
these activities were not material to the company’s financial position, results of operations or
cash flows in 2009.

The company’s market exposure positions are monitored and managed on a daily basis by an
internal Risk Control group in accordance with the company’s risk management policies, which have
been approved by the Audit Committee of the company’s Board of Directors.

The derivative commodity instruments used in the company’s risk management and trading
activities consist mainly of futures, options and swap contracts traded on the New York Mercantile
Exchange and on electronic platforms of the Inter-Continental Exchange and Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. In addition, crude oil, natural gas and refined-product swap contracts and option
contracts are entered into principally with major financial institutions and other oil and gas
companies in the “over-the-counter” markets.

Virtually all derivatives beyond those designated as normal purchase and normal sale contracts
are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with resulting gains and losses
reflected in income. Fair values are derived principally from published market quotes and other
independent third-party quotes. The change in fair value from Chevron’s derivative commodity
instruments in 2009 was a quarterly average decrease of $168 million in total assets and a
quarterly average decrease of $104 million in total liabilities.

The company uses a Value-at-Risk
(VaR) model to estimate the potential loss in fair value on a single day from the effect of adverse
changes in market conditions on derivative commodity instruments held or issued, which are recorded
on the balance sheet at

December 31, 2009, as derivative commodity instruments in accordance with
accounting standards for derivatives (ASC 815). VaR is the maximum loss not to be exceeded within a
given probability or confidence level over a given period of time. The company’s VaR model uses the
Monte Carlo simulation method that involves generating hypothetical scenarios from the specified
probability distribution and constructing a full distribution of a portfolio’s potential values.

The VaR model utilizes an exponentially weighted moving average for computing historical
volatilities and
correlations, a 95 percent confidence level, and a one-day holding period. That is, the
company’s 95 percent, one-day VaR corresponds to the unrealized loss in portfolio value that would
not be exceeded on average more than one in every 20 trading days, if the portfolio were held
constant for one day.

The one-day holding period is based on the assumption that market-risk positions can be
liquidated or hedged within one day. For hedging and risk management, the company uses conventional
exchange-traded instruments such as futures and options as well as non-exchange-traded swaps,

FS-14


most of which can be liquidated or hedged effectively within one day. The table below presents the
95 percent/one-day VaR for each of the company’s primary risk exposures in the area of derivative
commodity instruments at December 31, 2009 and 2008. The lower amounts in 2009 were primarily
associated with a decrease in price volatility for these commodities during the year.

Foreign Currency

The company may enter into foreign-currency derivative contracts to
manage some of its foreign-currency exposures. These exposures include revenue and anticipated
purchase transactions, including foreign-currency capital expenditures and lease commitments. The
foreign-currency derivative contracts, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with
resulting gains and losses reflected in income. There were no open foreign-currency derivative
contracts at December 31, 2009.

Interest Rates

The company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its
overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. Historically, under the terms of the
swaps, net cash settlements were based on the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate
interest amounts calculated by reference to agreed notional principal amounts. Interest rate swaps
related to a portion of the company’s fixed-rate debt, if any, may be accounted for as fair –
value hedges. Interest rate swaps related to floating-rate debt, if any, are recorded at fair value
on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. At year-end 2009, the
company had no interest rate swaps on floating-rate debt. The company’s only interest rate swaps on
fixed-rate debt matured in January 2009 and the company had no interest rate swaps on

fixed-rate
debt at year-end 2009.

Transactions With Related Parties

Chevron enters into a number of business arrangements with related parties, principally its
equity affiliates. These arrangements include long-term supply or offtake agreements and long-term
purchase agreements. Refer to Other Financial Information in Note 24 of the Consolidated Financial
Statements, page FS-61, for further discussion. Management believes these agreements have been
negotiated on terms consistent with those that would have been negotiated with an unrelated party.

Litigation and Other Contingencies

MTBE

Chevron and many other companies in the petroleum industry have used methyl tertiary
butyl ether (MTBE) as a gasoline additive. Chevron is a party to 50 pending lawsuits and claims,
the majority of which involve numerous other petroleum marketers and refiners. Resolution of these
lawsuits and claims may ultimately require the company to correct or ameliorate the alleged effects
on the environment of prior release of MTBE by the company or other parties. Additional lawsuits
and claims related to the use of MTBE,

including personal-injury claims, may be filed in the future. The company’s ultimate exposure
related to pending lawsuits and claims is not determinable, but could be material to net income in
any one period. The company no longer uses MTBE in the manufacture of gasoline in the United
States.

Ecuador

Chevron is a defendant in a civil lawsuit before the Superior Court of Nueva Loja in
Lago Agrio, Ecuador, brought in May 2003 by plaintiffs who claim to be representatives of certain
residents of an area where an oil production consortium formerly had operations. The lawsuit
alleges damage to the environment from the oil exploration and production operations and seeks
unspecified damages to fund environmental remediation and restoration of the alleged environmental
harm, plus a health monitoring program. Until 1992, Texaco Petroleum Company (Texpet), a subsidiary
of Texaco Inc., was a minority member of this consortium with Petroecuador, the Ecuadorian
state-owned oil company, as the majority partner; since 1990, the operations have been conducted
solely by Petroecuador. At the conclusion of the consortium and following an independent
third-party environmental audit of the concession area, Texpet entered into a formal agreement with
the Republic of Ecuador and Petroecuador for Texpet to
remediate specific sites assigned by the government in proportion to Texpet’s ownership share
of the consortium. Pursuant to that agreement, Texpet conducted a three-year remediation program at
a cost of $40 million. After certifying that the sites were properly remediated, the government
granted Texpet and all related corporate entities a full release from any and all environmental
liability arising from the consortium operations.

Based on the history described above, Chevron believes that this lawsuit lacks legal or
factual merit. As to matters of law, the company believes first, that the court lacks jurisdiction
over Chevron; second, that the law under which plaintiffs bring the action, enacted in 1999, cannot
be applied retroactively; third, that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations in
Ecuador; and, fourth, that the lawsuit is also barred by the releases from liability previously
given to Texpet by the Republic of Ecuador and Petroecuador. With regard to the facts, the company
believes that the evidence confirms that Texpet’s remediation was properly conducted and that the
remaining environmental damage reflects Petroecuador’s failure to timely fulfill its legal
obligations and Petroecuador’s further conduct since assuming full control over the operations.

In April 2008, a mining engineer appointed by the court to identify and determine the cause of
environmental damage, and to specify steps needed to remediate it, issued a report recommending
that the court assess $8 billion, which would, according to the engineer, provide financial
compensation for purported damages, including wrongful death claims, and pay for, among other
items, environmental remediation, health care systems and additional infrastructure for
Petroecuador. The engineer’s report also asserted that an additional $8.3 billion could be assessed
against Chevron for unjust enrichment. The engineer’s report is not binding on the court. Chevron
also believes that the engineer’s work

FS-15


Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations

was performed and his report prepared in a manner contrary to law and in violation of
the court’s orders. Chevron submitted a rebuttal to the report in which it asked the court to
strike the report in its entirety. In November 2008, the engineer revised the report and, without
additional evidence, recommended an increase in the financial compensation for purported damages to
a total of $18.9 billion and an increase in the assessment for purported unjust enrichment to a
total of $8.4 billion. Chevron submitted a rebuttal to the revised report, which the court
dismissed. In September 2009, following the disclosure by Chevron of evidence that the judge
participated in meetings in which businesspeople and individuals holding themselves out as
government officials discussed the case and its likely outcome, the judge presiding over the case
petitioned to be recused. In late September 2009, the judge was recused, and in October 2009, the
full chamber of the provincial court affirmed the recusal, resulting in the appointment of a new
judge. Chevron filed motions to annul all of the rulings made by the prior judge, but the new judge
denied these motions. The court has completed most of the procedural aspects of the case and could
render a judgment at any time. Chevron will continue a vigorous defense of any attempted imposition
of liability.

In the event of an adverse judgment, Chevron would expect to pursue its appeals and vigorously
defend against enforcement of any such judgment; therefore, the ultimate outcome – and any
financial effect on Chevron – remains uncertain. Management does not believe an estimate of a
reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss) can be made in this case. Due to the defects
associated with the engineer’s report, management does not believe the report has any utility in
calculating a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss). Moreover, the highly uncertain legal
environment surrounding the case provides no basis for management to estimate a reasonably possible
loss (or a range of loss).

Environmental

The company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to laws, regulations,
private claims and legal proceedings related to environmental matters that are subject to legal
settlements or that in the future may require the company to take action to correct or ameliorate
the effects on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleum substances, including
MTBE, by the company or other parties. Such contingencies may exist for various sites, including,
but not limited to, federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, refineries,
crude-oil fields, service stations, terminals, land development areas, and mining operations,
whether operating, closed or divested. These future costs are not fully determinable due to such
factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the
corrective actions that may be required, the

determination of the company’s liability in proportion to other responsible
parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third
parties.

Although the company has provided for known environmental obligations
that are probable and reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future
costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they
are recognized. The company does not expect these costs will have a material
effect on its consolidated financial
position or liquidity. Also, the company does not believe its obligations

to make such expenditures
have had, or will have, any significant impact on the company’s competitive position relative to
other U.S. or international petroleum or chemical companies.

The following table displays the annual changes to the company’s before-tax environmental
remediation reserves, including those for federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state
laws.

Included in the $1,700 million year-end 2009 reserve balance were remediation activities
at approximately 250 sites for which the company had been identified as a potentially responsible party or
otherwise involved in the remediation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or other
regulatory agencies under the provisions of the federal Superfund law or analogous state laws. The
company’s remediation reserve for these sites at year-end 2009 was $185 million. The federal
Superfund law and analogous state laws provide for joint and several liability for all responsible
parties. Any future actions by the EPA or other regulatory agencies to require Chevron to assume
other potentially responsible parties’ costs at designated hazardous waste sites are not expected
to have a material effect on the company’s results of operations, consolidated financial position
or liquidity.

FS-16


Of the remaining year-end 2009 environmental reserves balance of $1,515 million, $820 million
related to the company’s U.S. downstream operations, including refineries and other plants,
marketing locations (i.e., service stations and terminals), and pipelines. The remaining $695
million was associated with various sites in international downstream ($107 million), upstream
($369 million), chemicals ($149 million) and other businesses ($70 million). Liabilities at all
sites, whether operating, closed or divested, were primarily associated with the company’s plans
and activities to remediate soil or groundwater contamination or both. These and other activities
include one or more of the following: site assessment; soil excavation; offsite disposal of
contaminants; onsite containment, remediation and/or extraction of petroleum hydrocarbon liquid and
vapor from soil; groundwater extraction and treatment; and monitoring of the natural attenuation of
the contaminants.

The company manages environmental liabilities under specific sets of regulatory requirements,
which in the United States include the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and various state and
local regulations. No single remediation site at year-end 2009 had a recorded liability that was
material to the company’s results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity.

It is likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities, beyond those
recorded, for environmental remediation relating to past operations. These future costs are not
fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the
unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the
company’s liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs
are recoverable from third parties.

Under accounting standards for asset retirement obligations

(ASC 410), the fair value of a
liability for an asset retirement obligation is recorded when there is a legal obligation
associated with the retirement of long-lived assets and the liability can be reasonably estimated.
The liability balance of approximately $10.2 billion for asset retirement obligations at year-end
2009 related primarily to upstream properties.

For the company’s other ongoing operating assets, such as refineries and chemicals facilities,
no provisions are made for exit or cleanup costs that may be required when such assets reach the
end of their useful lives unless a decision to sell or otherwise abandon the facility has been
made, as the indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the
fair value of the asset retirement obligation.

Refer also to Note 23 on page FS-60, related to the company’s asset retirement obligations and
the discussion of “Environmental Matters” on page FS-18.

Income Taxes

The company calculates its income tax expense and liabilities quarterly. These
liabilities generally are subject to audit and are not finalized with the individual taxing
authorities until several years after the end of the annual period for which income taxes have been
calculated.

Refer to Note 15 beginning on page FS-46 for a discussion of the periods for which tax returns have
been audited for the company’s major tax jurisdictions and a discussion for all tax jurisdictions
of the differences between the amount of tax benefits recognized in the financial statements and
the amount taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The company does not expect settlement of income tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions will have a material
effect on its results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity.

Suspended Wells

The company suspends the costs of exploratory wells pending a final
determination of the commercial potential of the related crude-oil and natural-gas fields. The
ultimate disposition of these well costs is dependent on the results of future drilling activity or
development decisions or both. At December 31, 2009, the company had approximately $2.4 billion of
suspended exploratory wells included in properties, plant and equipment, an increase of $317
million from 2008. The 2008 balance reflected an increase of $458 million from 2007.

The future trend of the company’s exploration expenses can be affected by amounts associated
with well write-offs, including wells that had been previously suspended pending determination as
to whether the well had found reserves that could be classified as proved. The effect on
exploration expenses in future periods of the $2.4 billion of suspended wells at year-end 2009 is
uncertain pending future activities, including normal project evaluation and additional drilling.

Refer to Note 19, beginning on page FS-50, for additional discussion of suspended wells.

Equity Redetermination

For oil and gas producing operations, ownership agreements may provide
for periodic reassessments of equity interests in estimated crude-oil and natural-gas reserves.
These activities, individually or together, may result in gains or losses that could be material to
earnings in any given period. One such equity redetermination process has been under way since 1996
for Chevron’s interests in four producing zones at the Naval Petroleum Reserve at Elk Hills,
California, for the time when the remaining interests in these zones were owned by the U.S.
Department of Energy. A wide range remains for a possible net settlement amount for the four zones.
For this range of settlement, Chevron estimates its maximum possible net before-tax liability at
approximately $200 million, and the possible maximum net amount that could be owed to Chevron is
estimated at about $150 million. The timing of the settlement and the exact amount within this
range of estimates are uncertain.

Other Contingencies

Chevron receives claims from and submits claims to customers; trading
partners; U.S. federal, state and local regulatory bodies; governments; contractors; insurers; and
suppliers. The amounts of these claims, individually and in the aggregate, may be significant and
take lengthy periods to resolve.

FS-17


Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their operations
and may close, abandon, sell, exchange, acquire or restructure assets to achieve operational or
strategic benefits and to improve competitiveness and profitability. These activities, individually
or together, may result in gains or losses in future periods.

Environmental Matters

Virtually all aspects of the businesses in which the company engages are subject to various
federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These regulatory
requirements continue to increase in both number and complexity over time and govern not only the
manner in which the company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells. Most of the
costs of complying with laws and regulations pertaining to company operations and products are
embedded in the normal costs of doing business.

Accidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business. In
addition to the costs for environmental protection associated with its ongoing operations and
products, the company may incur expenses for corrective actions at various owned and previously
owned facilities and at

third-party-owned waste-disposal sites used by the company. An obligation
may arise when operations are closed or sold or at

non-Chevron

sites where company products have
been handled or disposed of. Most of the expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to
facilities and sites where past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered
acceptable at the time but now require investigative or remedial work or both to meet current
standards.

Using definitions and guidelines established by the American Petroleum Institute, Chevron
estimated its worldwide environmental spending in 2009 at approximately $3.5 billion for its
consolidated companies. Included in these expenditures were approximately $1.7 billion of
environmental capital expenditures and $1.8 billion of costs associated with the prevention,
control, abatement or elimination of hazardous substances and pollutants from operating, closed or
divested sites, and the abandonment and restoration of sites.

For 2010, total worldwide environmental capital expenditures are estimated at $2.1 billion.
These capital costs are in addition to the ongoing costs of complying with environmental
regulations and the costs to remediate previously contaminated sites.

It is not possible to predict with certainty the amount of additional investments in new or
existing facilities or amounts of incremental operating costs to be incurred in the future to:
prevent, control, reduce or eliminate releases of hazardous materials into the environment; comply
with exist-

ing and
new environmental laws or regulations; or remediate and restore areas damaged by prior releases
of hazardous materials. Although these costs may be significant to the results of operations in any
single period, the company does not expect them to have a material effect on the company’s
liquidity or financial position.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions

Management makes many estimates and assumptions in the application of generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP) that may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial
statements and related disclosures and on the comparability of such information over different
reporting periods. All such estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.
Estimates and assumptions are based on management’s experience and other information available
prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Materially different results can occur as
circumstances change and additional information becomes known.

The discussion in this section of “critical” accounting estimates and assumptions is according
to the disclosure guidelines of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), wherein:

1.

the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of
subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the
susceptibility of such matters to change; and

2.

the impact of the estimates and assumptions on the company’s financial condition or
operating performance is material.

Besides those meeting these “critical” criteria, the company makes many other accounting
estimates and assumptions in preparing its financial statements and related disclosures. Although
not associated with “highly uncertain matters,” these estimates and assumptions are also subject to
revision as circumstances warrant, and materially different results may sometimes occur.

For example, the recording of deferred tax assets requires an assessment under the accounting
rules that the future realization of the associated tax benefits be “more likely than not.” Another
example is the estimation of crude-oil and natural-gas reserves under SEC rules, which, effective
December 31, 2009, require “...by analysis of geosciences and engineering data, (the reserves) can be
estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible...under existing economic
conditions” where existing economic conditions include prices based on the average price during the

FS-18


12-month period. Refer to Table V, “Reserve Quantity Information,” beginning on page FS-69,
for the changes in these estimates for the three years ending December 31, 2009, and to Table VII,
“Changes in the Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows From Proved Reserves” on
page FS-77 for estimates of

proved-reserve values for each of the three years ended December 31,
2009. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, beginning on page FS-32, includes a
description of the “successful efforts” method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and
production activities. The estimates of crude-oil and natural-gas reserves are important to the
timing of expense recognition for costs incurred.

The discussion of the critical accounting policy for “Impairment of Properties, Plant and
Equipment and Investments in Affiliates,” beginning on page FS-20, includes reference to conditions
under which downward revisions of proved-reserve quantities could result in impairments of oil and
gas properties. This commentary should be read in conjunction with disclosures elsewhere in this
discussion and in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements related to estimates,
uncertainties, contingencies and new accounting standards. Significant accounting policies are
discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, beginning on page FS-32. The
development and selection of accounting estimates and assumptions, including those deemed
“critical,” and the associated disclosures in this discussion have been discussed by management
with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

The areas of accounting and the associated “critical” estimates and assumptions made by the
company are as follows:

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

The determination of pension-plan obligations
and expense is based on a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions are the
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan
obligations. For other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans, which provide for certain health care
and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees and which are not funded, critical
assumptions in determining OPEB obligations and expense are the discount rate and the assumed
health care

cost-trend rates.

Note 21, beginning on page FS-52, includes information on the funded status of the company’s
pension and OPEB plans at the end of 2009 and 2008; the components of pension and OPEB expense for
the three years ending December 31, 2009; and the underlying assumptions for those periods.

Pension and OPEB expense is reported on the Consolidated Statement of Income as “Operating
expenses” or “Selling, general and administrative expenses” and applies to all business segments.
The year-end 2009 and 2008 funded status, measured as the difference between plan assets and
obligations, of each of the company’s pension and OPEB plans is recognized on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet. The

differences related to overfunded pension plans are reported as a long-term asset in “Deferred
charges and other assets.” The differences associated with underfunded or unfunded pension and OPEB
plans are reported as “Accrued liabilities” or “Reserves for employee benefit plans.” Amounts yet
to be recognized as components of pension or OPEB expense are reported in “Accumulated other
comprehensive loss.”

To estimate the long-term rate of return on pension assets, the company uses a process that
incorporates actual historical asset-class returns and an assessment of expected future performance
and takes into consideration external actuarial advice and asset-class factors. Asset allocations
are periodically updated using pension plan asset/liability studies, and the determination of the
company’s estimates of long-term rates of return are consistent with these studies. The expected
long-term rate of return on U.S. pension plan assets, which account for 69 percent of the company’s
pension plan assets, has remained at 7.8 percent since 2002. For the 10 years ending December 31,
2009, actual asset returns averaged 3.7 percent for this plan. The actual return for 2009 was 15.7
percent and was associated with the broad recovery in the financial markets.

The year-end market-related value of assets of the major U.S. pension plan used in the
determination of pension expense was based on the market value in the preceding three months, as
opposed to the maximum allowable period of five years under U.S. accounting rules. Management
considers the three-month period long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from day-to-day
market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year. For other plans, market
value of assets as of year-end is used in calculating the pension expense.

The discount rate assumptions used to determine U.S. and international pension and
postretirement benefit plan obligations and expense reflect the prevailing rates available on
high-quality

fixed-income

debt instruments. At December 31, 2009, the company selected a 5.3
percent discount rate for the major U.S. pension plan and 5.8 percent for its OPEB plan. These
rates were selected based on a cash flow analysis that matched estimated future benefit payments to
the Citigroup Pension Discount Yield Curve as of

year-end

2009. The discount rates at the end of
2008 and 2007 were 6.3 percent for both years for the U.S. pension and OPEB plans.

An increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets or the discount rate would reduce
pension plan expense, and vice versa. Total pension expense for 2009 was $1.1 billion. As an
indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long-term rate of return assumption, a 1
percent increase in the expected rate of return on assets of the company’s primary U.S. pension
plan would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2009 by approximately $50 million. A 1
percent increase in the discount rate for this same plan, which accounted for about 61 percent of
the

FS-19


Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations

companywide pension obligation, would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2009
by approximately $150 million.

An increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation, thus changing the
funded status of a plan reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The total pension liability on
the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2009, for underfunded plans was approximately $3.8
billion. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate
assumption, a 0.25 percent increase in the discount rate applied to the company’s primary U.S.
pension plan would have reduced the plan obligation by approximately $300 million, which would have
decreased the plan’s underfunded status from approximately $1.6 billion to $1.3 billion. Other
plans would be less underfunded as discount rates increase. The actual rates of return on plan
assets and discount rates may vary significantly from estimates because of unanticipated changes in
the world’s financial markets.

In 2009, the company’s pension plan contributions were $1.7 billion (including $1.5 billion to
the U.S. plans). In 2010, the company estimates contributions will be approximately $900 million.
Actual contribution amounts are dependent upon

plan-investment results, changes in pension
obligations, regulatory requirements and other economic factors. Additional funding may be required
if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations.

For the company’s OPEB plans, expense for 2009 was $164 million and the total liability,
which reflected the unfunded status of the plans at the end of 2009, was $3.1 billion.

As an indication of discount rate sensitivity to the determination of OPEB expense in 2009, a
1 percent increase in the discount rate for the company’s primary U.S. OPEB plan, which accounted
for about 69 percent of the companywide OPEB expense, would have decreased OPEB expense by
approximately $11 million. A 0.25 percent increase in the discount rate for the same plan, which
accounted for about 84 percent of the companywide OPEB liabilities, would have decreased total OPEB
liabilities at the end of 2009 by approximately $65 million.

For the main U.S. postretirement medical plan, the annual increase to company contributions is
limited to 4 percent per year. For active employees and retirees under age 65 whose claims
experiences are combined for rating purposes, the assumed health care cost-trend rates start with 7
percent in 2010 and gradually drop to 5 percent for 2018 and beyond. As an indication of the health
care cost-trend rate sensitivity to the determination of OPEB expense
in  2009, a 1 percent

increase in the rates for the main U.S. OPEB plan, which accounted for 84 percent of the
companywide OPEB liabilities, would have increased OPEB expense $8 million.

Differences between the various assumptions used to determine expense and the funded status of
each plan and actual experience are not included in benefit plan costs in the year the difference
occurs. Instead, the differences are included in actuarial gain/loss and unamortized amounts have
been reflected in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Refer
to Note 21, beginning on page FS-52, for information on the $6.7 billion of before-tax actuarial
losses recorded by the company as of December 31, 2009; a description of the method used to
amortize those costs; and an estimate of the costs to be recognized in expense during 2010.

Impairment of Properties, Plant and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates

The company
assesses its properties, plant and equipment (PP&E) for possible impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable.
Such indicators include changes in the company’s business plans, changes in commodity prices and,
for crude-oil and natural-gas properties, significant downward revisions of estimated
proved-reserve quantities. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash
flows expected from the asset, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value of
the asset over its estimated fair value.

Determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on
highly uncertain matters, such as future commodity prices, the effects of inflation and technology
improvements on operating expenses, production profiles, and the outlook for global or regional
market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas, commodity chemicals and refined
products. However, the impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are
consistent with the company’s business plans and long-term investment decisions.

No major individual impairments of PP&E and Investments were recorded for the three years
ending December 31, 2009. A sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these periods if
other assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not
practicable, given the broad range of the company’s PP&E and the number of assumptions involved in
the estimates. That is, favorable changes to some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair
any assets in these periods, whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown
number of other assets to become impaired.

FS-20


Investments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method, as
well as investments in other securities of these equity investees, are reviewed for impairment when
the fair value of the investment falls below the company’s carrying value. When such a decline is
deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to the income statement for the
difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value at the time.

In making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the company
considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial
performance, and the company’s ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that
will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment’s market value.
Differing assumptions could affect whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of
the impairment, and are not subject to sensitivity analysis.

From time to time, the company performs impairment reviews and determines whether any
write-down in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required. For example, when
significant downward revisions to crude-oil and natural-gas reserves are made for any single field
or concession, an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset
remains recoverable. Also, if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any
period has been deemed more likely than not, an impairment review is performed, and if the
estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group, no impairment charge
is required. Such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed
of. Assets that are not impaired on a held-and-used basis could possibly become impaired if a
decision is made to sell such assets. That is, the assets would be impaired if they are classified
as held-for-sale and the estimated proceeds from the sale, less costs to sell, are less than the
assets’ associated carrying values.

Goodwill

Goodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to amortization. As
required by accounting standards for goodwill (ASC 350), the company tests such goodwill at the
reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs
or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit
below its carrying amount.

Contingent Losses

Management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for
claims, litigation, tax matters and environmental remediation. Actual costs can frequently vary
from estimates for a variety of reasons. For example, the costs from settlement of claims and
litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on
culpability and assessments on the amount of damages. Similarly, liabilities for environmental
remediation are subject to change because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation,
the determination of

additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination, and improvements in
technology.

Under the accounting rules, a liability is generally recorded for these types of contingencies
if management determines the loss to be both probable and estimable. The company generally reports
these losses as “Operating expenses” or “Selling, general and administrative expenses” on the
Consolidated Statement of Income. An exception to this handling is for income tax matters, for
which benefits are recognized only if management determines the tax position is “more likely than
not” (i.e., likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction. For
additional discussion of income tax uncertainties, refer to Note 15 beginning on page FS-46. Refer
also to the business segment discussions elsewhere in this section for the effect on earnings from
losses associated with certain litigation, environmental remediation and tax matters for the three
years ended December 31, 2009.

An estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been
used in recording these liabilities is not practicable because of the number of contingencies that
must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible
outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss.

New Accounting Standards

The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles – a replacement of FASB Statement No. 162 (FAS 168)

In June 2009, the FASB issued FAS
168, which became effective for the company in the quarter ending September 30, 2009. This standard
established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) system as the single authoritative
source of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and superseded existing literature
of the FASB, Emerging Issues Task Force, American Institute of CPAs and other sources. The ASC did
not change GAAP, but organized the literature into about 90 accounting Topics. Adoption of the ASC
did not affect the company’s accounting.

Employer’s Disclosures About Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets (FSP FAS 132(R)-1)

In December
2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 132(R)-1, which was subsequently codified into ASC 715,

Compensation
– Retirement Benefits,

and became effective with the company’s reporting at December 31, 2009. This
standard amended and expanded the disclosure requirements for the plan assets of defined benefit
pension and other postretirement plans. Refer to information beginning on page FS-52 in Note 21,
Employee Benefits, for these disclosures.

Transfers and Servicing (ASC 860), Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets (ASU 2009-16)

The FASB issued ASU 2009-16 in December 2009. This standard became effective for the company on
January 1, 2010. ASU 2009-16

FS-21


changes how companies account for transfers of financial assets and eliminates the concept of
qualifying special-purpose entities. Adoption of the guidance is not expected to have an impact on
the company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

Consolidation (ASC 810), Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved With
Variable Interest Entities

(ASU 2009-17)

The FASB issued ASU 2009-17 in December 2009. This
standard became effective for the company January 1, 2010. ASU 2009-17 requires the enterprise to
qualitatively assess if it is the primary beneficiary of a variable-interest entity (VIE), and, if
so, the VIE must be consolidated. Adoption of the standard is not expected to have a material
impact on the company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

Extractive
Industries – Oil and Gas (ASC 932), Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures
(ASU 2010-03)

In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-03, which became effective for the company
on December 31, 2009. The standard amends certain sections of
ASC 932,

Extractive Industries – Oil
and Gas,

to align them with the requirements in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s final
rule,

Modernization of the Oil and Gas Reporting Requirements

(the final rule). The final rule was
issued on December 31, 2008. Refer to Table V – Reserve Quantity Information, beginning on page
FS-69, for additional information on the final rule and the impact of adoption.

Management’s Responsibility for Financial Statements

To the Stockholders of Chevron Corporation

Management of Chevron is responsible for preparing the accompanying consolidated financial
statements and the related information appearing in this report. The statements were prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and fairly
represent the transactions and financial position of the company. The financial statements include
amounts that are based on management’s best estimates and judgment.

As stated in its report included herein, the independent registered public accounting firm of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has audited the company’s consolidated financial statements in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).

The Board of Directors of Chevron has an Audit Committee composed of directors who are not
officers or employees of the company. The Audit Committee meets regularly with members of
management, the internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm to review
accounting, internal control, auditing and financial reporting matters. Both the internal auditors
and the independent registered public accounting firm have free and direct access to the Audit
Committee without the presence of management.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). The company’s

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Chevron Corporation:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated
statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Chevron Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2009
and December 31, 2008 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2009 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial
statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 based on
criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible
for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on
the financial statement schedule, and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our

audit of
internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed
risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts

Note 1

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

General

Exploration and production (upstream) operations consist of exploring for, developing and
producing crude oil and natural gas and marketing natural gas. Refining, marketing and
transportation (downstream) operations relate to refining crude oil into finished petroleum
products; marketing crude oil and the many products derived from petroleum; and transporting crude
oil, natural gas and petroleum products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car.
Chemical operations include the manufacture and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for
industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant oil additives.

The company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These require the use of estimates
and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the
financial statements, as well as amounts included in the notes thereto, including discussion and
disclosure of contingent liabilities. Although the company uses its best estimates and judgments,
actual results could differ from these estimates as future confirming events occur.

The nature of the company’s operations and the many countries in which it operates subject the
company to changing economic, regulatory and political conditions. The company does not believe it
is vulnerable to the risk of near-term severe impact as a result of any concentration of its
activities.

Subsidiary and Affiliated Companies

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of
controlled subsidiary companies more than 50 percent-owned and variable-interest entities in which
the company is the primary beneficiary. Undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures and
certain other assets are consolidated on a proportionate basis. Investments in and advances to
affiliates in which the company has a substantial ownership interest of approximately 20 percent to
50 percent or for which the company exercises significant influence but not control over policy
decisions are accounted for by the equity method. As part of that accounting, the company
recognizes gains and losses that arise from the issuance of stock by an affiliate that results in
changes in the company’s proportionate share of the dollar amount of the affiliate’s equity
currently in income.

Investments are assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value of
the investment may be below the company’s carrying value. When such a condition is deemed to be
other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value, and
the amount of the write-down is included in net income. In making the determination as to whether a
decline is other than temporary, the company considers such factors as the

duration and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial performance, and the company’s ability
and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any
anticipated recovery in the investment’s market value. The new cost basis of investments in these
equity investees is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value.

Differences between the company’s carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying
equity in the net assets of the affiliate are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets
and liabilities based on the company’s analysis of the various factors giving rise to the
difference. When appropriate, the company’s share of the affiliate’s reported earnings is adjusted
quarterly to reflect the difference between these allocated values and the affiliate’s historical
book values.

Derivatives

The majority of the company’s activity in derivative commodity instruments is intended
to manage the financial risk posed by physical transactions. For some of this derivative activity,
generally limited to large, discrete or infrequently occurring transactions, the company may elect
to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting. For other similar derivative instruments,
generally because of the short-term nature of the contracts or their limited use, the company does not apply hedge accounting, and
changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in current income. For the company’s
commodity trading activity and foreign currency exposures, gains and losses from derivative
instruments are reported in current income. Interest rate swaps – hedging a portion of the
company’s fixed-rate debt – are accounted for as fair value hedges, whereas interest rate swaps
relating to a portion of the company’s floating-rate debt are recorded at fair value on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet, with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. Where Chevron is a
party to master netting arrangements, fair value receivable and payable amounts recognized for
derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty are offset on the balance sheet.

Short-Term Investments

All short-term investments are classified as available for sale and are in
highly liquid debt securities. Those investments that are part of the company’s cash management
portfolio and have original maturities of three months or less are reported as “Cash equivalents.”
The balance of the short-term investments is reported as “Marketable securities” and is
marked-to-market, with any unrealized gains or losses included in “Other comprehensive income.”

Inventories

Crude oil, petroleum products and chemicals are generally stated at cost, using a
Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) method. In the aggregate, these costs are below market. “Materials,
supplies and other” inventories generally are stated at average cost.

FS-32


Note 1

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Continued

Properties, Plant and Equipment

The successful efforts method is used for crude-oil and natural-gas
exploration and production activities. All costs for development wells, related plant and
equipment, proved mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties, and related asset
retirement obligation (ARO) assets are capitalized. Costs of exploratory wells are capitalized
pending determination of whether the wells found proved reserves. Costs of wells that are assigned
proved reserves remain capitalized. Costs also are capitalized for exploratory wells that have
found crude-oil and natural gas reserves even if the reserves cannot be classified as proved when
the drilling is completed, provided the exploratory well has found a sufficient quantity of
reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient
progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. All other
exploratory wells and costs are expensed. Refer to Note 19, beginning on page FS-50, for additional
discussion of accounting for suspended exploratory well costs.

Long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved crude-oil and natural-gas properties,
are assessed for possible impairment by comparing their carrying values with their associated
undiscounted future net before-tax cash flows. Events that can trigger assessments for possible
impairments include write-downs of proved reserves based on field performance, significant
decreases in the market value of an asset, significant change in the extent or manner of use of or
a physical change in an asset, and a more-likely-than-not expectation that a long-lived asset or
asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly sooner than the end of its
previously estimated useful life. Impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values,
generally their discounted future net before-tax cash flows. For proved crude-oil and natural-gas
properties in the United States, the company generally performs the impairment review on an
individual field basis. Outside the United States, reviews are performed on a country, concession,
development area or field basis, as appropriate. In the refining, marketing, transportation and
chemicals areas, impairment reviews are generally done on the basis of a refinery, a plant, a
marketing area or marketing assets by country. Impairment amounts are recorded as incremental
“Depreciation, depletion and amortization” expense.

Long-lived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing
the carrying value of the asset with its fair value less the cost to sell. If the net book value
exceeds the fair value less cost to sell, the asset is considered impaired and adjusted to the
lower value.

As required under accounting standards for asset retirement and environmental obligations
(Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 410), the fair value of a liability for an ARO is recorded
as an asset and a liability when there is a

legal obligation associated with the retirement of a long-lived asset and the amount can be
reasonably estimated. Refer also to Note 23, on page FS-60, relating to AROs.

Depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude-oil and natural-gas
producing properties, except mineral interests, are expensed using the unit-of-production method
generally by individual field, as the proved developed reserves are produced. Depletion expenses
for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using the unit-of-production
method by individual field as the related proved reserves are produced. Periodic valuation
provisions for impairment of capitalized costs of unproved mineral interests are expensed.

Depreciation and depletion expenses for mining assets are determined using the
unit-of-production method as the proved reserves are produced. The capitalized costs of all other
plant and equipment are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives. In general, the
declining-balance method is used to depreciate plant and equipment in the United States; the
straight-line method generally is used to depreciate international plant and equipment and to
amortize all capitalized leased assets.

Gains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties, plant and equipment
subject to composite group amortization or depreciation. Gains or losses from abnormal retirements
are recorded as expenses and from sales as “Other income.”

Expenditures for maintenance (including those for
planned major maintenance projects), repairs and minor renewals to maintain facilities in operating
condition are generally expensed as incurred. Major replacements and renewals are capitalized.

Goodwill

Goodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to amortization. As required
by accounting standards for goodwill (ASC 350), the company tests such goodwill at the reporting
unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or
circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit
below its carrying amount.

Environmental Expenditures

Environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing operations or to
conditions caused by past operations are expensed. Expenditures that create future benefits or
contribute to future revenue generation are capitalized.

Liabilities related to future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments or
cleanups or both are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. For the company’s U.S. and
Canadian marketing facilities, the accrual is based in part on the probability that a future
remediation commitment will be required. For crude-oil, natural-gas and mineral-producing
properties, a liability for an ARO is made,

FS-33


Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts

Note 1

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Continued

following accounting standards for asset retirement and environmental obligations. Refer to Note
23, on page FS-60, for a discussion of the company’s AROs.

For federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, the company records a
liability for its designated share of the probable and estimable costs and probable amounts for
other potentially responsible parties when mandated by the regulatory agencies because the other
parties are not able to pay their respective shares.

The gross amount of environmental liabilities is based on the company’s best estimate of
future costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations and the
company’s own internal environmental policies. Future amounts are not discounted. Recoveries or
reimbursements are recorded as assets when receipt is reasonably assured.

Currency Translation

The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for substantially all of the
company’s consolidated operations and those of its equity affiliates. For those operations, all
gains and losses from currency translations are currently included in income. The cumulative
translation effects for those few entities, both consolidated and affiliated, using functional
currencies other than the U.S. dollar are included in “Currency translation adjustment” on the
Consolidated Statement of Equity.

Revenue Recognition

Revenues associated with sales of crude oil, natural gas, coal, petroleum and
chemicals products, and all other sources are recorded when title passes to the customer, net of
royalties, discounts and allowances, as applicable. Revenues from natural gas production from
properties in which Chevron has an interest with other producers are generally recognized on the
entitlement method. Excise, value-added and similar taxes assessed by a governmental authority on a
revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer are presented on a gross basis. The
associated amounts are shown as a footnote to the Consolidated Statement of Income on page FS-27.
Purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation
of one another (including buy/sell arrangements) are combined and recorded on a net basis and
reported in “Purchased crude oil and products” on the Consolidated Statement of Income.

Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation

The company issues stock options and other
share-based compensation to its employees and accounts for these transactions under the accounting
standards for share-based compensation (ASC 718). For equity awards, such as stock options, total
compensation cost is based on the grant date fair value

and for liability awards, such as stock appreciation rights, total compensation cost is based on
the settlement value. The company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for all awards over
the service period required to earn the award, which is the shorter of the vesting period or the
time period an employee becomes eligible to retain the award at retirement. Stock options and stock
appreciation rights granted under the company’s Long-Term Incentive Plan have graded vesting
provisions by which one-third of each award vests on the first, second and third anniversaries of
the date of grant. The company amortizes these graded awards on a straight-line basis.

Note 2

Noncontrolling Interests

The company adopted accounting standards for noncontrolling interests (ASC 810) in the
consolidated financial statements effective January 1, 2009, and retroactive to the earliest period
presented. Ownership interests in the company’s subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent
are presented separately from
 the parent’s equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount of consolidated net income
attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interests are both presented on the face of the
Consolidated Statement of Income. The term “earnings” is defined as “Net Income Attributable to
Chevron Corporation.”

Activity for the equity attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2009,
2008 and 2007 is as follows:

Retained earnings at December 31, 2009 and 2008, included approximately $8,122 and $7,951,
respectively, for the company’s share of undistributed earnings of equity affiliates.

At December 31, 2009, about 94 million shares of Chevron’s common stock remained available for
issuance from the 160 million shares that were reserved for issuance under the Chevron Corporation
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). In addition, approximately 342,000 shares remain available for
issuance from the 800,000 shares of the company’s common stock that were reserved for awards under
the Chevron Corporation Non-Employee Directors’ Equity Compensation and Deferral Plan
(Non-Employee

In accordance with accounting standards for cash-flow classifications for stock options (ASC
718), the “Net (increase) decrease in operating working capital” includes reductions of $25, $106
and $96 for excess income tax benefits associated with stock options exercised during 2009, 2008
and 2007, respectively. These amounts are offset by an equal amount in “Net sales (purchases) of
treasury shares.”

The “Net sales (purchases) of treasury shares” represents the cost of common shares purchased less
the cost of shares issued for
share-based compensation plans. Purchases totaled $6, $8,011 and
$7,036 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Purchases in 2008 and 2007 included shares purchased
under the company’s common stock repurchase programs.

In 2009, “Net sales (purchases) of other short-term investments” consisted of $123 in
restricted cash associated with
capital-investment projects at the company’s Pascagoula,
Mississippi refinery and the Angola liquefied-natural-gas project that was invested in short-term
securities and reclassified from “Cash and cash equivalents” to “Deferred charges and other assets”
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The company issued $350 and $650, in 2009 and 2007 respectively,
of tax exempt Mississippi Gulf Opportunity Zone Bonds as a source of funds for Pascagoula Refinery
projects.

The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for 2009 excludes changes to the Consolidated Balance
Sheet that did not affect cash. In 2008, “Net sales (purchases) of treasury shares” excludes $680 of treasury
shares acquired in exchange for a U.S. upstream property and $280 in cash. The carrying value of
this property in “Properties, plant and equipment” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet was not
significant. In 2008, a $2,450 increase in “Accrued liabilities” and a corresponding increase to
“Properties, plant and equipment, at cost” were considered non-cash transactions and excluded from
“Net (increase) decrease in operating
working
capital” and “Capital expenditures.” In 2009, the payments related to these “Accrued
liabilities” were excluded from “Net (increase) decrease in operating working capital” and were
reported as “Capital expenditures.” The amount is related to upstream operating agreements outside
the United States. “Capital expenditures” in 2008 excludes a $1,400 increase in “Properties, plant
and equipment” related to the acquisition of an additional interest in an equity affiliate that
required a change to the consolidated method of accounting for the investment during 2008. This
addition was offset primarily by reductions in “Investments and advances” and working capital and
an increase in “Non-current deferred income tax” liabilities. Refer also to Note 23, on page FS-60,
for a discussion of revisions to the company’s AROs that also did not involve cash receipts or
payments for the three years ending December 31, 2009.

Summarized Financial Data – Chevron U.S.A. Inc.

Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (CUSA) is a major subsidiary of Chevron Corporation. CUSA and its subsidiaries
manage and operate most of Chevron’s U.S. businesses. Assets include those related to the
exploration and production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and those associated
with the refining, marketing, supply and distribution of products derived from petroleum, excluding
most of the regulated pipeline operations of Chevron. CUSA also holds the company’s investment in
the Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC joint venture, which is accounted for using the equity
method.

During 2008, Chevron implemented legal reorganizations in which certain Chevron subsidiaries
transferred assets to or under CUSA. The summarized financial information for CUSA and its
consolidated subsidiaries presented in the table below gives retroactive effect to the
reorganizations as if they had occurred on January 1, 2007. However, the financial information in
the following table may not reflect the financial position and operating results in the future or
the historical results in the periods presented if the reorganization actually had occurred on that
date. The summarized financial information for CUSA and its consolidated subsidiaries is as

Fair Value Measurements

Accounting standards for fair-value measurement (ASC 820) establish a framework for measuring fair
value and stipulate disclosures about fair-value measurements. The standards apply to recurring and
nonrecurring financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that require or permit fair-value
measurements. ASC 820 became effective for Chevron on January 1, 2008, for all financial assets and
liabilities and recurring nonfinancial assets and liabilities. On January 1, 2009, the standard
became effective for nonrecurring nonfinancial assets and liabilities. Among the required
disclosures is the fair-value hierarchy of inputs the company uses to value an asset or a
liability. The three levels of the fair-value hierarchy are described as follows:

Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. For the
company, Level 1 inputs include exchange-traded futures contracts for which the parties are willing
to transact at the exchange-quoted price and marketable securities that are actively traded.

Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly. For the
company, Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, prices obtained
through third-party broker quotes, and prices that can be corroborated with other observable inputs
for substantially the complete term of a contract.

Note 9

Fair Value Measurements - Continued

Level 3: Unobservable inputs. The company does not use Level 3 inputs for any of its recurring
fair-value measurements. Level 3 inputs may be required for the determination of fair value
associated with certain nonrecurring measurements of nonfinancial assets and liabilities. In 2009,
the company used Level 3 inputs to determine the fair value of certain nonrecurring nonfinancial
assets.

The fair-value hierarchy for recurring assets and liabilities measured at fair value at
December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2008, is as follows:

Marketable Securities

The company calculates fair value for its marketable securities based on
quoted market prices for identical assets and liabilities. The fair values reflect the cash that
would have been received if the instruments were sold at December 31, 2009. Marketable securities
had average maturities of less than one year.

Derivatives

The company records its derivative

instruments – other than any commodity derivative
contracts that are designated as normal purchase and normal sale – on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet at fair value, with virtually all the offsetting amount to the Consolidated Statement of
Income. For derivatives with identical or similar provisions as contracts that are publicly traded
on a regular basis, the company uses the market values of the publicly traded instruments as an
input for fair-value calculations.

The company’s derivative instruments principally include crude-oil, natural-gas and
refined-product futures, swaps, options and forward contracts. Derivatives classified as Level 1
include futures, swaps and options contracts traded in active markets such as the New York
Mercantile Exchange.

Derivatives classified as Level 2 include swaps, options, and forward contracts principally
with financial institutions and other oil and gas companies, the fair values for which are obtained
from third-party broker quotes, industry pric-

ing services and exchanges.  The company obtains multiple sources of pricing information for the
Level 2 instruments. Since this pricing information is generated from observable market data, it
has historically been very consistent. The company does not materially adjust this information. The
company incorporates internal review, evaluation and assessment procedures, including a comparison
of Level 2 fair values derived from the company’s internally developed forward curves (on a sample
basis) with the pricing information to document reasonable, logical and supportable fair-value
determinations and proper level of classification.

Impairments of “Properties, plant and equipment”

During 2009 and in accordance with the accounting
standard for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets (ASC 360), long-lived assets
“held and
used” with a carrying amount of $949 were written down to a fair value of $490, resulting in a
before-tax loss of $459. The fair values were determined from internal cash-flow models, using
discount rates consistent with those used by the company to evaluate cash flows of other assets of
a similar nature. Long-lived assets
“held for sale” with a carrying amount of $160 were written
down to a fair value of $68, resulting in a before-tax loss of $92. The fair values were determined
based on bids received from prospective buyers.

Assets and Liabilities Not Required to Be Measured at Fair Value

The company holds cash
equivalents in U.S. and non-U.S. portfolios. The instruments held are primarily time deposits and
money market funds. The fair values reflect the cash that would have been received or paid if the
instruments were settled at

year-end.

Cash equivalents had carrying/fair values of $6,396 and
$7,058 at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and average maturities under 90 days. The
balance at December 31, 2009, includes $123 of investments for restricted funds related to an
international upstream development project and Pascagoula Refinery projects, which are included in
“Deferred charges and other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Long-term debt of $5,705 and
$1,221 had estimated fair values of $6,229 and $1,414 at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Fair values of other financial instruments at the end of 2009 and 2008 were not material.

Note 10

Financial and Derivative Instruments

Derivative Commodity Instruments

Chevron is exposed to market risks related to price
volatility of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas
and refinery feedstocks.

The company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on a portion of
its activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the pur-

chase, sale and storage of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids and
feedstock for company refineries. From time to time, the company also uses derivative commodity
instruments for limited trading purposes.

The company’s derivative commodity instruments principally include crude-oil, natural-gas and
refined-product futures, swaps, options and forward contracts. None of the company’s derivative
instruments is designated as a hedging instrument, although certain of the company’s affiliates
make such designation. The company’s derivatives are not material to the company’s financial
position, results of operations or liquidity. The company believes it has no material market or
credit risks to its operations, financial position or liquidity as a result of its commodities and
other derivatives activities.

The company uses International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreements to govern
derivative contracts with certain counterparties to mitigate credit risk. Depending on the nature
of the derivative transactions, bilateral collateral arrangements may also be required. When the
company is engaged in more than one outstanding derivative transaction with the same counterparty
and also has a legally enforceable netting agreement with that counterparty, the net mark-to-market exposure represents the
netting of the positive and negative exposures with that counterparty and is a reasonable measure
of the company’s credit risk exposure. The company also uses other netting agreements with certain
counterparties with which it conducts significant transactions to mitigate credit risk.

Derivative instruments measured at fair value at December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2008, and
their classification on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Income are as
follows:

Foreign Currency

The company may enter into currency derivative contracts to manage some of
its foreign currency exposures. These exposures include revenue and anticipated purchase
transactions, including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease commitments. The currency
derivative contracts, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains
and losses reflected in income. There were no open currency derivative contracts at December 31,
2009.

Interest Rates

The company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its
overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. Historically, under the terms of the
swaps, net cash settlements were based on the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate
interest amounts calculated by reference to agreed notional principal amounts. Interest rate swaps
related to a portion of the company’s fixed-rate debt, if any, may be accounted for as fair value
hedges. Interest rate swaps related to floating-rate debt, if any, are recorded at fair value on
the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. At year-end 2009, the
company had no interest rate swaps. The company’s only interest rate swaps on fixed-rate debt
matured in January 2009.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

The company’s financial instruments that are exposed to
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of its cash equivalents, marketable securities,
derivative financial instruments and trade receivables. The company’s short-term investments are
placed with a wide array of financial institutions with high credit ratings. This diversified
investment policy limits the company’s exposure both to credit risk and to concentrations of credit
risk. Similar standards of diversity and creditworthiness are applied to the company’s
counterparties in derivative instruments.

The trade receivable balances, reflecting the company’s diversified sources of revenue, are
dispersed among the company’s broad customer base worldwide. As a result, the company believes
concentrations of credit risk are limited. The company routinely assesses the financial strength of
its customers. When the financial strength of a customer is not considered sufficient, requiring
Letters of Credit is a principal method used to support sales to customers.

Note 11

Operating Segments and Geographic Data

Although each subsidiary of Chevron is responsible for its own affairs, Chevron Corporation
manages its investments in these subsidiaries and their affiliates. For this purpose, the
investments are grouped as follows: upstream – exploration and production; downstream – refining,
marketing and transportation; chemicals; and all other. The first three of these groupings
represent the company’s “reportable segments” and “operating segments” as defined in accounting
standards for segment reporting (ASC 280).

The segments are separately managed for investment purposes under a structure that includes
“segment managers” who report to the company’s “chief operating decision maker” (CODM)
(terms as
defined in ASC 280). The CODM is the company’s Executive Committee, a committee of senior officers
that includes the Chief Executive Officer and that, in turn, reports to the Board of Directors of
Chevron Corporation.

The operating segments represent components of the company, as described in accounting
standards for segment reporting (ASC 280), that engage in activities (a) from which revenues are
earned and expenses are incurred; (b) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the CODM,
which makes decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and to assess their
performance; and (c) for which discrete financial information is available.

Segment managers for the reportable segments are directly accountable to and maintain regular
contact with the company’s CODM to discuss the segment’s operating activities and financial
performance. The CODM approves annual capital and exploratory budgets at the reportable segment
level, as well as reviews capital and exploratory funding for major projects and approves major
changes to the annual capital and exploratory budgets. However, business-unit managers within the
operating segments are directly responsible for decisions relating to project implementation and
all other matters connected with daily operations. Company officers who are

FS-40


Note 11

Operating Segments and Geographic Data - Continued

members of the Executive Committee also have individual management responsibilities and
participate in other committees for purposes other than acting as the CODM.

“All Other” activities include mining operations, power generation businesses, worldwide cash
management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations,
real estate activities, alternative fuels and technology companies, and the company’s interest in
Dynegy
(through May 2007, when Chevron sold its interest).

The company’s primary country of operation is the United States of America, its country of
domicile. Other components of the company’s operations are reported as “International”
(outside the
United States).

Segment Earnings

The company evaluates the performance of its operating segments on an after-tax
basis, without considering the effects of debt financing interest expense or investment interest
income, both of which are managed by the company on a worldwide basis. Corporate administrative
costs and assets are not allocated to the operating segments. However, operating segments are
billed for the direct use of corporate services. Nonbillable costs remain at the corporate level in
“All Other.” Earnings by major operating area are presented in the following table:

Segment Sales and Other Operating Revenues

Operating segment sales and other operating
revenues, including internal transfers, for the years 2009, 2008 and 2007, are presented in the
table on the following page. Products are transferred between operating segments at internal
product values that approximate market prices.

Revenues for the upstream segment are derived primarily from the production and sale of crude
oil and natural gas, as well as the sale of third-party production of natural gas. Revenues for the
downstream segment are derived from the refining and marketing of petroleum products such as
gasoline, jet fuel, gas oils, lubricants, residual fuel oils and other products derived from crude
oil. This segment also generates revenues from the transportation and trading of refined products,
crude oil and natural gas liquids. Revenues

Descriptions of major affiliates, including significant differences between the company’s
carrying value of its investments and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliates,
are as follows:

Tengizchevroil

Chevron has a 50 percent equity ownership interest in Tengizchevroil
(TCO), a joint venture formed in 1993 to develop the Tengiz and Korolev crude-oil fields in
Kazakhstan over a 40-year period. At December 31, 2009, the company’s carrying value of its
investment in TCO was about $200 higher than the amount of underlying equity in TCO’s net assets. This difference results from
Chevron acquiring

a portion of its interest in TCO at a value greater than the underlying book value for that portion
of TCO’s net assets. See Note 7, on page FS-36, for summarized financial information for 100
percent of TCO.

Petropiar

Chevron has a 30 percent interest in Petropiar, a joint stock company formed in 2008 to
operate the Hamaca heavy-oil production and upgrading project. The project, located in Venezuela’s
Orinoco Belt, has a 25-year contract term. Prior to the formation of Petropiar, Chevron had a 30
percent interest in the Hamaca project. At December 31, 2009, the company’s carrying value of its
investment in Petropiar was approximately $195 less than the amount of underlying equity in
Petropiar’s net assets. The difference represents the excess of Chevron’s underlying equity in
Petropiar’s net assets over the net book value of the assets contributed to the venture.

Petroboscan

Chevron has a 39 percent interest in Petroboscan, a joint stock company formed in 2006
to operate the Boscan Field in Venezuela until 2026. Chevron previously operated the field under an
operating service agreement. At December 31, 2009, the company’s carrying value of its investment
in Petroboscan was approximately $275 higher than the amount of underlying equity in Petroboscan’s
net assets. The difference reflects the excess of the net book value of the assets contributed by
Chevron over its underlying equity in Petroboscan’s net assets.

Angola LNG Ltd.

Chevron has a 36 percent interest in
Angola LNG Ltd., which will process and
liquefy natural gas produced in Angola for delivery to international markets.

GS Caltex Corporation

Chevron owns 50 percent of
GS Caltex Corporation, a joint venture with GS
Holdings. The joint venture imports, refines and markets petroleum products and petrochemicals,
predominantly in South Korea.

Caspian Pipeline Consortium

Chevron has a 15 percent interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium,
which provides the critical export route for crude oil from both TCO and Karachaganak.

Star Petroleum Refining Company Ltd.

Chevron has a 64 percent equity ownership interest in Star
Petroleum Refining Company Ltd. (SPRC), which owns the Star Refinery in Thailand. The Petroleum
Authority of Thailand owns the remaining 36 percent of SPRC.

Caltex Australia Ltd.

Chevron has a 50 percent equity ownership interest in Caltex Australia Ltd.
(CAL). The remaining 50 percent of CAL is publicly owned. At December 31, 2009,

FS-43


Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts

Note 12

Investments and Advances - Continued

the fair value of Chevron’s share of CAL common stock was approximately $1,120.

Colonial Pipeline Company

Chevron owns an approximate 23 percent equity interest in the Colonial
Pipeline Company. The Colonial Pipeline system runs from Texas to New Jersey and transports
petroleum products in a 13-state market.
 At December 31, 2009, the company’s carrying value of its
investment in Colonial Pipeline was approximately $550 higher than the amount of underlying equity
in Colonial Pipeline net assets. This difference primarily relates to purchase price adjustments
from the acquisition of Unocal Corporation.

Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC

Chevron owns 50 percent of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company
LLC. The other half is owned by ConocoPhillips Corporation.

Litigation

MTBE

Chevron and many other companies in the petroleum industry have used methyl tertiary butyl
ether (MTBE) as a gasoline additive. Chevron is a party to 50 pending lawsuits and claims, the
majority of which involve numerous other petroleum marketers and refiners. Resolution of these
lawsuits and claims may ultimately require the company to correct or ameliorate the alleged effects
on the environment of prior release of MTBE by the company or other parties. Additional lawsuits
and claims related to the use of MTBE, including personal-injury claims, may be filed in the
future. The company’s ultimate exposure related to pending lawsuits and claims is not determinable,
but could be material to net income in any one period. The company no longer uses MTBE in the
manufacture of gasoline in the United States.

Ecuador

Chevron is a defendant in a civil lawsuit before the Superior Court of Nueva Loja in Lago
Agrio, Ecuador, brought in May 2003 by plaintiffs who claim to be representatives of certain
residents of an area where an oil production consortium formerly had operations. The lawsuit
alleges damage to the environment from the oil exploration and production operations and seeks
unspecified damages to fund environmental remediation and restoration of the

alleged environmental harm, plus a health
monitoring program. Until 1992, Texaco Petroleum Company (Texpet), a subsidiary of Texaco Inc., was
a minority member of this consortium with Petroecuador, the Ecuadorian state-owned oil company, as
the majority partner; since 1990, the operations have been conducted solely by Petroecuador. At the
conclusion of the consortium and following an independent third-party environmental audit of the
concession area, Texpet entered into a formal agreement with the Republic of Ecuador and
Petroecuador for Texpet to remediate specific sites assigned by the government in proportion to
Texpet’s ownership share of the consortium. Pursuant to that agreement, Texpet conducted a
three-year remediation program at a cost of $40. After certifying that the sites were properly
remediated, the government granted Texpet and all related corporate entities a full release from
any and all environmental liability arising from the consortium operations.

Based on the history described above, Chevron believes that this lawsuit lacks legal or
factual merit. As to matters of law, the company believes first, that the court lacks jurisdiction
over Chevron; second, that the law under which plaintiffs bring the action, enacted in 1999, cannot
be applied retroactively; third, that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations in
Ecuador; and, fourth, that the
lawsuit is also barred by the releases from liability previously

FS-45

given to Texpet by the Republic of Ecuador and Petroecuador. With regard to the facts, the company believes that the
evidence confirms that Texpet’s remediation was properly conducted and that the remaining
environmental damage reflects Petroecuador’s failure to timely fulfill its legal obligations and
Petroecuador’s further conduct since assuming full control over the operations.

In April 2008, a mining engineer appointed by the court to identify and determine the cause of
environmental damage, and to specify steps needed to remediate it, issued a report recommending
that the court assess $8,000, which would, according to the engineer, provide financial
compensation for purported damages, including wrongful death claims, and pay for, among other
items, environmental remediation, health care systems and additional infrastructure for
Petroecuador. The engineer’s report also asserted that an additional $8,300 could be assessed
against Chevron for unjust enrichment. The engineer’s report is not binding on the court. Chevron
also believes that the engineer’s work was performed and his report prepared in a manner contrary
to law and in violation of the court’s orders. Chevron submitted a rebuttal to the report in which
it asked the court to strike the report in its entirety. In November 2008, the engineer revised the
report and, without additional evidence, recommended an increase in the financial compensation for
purported damages to a total of $18,900 and an increase in the assessment for purported unjust
enrichment to a total of $8,400. Chevron submitted a rebuttal to the revised report, which the
court dismissed. In September 2009, following the disclosure by Chevron of evidence that the judge
participated in meetings in which businesspeople and individuals holding themselves out as
government officials discussed the case and its likely outcome, the judge presiding over the case
petitioned to be recused. In late September 2009, the judge was recused, and in October 2009, the
full chamber of the provincial court affirmed the recusal, resulting in the appointment of a new
judge. Chevron filed motions to annul all of the rulings made by the prior judge, but the new judge
denied these motions. The court has completed most of the procedural aspects of the case and could
render a judgment at any time. Chevron will continue a vigorous defense of any attempted imposition
of liability.

In the event of an adverse judgment, Chevron would expect to pursue its appeals and vigorously
defend against enforcement of any such judgment; therefore, the ultimate outcome – and any
financial effect on Chevron – remains uncertain. Management does not believe an estimate of a
reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss) can be made in this

case. Due to the defects associated with the engineer’s report, management does not believe the
report has any utility in calculating a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss). Moreover,
the highly uncertain legal environment surrounding the case provides no basis for management to
estimate a reasonably possible loss (or a range of loss).

Taxes - Continued

The company’s effective tax rate decreased from 44.2 percent in 2008 to 43.0
percent in 2009. The rate was lower in 2009 mainly due to the effect of deferred tax benefits and
relatively low tax rates on asset sales, both related to an international upstream project. In
addition, a greater proportion of before-tax income was earned in 2009 by equity affiliates than in
2008. (Equity-affiliate income is reported as a single amount on an after-tax basis on the
Consolidated Statement of Income.) Partially offsetting these items was the effect of a greater
proportion of income earned in 2009 in tax jurisdictions with higher tax rates.

The company records its deferred taxes on a tax-jurisdiction basis and classifies those net
amounts as current or noncurrent based on the balance sheet classification of the related assets or
liabilities. The reported deferred tax balances are composed of the following:

Deferred tax liabilities at the end of 2009 increased by approximately $400 from
year-end 2008. The increase was primarily related to increased temporary differences for
properties, plant and equipment.

Deferred tax assets were essentially unchanged in 2009. Increases related to additional
foreign tax credits arising from earnings in high-tax-rate international jurisdictions (which were
substantially offset by valuation allowances) and to inventory-related temporary differences. These
effects were offset by reductions in deferred credits and tax loss carryforwards primarily
resulting from the usage of tax benefits in international tax jurisdictions.

The overall valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for foreign tax credit carryforwards,
tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences. It reduces the deferred tax assets to
amounts that are, in management’s assessment, more likely than not to be realized. Tax loss
carryforwards exist in many international jurisdictions. Whereas some of these tax loss
carryforwards do not have an expiration date, others expire at various times from 2010 through
2036. Foreign tax credit carryforwards of $5,387 will expire between 2010 and 2019.

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, deferred taxes were classified on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet as follows:

Income taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that
have been or are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. Undistributed earnings of international
consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates for which no deferred income tax provision has been made
for possible future remittances totaled $20,458 at December 31, 2009. This amount represents
earnings reinvested as part of the company’s ongoing international business. It is not practicable
to estimate the amount of taxes that might be payable on the eventual remittance of earnings that
are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. At the end of 2009, deferred income taxes were recorded
for the undistributed earnings of certain international operations for which the company no longer
intends to indefinitely reinvest the earnings. The company does not anticipate incurring
significant additional taxes on remittances of earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested.

Uncertain Income Tax Positions

Under accounting standards for uncertainty in income taxes (ASC
740-10), a company recognizes a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax
position only if management’s assessment is that the position is “more likely than not” (i.e., a
likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the
technical merits of the position. The term “tax position” in the accounting standards for income
taxes (ASC 740-10-20) refers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected
to be taken in a future tax return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax
assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods.

The following table indicates the changes to the company’s unrecognized tax
benefits for the year ended December 31, 2009. The term “unrecognized tax benefits” in the
accounting standards for income taxes (ASC 740-10-20) refers to the differences between a tax
position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit measured and recognized in
the financial statements. Interest and penalties are not included.

Although unrecognized tax benefits for individual tax positions may increase or decrease
during 2010, the company believes that no change will be individually significant during 2010.
Approximately 90 percent of the $3,195 of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2009, would
have an impact on the effective tax rate if subsequently recognized.

Tax positions for Chevron and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to income tax audits
by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world. For the company’s major tax jurisdictions,
examinations of tax returns for certain prior tax years had not been completed as of December 31,
2009. For these jurisdictions, the latest years for which income tax examinations had been
finalized were as follows: United States – 2005, Nigeria – 1994, Angola – 2001 and Saudi Arabia – 2003.

On the Consolidated Statement of Income, the company reports interest and penalties related to
liabilities for uncertain tax positions as “Income tax expense.” As of December 31, 2009, accruals
of $232 for anticipated interest and penalty obligations were included on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet,

compared with accruals of $276 as of year-end 2008. Income tax (benefit) expense associated with
interest and penalties was $(20), $79 and $70 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

the balance sheet date. In 2009, $350 of tax-exempt Gulf Opportunity Zone bonds related to
projects at the Pascagoula Refinery were issued.

The company periodically enters into interest rate swaps on a portion of its short-term debt.
At December 31, 2009, the company had no interest rate swaps on short-term debt. See Note 10,
beginning on page FS-39, for information concerning the company’s debt-related derivative
activities.

At December 31, 2009, the company had $5,100 of committed credit facilities with banks
worldwide, which permit the company to refinance short-term obligations on a long-term basis. The
facilities support the company’s commercial paper borrowings. Interest on borrowings under the
terms of specific agreements may be based on the London Interbank Offered Rate or bank prime rate.
No amounts were outstanding under these credit agreements during 2009 or at year-end.

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the company classified $4,190 and $4,950, respectively, of
short-term debt as long-term. Settlement of these obligations is not expected to require the use of
working capital in 2010, as the company has both the intent and the ability to refinance this debt
on a long-term basis.

New Accounting Standards

The FASB Accounting Standards
Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles – a replacement of FASB
Statement No. 162 (FAS 168)

In June 2009, the FASB issued FAS 168, which became effective for the
company in the quarter ending September 30, 2009. This standard established the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification (ASC) system as the single authoritative source of U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP) and superseded existing literature of the FASB, Emerging Issues Task
Force, American Institute of CPAs and other sources. The ASC did not change GAAP, but organized the
literature into about 90 accounting Topics. Adoption of the ASC did not affect the company’s
accounting.

Employer’s Disclosures About Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets (FSP FAS 132(R)-1)

In December 2008,
the FASB issued FSP FAS 132(R)-1, which was subsequently codified into ASC 715,

Compensation –
Retirement Benefits,

and became effective with the company’s reporting at December 31,
2009. This standard amended and expanded the disclosure
requirements for the plan assets of defined benefit pension
and other postretirement plans. Refer to information
beginning on page FS-52 in Note 21, Employee Benefits, for these
disclosures.

Transfers and Servicing (ASC 860), Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets (ASU 2009-16)

The
FASB issued ASU 2009-16 in December 2009. This standard became effective for the company on January
1, 2010. ASU 2009-16 changes how companies account for transfers of financial assets and eliminates
the concept of qualifying special-purpose entities. Adoption of the guidance is not expected to
have an impact on the company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

Consolidation (ASC 810), Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved With Variable
Interest Entities (ASU 2009-17)

The FASB issued ASU 2009-17 in December 2009. This standard became
effective for the company January 1,
2010. ASU 2009-17 requires the enterprise to qualitatively

FS-49


Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts

Note 18

New Accounting Standards - Continued

assess if it is the primary beneficiary of a variable-interest entity (VIE), and, if
so, the VIE must be consolidated. Adoption of the standard is not expected to have a material
impact on the company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

Extractive Industries – Oil and Gas (ASC 932), Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures
(ASU 2010-03)

In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-03, which became effective for the company
on December 31, 2009. The standard amends certain sections of ASC 932,

Extractive Industries – Oil
and Gas,

to align them with the requirements in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s final
rule,

Modernization of the Oil and Gas Reporting Requirements

(the final rule). The final rule was
issued on December 31, 2008. Refer to Table V – Reserve Quantity Information, beginning on page
FS-69, for additional information on the final rule and the impact of adoption.

Note 19

Accounting for Suspended Exploratory Wells

Accounting standards for the costs of exploratory
wells (ASC 932) provide that exploratory well costs continue to be capitalized after the completion
of drilling when (a) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as
a producing well and (b) the enterprise is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and
the economic and operating viability of the project. If either condition is not met or if an
enterprise obtains information that raises substantial doubt about the economic or operational
viability of the project, the exploratory well would be assumed to be impaired, and its costs, net
of any salvage value, would be charged to expense. The accounting standards provide a number of
indicators that can assist an entity in demonstrating that sufficient progress is being made in
assessing the reserves and economic viability of the project.

The following table indicates the changes to the company’s suspended exploratory well costs
for the three years ended December 31, 2009:

Of the $1,871 of exploratory well costs capitalized for more than one year at December 31,
2009, $1,143 (28 projects) is related to projects that had drilling activities under way or firmly
planned for the near future. The $728 balance is related to 18 projects in areas requiring a major
capital expenditure before production could begin and for which additional drilling efforts were
not under way or firmly planned for the near future. Additional drilling was not deemed necessary
because the presence of hydrocarbons had already been established, and other activities were in
process to enable a future decision on project development.

FS-50


Note 19

Accounting for Suspended Exploratory Wells - Continued

The projects for the $728 referenced above had the following activities
associated with assessing the reserves and the projects’
economic viability: (a) $330 (one project) – negotiation of crude-oil and natural-gas transportation contracts and construction agreements;
(b) $107 (two projects) – discussion with possible natural-gas purchasers ongoing; (c) $73 (two
projects) – continued unitization efforts on adjacent discoveries that span international
boundaries while planning on an LNG facility has commenced; (d) $49
(one project) – progression of
development concept selection; (e) $47 (one project) – subsurface and facilities engineering
studies concluding with front-end engineering and design expected to begin in early 2010; (f) $34 (one project) – reviewing development alternatives; $88 – miscellaneous activities for 10
projects with smaller amounts suspended. While progress was being made on all 46 projects, the
decision on the recognition of proved reserves under SEC rules in some cases may not occur for
several years because of the complexity, scale and negotiations connected with the projects. The
majority of these decisions are expected to occur in the next three years.

The $1,871 of suspended well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year as of
December 31, 2009, represents 149 exploratory wells in 46 projects. The tables below contain the

Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation

Compensation expense for stock options for
2009, 2008 and 2007 was $182 ($119 after tax), $168 ($109 after tax) and $146 ($95 after tax),
respectively. In addition, compensation expense for stock appreciation rights, restricted stock,
performance units and restricted stock units was $170 ($110

after tax), $132 ($86 after tax) and $205 ($133 after tax) for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
No significant stock-based compensation cost was capitalized at December 31, 2009 and 2008.

Cash received in payment for option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements for
2009, 2008 and 2007 was $147, $404 and $445, respectively. Actual tax benefits realized for the tax
deductions from option exercises were $25, $103 and $94 for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Cash paid to settle performance units and stock appreciation rights was $89, $136 and $88 for
2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Chevron Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)

Awards under the LTIP may take the form of, but are not
limited to, stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights,
performance units and nonstock grants. From April 2004 through January 2014, no more than 160
million shares may be issued under the LTIP, and no more than 64 million of those shares may be in
a form other than a stock option, stock appreciation right or award requiring full payment for
shares by the award recipient.

Texaco Stock Incentive Plan (Texaco SIP)

On the closing of the acquisition of Texaco in October
2001, outstanding options granted under the Texaco SIP were converted to Chevron options. These
options, which have 10-year contractual lives extending into 2011, retained a provision for being
restored. This provision enables a participant who exercises a stock option to receive new options
equal to the number of shares exchanged or who has shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding
obligations to receive new options equal to the number of shares exchanged or withheld. The
restored options are fully exercisable six months after the date of grant, and the exercise price
is the market value of the common stock on the day the restored option is granted. Beginning in
2007, restored options were issued under the LTIP. No further awards may be granted under the
former Texaco plans.

Unocal Share-Based Plans (Unocal Plans)

When Chevron acquired Unocal in August 2005, outstanding
stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under various Unocal Plans were exchanged for
fully vested Chevron options and appreciation rights. These awards retained the same provisions as
the original Unocal Plans. If not exercised, these awards will expire between early 2010 and early
2015.

The total intrinsic value (i.e., the difference between the exercise price and the
market price) of options exercised during 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $91, $433 and $423, respectively.
During this period, the company continued its practice of issuing treasury shares upon exercise of
these awards.

As of December 31, 2009, there was $233 of total unrecognized before-tax compensation cost
related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted or restored under the plans.
That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years.

At January 1, 2009, the number of LTIP performance units outstanding was equivalent to
2,400,555 shares. During 2009, 992,800 units were granted, 668,953 units vested with cash proceeds
distributed to recipients and 45,294 units were forfeited. At December 31, 2009, units outstanding
were 2,679,108, and the fair value of the liability recorded for these instruments was $233. In
addition, outstanding stock appreciation rights and other awards that were granted under various
LTIP and former Texaco and Unocal programs totaled approximately 1.5 million equivalent shares as
of December 31, 2009. A liability of $45 was recorded for these awards.

In March 2009, Chevron granted all eligible LTIP employees restricted stock units in lieu of
annual cash bonus. The expense associated with these special restricted stock units was recognized
at the time of the grants. A total of 453,965 units were granted at $69.70 per unit at the time of
the grant. Total fair value of the special restricted stock units was $32 as of December 31, 2009.

All of

the special restricted stock units will be payable in November 2010.

Note 21

Employee Benefit Plans

The company has defined benefit pension plans for many employees. The company typically
prefunds defined benefit plans as required by local regulations or in certain situations where
prefunding provides economic advantages. In the United States, all qualified plans are subject to
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) minimum funding standard. The company does not
typically fund U.S. nonqualified pension plans that are not subject to funding requirements under
laws and regulations because contributions to these pension plans may be less economic and
investment returns may be less attractive than the company’s other investment alternatives.

The company also sponsors other postretirement (OPEB) plans that provide medical and dental
benefits, as well as life insurance for some active and qualifying retired employees. The plans are
unfunded, and the company and retirees share the costs. Medical coverage for Medicare-eligible
retirees in the company’s main U.S. medical plan is secondary to Medicare (including Part D), and
the increase to the company contribution for retiree medical coverage is limited to no more than 4
percent per year. Certain life insurance benefits are paid by the company.

Under accounting standards for postretirement benefits (ASC 715), the company recognizes the
overfunded or underfunded status of each of its defined benefit pension and OPEB as an asset or
liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The funded status of the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans for 2009 and
2008 is on the following page:

Net actuarial losses recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” at December
31, 2009, for the company’s U.S. pension, international pension and OPEB plans are being amortized
on a straight-line basis over approximately 11, 13 and 10 years, respectively. These amortization
periods represent the estimated average remaining service of employees expected to receive benefits
under the plans. These losses are amortized to the extent they exceed 10 percent of the higher of
the projected benefit obligation or market-related value of plan assets. The amount subject to
amortization is determined on a plan-by-plan basis. During 2010, the company estimates actuarial
losses of $318, $102 and $26 will be amortized from “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” for U.S.
pension, international pension and OPEB plans, respec-

tively. In addition, the company estimates an
additional $220 will be recognized from “Accumulated
other comprehensive loss” during 2010 related to lump-sum settlement costs from U.S. pension plans.

The weighted average amortization period for recognizing prior service costs (credits)
recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” at December 31, 2009, was approximately eight
and 12 years for U.S. and international pension plans, respectively, and eight years for other
postretirement benefit plans. During 2010, the company estimates prior service (credits) costs of
$(7), $27 and $(74) will be amortized from “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” for U.S. pension,
international pension and OPEB plans, respectively.

Expected Return on Plan Assets

The company’s estimated long-term rates of return on
pension assets are driven primarily by actual historical asset-class returns, an assessment of
expected future performance, advice from external actuarial firms and the incorporation of specific
asset-class risk factors. Asset allocations are periodically updated using pension plan
asset/liability studies, and the company’s estimated long-term rates of return are consistent with
these studies.

There have been no changes in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets since 2002
for U.S. plans, which account for 69 percent of the company’s pension plan assets. At December 31,
2009, the estimated long-term rate of return on U.S. pension plan assets was 7.8 percent.

The market-related value of assets of the major U.S. pension plan used in the determination of
pension expense was based on the market values in the three months preceding the year-end
measurement date, as opposed to the maximum allowable period of five years under U.S. accounting
rules. Management considers the three-month time period long enough to minimize the effects of
distortions from day-to-day market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year.
For other plans, market value of assets as of year-end is used in calculating the pension expense.

Discount Rate

The discount rate assumptions used to determine U.S. and international pension and
postretirement benefit plan obligations and expense reflect the prevailing rates available on
high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments. At December 31, 2009, the company selected a 5.3
percent discount rate for the U.S. pension plan and 5.8 percent for the U.S. postretirement benefit
plan. This rate was based on a cash flow analysis that matched estimated future benefit payments to
the Citigroup Pension Discount Yield Curve as of year-end 2009. The discount rates at the end of
2008 and 2007 were 6.3 percent for the U.S. pension plan and the OPEB plan.

Other Benefit Assumptions

For the measurement of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at
December 31, 2009, for the main U.S. postretirement medical plan, the assumed health care
cost-trend rates start with 7 percent in 2010 and gradually decline to 5 percent for 2018 and
beyond. For this measurement at December 31, 2008, the assumed health care cost-trend rates started
with 7 percent in 2009 and gradually declined to 5 percent for 2017 and beyond. In both
measurements, the annual increase to company contributions was capped at 4 percent.

Assumed health care cost-trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for
retiree health care costs. The impact is mitigated by the 4 percent cap on the company’s medical
contributions for the primary U.S. plan. A one-percentage-point change in the assumed health care
cost-trend rates would have the following effects:

Plan Assets and Investment Strategy

Effective December 31, 2009, the company implemented the
expanded disclosure requirements for the plan assets of defined benefit pension and OPEB plans (ASC
715) to provide users of financial statements with an understanding of: how investment allocation
decisions are made; the major categories of plan assets; the inputs and valuation techniques used
to measure the fair value of plan assets; the effect of fair-value measurements using unobservable
inputs on changes in plan assets for the period; and significant concentrations of risk within plan
assets.

The fair-value hierarchy of inputs the company uses to value the pension assets is divided
into three levels:

FS-55


Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts

Note 21

Employee Benefit Plans - Continued

Level 1: Fair values of these assets are measured using unadjusted quoted prices
for the assets or the prices of identical assets in active markets that the plans have the ability
to access.

Level 2: Fair values of these assets are measured based on quoted prices for similar assets in
active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets; inputs other
than quoted prices that are observable for the asset; and inputs that are derived principally from
or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. If the

asset has a contractual term, the Level 2 input is observable for substantially the full term of
the asset. The fair values for Level 2 assets are generally obtained from third-party broker
quotes, independent pricing services and exchanges.

Level 3: Inputs to the fair value measurement are unobservable for these assets. Valuation may
be performed using a financial model with estimated inputs entered into the model.

The fair value measurements of the company’s pension plans for 2009 are below:

U.S. equities include investments in the company’s common stock in the amount of
$29 at December 31, 2009.


Collective Trusts/Mutual Funds for U.S. plans are entirely index funds; for
International plans, they are mostly index funds. For these index funds, the Level 2
designation is based
on the restriction that advance notification of redemptions, typically two business days, is
required.


Mixed funds are composed of funds that invest in both equity and fixed income
instruments in order to diversify and lower risk.


The year-end valuations of the U.S. real estate assets are based on internal
appraisals by the real estate managers, which are updates of third-party appraisals that occur
at least once
a year for each property in the portfolio.


The “Other” asset category includes net payables for securities purchased but not yet
settled (Level 1); dividends, interest- and tax-related receivables (Level 2); insurance
contracts
and investments in private-equity limited partnerships (Level 3).

Note 21

Employee Benefit Plans - Continued

The primary investment objectives of the pension plans are to achieve the highest
rate of total return within prudent levels of risk and liquidity, to diversify and mitigate
potential downside risk associated with the investments, and to provide adequate liquidity for
benefit payments and portfolio management.

The company’s U.S. and U.K. pension plans comprise 84 percent of the total pension assets.
Both the U.S. and U.K. plans have an Investment Committee that regularly meets during the year to
review the asset holdings and their returns. To assess the plan’s investment performance, long-term
asset allocation policy benchmarks have been established.

For the primary U.S. pension plan, the Chevron Board of Directors has established the
following approved asset allocation ranges: Equities 40-70 percent, Fixed Income and Cash 20-60
percent, Real Estate 0-15 percent, and Other 0-5 percent. For the U.K. pension plan, the U.K. Board
of Trustees has established the following asset allocation guidelines, which are reviewed
regularly: Equities 60-80 percent and Fixed Income and Cash 20–40 percent. The other significant
international pension plans also have established maximum and minimum asset allocation ranges that
vary by plan. Actual asset allocation within approved ranges is based on a variety of current
economic and market conditions and consideration of specific asset category risk. There are no
significant concentrations of risk in plan assets due to the diversification of investment
categories.

The company does not prefund its OPEB obligations.

Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments

In 2009, the company contributed $1,494 and $245 to its
U.S. and international pension plans, respectively. In 2010, the company expects contributions to
be approximately $600 and $300 to its U.S. and international pension plans, respectively. Actual
contribution amounts are dependent upon plan-investment returns, changes in pension obligations,
regulatory environments and other economic factors. Additional funding may ultimately be required
if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations.

The company anticipates paying other postretirement benefits of approximately $208 in 2010,
as compared with $187 paid in 2009.

The following benefit payments, which include estimated future service, are expected to be
paid by the company in the next 10 years:

Employee Savings Investment Plan

Eligible employees of Chevron and certain of its
subsidiaries participate in the Chevron Employee Savings Investment Plan (ESIP).

Charges to expense for the ESIP represent the company’s contributions to the plan, which are
funded either through the purchase of shares of common stock on the open market or through the
release of common stock held in the leveraged employee stock ownership plan (LESOP), which is
described in the section that follows. Total company matching contributions to employee accounts
within the ESIP were $257, $231 and $206 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. This cost was
reduced by the value of shares released from the LESOP totaling $184, $40 and $33 in 2009, 2008 and
2007, respectively. The remaining amounts, totaling $73, $191 and $173 in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively, represent open market purchases.

Employee Stock Ownership Plan

Within the Chevron ESIP is an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP).
In 1989, Chevron established a LESOP as a constituent part of the ESOP. The LESOP provides partial
prefunding of the company’s future commitments to the ESIP.

As permitted by accounting standards for share-based compensation (ASC 718), the debt of the
LESOP is recorded as debt, and shares pledged as collateral are reported as “Deferred compensation
and benefit plan trust” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the Consolidated Statement of Equity.

The company reports compensation expense equal to LESOP debt principal repayments less
dividends received and used by the LESOP for debt service. Interest accrued on LESOP debt is
recorded as interest expense. Dividends paid on LESOP shares are reflected as a reduction of
retained earnings. All LESOP shares are considered outstanding for earnings-per-share computations.

Total credits to expense for the LESOP were $3, $1 and $1 in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. The net credit for the respective years was composed of credits to compensation
expense of $15, $15 and $17 and charges to interest expense for LESOP debt of $12, $14 and $16.

Of the dividends paid on the LESOP shares, $110, $35 and $8 were used in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively, to service LESOP debt. No contributions were required in 2009, 2008 or 2007 as
dividends received by the LESOP were sufficient to satisfy LESOP debt service.

FS-57

Shares held in the LESOP are released and allocated to the accounts of plan

Benefit Plan Trusts

Prior to its acquisition by Chevron, Texaco established a benefit plan
trust for funding obligations under some of its benefit plans. At year-end 2009, the trust
contained 14.2 million shares of Chevron treasury stock. The trust will sell the shares or use the
dividends from the shares to pay benefits only to the extent that the company does not pay such
benefits. The company intends to continue to pay its obligations under the benefit plans. The
trustee will vote the shares held in the trust as instructed by the trust’s beneficiaries. The
shares held in the trust are not considered outstanding for earnings-per-share purposes until
distributed or sold by the trust in payment of benefit obligations.

Prior to its acquisition by Chevron, Unocal established various grantor trusts to fund
obligations under some of its benefit plans, including the deferred compensation and supplemental
retirement plans. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, trust assets of $57 and $60, respectively, were
invested primarily in interest-earning accounts.

Employee Incentive Plans

Effective January 2008, the company established the Chevron Incentive Plan
(CIP), a single annual cash bonus plan for eligible employees that links awards to corporate, unit
and individual performance in the prior year. This plan replaced other cash bonus programs, which
primarily included the Management Incentive Plan (MIP) and the Chevron Success Sharing program. In
2009 and 2008, charges to expense for cash bonuses were $561 and $757, respectively. In 2007,
charges to expense for MIP were $184 and charges for other cash bonus programs were $431. Chevron
also has the LTIP for officers and other regular salaried employees of the company and its
subsidiaries who hold positions of significant responsibility. Awards under the LTIP consist of
stock options and other share-based compensation that are described in Note 20, on page FS-51.

Note 22

Other Contingencies and Commitments

Income Taxes

The company calculates its income tax expense
and liabilities quarterly. These liabilities generally are subject
to audit and are not finalized with the individual taxing
authorities until several years after the end of the annual period for which income taxes have been calculated. Refer to

Note 15 beginning on page FS-46 for a
discussion of the periods for which tax returns have been audited for the company’s major tax
jurisdictions and a discussion for all tax jurisdictions of the differences between the amount of
tax benefits recognized in the financial statements and the amount taken or expected to be taken in
a tax return. The company does not expect settlement of income tax liabilities associated with
uncertain tax positions will have a material effect on its results of operations, consolidated
financial position or liquidity.

Guarantees

The company’s guarantee of approximately $600 is associated with certain payments under
a terminal use agreement entered into by a company affiliate. The terminal is expected to be
operational by 2012. Over the approximate 16-year term of the guarantee, the maximum guarantee
amount will be reduced over time as certain fees are paid by the affiliate. There are numerous
cross-indemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of any
amounts paid under the guarantee. Chevron has recorded no liability for its obligation under this
guarantee.

Indemnifications

The company provided certain indemnities of contingent liabilities of Equilon and
Motiva to Shell and Saudi Refining, Inc., in connection with the February 2002 sale of the
company’s interests in those investments. The company would be required to perform if the
indemnified liabilities become actual losses. Were that to occur, the company could be required to
make future payments up to $300. Through the end of 2009, the company paid $48 under these
indemnities and continues to be obligated for possible additional indemnification payments in the
future.

The company has also provided indemnities relating to contingent environmental liabilities
related to assets originally contributed by Texaco to the Equilon and Motiva joint ventures and
environmental conditions that existed prior to the formation of Equilon and Motiva or that occurred
during the period of Texaco’s ownership interest in the joint ventures. In general, the
environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to
December 2001. Claims had to be asserted by February 2009 for Equilon indemnities and must be
asserted no later than February 2012 for Motiva indemnities. Under the terms of these indemnities,
there is no maximum limit on the amount of potential future payments. In February 2009, Shell
delivered a letter to the company purporting to preserve unmatured claims for certain Equilon
indemnities. The letter itself provides no estimate of the ultimate claim amount. Management does
not believe this letter or any other information provides a basis to estimate the amount, if any,
of a range of loss or potential range of loss with respect to either
the Equilon or the Motiva indemnities. The company posts no assets as collateral and has made no
payments under the indemnities.

FS-58


Note 22

Other Contingencies and Commitments - Continued

The amounts payable for the indemnities described in the preceding paragraph are to be net of
amounts recovered from insurance carriers and others and net of liabilities recorded by Equilon or
Motiva prior to September 30, 2001, for any applicable incident.

In the acquisition of Unocal, the company assumed certain indemnities relating to contingent
environmental liabilities associated with assets that were sold in 1997. The acquirer of those
assets shared in certain environmental remediation costs up to a maximum obligation of $200, which
had been reached at December 31, 2009. Under the indemnification agreement, after reaching the $200
obligation, Chevron is solely responsible until April 2022, when the indemnification expires. The
environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to
the sale of the assets in 1997.

Although the company has provided for known obligations under this indemnity that are probable
and reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of
operations in the period in which they are recognized. The company does not expect these costs will
have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity.

Long-Term Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments, Including Throughput and Take-or-Pay
Agreements

The company and its subsidiaries have certain other contingent liabilities relating to
long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay
agreements, some of which relate to suppliers’ financing arrangements. The agreements typically
provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity, drilling rigs, utilities, and
petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the company’s business. The
aggregate approximate amounts of required payments under these various commitments are: 2010 –
$7,500; 2011 – $4,300; 2012 – $1,400; 2013 – $1,400; 2014 – $1,000; 2015 and after – $4,100. A
portion of these commitments may ultimately be shared with project partners. Total payments under
the agreements were approximately $8,100 in 2009, $5,100 in 2008 and $3,700 in 2007.

Environmental

The company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to laws, regulations, private
claims and legal proceedings related to environmental matters that are subject to legal settlements
or that in the future may require the company to take action to correct or ameliorate the effects
on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleum substances, including MTBE, by the
company or other parties. Such contingencies may exist for various sites, including, but not
limited to, federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, refineries, crude-oil fields, service stations, terminals, land development
areas, and mining operations,

whether operating, closed or divested. These future costs are not
fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the
unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the
company’s liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs
are recoverable from third parties.

Although the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and
reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of
operations in the period in which they are recognized. The company does not expect these costs will
have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity. Also, the company does
not believe its obligations to make such expenditures have had, or will have, any significant
impact on the company’s competitive position relative to other U.S. or international petroleum or
chemical companies.

Chevron’s environmental reserve as of December 31, 2009, was $1,700. Included in this balance
were remediation activities at approximately 250 sites for which the company
had been identified as a
 potentially
responsible party or otherwise involved in the remediation by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) or other regulatory agencies under the provisions of the federal Superfund law or
analogous state laws. The company’s remediation reserve for these sites at year-end 2009 was $185.
The federal Superfund law and analogous state laws provide for joint and several liability for all
responsible parties. Any future actions by the EPA or other regulatory agencies to require Chevron
to assume other potentially responsible parties’ costs at designated hazardous waste sites are not
expected to have a material effect on the company’s results of operations, consolidated financial
position or liquidity.

Of the remaining year-end 2009 environmental reserves balance of $1,515, $820 related to the
company’s U.S. downstream operations, including refineries and other plants, marketing locations
(i.e., service stations and terminals), and pipelines. The remaining $695 was associated with
various sites in international downstream ($107), upstream ($369), chemicals ($149) and other
businesses ($70). Liabilities at all sites, whether operating, closed or divested, were primarily
associated with the company’s plans and activities to remediate soil or groundwater contamination
or both. These and other activities include one or more of the following: site assessment; soil
excavation; offsite disposal of contaminants; onsite containment, remediation and/or extraction of
petroleum hydrocarbon liquid and vapor from soil; groundwater extraction and treatment; and
monitoring of the natural attenuation of the contaminants.

The company manages environmental liabilities under specific sets of regulatory requirements,
which in the United

Other Contingencies and Commitments - Continued

States include the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and various state or local regulations. No single remediation site at year-end 2009
had a recorded liability that was material to the company’s results of operations, consolidated
financial position or liquidity.

It is likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities, beyond those
recorded, for environmental remediation relating to past operations. These future costs are not
fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the
unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the
company’s liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs
are recoverable from third parties.

Refer to Note 23 for a discussion of the company’s asset retirement obligations.

Equity Redetermination

For oil and gas producing operations, ownership agreements may provide for
periodic reassessments of equity interests in estimated crude-oil and natural-gas reserves. These
activities, individually or together, may result in gains or losses that could be material to
earnings in any given period. One such equity redetermination process has been under way since 1996
for Chevron’s interests in four producing zones at the Naval Petroleum Reserve at Elk Hills,
California, for the time when the remaining interests in these zones were owned by the U.S.
Department of Energy. A wide range remains for a possible net settlement amount for the four zones.
For this range of settlement, Chevron estimates its maximum possible net before-tax liability at
approximately $200, and the possible maximum net amount that could be owed to Chevron is estimated
at about $150. The timing of the settlement and the exact amount within this range of estimates are
uncertain.

Other Contingencies

Chevron receives claims from and submits claims to customers; trading partners;
U.S. federal, state and local regulatory bodies; governments; contractors; insurers; and suppliers.
The amounts of these claims, individually and in the aggregate, may be significant and take lengthy
periods to resolve.

The company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their operations and may
close, abandon, sell, exchange, acquire or restructure assets to achieve operational or strategic
benefits and to improve competitiveness and profitability. These activities, individually or
together, may result in gains or losses in future periods.

Note 23

Asset Retirement Obligations

In accordance with accounting standards for asset retirement obligations (ASC 410), the
company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation (ARO) when there
is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset and the
liability can be reasonably estimated. The legal obligation to perform the asset retirement
activity is unconditional even though uncertainty may exist about the timing and/or method of
settlement that may be beyond the company’s control. This uncertainty about the timing and/or
method of settlement is factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information
exists to reasonably estimate fair value. The legal obligations associated with the retirement of
the tangible long-lived assets require recognition in certain circumstances including: (1) the
present value of a liability and offsetting asset for an ARO, (2) the subsequent accretion of that
liability and depreciation of the asset, and (3) the periodic review of the ARO liability estimates
and discount rates.

Accounting standards for asset retirement obligations primarily affect the company’s
accounting for crude-oil and natural-gas producing assets. No significant AROs associated with any
legal obligations to retire refining, marketing and transportation (downstream) and chemical
long-lived assets have been recognized, as indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements
prevent estimation of the fair value of the associated ARO. The company performs periodic reviews
of its downstream and chemical long-lived assets for any changes in facts and circumstances that
might require recognition of a retirement obligation.

The following table indicates the changes to the company’s before-tax asset retirement
obligations in 2009, 2008 and 2007:

The excess of replacement cost over the carrying value of inventories for which the Last-In,
First-Out (LIFO) method is used was $5,491 and $9,368 at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
Replacement cost is generally based on average acquisition costs for the year. LIFO (charges)
profits of $(168), $210 and $113 were included in earnings for the years 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.

The company has $4,618 in goodwill on the Consolidated Balance Sheet related to its 2005
acquisition of Unocal. Under the accounting standard for goodwill
(ASC 350), the

company tested this goodwill for impairment during 2009 and concluded no impairment was necessary.

Events subsequent to December 31, 2009, were evaluated until the time of the Form 10-K filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 25, 2010.

Note 25

Assets Held for Sale

At December 31, 2009, the company reported no assets as “Assets held for sale” (AHS) on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2008, $252 of net properties, plant and equipment were
reported as AHS. Assets in this category are related to groups of service stations, aviation
facilities, lubricants blending plants, and commercial and industrial fuels business. These assets
were sold in 2009.

Note 26

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share (EPS) is based upon Net Income Attributable to Chevron Corporation
(“earnings”) less preferred stock dividend requirements and includes the effects of deferrals of
salary and other compensation awards that are invested in Chevron stock units by certain officers
and employees of the company and the company’s share of stock transactions of affiliates, which,
under the applicable accounting rules, may be recorded directly to the company’s retained earnings
instead of net income. Diluted EPS includes the effects of these items as well as the
dilutive effects of outstanding stock options awarded under the company’s stock option programs
(refer to Note 20, “Stock Options and Other
Share-Based Compensation,” beginning on page FS-51).

Table V

Reserve Quantity Information

Reserves Governance

The company has adopted a comprehensive reserves and resource
classification system modeled after a system developed and approved by the Society of Petroleum
Engineers, the World Petroleum Congress and the American Association of Petroleum Geologists. The
system classifies recoverable hydrocarbons into six categories based on their status at the time of
reporting – three deemed commercial and three noncommercial. Within the commercial classification
are proved reserves and two categories of unproved: probable and possible. The noncommercial
categories are also referred to as contingent resources. For reserves estimates to be classified as
proved, they must meet all SEC and company standards.

Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities that geoscience and engineering data
demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future from known
reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. Net
proved reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by others and reflect contractual
arrangements and royalty obligations in effect at the time of the estimate.

Proved reserves are classified as either developed or undeveloped. Proved developed reserves are
the quantities expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and
operating methods.

Due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, estimates of reserves
are subject to change as additional information becomes available.

Proved reserves are estimated by company asset teams composed of earth scientists and engineers. As
part of the internal control process related to reserves estimation, the com-

pany maintains a Reserves Advisory Committee (RAC) that is chaired by the corporate reserves
manager, who is a member of a corporate department that reports directly to the vice chairman
responsible for the company’s worldwide exploration and production activities. The corporate
reserves manager has more than 30 years experience working in the oil and gas industry and a
Master’s of Science in Petroleum Engineering. All RAC members are knowledgeable in SEC guidelines
for proved reserves classification. The RAC manages its activities through two operating
company-level reserves managers. These two reserves managers are not members of the RAC so as to
preserve the corporate-level independence.

The RAC has the following primary responsibilities: provide independent reviews of the business
units’ recommended reserve changes; confirm that proved reserves are recognized in accordance with
SEC guidelines; determine that reserve volumes are calculated using consistent and appropriate
standards, procedures and technology; and maintain the

Corporate Reserves Manual,

which provides
standardized procedures used corporatewide for classifying and reporting hydrocarbon reserves.

During the year, the RAC is represented in meetings with each of the company’s upstream business
units to review and discuss reserve changes recommended by the various asset teams. Major changes
are also reviewed with the company’s Strategy and Planning Committee and the Executive Committee,
whose members include the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. The company’s
annual reserve activity is also reviewed with the Board of Directors. If major changes to reserves
were to occur between the annual reviews, those matters would also be discussed with the Board.

FS-69


Table V

Reserve Quantity Information - Continued

RAC subteams also conduct in-depth reviews during the year of many of the fields that have the
largest proved reserves quantities. These reviews include an examination of the proved-reserve
records and documentation of their alignment with the

Corporate Reserves Manual.

Revised Oil and Gas Reporting

In December 2008, the SEC issued its final rule,

Modernization
of Oil and Gas Reporting

(Release Nos. 33-8995; 34-59192; FR-78). The disclosure requirements under
the final rule became effective for the company with its Form 10-K filing for the year ending
December 31, 2009. The final rule changes a number of oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure
requirements under SEC Regulations S-K and S-X. Subsequently, the FASB updated

Extractive
Industries — Oil and Gas

(Topic 932) to align the oil and gas reserves estimation and disclosure
requirements with the SEC’s final rule.

Among the principal changes in the final rule are requirements to use a price based on a 12-month
average for reserve estimation and disclosure instead of a single end-of-year price; expanding the
definition of oil and gas producing activities to include nontraditional sources such as bitumen
extracted from oil sands; permitting the use of new reliable technologies to establish reasonable
certainty of proved reserves; allowing optional disclosure of probable and possible reserves;
modifying the definition of geographic area for disclosure of reserve estimates and production;
amending

disclosures of proved reserve quantities to include separate disclosures of synthetic oil and gas;
expanding proved undeveloped reserves disclosures, including discussion of proved undeveloped
reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more; and disclosure of the
qualifications of the chief technical person who oversees the company’s overall reserves estimation
process.

Effect of New Rules

The most significant effect of the company’s adopting the new guidance was the
inclusion of Canadian oil sands as synthetic oil in the consolidated companies reserves. As
indicated in Table V, on page FS-72, an additional 460 million BOE were included at year-end 2009.
The synthetic oil reported for affiliated companies represents volumes reclassified from
heavy crude oil to synthetic oil, and does not represent additional reserves. It was
impracticable to estimate the remaining impact of the new rules because of the cost and resources
required to prepare detailed field-level calculations. However, the use of the 12-month average
price had an upward effect on reserves related to production-sharing and variable-royalty contracts
as the 12-month average price for crude oil and

FS-70


Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities

Table V

Reserve Quantity Information - Continued

natural gas for 2009 was lower than the 2009 year-end spot prices applicable under the old
rules. The ability to use new technologies in reserves determination did not impact reserves
significantly, as most reserve additions and revisions were based on conventional technologies.

Proved Undeveloped Reserve Quantities

At the end of 2009, proved undeveloped oil-equivalent
reserves for consolidated companies totaled 3.1 billion barrels. Approximately 58 percent of the
reserves are attributed to natural gas, of which about half were located in Australia in the Other
regions. Crude oil, condensate and NGLs accounted for about 33 percent of the total, with the
largest concentration of these reserves in Africa, Asia and the United States. Synthetic oil
accounted for the balance of the reserves and were located in Canada in the Other regions.

Proved undeveloped reserves of equity affiliates amounted to 1.3 billion oil-equivalent barrels. At
year-end, crude oil, condensate and NGLs represented 58 percent of the total reserves, with the TCO
affiliate accounting for the majority of the amount. Natural gas represented 26 percent of the
total, with over half of these reserves at TCO. The balance is attributed to synthetic oil in
Venezuela in the Other regions.

In 2009, worldwide proved undeveloped oil-equivalent reserves increased by 480 million barrels for
consolidated companies and decreased 19 million barrels for equity affiliates. The largest
increase for consolidated companies was in the Other regions, resulting primarily from initial
recognition of reserves for the Gorgon Project in Australia and addition of synthetic oil
reserves related to Canadian oil sands with adoption of the new definition of oil and gas activity.
Proved undeveloped reserves decreased in Asia, Africa, and the United States, as a result of
development drilling and other activities, which reclassified reserves to proved developed.

Proved undeveloped reserves decreased for affiliated companies. This was primarily associated with
a 146 million barrel reclassification to proved developed as a result of the TCO production
capacity added with the completion of the Sour Gas Injection/Second Generation Plant Projects
(SGI/SGP). The decrease at TCO was partially offset by increased proved undeveloped reserves in
Venezuela and for Angola LNG due to reservoir performance and additional drilling opportunities.

There were no material downward revisions of proved undeveloped reserves for consolidated or
affiliated companies.

Investment to Convert Proved Undeveloped to Proved Developed Reserves

During 2009, investments
totaling about $6.9 billion were made by consolidated companies and equity affiliates to advance
the development of proved undeveloped reserves. In the Africa region, $2.5 billion was expended on
various projects, including offshore development projects in Nigeria and Angola, which advanced
development drilling, and the completion of a Nigerian natural gas processing project. In the Asia
region, expenditures during the year totaled $1.5 billion, which included construction on a gas
processing

facility in Thailand and development drilling at a steam-flood project in Indonesia. In the United
States, expenditures totaled $1.7 billion for three offshore development projects in the Gulf of
Mexico and various smaller development projects. In the Other regions, development expenditures
totaled $1.2 billion for a variety of projects including development activities in Australia and
the United Kingdom.

During
the year, eight major development projects that were placed into service resulted in the
recognition of proved developed reserves.

Proved Undeveloped Reserves for 5 Years or More

Reserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or
more years are a result of several physical factors that affect optimal project development and
execution, such as the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations,
physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing, compression
projects that are pending reservoir pressure declines, and contractual limitations that dictate
production levels.

Proved undeveloped oil-equivalent reserves for consolidated and affiliated companies totaled 4.4
billion barrels at year-end 2009. Of this total, 1.7 billion barrels corresponds to proved
undeveloped

oil-equivalent reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more.

Consolidated companies held approximately 700 million barrels of the proved undeveloped reserves
over five years. In Africa, approximately 400 million barrels were related to deepwater projects
under development. The Asia region held approximately 100 million barrels related to compression
and contract restrictions. The Other regions held about 100 million barrels related to compression
projects in Australia. The balance relates to capacity constraints and various projects in
the United States.

At year end, affiliated companies held about 1.0 billion barrels of proved undeveloped reserves
over five years. TCO accounted for 800 million oil-equivalent barrels of reserves, which was
primarily related to plant capacity limitations. The balance related to capacity limitations at a
synthetic oil project in Venezuela.

Annually,
the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances, such as changes to
development plans, regulations or government policies, which would warrant a revision to reserve
estimates. For 2009, this assessment did not result in any material changes in reserves classified
as proved undeveloped. Over the past three years, the ratio of proved undeveloped reserves to total
proved reserves has ranged between 35 and 39 percent. The consistent completion of major capital
projects has kept the ratio in a narrow range over this time period.

Proved Reserve Quantities

At December 31, 2009, oil-equivalent reserves for the company’s
consolidated operations were 8.3 billion barrels. (Refer to the term “Reserves” on page E-42 for
the definition of oil-equivalent reserves.) Approximately 22 percent of the total reserves were
located

FS-71


Table V

Reserve Quantity Information - Continued

in the United States. For the company’s interests in equity affiliates, oil-equivalent reserves
were 3.0 billion barrels, 80 percent of which were associated with the company’s 50 percent
ownership in TCO.

Aside from the Tengiz Field in the TCO affiliate, no single property accounted for more than 5
percent of the company’s total oil-equivalent proved reserves. About 25 other individual properties
in the company’s portfolio of assets each contained between 1 percent and 5 percent of the
company’s oil-equivalent proved reserves, which in the aggregate accounted for approximately

percent of the company’s total proved reserves. These properties were geographically dispersed,
located in the United States, Canada, South America, West Africa, the Middle East, Southeast Asia,
and Australia.

In the United States, total oil-equivalent reserves at year-end 2009 were 1.8 billion barrels.
California properties accounted for approximately 44 percent of the U.S. reserves, with most
classified as heavy oil. Because of heavy oil’s high viscosity and the need to employ enhanced
recovery methods, the producing operations are capital intensive in nature. Most of the company’s
heavy-oil fields in California employ

a continuous steamflooding process. The Gulf of Mexico region contains about 22 percent of the U.S. reserves,
with liquids representing about 15 percent of reserves. Production operations are mostly offshore
and, as a result, are also capital intensive. Other U.S. areas represent the remaining 34 percent
of U.S. reserves, which are about evenly split between liquids and natural gas. For production of
crude oil, some fields utilize enhanced recovery methods, including water-flood and CO


injection.

For the three years ending December 31, 2009, the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the
following tables are not necessarily indicative of future trends. Apart from acquisitions, the
company’s ability to add proved reserves is affected by, among other things, events and
circumstances that are outside the company’s control, such as delays in government permitting,
partner approvals of development plans, declines in oil and gas prices, OPEC constraints,
geopolitical uncertainties and civil unrest.

The company’s estimated net proved oil and natural gas reserves and changes thereto for the
years 2007, 2008 and 2009 are shown in the following table and on page FS-74.

Reserve Quantity Information - Continued

Noteworthy amounts in the categories of liquids proved-reserve changes for 2007 through 2009
are discussed below:

Revisions

In 2007, net revisions decreased reserves by 146 million barrels for worldwide
consolidated companies and increased reserves by 103 million barrels for equity affiliates. For
consolidated companies, the largest downward net revisions were 89 million barrels in Africa and 54
million barrels in Asia.

In 2008, net revisions increased reserves by 536 million barrels for worldwide consolidated
companies and increased reserves by 267 million barrels for equity affiliates. For consolidated
companies, the largest increase was in the Asia region, which added 574 million barrels. The
majority of the increase was in the Partitioned Zone, as a result of a concession extension, and
Indonesia, due to lower year-end prices. Upward
revisions were also recorded in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan and were mainly associated with the
effect of lower year-end prices on the calculation of reserves associated with production-sharing
and variable-royalty contracts. In Indonesia, reserves increased due mainly to the impact of lower
year-end prices on the reserve calculations for
production-sharing contracts, as well as a result
of development drilling and improved waterflood and steam-flood performance. These increases were
offset by downward revisions in the United States and Other regions. For affiliated companies, the
249 million-barrel increase for TCO was due to the effect of lower year-end prices on the royalty
determination and facility optimization at the Tengiz and Korolev fields.

In 2009, net revisions increased reserves by 355 million barrels for worldwide consolidated
companies and decreased reserves by 187 million barrels for equity affiliates. For consolidated
companies, the largest increase was 460 million barrels in the Other regions due to the inclusion
of synthetic oil related to Canadian oil sands. In the United States, reserves increased 63
million barrels as a result of development drilling and performance revisions. The increases were
partially offset by decreases of 121 million barrels in Asia and 46 million barrels in Africa. In
Asia, decreases in Indonesia and Azerbaijan were driven by the effect of higher 12-month average
prices on the calculation of reserves associated with

production-sharing contracts and the effect
of reservoir performance revisions. In Africa, reserves in Nigeria declined as a result of higher
prices on production-sharing contracts and reservoir performance.

For affiliated companies, TCO declined by 184 million-barrels primarily due to the effect of
higher 12-month average prices on royalty determination. For Other affiliated companies, 266
million barrels of heavy crude oil were reclassified to synthetic oil for the activities in
Venezuela.

Improved Recovery

In 2007, improved recovery increased liquids volumes by 20 million barrels
worldwide. No addition was individually significant.

In 2008, improved recovery increased worldwide liquids volumes by 37 million barrels. For
consolidated companies, the largest addition was in the Asia region related to gas reinjection in
Kazakhstan. Affiliated companies increased reserves 10 million barrels due to improved secondary
recovery at Boscan.

In 2009, improved recovery increased liquids volumes by 86 million barrels worldwide.
Consolidated companies accounted for 50 million barrels. The largest addition was related to
improved secondary recovery in Nigeria. Affiliated companies increased reserves 36 million barrels
due to improvements related to the TCO SGI/SGP facilities.

Extensions and Discoveries

In 2007, extensions and discoveries increased liquids volumes by 60
million barrels worldwide. The largest additions were 36 million barrels in the United States,
mainly for the deepwater Tahiti and Mad Dog fields in the Gulf of Mexico.

In 2008, extensions and discoveries increased consolidated company reserves 33 million barrels
worldwide. The United States increased reserves 17 million barrels, primarily in the Gulf of
Mexico. The Africa, Asia, and Other regions increased reserves 16 million barrels with no one
country resulting in additions greater than 5 million barrels.

In 2009, extensions and discoveries increased liquids volumes by 52 million barrels worldwide.
The largest additions were 33 million barrels in Other regions related to the Gorgon Project in
Australia and delineation drilling in Argentina. Africa and the United States accounted for 10
million barrels and 6 million barrels, respectively.

Purchases

In 2007, acquisitions of 316 million barrels for equity affiliates related to the
formation of a new Hamaca equity affiliate in Venezuela.

Sales

In 2007, affiliated company sales of 432 million barrels related to the dissolution of a
Hamaca equity affiliate in Venezuela.

respectively.


Includes reserves disposed of through nonmonetary transactions.

Noteworthy amounts in the categories of natural gas

proved-reserve changes for 2007 through
2009 are discussed below:

Revisions

In 2007, net revisions increased reserves for consolidated companies by 395 BCF and
increased reserves for affiliated companies by 73 BCF. For consolidated companies, net increases of
346 BCF in Asia and 209 BCF in the United States were partially offset by downward revisions of 160
BCF in Africa and Other regions. In the Asia region, drilling activities in Thailand added 360 BCF,
which were partially offset by downward revisions in Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan due to the impact of
higher prices. In the United States, improved reservoir performance for many fields contributed to
the increase with the largest portion in the

mid-continent areas. Decreases in Africa were
primarily due to a 136 BCF downward revision in Nigeria resulting from field performance. The Other
regions had net downward revisions of 19 BCF. A 185 BCF downward revision in Australia due to
drilling results and other smaller declines

were mostly offset by improved reservoir performance in Trinidad and Tobago which added 188 BCF.

TCO had an upward revision of 75 BCF associated with improved reservoir performance and
development activities. This upward revision was net of a negative impact due to higher year-end
prices on royalty determination.

In 2008, net revisions increased reserves for consolidated companies by 1,166 BCF and
increased reserves for affiliated companies by 1,130 BCF. In the Asia region, positive revisions
totaled 1,073 BCF for consolidated companies. Almost half of the increase was attributed to the
Karachaganak Field in Kazakhstan, due mainly to the effects of low year-end prices on the

production-sharing contract and the results of development drilling and improved recovery. Other
large upward revisions were recorded for the Pattani Field in Thailand due to a successful drilling
campaign.

For the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan, an increase of 498 BCF reflected the impacts of lower
year-end prices on royalty determination and facility optimization. Reserves associated

FS-74


Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities

with the Angola LNG project accounted for a majority of the

632 BCF

increase in Other affiliated companies.

In 2009, net revisions increased reserves by 569 BCF for consolidated companies and decreased
reserves by 44 BCF for affiliated companies. For consolidated companies, net increases were 493 BCF
in Asia primarily as a result of reservoir studies in Bangladesh and development drilling in
Thailand. These results were partially offset by a downward revision due to the impact of higher
prices on production-sharing contracts in Myanmar. The United States and Other regions increased
reserves 39 BCF and 33 BCF, respectively. In the United States, development drilling in the Gulf of
Mexico was partially offset by performance revisions in the California and mid-continent areas. In
Other regions, improved reservoir performance and compression in Australia was partially offset by
the effect of higher prices on production-sharing contracts in Trinidad.

For equity affiliates, a downward revision of 237 BCF at TCO was due to the effect of higher
prices on royalty determination and an increase in gas injection for SGI/SGP facilities. This
decline was partially offset by performance and drilling opportunities related to the Angola LNG
project.

Extensions and Discoveries

In 2007, extensions and discoveries accounted for an increase of
518 BCF worldwide. The largest addition was 330 BCF in Bangladesh, the result of drilling
activities. Other additions were not individually significant.

In 2009, worldwide extensions and discoveries of 4,387 BCF were attributed to consolidated
companies. The Gorgon Project in Australia accounted for essentially all of the 4,277 BCF additions
in the Other regions. In Asia, development drilling in Thailand accounted for the majority of the
increase. In the United States, delineation drilling in California accounted for the majority of
the increase.

Purchases

In 2007, purchases of natural gas reserves were 141 BCF for consolidated companies,
which include the acquisition of an additional interest in the Bibiyana Field in Bangladesh.
Affiliated company purchases of 211 BCF related to the formation of a new Hamaca equity affiliate
in Venezuela and an initial booking related to the Angola LNG project.

Sales

In 2007, sales were 76 BCF and 175 BCF for consolidated companies and equity affiliates,
respectively. The affiliated company sales related to the dissolution of a Hamaca equity affiliate
in Venezuela.

In 2009, worldwide sales of 117 BCF were related to consolidated companies. For the Other
regions, the sale of properties in Argentina accounted for 84 BCF. The sale of properties in the
Gulf of Mexico accounted for the majority of the 33 BCF decrease in the United States.

Table VI

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Related to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves

The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, related to the preceding proved
oil and gas reserves, is calculated in accordance with the requirements of the FASB. Estimated
future cash inflows from production are computed by applying

12 month-average prices for oil and
gas to year-end quantities of estimated net proved reserves. Future price changes are limited to
those provided by contractual arrangements in existence at the end of each reporting year. Future
development and production costs are those estimated future expenditures necessary to develop and
produce year-end estimated proved reserves based on year-end cost indices, assuming continuation of
year-end economic conditions, and include estimated costs for asset retirement obligations.
Estimated future income taxes are calculated by applying appropriate year-end statutory tax rates.
These rates reflect allowable deductions and tax credits and are applied to estimated future pretax
net cash flows, less the tax basis of related assets. Discounted future net cash flows are
calculated using 10 percent midperiod discount factors. Discounting requires a year-by-year
estimate of when future expenditures will be incurred and when reserves will be produced.

The information provided does not represent management’s estimate of the company’s expected
future cash flows or value of proved oil and gas reserves. Estimates of proved-reserve quantities
are imprecise and change over time as new information becomes available. Moreover, probable and
possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, are excluded from the calculations. The
arbitrary valuation prescribed by the FASB requires assumptions as to the timing and amount of
future development and production costs. The calculations are made as of December 31 each year and
should not be relied upon as an indication of the company’s future cash flows or value of its oil
and gas reserves. In the following table, “Standardized Measure Net Cash Flows” refers to the
standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows.
