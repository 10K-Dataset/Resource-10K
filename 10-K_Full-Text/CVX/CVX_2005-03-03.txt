General Development of Business

Summary Description of ChevronTexaco

ChevronTexaco
Corporation,


a Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries
and affiliates and provides administrative, financial and
management support to U.S. and foreign subsidiaries that engage
in fully integrated petroleum operations, chemicals operations,
coal mining, power and energy services. The company conducts
business activities in the United States and approximately 180
other countries. Petroleum operations consist of exploring for,
developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; refining
crude oil into finished petroleum products; marketing crude oil,
natural gas and the many products derived from petroleum; and
transporting crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products by
pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car. Chemicals
operations include the manufacture and marketing, by affiliates,
of commodity petrochemicals for industrial uses, and the
manufacture and marketing, by a consolidated subsidiary, of fuel
and lubricating oil additives.

In this report, exploration and production of crude oil, natural
gas liquids and natural gas may be referred to as
“E&P” or “upstream” activities.
Refining, marketing and transportation may be referred to as
“RM&T” or “downstream” activities. A
list of the company’s major subsidiaries is presented on
pages E-4 and E-5 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of
December 31, 2004, ChevronTexaco had more than 56,000
employees (including about 9,300 service station employees).
Approximately 25,000, or 45 percent, of the company’s
employees were employed in U.S. operations.

Overview of Petroleum Industry

Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced
by many factors, and individual petroleum companies have little
control over some of them. Governmental policies, particularly
in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment have a
significant impact on petroleum activities, regulating where and
how companies conduct their operations and formulate their
products and, in some cases, limiting their profits directly.
Prices for crude oil and natural gas, petroleum products and
petrochemicals are determined by supply and demand for these
commodities. The members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) are typically the world’s swing
producers of crude oil, and their production levels are a major
factor in determining worldwide supply. Demand for crude oil and
its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the
conditions of local, national and worldwide economies, although
weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources
also play a significant part. Variations in the components of
refined products sales due to seasonality are not primary
drivers of changes in the company’s overall annual earnings.

Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and
petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and
chemical needs of industry and individual consumers.
ChevronTexaco competes with fully integrated major petroleum
companies, as well as independent and national petroleum
companies for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas
leases and other properties, and for the equipment and labor
required to develop and operate those properties. In its
downstream business, ChevronTexaco also competes with fully
integrated major petroleum companies and other independent
refining and marketing entities in the sale or purchase of
various goods or services in many national and international
markets.

Operating Environment

Refer to pages FS-2 through FS-21 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion
on the company’s current business environment and outlook.


Incorporated
in Delaware in 1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the
company adopted the name Chevron Corporation in 1984 and
ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2001. As used in this report, the
term “ChevronTexaco” and such terms as “the
company,” “the corporation,” “our,”
“we,” and “us” may refer to ChevronTexaco
Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or to
all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated otherwise, it
does not include “affiliates” of
ChevronTexaco — i.e., those companies accounted for by
the equity method (generally owned 50 percent or less) or
investments accounted for by the cost method. All of these terms
are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise
description of any of the separate companies, each of which
manages its own affairs.



Risk Factors

ChevronTexaco is a major fully integrated petroleum company with
a diversified business portfolio, strong balance sheet, and a
history of generating sufficient cash to fund capital and
exploratory expenditures and to pay dividends. Nevertheless,
some inherent risks could materially impact the company’s
financial results of operations or financial condition.

ChevronTexaco is exposed to the effects of changing
    commodity prices.

ChevronTexaco is primarily in a commodities business with a
history of price volatility. The single largest variable that
affects the company’s results of operations is crude oil
prices. Except in the ordinary course of running an integrated
petroleum business, ChevronTexaco does not seek to hedge its
exposure to price changes. A significant, persistent decline in
crude oil prices may have a material adverse effect on its
results of operations and its capital and exploratory
expenditure plans.

The scope of ChevronTexaco’s business will decline if
    the company does not successfully develop resources.

The company is in an extractive business; therefore, if
ChevronTexaco is not successful in replacing the crude oil and
natural gas it produces with good prospects for future
production, the company’s business will decline. Creating
and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many
factors, including obtaining rights to explore, develop and
produce hydrocarbons in promising areas, drilling success,
ability to bring long lead-time, capital intensive projects to
completion on budget and schedule, and efficient and profitable
operation of mature properties.

The company’s operations could be disrupted by
    natural or human factors.

ChevronTexaco operates in both urban areas and remote and
sometimes inhospitable regions. The company’s operations
and facilities are therefore subject to disruption from either
natural or human causes, including hurricanes, earthquakes,
floods, civil unrest, fires and explosions, any of which could
result in suspension of operations, or harm to people or the
natural environment.

ChevronTexaco’s business subjects the company to
    liability risks.

The company produces, transports, refines and markets materials
with potential toxicity, and it purchases, handles and disposes
of other potentially toxic materials in the course of the
company’s business. ChevronTexaco operations also produce
byproducts, which may be considered pollutants. Any of these
activities could result in liability, either as a result of an
accidental, unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions
on the effects of the company’s operations on human health
or the environment.

Political instability could harm ChevronTexaco’s
    business.

The company’s operations, particularly exploration and
production, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and
political environments in the various countries in which it
operates. As has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by
host governments to increase public ownership of the
company’s partially– or wholly owned businesses,
and/or to impose additional taxes or royalties.

In certain locations, host governments have imposed
restrictions, controls and taxes, and in others, political
conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of
employees and the company’s continued presence in those
countries. Internal unrest, acts of violence or strained
relations between a host government and the company or other
governments may affect the company’s operations. Those
developments have, at times, significantly affected the
company’s related operations and results, and are carefully
considered by management when evaluating the level of current
and future activity in such countries. At December 31,
2004, approximately 27 percent of the company’s proved
reserves were located in Kazakhstan. The company also has
significant interests in Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC)-member countries



including Indonesia, Nigeria and Venezuela. Approximately
25 percent of the company’s net proved reserves,
including affiliates, were located in OPEC countries at
December 31, 2004.

ChevronTexaco Strategic Direction

ChevronTexaco’s primary objective is to achieve sustained
financial returns from its operations that will enable it to
outperform its competitors. The company set a goal to generate
the highest total stockholder return (based on a combination of
stock price appreciation and reinvested dividends) among a
designated peer group for the five-year period 2000-2004. BP,
ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell – among the
world’s largest publicly traded integrated petroleum
companies – comprised the company’s designated
competitor peer group for this purpose. For the five years
ending December 31, 2004, ChevronTexaco tied one other
company in the peer group for the highest total stockholder
return.

As a foundation for attaining this goal, the company had
established four key priorities, which continue into 2005:

Supporting these four priorities is a focus on:

•

Organizational Capability:

Having the right
    people, processes and culture to achieve and sustain
    industry-leading performance in the four primary areas described
    above.

The company’s long-term strategies for its largest
businesses build on this framework and focus on balancing
financial returns and growth. The strategies for upstream
(exploration and production) are to grow profitability in core
areas, build new legacy positions, and commercialize the
company’s natural gas equity resource base by targeting
North American and Asian markets. The primary strategy for
downstream (refining, marketing and transportation) is to
continue to improve returns by focusing on areas of market and
supply strength.

(b)

Description of Business and Properties

The upstream and downstream activities of the company are widely
dispersed geographically. The company has operations in North
America, South America, Europe, Africa, Middle East, Central and
Far East Asia, and Australia. Besides the large upstream and
downstream businesses, the company’s other comparatively
smaller business segment is chemicals, which is conducted by the
company’s 50 percent-owned affiliate –
Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem) – and
the wholly owned Chevron Oronite Company (Chevron Oronite).
CPChem has operations in the United States, Puerto Rico,
Singapore, China, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Mexico and
Belgium. Chevron Oronite is a fuel and lubricating-oil additives
business that owns and operates facilities in the United States,
France, the Netherlands, Singapore and Japan and has equity
interests in facilities in India and Mexico.

ChevronTexaco also owns an approximate 25 percent equity
interest in the common stock of Dynegy Inc. (Dynegy), an energy
provider engaged in power generation, gathering and processing
of natural gas, and the fractionation, storage, transportation
and marketing of natural gas liquids. The company holds an
additional investment in Dynegy preferred stock. Refer to page
FS-11 and Note 8 on page FS-36 for further information
relating to the company’s investment in Dynegy.

Tabulations of segment sales and other operating revenues,
earnings, income taxes for the three years ending
December 31, 2004, and assets as of the end of each
year — for the United States and the company’s
major international geographic areas — may be found in
Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements beginning
on page FS-36 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In
addition, similar comparative data for the company’s
investments in and income from equity affiliates and property,
plant and equipment are contained in Notes 14 and 15 on
pages FS-39 to FS-41.



Capital and Exploratory Expenditures

A discussion of the company’s capital and exploratory
expenditures is contained on pages FS-12 and FS-13 of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Petroleum — Exploration and Production

The following table summarizes the company’s and
affiliates’ net production of liquids and natural gas
production for 2004 and 2003.



Net
Production


of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Liquids and Natural Gas


Net production excludes royalty interests owned by others.


Barrels of oil-equivalent (BOE) is crude oil and natural
    gas liquids plus natural gas converted to oil-equivalent gas
    (OEG) barrels at 6 MCF = 1 OEG barrel.


The company sold its interest in the Democratic Republic of the
    Congo in mid-2004.


Located between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the State of
    Kuwait.


The company sold its interest in Papua New Guinea and resigned
    operatorship of the Kutubu, Gobe and Moran oil fields in 2003.


Affiliates include Tengizchevroil (TCO) in Kazakhstan and
    Hamaca in Venezuela.


Includes natural gas consumed on lease of 343 and
    333 million cubic feet per day in 2004 and 2003,
    respectively.


Does not include other produced volumes:

In 2004, ChevronTexaco conducted its exploration and production
operations in the United States and approximately 25 other
countries. Worldwide oil-equivalent production in 2004,
including volumes produced from oil sands and production under
an operating service agreement, declined approximately
5 percent from 2003. The decline was largely the result of
lower production in the United States due to normal field
declines, property sales and curtailments as a result of damages
to producing operations from hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico in
September 2004. International oil-equivalent production was down
marginally between years. Refer to the “Results of
Operations” section beginning on page FS-6 for a detailed
discussion of the factors explaining the 2002-2004 changes in
production for crude oil and natural gas liquids and natural gas.

For the past six years, the company’s worldwide
oil-equivalent production, including the volumes produced from
oil sands and production under an operating service agreement,
has followed a downward trend. Production in 2004 was
85 percent of 1998 levels, equivalent to an average annual
decline rate of about 3 percent. For 2005, the company
again expects worldwide oil-equivalent production to be lower.
Increases internationally in 2005 are not expected to fully
offset lower rates in the United States, which the company
projects will result largely from normal field declines and the
absence of production associated with property sales. The actual
level of worldwide production in 2005 remains uncertain for
reasons including the potential for constraints imposed by OPEC,
and disruptions caused by weather, local civil unrest and other
factors. Production capacity in the 2006-2008 period may permit
the worldwide oil-equivalent production level to increase from
that expected in 2005. Refer to the “Review of Ongoing
Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas”
beginning on page 11 for a discussion of the company’s
major oil and gas development projects.

Acreage

At December 31, 2004, the company owned or had under lease
or similar agreements undeveloped and developed oil and gas
properties located throughout the world. The geographical
distribution of the company’s acreage is shown in the
following table.

Acreage


at December 31, 2004

(Thousands of Acres)


Gross acreage includes the total number of acres in all tracts
    in which the company has an interest. Net acreage is the sum of
    the company’s fractional interests in gross acreage.


Developed acreage is spaced or assignable to productive wells.
    Undeveloped acreage is acreage where wells have not been drilled
    or completed to permit commercial production and that may
    contain undeveloped proved reserves. The gross undeveloped acres
    that will expire in 2005, 2006 and 2007 if production is not
    established are 10,573, 7,062 and 3,374, respectively.



Refer to Table IV on page FS-62 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K for data about the company’s average sales
price per unit of oil and gas produced, as well as the average
production cost per unit for 2004, 2003 and 2002. The following
table summarizes gross and net productive wells at year-end 2004
for the company and its affiliates.

Productive Oil and Gas Wells at December 31, 2004


Includes wells producing or capable of producing and injection
    wells temporarily functioning as producing wells. Wells that
    produce both oil and gas are classified as oil wells.


Gross wells include the total number of wells in which the
    company has an interest. Net wells include wholly owned and the
    sum of the company’s fractional interests in gross wells.

Reserves

Table V, beginning on page FS-63, sets forth the
company’s proved net oil and gas reserves, by geographic
area, as of December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. Also, refer
to Table V for a discussion of major changes to proved reserves
by geographic area for 2004. During 2004, the company provided
oil and gas reserves estimates for 2003 to the Department of
Energy, Energy Information Agency. Such estimates are consistent
with and do not differ more than 5 percent from the
information furnished to the SEC in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K. During 2005, the company will file estimates of
oil and gas reserves with the Department of Energy, Energy
Information Agency, consistent with the reserve data reported in
Table V.

Contract Obligations

The company sells crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids
from its producing operations under a variety of contractual
arrangements. Most contracts generally commit the company to
sell quantities based on production from specified properties,
but certain gas sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and
determinable quantities.

In the United States, the company is contractually committed to
deliver to third parties and affiliates approximately
180 billion cubic feet of natural gas through 2007 from
United States reserves. The company believes it can satisfy
these contracts from quantities available from production of the
company’s proved developed U.S. reserves. These
contracts include variable-pricing terms.



Outside the United States, the company is contractually
committed to deliver to third parties approximately
700 billion cubic feet of natural gas through 2007 from
Australian, Canadian, Colombian and Philippine reserves. The
sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas that are
generally referenced to the prevailing market price for crude
oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of
delivery and that in some cases consider inflation or other
factors.

The company believes it can satisfy these contracts from
quantities available from production of the company’s
proved developed Australian, Colombian and Philippine reserves.
The company plans to meet its Canadian contractual delivery
commitments through third-party purchases.

Development Activities

Details of the company’s development expenditures and costs
of proved property acquisitions for 2004, 2003 and 2002 are
presented in Table I on page FS-58.

The table below summarizes the company’s net interest in
productive and dry development wells completed in each of the
past three years and the status of the company’s
development wells drilling at December 31, 2004. A
“development well” is a well drilled within the proved
area of a crude oil or natural gas reservoir to the depth of a
stratigraphic horizon known to be productive. “Wells
drilling” includes wells temporarily suspended.

Development Well Activity


Indicates the fractional number of wells completed during the
    year regardless of when drilling was initiated. Completion
    refers to the installation of permanent equipment for the
    production of crude oil or natural gas or, in the case of a dry
    well, the reporting of abandonment to the appropriate agency.


Gross wells include the total number of wells in which the
    company has an interest. Net wells include wholly owned and the
    sum of the company’s fractional interests in gross wells.

Exploration Activities

The following table summarizes the company’s net interests
in productive and dry exploratory wells completed in each of the
last three years and the number of exploratory wells drilling at
December 31, 2004. “Exploratory wells” are wells
drilled to find and produce crude oil or natural gas in unproved
areas and include delineation wells, which are wells drilled to
find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be
productive of crude oil or natural gas in another reservoir or
to extend a known reservoir beyond the proved area.



“Wells drilling” includes wells temporarily suspended.
Refer to the suspended wells discussion in “Litigation and
Other Contingencies” in Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on
page FS-17 and Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies; “Properties, Plant and Equipment” on
pages FS-30 and FS-31 and Note  21, Accounting
for Suspended Exploratory Well Costs beginning on
page FS-45 for further discussion.

The ultimate disposition of these well costs is dependent on one
or more of the following: (1) decisions on additional major
capital expenditures, (2) the results of additional
exploratory drilling that is under way or firmly planned, and
(3) securing final regulatory approvals for development.

Exploratory Well Activity


Indicates the fractional number of wells completed during the
    year regardless of when drilling was initiated. Completion
    refers to the installation of permanent equipment for the
    production of crude oil or natural gas or, in the case of a dry
    well, the reporting of abandonment to the appropriate agency.


Gross wells include the total number of wells in which the
    company has an interest. Net wells include wholly owned and the
    sum of the company’s fractional interests in gross wells.

Details of the company’s exploration expenditures and costs
of unproved property acquisitions for 2004, 2003 and 2002 are
presented in Table I on page FS-58.

Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in
Key Areas

ChevronTexaco’s 2004 key upstream activities, also
discussed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations beginning on
page FS-2, are presented below. The comments include
reference to “net production,” which excludes partner
shares and royalty interests. “Total production”
includes these components. In addition to the activities
discussed, ChevronTexaco was active in other geographic areas,
but these activities were less significant.

The discussion below references the status of proved reserves
recognition for long-lead-time projects not yet on production
and for projects recently placed on production. Reserves are not
discussed for recent discoveries not yet advanced to a project
stage and for production in mature areas.



Consolidated Operations

a)

United States

The United States upstream activities are concentrated in the
Gulf of Mexico, California, Louisiana, Texas, New Mexico and the
Rocky Mountains. Average daily net production during 2004 was
approximately 505,000 barrels of liquids and
1.9 billion cubic feet of natural gas, or
817,000 barrels per day on an oil-equivalent basis. The
company announced plans in 2003 to sell interests in
nonstrategic producing properties in the United States, and
during 2004 substantially all of the larger asset packages were
sold. The effect of these sales on 2004 net oil-equivalent
production was about 30,000 barrels per day. The remaining
properties earmarked for sale are expected to be disposed of
during 2005 and represent less than 1 percent of the
U.S. oil-equivalent production at the end of 2004. Refer to
Table V beginning on page FS-63 for a discussion of
the reserves and different characteristics for the major
U.S. producing areas.

California:

The company has significant production
    in the San Joaquin Valley. In 2004, average daily net
    production was 217,000 barrels of crude oil,
    108 million cubic feet of natural gas and
    4,000 barrels of natural gas liquids, or
    239,000 barrels of daily net production on an
    oil-equivalent basis. Approximately 84 percent of the crude
    oil production is considered heavy oil (typically with API
    gravity lower than 22 degrees).

Gulf of Mexico:

Combining the company’s
    interest in the shelf and deepwater areas and on-shore
    Louisiana, average daily net production rates during 2004 were
    138,000 barrels of crude oil, 815 million cubic feet
    of natural gas and 16,000 barrels of natural gas liquids,
    or approximately 290,000 oil-equivalent barrels daily.

In deepwater, the company has an interest in three significant
    producing fields: Genesis, Petronius and Typhoon. Petronius,
    50 percent-owned and operated, maintained a daily net
    production of 14,000 barrels of crude oil and
    25 million cubic feet of natural gas in 2004.



The 57 percent-owned and operated Genesis averaged daily
net production of approximately 13,000 barrels of crude oil
and 18 million cubic feet of natural gas in 2004. Petronius
production was shut-in for repairs following hurricane damage in
September 2004, and is expected to resume producing in March
2005. Typhoon, which is 50 percent-owned and operated, had
average daily net production of approximately
11,000 barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and
14 million cubic feet of natural gas in 2004, including
production from the Boris Field that utilizes the Typhoon
production facility.

Development continues on the company-operated Perseus and Tahiti
projects, which are not yet on production. The company’s
ownership interests are 50 percent and 58 percent,
respectively. At Perseus, platform rig damage due to the
September 2004 hurricane delayed the estimated completion of the
first producing well until April 2005. A second production well
is scheduled to follow in the first quarter 2006. Average net
production in 2005 from the first Perseus well through the
Petronius facilities is estimated at more than 4,000 net
barrels of oil-equivalent per day after start-up. The initial
booking of proved undeveloped reserves occurred in 2003 and a
reclassification of certain reserves to proved developed will
occur in early 2005, prior to the start of production from the
first well. The Perseus project has an estimated production life
of between six and nine years. At Tahiti, engineering and
equipment procurement was in process during 2004. A successful
well test of the original discovery well was also conducted in
2004. Initial booking of proved undeveloped reserves occurred in
2003, and transfer of certain reserves into the proved developed
category is anticipated in 2008, when first production is
scheduled to begin. Tahiti is expected to have a production life
of 25 years.

In Gulf of Mexico exploration, the company participated in 11
deepwater exploratory wells during 2004 and announced two
discoveries — the 50 percent-owned and operated
Jack prospect and the 17 percent-owned and nonoperated
Tobago prospect. Further evaluation of commercial potential also
continued on the 2003 discovery at the 30 percent-owned and
nonoperated Tubular Bells prospect with additional follow-up
drilling planned for the 2005-to-2006 timeframe. Commercial
appraisal work also continues at the nonoperated
33 percent-owned Great White Field, including an additional
well that is planned in 2005, and at the nonoperated
13 percent-owned Saint Malo discovery. Proved reserves have
not been recognized for these projects. Appraisal drilling also
occurred in 2004 at the 63 percent-owned and operated Blind
Faith. Initial production is expected by early 2008. No proved
reserves have been recognized for this project. The
75 percent-owned and operated Tonga prospect was drilled in
2003 and the data from this well is under evaluation.

In December 2004, the company announced it had finalized a
20-year agreement for regasification capacity at the proposed
Sabine Pass liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal. In November
2004, the company announced it had plans to submit federal and
state permit applications for a regasification terminal to
import LNG located at its Pascagoula Refinery.

Other U.S. Areas:

Outside of California and the Gulf
of Mexico, the company manages operations in the midcontinent
United States extending from the Rockies to southern Texas. In
2004, average daily net production was 130,000 barrels of
crude oil and natural gas liquids and 950 million cubic
feet of natural gas.

Africa

Angola:

ChevronTexaco is the largest producer of
    crude oil and liquefied petroleum gases in Angola. The company
    was the first to produce in the deepwater. Cabinda Gulf Oil
    Company Limited (CABGOC), a wholly owned subsidiary of
    ChevronTexaco, is operator of two concessions, Block 0 and
    Block 14, off the west coast of Angola, north of the Congo
    River. Block 0, in which CABGOC has a 39 percent
    interest, is a 2,155-square-mile concession adjacent to the
    Cabinda coastline. Block 14, in which CABGOC has a
    31 percent interest, is a 1,580-square-mile deepwater
    concession located west of Block 0.

In Block 0, the company operates in two areas – A
    and B – composed of 19 fields producing
    116,000 barrels per day of net liquids in 2004.
    Area A, comprising 13 producing fields, averaged net daily
    production of approximately 78,000 barrels of crude oil and
    1,000 barrels of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) in
    2004. Area B, which is now the combination of areas
    previously known as Area B and Area C, has six
    producing fields and averaged daily net production of
    37,000 barrels of crude oil in 2004. In 2004, the company
    finalized a 20-year extension of its Block 0 concession,
    which will expire in 2030. The Sanha condensate gas utilization
    and Bomboco crude oil project, located in Area B, began
    operations with the installation of facilities and the start of
    production in late 2004. Initial recognition of proved reserves
    was made at the end of 2002. Initial reclassification of
    reserves from proved undeveloped to proved developed occurred in
    2004 and will continue in 2005 and 2006.

In Block 14, net production in 2004 from the Kuito Field,
Angola’s first deepwater producing area, averaged
approximately 18,000 net barrels of crude oil per day. The
development plans for the Benguela, Belize, Lobito and Tomboco
fields in Block 14 were approved in 2003. Phase 1 of
the $2.2 billion project involves the installation of an
integrated drilling and production platform and the development
of the Benguela and Belize fields, projected for first oil in
early 2006. Proved undeveloped reserves for these fields were
booked in 1998. Phase 2 involves the installation of subsea
systems, pipelines and wells for Lobito and Tomboco. Proved
undeveloped reserves for these fields were booked in 2000.
Phase 2 is under construction, with first oil planned for
late 2006. After both phases are completed, maximum total daily
production is estimated at more than 200,000 barrels of
crude oil in 2008. Some proved developed reserves will be
recognized near to the time of first oil. The concession for
these fields will expire in 2027.

The Landana and Tombua fields were discovered in 1997 and 2001,
respectively, and appraisal drilling was done from 1998 through
2002. Proved undeveloped reserves for Tombua and Landana were
booked in 2001 and 2002, respectively. Feasibility studies were
completed in 2004 for the Tombua-Landana development, which is
targeted as the next major capital project for Block 14 and
is currently in front-end engineering. Estimated capital
expenditures for the development exceed $2 billion. Proved
developed reserves will start to be recognized near the time of
first production.

ChevronTexaco has two other concessions in Angola. Block 2,
20 percent-owned and operated, and Block FST, in which
the company has a 16 percent nonoperated interest, had a
combined net production of nearly 6,000 barrels of crude
oil per day in 2004.

The Angola LNG Project is an integrated gas utilization project.
ChevronTexaco and Sonangol, the state oil company of Angola, are
co-leading the project in which the company has a
36 percent interest. Front-end engineering and design work
is expected to start in the first half of 2005.

Chad-Cameroon:

ChevronTexaco is a non-operating partner
in a project to develop oil fields in southern Chad and
transport crude oil by pipeline to the coast of Cameroon for
export. Net daily production in 2004 was 37,000 barrels of
crude oil. All three of the original fields are now on
production. Proved undeveloped reserves were booked in 2000 and
began to be reclassified to proved developed reserves in 2002.
The production life of the field is estimated at 30 years.



ChevronTexaco has a 25 percent interest in the upstream
operations and an approximate 21 percent interest in the
pipeline.

Equatorial Guinea:

ChevronTexaco is a 45 percent
partner and operator of the L Block offshore the Republic
of Equatorial Guinea. The first exploration well, Ballena-1, was
completed in 2003. In the fourth quarter 2004, ChevronTexaco
initiated partial farm-out activities and, if completed, plans
to drill two stratigraphic prospects in Block L.

Libya:

In early 2005, the company was awarded
Block 177 in Libya’s first exploration license round
under the Exploration and Production Sharing Agreement IV.
The company was also made operator of Block 177 with
100 percent equity.

Nigeria:

ChevronTexaco’s principal subsidiary
    in Nigeria, Chevron Nigeria Limited (CNL), operates and holds a
    40 percent interest in 11 concessions, predominantly in the
    onshore and near-offshore regions of the Niger Delta. CNL
    operates under a joint-venture arrangement with the Nigerian
    National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), which owns the remaining
    60 percent interest. ChevronTexaco’s subsidiaries
    Chevron Oil Company Nigeria Limited (COCNL) and Texaco Overseas
    Nigeria Petroleum Company Unlimited (TOPCON) each hold a
    20 percent interest in six additional concessions. TOPCON
    operates these concessions under a joint venture agreement with
    NNPC, which owns the remaining 60 percent interest.
    Effective November 2004, all the rights, duties, obligations,
    assets and liabilities of TOPCON and COCNL were merged into
    CNL.

In 2004, daily net production from the 38 operated fields
    averaged 117,000 barrels of crude oil, 2,000 barrels
    of LPG and 59 million cubic feet of natural gas. Certain
    onshore operations in the western Niger Delta were suspended in
    March 2003 as a result of community disturbance.

Net onshore production capacity of about 45,000 barrels of
oil per day has been shut-in since March 2003. The company has
adopted a phased plan to restore these operations and has taken
initial steps to determine the extent of damage and secure the
properties. The company has begun initial production-resumption
efforts in certain areas. The Abiteye Field, closest to the
Escravos terminal, was returned to production in 2004.
Restoration activities in the remaining fields will continue
through 2006.

In May 2004, ChevronTexaco received a 100 percent
contractor interest under a production-sharing contract
arrangement in OPL (Oil Prospecting License)-247. This agreement
further increased the company’s leading acreage position in
the Nigerian deepwater trend.

The company also continued activities in the deepwater Agbami
development. Significant progress was made toward achieving
final governmental approvals and executing key agreements.
During 2004, the company drilled four development wells. In
early 2005, the Agbami Development had achieved the following
major milestones: conversion of OPL-216 and OPL-217 to OML (Oil
Mining Lease)-127 and OML-128, approval of the Field Development
Plan, award of the floating production, storage, and offloading
unit (FPSO) contract, concurrence on the Unit Agreement and
project funding approval by partners. Proved undeveloped
reserves were recognized for this project in 2002. Prior to the
anticipated production start-up, in 2008, proved undeveloped
reserves would be reclassified to proved developed reserves. The
expected field life is approximately 20 years.
ChevronTexaco’s share of contractor’s interest under
the Agbami production-sharing contract arrangements are
80 percent in OML-127 and approximately 46 percent in
OML-128.

In August 2003, the Aparo discovery on OPL-213 was extended with
a delineation well on OPL-249. The Aparo/ Bonga SW fields
straddle OPL-212, OPL-213 and OPL-249. ChevronTexaco signed an
agreement with the operator of OPL-212 in 2004 to conduct
technical studies in pursuit of a unitized joint development of
the Aparo/ Bonga SW discovery. The timing of recognition of
proved undeveloped reserves will depend on the completion of
these studies and subsequent



unitization. Also on Block OPL-249, which contains the 2003
Nsiko discovery, two additional appraisal wells were drilled in
2004. Both wells confirmed the presence of producible crude oil
over the entire structure.

OPL-222 activities continued in 2004 with the appraisal program
for the greater Usan area and successful drilling of the fifth
and sixth wells. Proved undeveloped reserves were recorded in
2004 for the Usan Field with development planned to enter the
basic engineering phase in 2005. Initial production is estimated
to occur in 2009 before which time certain proved undeveloped
reserves would be reclassified to proved developed reserves. The
company holds a 30 percent interest in this project.

At the Escravos Gas Project (EGP), onshore and offshore
engineering, procurement and construction bids were received in
2003. Bids were reissued in 2004 following a review of the
project design and scope. Start-up is expected in 2008 and
includes adding a second gas plant with 395 million cubic
feet of capacity, which would increase capacity to
680 million cubic feet of natural gas per day and increase
LPG and condensate exports to 43,000 barrels per day.
ChevronTexaco holds a 40 percent interest in this project.

The company is also pursuing a planned gas-to-liquids facility
at Escravos. Lump-sum engineering, procurement and construction
bids for the planned gas-to-liquids facility at Escravos were
opened in May 2004. Construction is expected to begin during
2005, pending finalization of fiscal terms. The project is the
first to use the technology and operational expertise of the
Sasol Chevron global 50-50 joint venture. Project start-up is
expected in 2008. Proved undeveloped reserves associated with
EGP were recognized in 2002. These reserves will be reclassified
to proved developed reserves as various stages of EGP and
related projects are completed.

In November 2004, the company and its partners in the Brass LNG
Project located in Nigeria’s central Niger Delta, awarded
the contract for front-end engineering and design of its
two-train liquefied natural gas facility. The project is
expected to start up in 2010. No proved reserves have been
recognized for this project.

In early 2005, the company announced plans to conduct a
feasibility study on a potential LNG project at Olokola in
southwest Nigeria. Future decisions to move forward with Olokola
LNG will depend on the results of the feasibility study.

Nigeria - São Tomé and Príncipe Joint
Development Zone (JDZ):

The company was awarded
JDZ Block 1 in 2004. In early 2005, the company signed
a production sharing contract with the Joint Development
Authority, under which ChevronTexaco will be the operator with a
51 percent interest.

Republic of Congo:

ChevronTexaco has a 30 percent
interest in Nkossa, Nsoko and Moho-Bilondo exploitation permits
and a 29 percent interest in the Marine VII Kitina and
Sounda exploitation permits, all of which are offshore Republic
of Congo and adjacent to the company’s concessions in
Angola. Net production from the company’s concessions in
the Republic of Congo averaged 12,000 barrels of crude oil
per day in 2004. Assessment of the Moho and Bilondo satellite
fields progressed during 2004, with the drilling of the
MOBIM 1 well. Work is in progress to determine the
development plan for the field.

Southern Africa:

Appraisal drilling is planned in 2005 to
assess the size and commerciality of the successful Lianzi-1
well drilled in the 14K/A-IMI Unit, located between the Republic
of Congo and Angola, in which the company is operator and holds
an approximate 31 percent interest. Timing is uncertain
regarding the recognition of proved reserves.



c)

Asia-Pacific

Australia:

ChevronTexaco has a 17 percent
    interest in the North West Shelf (NWS) Project offshore Western
    Australia. Daily net production from the project during 2004
    averaged 17,000 barrels of condensate, 305 million
    cubic feet of natural gas, 15,000 barrels of crude oil and
    4,000 barrels of liquefied petroleum gas. Approximately
    70 percent of the natural gas was sold, primarily under
    long-term contracts, in the form of LNG to major utilities in
    Japan and South Korea. The remaining natural gas was sold to the
    Western Australia domestic market. The Train 4 LNG
    expansion project completed during 2004 increased LNG capacity
    approximately 50 percent and encompassed the installation
    of a second 80-mile pipeline from the offshore natural gas
    fields to onshore facilities. The first LNG of Train 4 was
    produced in September 2004. A ninth LNG carrier, operated by
    Chevron Transport Corporation Ltd., was added to the
    NWS-controlled fleet. In December, the China Guangdong LNG sales
    purchase agreement became unconditional and the equity agreement
    with China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) was
    completed.

ChevronTexaco operates the crude oil producing facilities on
Barrow and Thevenard Islands, which had combined net crude oil
production of 7,000 barrels per day in 2004. ChevronTexaco
equity interest in this operation is 57 percent for Barrow
Island and 51 percent for Thevenard Island.

ChevronTexaco is the operator of the 57 percent-owned
Gorgon-area fields and has between 50 to 100 percent
interest in other Greater Gorgon fields off the northwest coast
of Australia. The 12 discovered natural gas fields straddle 17
lease blocks in the Greater Gorgon Area. The Gorgon Project is
moving forward on front-end-engineering-and-design feasibility
work, targeting initial production for 2009-2010. Preliminary
gas sales agreements have been signed with CNOOC and with a
planned North American West Coast terminal. Proved reserves have
not been recognized for any of the Gorgon fields and reserves
booking is contingent on securing LNG sales and purchase
agreements and other key project milestones.

In 2004, the company drilled the successful wholly owned
Wheatstone-1 natural gas well located offshore Western
Australia. Production tests were completed in 2004 and the
company is conducting a 3-D seismic program.

Cambodia:

ChevronTexaco operates and holds a
55 percent interest in Block A, located offshore Cambodia
in the Gulf of Thailand, after a 15 percent farm-out during
2004. The concession covers approximately 1.6 million
acres. ChevronTexaco processed more than 600,000 acres of
3-D seismic data and drilled four exploration wells on the
second exploration campaign resulting in four crude oil
discoveries in 2004. The company is evaluating appraisal and
additional exploration opportunities for 2005. Proved reserves
have not been recognized for this project.

China:

ChevronTexaco has a 33 percent interests in
Blocks 16/08 and 16/09, located in the Pearl River Delta
Mouth Basin. Daily net production in 2004 from the eight fields
in these blocks averaged about 10,000 barrels of crude oil.
The company has a 25 percent interest in QHD-32-6 in Bohai
Bay, which had 2004 average net production of about
7,000 barrels of crude oil per day, and a 16 percent
working interest in Bozhong 25-1 unitized development
project in Block 11/19, located in Bohai Bay, which
achieved initial production in August 2004. Average net
production from the field was about 1,000 barrels of crude
oil per day. The company has interest ranging from 64 to
100 percent interest in five prospective natural gas blocks
totaling about 2.7 million acres.



Kazakhstan:

ChevronTexaco holds a 20 percent
    interest in the Karachaganak project. In June 2004, the
    company’s first Karachaganak crude oil was loaded at
    Russia’s Black Sea port at Novorossiysk. Phase 2 of
    the field development, which included construction of gas
    injection and liquids processing facilities and an increase in
    liquids export capacity via the company’s
    15 percent-owned Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) was
    completed in the third quarter 2004. Access for Karachaganak
    production to CPC’s pipeline allows sales of approximately
    150,000 barrels per day of processed liquids
    (28,000 net barrels) to prices available in world markets.
    During 2004, Karachaganak net daily production averaged
    31,000 barrels of liquids and 125 million cubic feet
    of natural gas. Proved developed reserves associated with
    Phase 2 have been added over the 2002-to-2004 timeframe.
    The Karachaganak operations are conducted under a 40-year
    concession agreement that expires in 2038.

Partitioned Neutral Zone (PNZ):

Saudi Arabian Texaco
Inc., a ChevronTexaco affiliate, holds a 60-year concession,
originally signed in 1949, to produce onshore crude oil from the
PNZ, located between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the State
of Kuwait. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the State of Kuwait
each own an undivided 50 percent interest in the PNZ’s
hydrocarbon resources. The company, by virtue of its concession,
has the rights to the Kingdom’s undivided 50 percent
interest in the hydrocarbon resources located in the onshore PNZ
and pays a royalty and other taxes on hydrocarbons produced.
During 2004, average daily net production was
117,000 barrels of crude oil and 20 million cubic feet
of natural gas.

Philippines:

The company holds a 45 percent interest
in the Malampaya natural gas field located about 50 miles
offshore Palawan Island. Malampaya represents the first offshore
production of natural gas in the Philippines. Daily net
production was 131 million cubic feet of natural gas and
7,000 barrels of condensate.

Qatar:

In 2004, Sasol Chevron, ChevronTexaco’s 50-50
global joint venture with Sasol of South Africa, entered into a
memorandum of understanding with Qatar Petroleum to expand the
Oryx gas-to-liquids project and a letter of intent to examine
GTL base oils opportunities in Qatar. Qatar Petroleum and Sasol
Chevron also agreed to pursue an opportunity to develop a
130,000 barrels-per-day integrated gas-to-liquids project.

Thailand:

ChevronTexaco operates Blocks B8/32, 9A
and G4/43 in the Gulf of Thailand. The company holds
approximately a 52 percent interest in Blocks B8/32
and 9A and a 60 percent interest in Block G4/43. The
company also holds a 33 percent interests in exploration
Blocks 7, 8 and 9, which are currently inactive pending
resolution of border issues between Thailand and Cambodia.

Block B8/32 produces crude oil and natural gas from four
fields: Benchamas, Maliwan, North Jamjuree and Tantawan. Daily
net production in 2004 from these fields was 93 million
cubic feet of natural gas and 20,000 barrels of crude oil.
During the year, 72 development wells were drilled and five
wellhead platforms were installed in Block B8/32. In 2004,
the company completed an upgrade of processing capacity at the
Benchamas Field, increasing total capacity to approximately
65,000 barrels of crude oil per day (34,000 net
barrels). Further development of the concession focused on the
North and Central Benchamas Area and the development of the
North Jarmjuree Field, located between the Benchamas and
Tantawan fields. First production at North Jarmjuree was in the
third quarter 2004.

In 2004, the company farmed-out a 25 percent interest in
Block G4/43, reducing its interest to 60 percent. One
exploration well and one appraisal well were drilled
successfully. Environmental surveys, impact assessments for
drilling and 3-D seismic survey acquisition for the first
600,000 acres were completed in 2004.



d)

Indonesia

ChevronTexaco’s interests in Indonesia are managed by two
    wholly owned subsidiaries, P.T. Caltex Pacific Indonesia
    (CPI) and ChevronTexaco Energy Indonesia (CTEI). CPI accounts
    for nearly half of Indonesia’s total crude oil output and
    holds an interest in four production-sharing contracts. CTEI is
    a power generation company that operates the Darajat geothermal
    contract area in West Java and a cogeneration facility in
    support of CPI’s operation in North Duri. In addition to
    the above interests, ChevronTexaco has a 25 percent
    nonoperated interest in South Natuna Sea Block B.

ChevronTexaco’s share of net production during 2004 was
    222,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day in CPI-operated
    areas. The Duri Field in the Rokan Block, under steamflood since
    1985, is the largest steamflood project in the world, with net
    production averaging 120,000 barrels of crude oil per day
    in 2004. ChevronTexaco’s net production from South Natuna
    Sea Block B in 2004 was about 18,000 barrels of
    oil-equivalent per day.

e)

Other International Areas

Argentina:

ChevronTexaco operates in Argentina through
its subsidiary, Chevron San Jorge S.R.L. The company and
its partners hold more than 3.4 million exploration and
production acres in the Neuquén and Austral basins in 19
production concessions (18 operated and one nonoperated) and
seven exploration blocks (five operated and two nonoperated).
Working interests range from approximately 19 percent to
100 percent in operated license areas. Farm-out agreements
are under negotiations in five blocks. Net production in 2004
averaged 56,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day.

Brazil:

ChevronTexaco holds working interests ranging
from 20 percent to 68 percent in five deepwater blocks
totaling 1.5 million acres at year-end 2004. Exploration is
concentrated in the Campos and Santos basins. In 2004, the
National Petroleum Agency approved the company’s plans to
evaluate the discoveries in Block BS-4 and
Block BC-20, with completion expected by year-end 2006. In
the Frade Field, where the company is the operator and has a
43 percent interest, the contract for front-end engineering
design (FEED) for a floating, production, storage and offloading
vessel and subsea systems was awarded in August 2004. Timing of
initial production and booking of reserves is dependent upon
FEED results which are expected in late 2005. No proved reserves
have been recognized for this project.

Canada:

During 2004, the company divested producing
assets in western Canada and sold its wholly owned mid-stream
natural gas processing business. The effect of these sales on
2004 net oil-equivalent production was about 16,000 barrels
per day. The company continues to maintain strategically
significant assets in Canada, including a 27 percent
nonoperated interest in the Hibernia Field; a 20 percent
nonoperated interest in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project, which
is discussed separately on page 26; a 28 percent
operated interest in the Hebron project where feasibility
studies preceding the major development project are continuing;
and exploration opportunities in the Mackenzie Delta and Orphan
Basin. Excluding Athabasca, net daily production in 2004 from
the company’s Canadian operations was 62,000 barrels
of crude oil and natural gas liquids and 51 million cubic
feet of natural gas.

Colombia:

Until the end of 2004, ChevronTexaco operated
three natural gas fields under two related contracts —
the Guajira Association contract and the
Build-Operate-Maintain-Transfer (BOMT) contract. The Guajira
Association Contract, a 50-50 joint venture production-sharing
agreement, expired in December 2004. In 2005, the company
continues to operate the fields and receives 43 percent of
the production for the remaining life of the fields, as well as
continue to operate the BOMT contract until it expires in 2016.
Net natural gas production averaged 210 million cubic feet
per day in 2004.

Denmark:

ChevronTexaco holds a 15 percent interest
in the Danish Underground Consortium (DUC), producing crude oil
and natural gas from 15 fields in the Danish North Sea and
involving 12 percent to 27 percent interest in five
exploration areas. The daily net production from the DUC was
46,000 barrels of crude oil and 130 million cubic feet
of natural gas.



Faroe Islands:

In January 2005, the company was awarded
five offshore exploration blocks in the Faroe Islands second
offshore licensing round. The blocks cover approximately
170,000 acres and are near the recent Rosebank/ Lochnagar
discovery in the United Kingdom. The company has a
40 percent interest and will be operator.

Mexico:

In September 2004, ChevronTexaco was awarded
authorization from the Mexican Environment and Natural Resources
Secretariat for its Environmental Impact Assessment and Risk
Assessment for the construction of a proposed LNG receiving and
regasification terminal offshore Baja California and, in
December, was awarded a natural gas storage permit from the
Mexican Regulatory Energy Commission. Also in 2004, the company
received notice from the Mexican Communication and Transport
Secretariat, through its Port Authority, that it was the winner
of the public licensing round for the offshore port terminal.

Norway:

At the Draugen Field, where ChevronTexaco holds
about an 8 percent interest, the company’s share of
production during 2004 was 11,000 barrels of crude oil per
day.

Russia:

In September 2004, the company and OAO Gazprom
signed a six-month memorandum of understanding to jointly
undertake feasibility studies for the possible implementation of
projects in Russia and the United States. This represents a
possible opportunity to participate in the development of the
vast natural gas and crude oil resource base in Russia and to
develop a close partnership with Russia’s largest natural
gas producer.

Trinidad and Tobago:

The company has a 50 percent
nonoperated interest in four blocks offshore Trinidad. Net
natural gas production in 2004 averaged 135 million cubic
feet per day. In 2005, the company announced the successful
exploration drilling results at the offshore Manatee 1
exploration well in Block 6d. ChevronTexaco operates and
holds a 50 percent interest in the well.

United Kingdom:

In the United Kingdom, the
    company’s total daily net production in 2004 from several
    fields was 106,000 barrels of crude oil and
    340 million cubic feet of natural gas. Daily net production
    at the operated and 85 percent-owned Captain Field was
    56,000 barrels of crude oil. The company’s share of
    net daily production in 2004 at the co-operated and
    32 percent-owned Britannia Field was about
    9,000 barrels of crude oil and 195 million cubic feet
    of natural gas. Development drilling at Britannia is expected to
    continue for several more years. At the Alba Field in the North
    Sea, where ChevronTexaco holds a 21 percent interest and
    operatorship, daily net production averaged 14,000 barrels
    of crude oil and 3 million cubic feet of natural gas. The
    operated and 50 percent-owned Erskine Field had net daily
    crude oil production of 8,000 barrels and net natural gas
    production of 41 million cubic feet.

A crude oil and natural gas discovery was made in the fourth
    quarter 2004 at the offshore 40 percent-owned and operated
    Rosebank/ Lochnagar well (213/27-1Z) in the Faroe-Shetland
    Channel. Further appraisal drilling is planned for 2005.

ChevronTexaco holds a 19 percent interest in Clair, a
nonoperated development. Platform and pipeline installation has
been successfully completed. One well has been pre-drilled, and
over 20 production and water injection wells are to be drilled
and completed between late 2004 and early 2008. Initial
production began in February 2005 and is expected to reach an
average net daily production of 12,000 barrels of crude oil
and 3 million cubic feet of natural gas by 2006. Initial
recognition of proved reserves was in 2001. Some reserves were
reclassified from proved undeveloped to proved developed in late
2004. Further reclassifications will occur through 2008 related
to planned development drilling. Clair has an expected field
life of over 20 years.

Three producing assets, Galley, Orwell and Statfjord fields,
were sold in the first half 2004. The impact of these sales on
2004 U.K. net daily production was 12,000 barrels of crude
oil and 19 million cubic feet of natural gas.

Venezuela:

The company operates the onshore Boscan Field
under an Operating Services Agreement and receives operating
expense reimbursement and capital recovery, plus interest and an
incentive fee. Total production in 2004 averaged



113,000 barrels of crude oil per day. The company also has
production at the 63 percent-owned LL-652 Field located in
Lake Maracaibo. Net production in 2004 averaged
10,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day. The company
operates at LL-652 under a risked service agreement.

The company also has exploration activity in two blocks offshore
Plataforma Deltana. In Block 2, which includes Loran Field,
two exploratory wells were drilled successfully in 2004. Proved
reserves have not been recognized for this project. The company
is operator and holds a 60 percent interest in
Block 2. Also in August 2004, the company was awarded
a license for Block 3, for which the company will be
operator and holds a 100 percent interest. An exploration
program for Block 3 is planned for 2005.

f)     Affiliate Operations

Kazakhstan:

The company holds a 50 percent interest
in Tengizchevroil (TCO), which is developing the Tengiz and
Korolev crude oil fields located in western Kazakhstan, under a
40-year concession that expires in 2033. Net oil-equivalent
production averaged 178,000 barrels per day in 2004.

TCO is currently undertaking a significant expansion composed of
two integrated projects referred to as the Sour Gas
Injection (SGI)/Second Generation Project (SGP). At a total
cost in excess of $4 billion, the expansion is designed to
increase TCO’s crude oil production capacity from
298,000 barrels per day to between 430,000 and
500,000 barrels per day by late 2006, depending on the
final effects of the SGI.

SGP involves the construction of a large processing train for
treating crude oil and the associated sour gas. The SGP design
is based on the same conventional technology employed in the
existing processing trains. In addition to new processing
capacity, SGP involves drilling and/or completing 55 production
wells in the Tengiz and Korolev reservoirs to generate the
volumes required for the new processing train. Proved
undeveloped reserves associated with SGP were recognized in
2001. Some of these reserves were reclassified to proved
developed in 2004 based upon completion of certain project
milestones. Over the next decade, ongoing field development is
expected to result in the maturation of the current proved
undeveloped reserves to proved developed.

SGI involves taking a portion of the rich, sour gas separated
from the crude oil production at the SGP processing train and
re-injecting it into the Tengiz and Korolev reservoirs.
ChevronTexaco expects that SGI will have two key effects. First,
SGI will reduce the sour gas processing capacity otherwise
required at SGP, thereby increasing liquid production capacity
and lowering the quantities of sulfur and gas that would
otherwise be generated. Second, over time it is expected that
SGI will increase production efficiency and recoverable volumes
due to the maintenance of higher reservoir pressure from the gas
re-injection. Between 2006 and 2008, the company anticipates
recognizing additional proved reserves associated with the SGI
expansion. The primary SGI risks include uncertainties about
compressor performance associated with injecting high-pressure
sour gas and subsurface responses to injection.

Essentially all of TCO’s production is exported through the
CPC pipeline that runs from Tengiz in Kazakhstan to tanker
loading facilities at Novorossiysk on the Russian coast of the
Black Sea. CPC, which is expected to be expanded in stages
through the end of 2008, is anticipated to fully accommodate TCO
expansion volumes by the end of 2007. TCO is currently pursuing
alternate transportation routes to accommodate expansion volumes
prior to the end of 2007 as necessary.

Venezuela:

ChevronTexaco has a 30 percent interest
in the Hamaca heavy oil production and upgrading project located
in Venezuela’s Orinoco Belt. The crude oil upgrading began
in October 2004. The facility is expected to reach design
capacity in the first quarter 2005 to process
190,000 barrels per day of heavy crude oil (8.5° API)
and upgrade into 180,000 barrels of lighter, higher-value
crude oil (26° API). In 2004, net production averaged
24,000 barrels of crude oil per day.

Petroleum — Sale of Natural Gas and Natural Gas
Liquids

The company sells natural gas and natural gas liquids from its
producing operations under a variety of contractual
arrangements. Outside the United States, the majority of the
company’s natural gas sales occur in the United Kingdom,
Australia, Canada, Latin America, and in the company’s
affiliate operations in Kazakhstan. International natural gas
liquids sales take place in the company’s Canadian upstream
operations, with lower sales levels in Africa, Australia and
Europe. Refer to “Selected Operating Data” on page
FS-10 in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations for further information on
the company’s natural gas and natural gas liquids sales
volumes.



Petroleum — Refining Operations

Distillation operating capacity utilization in 2004, adjusted
for sales and closures, averaged 91 percent in the United
States (including asphalt plants) and 89 percent worldwide
(including affiliates), compared with 91 percent in the
United States and 88 percent worldwide in 2003.
ChevronTexaco’s capacity utilization at its U.S. fuels
refineries (i.e., excluding asphalt plants) averaged
96 percent in 2004, compared with 95 percent in 2003.
Capacity utilization at the company’s wholly owned
U.S. cracking and coking facilities, which are the primary
facilities used to convert heavier products to gasoline and
other light products, averaged 89 percent and
85 percent in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The company
processed imported and domestic crude oil in its
U.S. refining operations. Imported crude oil accounted for
about 81 percent and 75 percent of
ChevronTexaco’s U.S. refinery inputs in 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

In July 2004, the company acquired an additional interest in the
Singapore Refining Company Pte. Ltd. (SRC), increasing ownership
from 33 percent to 50 percent. The additional interest
in SRC is expected to strengthen the company’s existing
strategic position in the Asia-Pacific area, one of the
company’s core markets.

The company’s U.S. West Coast and Gulf Coast
refineries produce low sulfur fuels that meet 2006 federal
government specifications. Investments required to produce low
sulfur fuels in Europe and Canada were completed by the end of
2004 while clean fuel projects in South Africa and Australia are
scheduled to be completed in 2005.

The daily refinery inputs over the last three years for the
company and affiliate refineries are shown in the following
table.

(Inputs and Capacities in Thousands of Barrels per Day)


ChevronTexaco sold its interest in the El Paso Refinery in
    August 2003.


Refineries in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, and Portland, Oregon, are
    primarily asphalt plants.


ChevronTexaco ceased refining operations at the Batangas
    Refinery in November 2003 in advance of the refinery’s
    conversion into a finished-product terminal.


ChevronTexaco ceased refining operations at the Panama and
    Guatemala refineries in July 2002 and September 2002,
    respectively. The Guatemala facility was converted to terminal
    operations in 2002. The Panama facility was converted to a
    terminaling facility in 2003.


ChevronTexaco increased its ownership interest in the Singapore
    Refining Company Pte. Ltd. from 33 percent to
    50 percent in July 2004. This increased the company’s
    share of operable capacity at December 31, 2004 by about
    48,000 barrels per day.



Petroleum — Sale of Refined Products

Product Sales:

The company markets petroleum products
throughout much of the world. The principal brands for
identifying these products are “Chevron,”
“Texaco” and “Caltex.”

The following table shows the company’s and

In the United States, the company markets under the Chevron and
Texaco brands. The company supplies directly or through
retailers and marketers almost 9,000 branded motor vehicle
retail outlets, concentrated in the southern, eastern,
southwestern and western states. Approximately 700 of the
outlets are company-owned or -leased stations. By the end of the
year, the company was supplying more than 1,000 Texaco retail
sites, primarily in the Southeast. The Company plans to supply
additional sites in the Southeast and West during 2005.

Outside of the United States, ChevronTexaco supplies directly or
through retailers and marketers approximately 16,700 branded
service stations, including affiliates, in nearly
90 countries. In Canada, primarily in British Columbia, the
company markets under the Chevron brand name. In Europe, the
company has marketing operations under the Texaco brand in the
United Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg
and the Canary Islands. In West Africa, the company operates or
leases to retailers in Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire,
Nigeria, Republic of Congo, Togo and Benin. In these regions,
the company mainly uses the Texaco brand name. The company also
operates across the Caribbean, Central America, and South
America, with a significant presence in Brazil, using the Texaco
brand name. In the Asia-Pacific region, Southern, Central and
East Africa, Egypt, and Pakistan, ChevronTexaco uses the Caltex
brand name.

The company also operates through affiliates under various brand
names. In Denmark and Norway, the company operates through its
50 percent-owned affiliate, HydroTexaco, using the Y-X and
Uno-X brands. In the United Arab Emirates, the company operates
through its 40-percent-owned Emirates Petroleum Products Co.
joint venture, using the EPPCO brand. In South Korea, the
company operates through its 50-percent-owned affiliate,
LG Caltex, using the LG Caltex brand. This brand name
will become GS Caltex effective March 31, 2005. The
company’s 50-percent-owned affiliate in Australia operates
primarily using the Caltex brand.



Throughout 2004, the company continued the marketing and sale of
service station sites. Worldwide, dispositions totaling nearly
1,600 sites occurred as part of a decapitalization program in
2003 and 2004. In most cases, current sales volumes will
continue through branded sales agreements.

In addition to the above activities, the company manages other
marketing businesses globally. In global aviation fuel
marketing, the company markets 500,000 barrels per day of
aviation fuel in 80 countries, representing a worldwide
market share of about 12 percent. The company is the
leading marketer of jet fuels in the United States.
ChevronTexaco markets an extensive line of lubricant products in
about 170 countries.

Petroleum — Transportation

Pipelines:

ChevronTexaco owns and operates an extensive
system of crude oil, refined products, chemicals, natural gas
liquids and natural gas pipelines in the United States. The
company also has direct or indirect interests in other U.S. and
international pipelines. The company’s ownership interests
in pipelines are summarized in the following table.

Pipeline Mileage at December 31, 2004


Partially owned pipelines are included at the company’s
    equity percentage.


Includes gathering lines related to the transportation function.
    Excludes gathering lines related to the U.S. and international
    production activities.

The Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) operates a crude oil
export pipeline from the Tengiz Field in Kazakhstan to the
Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk. At the end of 2004, CPC
had 10 transportation agreements in place and was
transporting 550,000 barrels of crude oil per day from the
Caspian region. Russian crude oil entered CPC in late 2004, and
is forecasted to rise to about 120,000 barrels per day
during 2005, bringing the pipeline capacity to
670,000 barrels per day.

The pipeline system is expandable to 1.4 million barrels
per day with additional pump stations and tanks. CPC is in the
initial planning stages of expanding the system. Expansion is
expected to be completed in phases, with a total cost estimated
at $2 billion. Full build-out to 1.4 million barrels
per day is currently scheduled to be complete by the end of 2008
with additional planned capacity to begin operating in 2006 and
2007. ChevronTexaco has a 15 percent ownership interest in
CPC.



Tankers:

ChevronTexaco’s controlled seagoing fleet
at December 31, 2004, is summarized in the following table.
All controlled tankers were utilized in 2004. In addition, at
any given time, the company has approximately 70 vessels
under a voyage basis or as time charters of less than one year.

Federal law requires that cargo transported between
U.S. ports be carried in ships built and registered in the
United States, owned and operated by U.S. entities and
manned by U.S. crews. At year-end 2004, the company’s
U.S. flag fleet was engaged primarily in transporting
refined products between the Gulf Coast and the East Coast, and
from California refineries to terminals on the West Coast and in
Alaska and Hawaii.

The international flag vessels were engaged primarily in
transporting crude oil from the Middle East, Indonesia, Mexico
and West Africa to ports in the United States, Europe and Asia.
Refined products also were transported by tanker worldwide.

In addition to the vessels described above, the company owns a
one-sixth interest in each of seven liquefied natural gas
(LNG) tankers transporting cargoes for the North West Shelf
(NWS) project in Australia. In early 2004, the company
assumed full operatorship of one of the tankers, the

Northwest Swan,

on behalf of the project’s
participants. Additionally, the NWS project has two LNG tankers
under long-term time charter.

The Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 requires the scheduled
phase-out, by year-end 2010, of all single-hull tankers trading
to U.S. ports or transferring cargo in waters within the
U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone. This has raised the demand
for double-hull tankers. By the end of 2004, ChevronTexaco had a
total of 18 company-operated double-hull tankers in
operation. The company is a member of many oil-spill-response
cooperatives in areas around the world in which it operates.

Chemicals

Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem) is a
50-50 joint venture with ConocoPhillips Corporation. CPChem
owns or has joint venture interests in 32 manufacturing
facilities and six research and technical centers in the
United States, Puerto Rico, Belgium, China, Mexico, Saudi
Arabia, Singapore, South Korea and Qatar.

In 2004, along with its Saudi partner, CPChem secured approvals
to proceed with construction of an integrated, world-scale
styrene facility, along with the expansion of an existing,
adjacently located aromatics plant in Al Jubail, Saudi
Arabia. This $1.2 billion project is scheduled for
completion in the first half of 2008.

Also during 2004, CPChem continued the development of the
Q-Chem II and Ras Laffan ethylene projects in Qatar. Final
approvals by the project partners for this world-scale olefins
and polyolefins development are expected in 2005.

ChevronTexaco’s Oronite brand fuel and lubricant additives
business is a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of
performance additives for fuels and lubricating oils. The
company owns and operates facilities in the United States,
France, the Netherlands, Singapore and Japan and has equity
interests in facilities in India and Mexico. In January 2005,
the company announced it is closing its manufacturing plant in
Brazil. The closure is expected to be completed by the end of
2005.



Coal

The company’s coal mining and marketing subsidiary, The
Pittsburg & Midway Coal Mining Co. (P&M), owned and
operated two surface mines, McKinley, in New Mexico, and
Kemmerer, in Wyoming, and one underground mine, North River, in
Alabama, at year-end 2004. In addition, final reclamation
activities were under way at the York Canyon and Farco mines,
located in New Mexico and Texas, respectively. P&M also
owns an approximate 30 percent interest in Inter-American
Coal Holding N.V., which has interests in coal mining
operations in Venezuela as well as in trading and transportation
activities.

Sales of coal from P&M’s wholly owned mines and from
its affiliates were 14.6 million tons, an increase of
9 percent from 2003. The increase was primarily a result of
higher production at P&M’s surface mine located near
Gallup, New Mexico.

At year-end 2004, P&M controlled approximately
167 million tons of developed and undeveloped coal
reserves, including reserves of environmentally desirable
low-sulfur coal. The company is contractually committed to
deliver approximately 14 million tons of coal per year
through the end of 2006 and believes it can satisfy these
contracts from existing coal reserves.

Synthetic Crude Oil

In Canada, ChevronTexaco holds a 20 percent nonoperating
interest in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project (AOSP). Bitumen is
extracted from oil sands and upgraded into synthetic crude oil
using hydroprocessing technology. The integrated operation at
AOSP commenced in 2003 with ramp-up of production continuing in
2004. Total 2004 bitumen production averaged
134,000 barrels per day (about 27,000 net barrels). At
full capacity in 2005, AOSP is expected to reach total
production of 155,000 barrels per day.

Global Power Generation

ChevronTexaco’s Global Power Generation (GPG) has more
than 20 years experience in developing and operating
commercial power projects. With 13 power assets located in the
United States and Asia, GPG manages the production of more than
3,300 megawatts of electricity in its facilities. All of the
facilities are owned through joint ventures. The company
operates efficient gas-fired cogeneration facilities, some of
which produce steam for use in upstream operations to facilitate
production of heavy oil.

Gas-to-Liquids

The 50-50 Sasol Chevron Global Joint Venture was established in
October 2000 to develop a worldwide gas-to-liquids
(GTL) business. In Nigeria, construction for the planned
gas-to-liquids facility at Escravos is expected to begin in
2005, pending finalization of fiscal terms. Projects to build
GTL plants are being considered for Qatar and Australia.

Research and Technology

The company’s Energy Technology Company delivers integrated
technologies and services to the upstream, downstream and
gas-based businesses. These activities include deepwater
exploration and production systems, reservoir management and
optimization, heavy oil recovery and upgrading, shallow-water
production operations, gas-to-liquids processing, improved
refining processes, and safe, incident-free plant operations.

Additionally, ChevronTexaco’s Technology Ventures Company
focuses on identification, growth and commercialization of
emerging technologies that have the potential to transform how
energy is produced or consumed. The range of business spans
early-stage investing of venture capital in emerging
technologies to developing joint venture companies in new energy
systems, such as hydrogen infrastructure, advanced battery
systems, nano-materials and renewable energy applications.

ChevronTexaco’s research and development expenses were
$242 million, $228 million and $221 million for
the years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.



Because some of the investments the company makes in the areas
described above are in new or unproven technologies and business
processes, ultimate success is not certain. Although not all
initiatives may prove to be economically viable, the
company’s overall investment in this area is not
significant to the company’s consolidated financial
position.

Environmental Protection

Virtually all aspects of the company’s businesses are
subject to various federal, state and local environmental,
health and safety laws and regulations. These regulatory
requirements continue to change and increase in both number and
complexity and to govern not only the manner in which the
company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells.
ChevronTexaco expects more environmental-related regulations in
the countries where it has operations. Most of the costs of
complying with the many laws and regulations pertaining to its
operations are embedded in the normal costs of conducting its
business.

In 2004, the company’s U.S. capitalized environmental
expenditures were $145 million, representing approximately
5 percent of the company’s total consolidated
U.S. capital and exploratory expenditures. These
environmental expenditures include capital outlays to retrofit
existing facilities, as well as those associated with new
facilities. The expenditures are predominantly in the petroleum
segment and relate mostly to air-and-water quality projects and
activities at the company’s refineries, oil and gas
producing facilities, and marketing facilities. For 2005, the
company estimates U.S. capital expenditures for
environmental control facilities will be approximately
$240 million. The future annual capital costs of fulfilling
this commitment are uncertain and will be governed by several
factors, including future changes to regulatory requirements.

Further information on environmental matters and their impact on
ChevronTexaco and on the company’s 2004 environmental
expenditures, remediation provisions and year-end environmental
reserves are contained in Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on
pages FS-15 to FS-16, and on page FS-18 of this Annual Report on

Evaluation of
Disclosure Controls and Procedures

ChevronTexaco Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer and
    Chief Financial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of
    the company’s “disclosure controls and
    procedures” (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
    15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
    “Exchange Act”)), as of December 31, 2004, have
    concluded that as of December 31, 2004, the company’s
    disclosure controls and procedures were effective and designed

Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The company’s management is responsible for establishing
    and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
    reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act
    Rule 13a-15(f). The company’s management, including
    the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
    conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal
    control over financial reporting based on the

Internal
    Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. Based on the results of this evaluation, the
    company’s management concluded that its internal control
    over financial reporting was effective as of December 31,
    2004.

The company management’s assessment of the effectiveness of
    its internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2004 has been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included
    herein.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND OUTLOOK

As shown in the “Special Items” table, net special gains of $1.2 billion, associated mainly with
the disposition of non-strategic upstream assets, benefited income in 2004. In 2002, $2.3 billion
of the $3.3 billion of net charges related to the company’s investment in its Dynegy Inc. affiliate. Refer to page FS-11 for a discussion of the company’s investment in Dynegy.

The special
items recorded in 2002 through 2004 are not indicative of any future trends of events or their
impact on future earnings. Because of the nature of special item-related events, the company may
not always be able to anticipate their occurrence or associated effects on income in any period.
Apart from the effects of special-item gains and charges, the company’s earnings depend largely on
the profitability of its upstream – exploration and production – and downstream – refining,
marketing and transportation – business segments. The single largest variable that affects the
company’s results of operations is crude oil prices. Overall earnings trends are typically less
affected by results from the company’s commodity chemicals segment and other activities and
investments.

The company’s long-term competitive position, particularly given the capital-intensive
and commodity-based nature of the industry, is closely associated with the company’s ability to
invest in projects that provide adequate financial returns and to manage operating expenses
effectively. Creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors, including
obtaining rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons in promising areas, drilling success,
the ability to bring long-lead-time capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and
schedule, and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties.

The company also continuously evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not key to
providing sufficient long-term value and to acquire assets or operations complementary to its
asset base to help sustain the company’s growth. In addition to the asset-disposition and
restructuring plans announced in 2003, which generated $3.7 billion of sales proceeds in 2004,
other such plans may also occur in future periods and result in significant gains or losses. Refer
to the “Operating Developments” section on page FS-4 for a discussion that includes references to
the company’s asset disposition activities.

FS-2


Comments related to earnings trends for the company’s major business areas are as follows:

Upstream

Year-to-year changes in exploration and production earnings align most closely with industry price
levels for crude oil and natural gas. Crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external
factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global
economic conditions, industry inventory levels, production quotas imposed by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), weather-related damages and disruptions, competing fuel
prices, and regional supply interruptions that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest
or political uncertainty. Moreover, any of these factors could also inhibit the company’s
production capacity in an affected region. The company monitors developments closely in the
countries in which it operates and holds investments and attempts to manage risks in operating its
facilities and business. Longer-term trends in earnings for this segment are also a function of
other factors besides price fluctuations, including changes in the company’s crude oil and natural
gas production levels and the company’s ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude
oil and natural gas reserves.

The level of operating expenses associated with the efficient
production of oil and gas can also be subject to external factors beyond the company’s control.
External factors include not only the general level of inflation but also prices charged by the
industry’s product- and service-providers, which can be affected by the volatility of the
industry’s own supply and demand conditions for such products and services. Operating expenses can
also be affected by uninsured damages to production facilities caused by severe weather or civil
unrest.

Industry price levels for crude oil reached record highs during 2004. For example, the price for
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, one of the benchmark crudes, reached $55 per barrel in
October 2004. WTI prices for the full year averaged $41 per barrel, an increase of approximately
$10 per barrel from 2003. The WTI spot price per barrel at the end of February 2005 was
approximately $51. These relatively high industry prices reflected, among other things, increased
demand from higher economic growth, particularly in Asia and the United States, the heightened
level of geopolitical uncertainty in many areas of the world, crude oil supply concerns in the
Middle East and other key producing regions, and production shut in for repairs following Hurricane
Ivan in the Gulf of Mexico in September 2004.

During most of 2004, the differential in prices
between high quality, light-sweet crude oils, such as the U.S. benchmark

WTI, and the heavier crudes was unusually wide. The upward trend in prices in 2004 for lighter
crude oils tracked the increased demand for light products, as all refineries could process these
higher quality crudes. However, the demand and price for the heavier crudes were dampened due to
the limited number of refineries that are able to process this lower quality feedstock. The
company produces heavy crude oil (including volumes under an operating service agreement) in
California, Indonesia, the Partitioned Neutral Zone (between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait) and
Venezuela.

Natural gas prices, particularly in the United States, were also higher in 2004 than in 2003.
Benchmark prices in 2004 for Henry Hub U.S. natural gas peaked in October 2004 above $8.50 per
thousand cubic feet (MCF). For the full year, prices averaged nearly $6.00 per MCF, compared with
$5.50 in 2003. At the end of February 2005, the Henry Hub spot price was about $6.10 per MCF.

As compared with the supply and demand factors for natural gas in the United States and the
resultant trend in the Henry Hub benchmark prices, certain other regions of the world in which the
company operates have significantly different supply, demand and regulatory circumstances,
typically resulting in significantly lower average sales prices for the company’s production of
natural gas. (Refer to the table on page FS-10 for the company’s average natural gas prices for the
United States and international regions.) Additionally, excess supply conditions that exist in
certain parts of the world cannot easily serve to mitigate the relatively high-price conditions in
the United States and other developed markets because of lack of
infrastructure and the difficulties in transporting natural gas.

To help address this regional imbalance between supply and demand for natural gas, ChevronTexaco
and other companies in the industry are planning increased investments in long-term projects in
areas of excess supply to install infrastructure to produce and liquefy natural gas for transport
by tanker and additional investment to regasify the product in markets where demand is strong and
supplies are not as plentiful. Due to the

FS-3


Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

significance
of the overall investment in these long-term projects, the natural gas sales prices in the areas of
excess supply (before the natural gas is transferred to a company-owned or third-party processing
facility) are expected to remain well below sales prices for natural gas that is produced much
nearer to areas of high demand and that can be transported in existing natural gas pipeline
networks (as in the United States).

Partially offsetting the benefit of higher crude oil and natural gas prices in 2004 was a 5
percent decline in the company’s worldwide oil-equivalent production from the prior year, including
volumes produced from oil sands and production under an operating service agreement. The decrease
was largely the result of lower production in the United
States due to normal field declines, property sales and production curtailments resulting from
damages to producing operations caused by Hurricane Ivan. International oil-equivalent production
was down marginally between years. Refer also to pages FS-7 for additional discussion and detail of
production volumes worldwide.

The level of oil-equivalent production in future periods is uncertain, in part because of OPEC
production quotas and the potential for local civil unrest and changing geopolitics that could
cause production disruptions. Approximately 25 percent of the company’s net oil-equivalent
production in 2004, including volumes produced from oil sands and under an operating service
agreement, was in the OPEC-member countries of Indonesia, Nigeria and Venezuela and in the
Partitioned Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Although the company’s production level
during 2004 was not constrained in these areas by OPEC quotas, future production could be affected
by OPEC-imposed limitations. Future production levels also are affected by the size and number of
economic investment opportunities and, for new large-scale projects, the time lag between initial
exploration and the beginning of production. Refer to pages FS-4 through FS-6 for discussion of the
company’s major upstream projects.

In certain onshore areas of Nigeria, approximately 45,000 barrels per day of the company’s net
production capacity has been shut in since March 2003 because of civil unrest and damage to
production facilities. The company has adopted a phased plan to restore these operations and has
begun production-resumption efforts in certain areas.

As a result of Hurricane Ivan in September
2004, production in the fourth quarter was about 60,000 barrels per day lower than it otherwise
would have been. Damages to producing facilities are expected to restrict oil-equivalent production
in the first quarter 2005 by approximately 35,000 barrels per day. Most of the remaining shut-in
production is expected to be restored in the second quarter of 2005.

Downstream

Refining, marketing and transportation earnings are closely tied to regional demand for
refined products and the associated effects on industry refining and marketing margins. The
company’s core marketing areas are the West Coast of North America, the U.S. Gulf Coast, Latin
America, Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

Specific factors influencing the company’s profitability in this segment include the operating
efficiencies and expenses of the refinery network, including the effects of any downtime due to
planned and unplanned maintenance, refinery upgrade

projects and operating incidents. The level
of operating expenses can also be affected by the volatility of charter expenses for the company’s
shipping operations, which are driven by the industry’s demand for crude-oil tankers. Factors
beyond the company’s control include the general level of inflation, especially energy costs to
operate the refinery network.

Downstream earnings improved in 2004 compared with the prior year, primarily as a result of
increased demand and higher margins for the industry’s refined products in most of the areas in
which the company and its equity affiliates have operations. In 2004, refined-product margins in
North America and Asia were at their highest level in recent years. Industry margins may be
volatile in the future, depending primarily on price movements for crude oil feedstocks, the demand
for refined products, inventory levels, refinery maintenance and mishaps, and other factors.

Chemicals

Earnings in the petrochemicals segment are closely tied to global chemical demand,
inventory levels and plant capacities. Additionally, feedstock and fuel costs, which tend to follow
crude oil and natural gas price movements, influence earnings in this segment.

Earnings improved
in 2004 compared with 2003 primarily from the results of the company’s 50 percent-owned Chevron
Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem) affiliate, which recorded higher margins and sales volumes
for commodity chemicals and higher equity affiliate income.

OPERATING DEVELOPMENTS

Key operating developments and other events during 2004 and early 2005 included:

Upstream

North America

During 2004, the company closed on the sale of more than

300 producing properties and
other assets in the United States and Canada, generating proceeds of $2.5 billion. These sales, which accounted for
less than 10 percent of the oil-equivalent production and reserves in North America, were part of
plans announced in 2003 to dispose of assets that did not provide sufficient long-term value to
the company and to improve the overall competitive performance and operating efficiency of the
company’s exploration and production portfolio.

In the Gulf of Mexico, the company awarded two
major engineering contracts for the development of subsea systems and a floating production
facility to advance the development of the operated and 58 percent-owned Tahiti prospect, a major
deepwater discovery. A successful well test of the original discovery well was also conducted in
2004. Elsewhere in the

FS-4


Gulf of Mexico, a deepwater crude oil discovery was announced at the operated and 50 percent-owned
Jack prospect in Walker Ridge Block 759.

Angola

In late 2004, first production was achieved at the Block 0 Sanha Bomboco project, which
will help reduce natural-gas flaring.

Australia

In mid-2004, the company announced a natural gas
discovery at the wholly owned Wheatstone-1 well located offshore Western Australia. Production
tests were completed in the third quarter 2004, and in early 2005 the company was evaluating
development options.

Cambodia

In January 2005, the company announced crude oil discoveries at four exploration wells in
offshore Block A. ChevronTexaco is the operator of the block and holds a 55 percent interest.

China

In August 2004, initial crude oil production occurred at the 16 percent-owned BZ 25-1 Field,
located in Bohai Bay. Crude oil production also began late in 2004 at the HZ 19-3 Field, in which
the company has a 33 percent working interest.

Faroe Islands

In January 2005, the company was
awarded five offshore exploration blocks in the Faroe Islands’ second offshore licensing round.
The blocks are near the earlier Rosebank/Lochnagar discovery in the United Kingdom. The company
has a 40 percent interest and will be the operator.

Kazakhstan

The company’s first crude oil from Karachaganak Field was loaded at Russia’s Black Sea
port of Novorossiysk in mid-2004. This represented the first shipment of Karachaganak crude oil
through the Caspian Pipeline Consortium export pipeline that provides access to world markets.

Construction continued during 2004 by the company’s 50 percent-owned Tengizchevroil affiliate on
Sour Gas Injection (SGI)/Second Generation Project (SGP), which is expected to increase total
production from the current capacity of 298,000 barrels of crude oil per day to between 430,000 and
500,000 barrels per day by the end of 2006, with the expansion dependent upon the success of the
SGI.

Libya

In early 2005, the company was awarded onshore Block 177 in Libya’s first exploration
license round under the Exploration and Production Sharing Agreement IV terms. The company was also
made operator of the block with 100 percent equity. The events mark the company’s return to Libya
after a 28-year absence.

Nigeria

At the deepwater Agbami project, several milestones were achieved
in 2004, including initial development drilling in the third quarter, and reaching a unitization
agreement with other owners in the area. In early 2005, a contract for the construction of a floating production, storage and offshore loading platform was awarded. The project is being
unitized, and the company’s equity will be about 68 percent.

The company was awarded a 100 percent contractor interest in the deepwater Nigeria Block OPL-247 in
the eastern part of the Niger Delta in the second quarter 2004. Block 247 is adjacent to Block 222,
which includes the company’s Usan and Ukot discoveries.

In the third quarter 2004, the company
announced a crude oil discovery at the Usan 5 well. Additionally, in early 2005, hydrocarbons were
encountered at the Usan 6 appraisal well. ChevronTexaco holds a 30 percent interest in the wells,
both of which are located in OPL-222.

Nigeria — São Tomé and Príncipe Joint Development Zone (JDZ)

The company was awarded the right in
early 2004 to conduct exploration activities in deepwater Block 1 in the JDZ, offshore São Tomé and
Príncipe and Nigeria. In early 2005, the company signed a production-sharing contract with the
Joint

Development Authority, under which ChevronTexaco will be the operator with a 51 percent interest in
the block.

Southern Africa

The company announced a discovery in the deepwater area between Angola
and the Republic of Congo at the Lianzi-1 exploration well in the third quarter 2004. The
discovery, in the shared 14K/A-IMI Unit, is located in the same area as the previous Block 14
deepwater crude oil discoveries at Landana and Tombua in Angola. ChevronTexaco is the operator of
the 14K/A-IMI Unit and holds about a 31 percent interest.

Russia

In September 2004, the company and OAO Gazprom signed a six-month memorandum of
understanding to jointly undertake feasibility studies for the possible implementation of projects
in Russia and the United States. This represents a possible opportunity to participate in the
development of the vast natural gas and crude oil resource base in Russia and to develop a close
partnership with Russia’s largest natural gas producer.

Thailand

The company announced successful exploration and appraisal drilling results in mid-2004 at
Block G4/43, located in the Gulf of Thailand. Block G4/43 is adjacent to the company’s operated and
52 percent-owned Block B8/32.

Trinidad and Tobago

In early 2005, the company announced successful exploration drilling results at
the offshore Manatee 1 exploration well in Block 6d. ChevronTexaco operates and holds a 50 percent
interest in this well.

United Kingdom

In the third quarter 2004, production of first crude oil occurred at the 21
percent-owned Alba Extreme South Phase 2 project. Alba Field is located in Block 16/26, northeast
of Aberdeen. In the fourth quarter, a crude oil and natural gas discovery was made at the offshore
40 percent-owned Rosebank/Lochnagar well (213/27-1Z) in the Faroe-Shetland Channel.

Venezuela

In August 2004, the company was awarded an exploration license and 100 percent interest
for Block 3 in Plataforma Deltana, an offshore area on Venezuela’s Atlantic continental shelf. The
exploration rights added to the company’s existing Block 2 license in Venezuela and Block 6d in
Trinidad and Tobago, across the border with Venezuela. Two exploration wells were successful during
2004 in the operated and 60 percent-owned Plataforma Deltana Block 2.

The company completed onshore
construction of the 30 percent-owned Hamaca Project’s crude oil upgrading facility. This facility
has the capacity to process 190,000 barrels per day of heavy crude oil and upgrade into 180,000
barrels per day of lighter higher-value crude oil. Upgrading began in October 2004.

Global Natural

Gas Projects

In Qatar, Sasol Chevron, ChevronTexaco’s 50-50 global joint venture with Sasol of
South Africa, entered into a memorandum of understanding with Qatar Petroleum to expand the Oryx
gas-to-liquids project and a letter of intent to examine GTL base oils opportunities in Qatar.
Qatar Petroleum and Sasol Chevron also agreed to pursue an opportunity to develop a
130,000-barrel-per-day integrated gas-to-liquids project.

In Australia, the North West Shelf Venture began commissioning of a fourth LNG train in September
2004. This increased the venture’s LNG production capacity by approximately 50 percent during 2004.
ChevronTexaco holds a one-sixth interest in the joint venture.

The company announced in the fourth quarter 2004 an agreement with other shareholders of the West
African Gas Pipeline Co. Ltd. to move forward with the construction of a pipeline to be used for
the transportation of natural gas more than 400 miles from Nigeria to customers in Ghana, Benin and
Togo.

In early 2005, the company announced plans to conduct a feasibility study on a potential liquefied
natural gas (LNG) project at Olokola in southwest Nigeria. Future decisions to move

FS-5


Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

forward with
Olokola LNG will depend on the results of the feasibility study.

In November 2004, ChevronTexaco and its partners in the Brass LNG Project awarded the contract for
front-end engineering and design for a world-scale LNG plant to be located in Nigeria. The LNG
plant will have two processing trains with potential processing capacity of 5 million metric tons
each. ChevronTexaco is expected to supply a major amount of feed gas to the LNG project.

In Angola, front-end engineering and design work is scheduled to begin in the first half of 2005
for the construction of a multibillion dollar LNG processing plant that also will help eliminate
natural gas flaring associated with crude oil producing operations. The company has a 36 percent
ownership interest in the plant and will co-lead the project with the Angolan government’s national
oil company.

In September 2004, the company was awarded authorization from the Mexican Environment
and Natural Resources Secretariat for its Environmental Impact Assessment and Risk Assessment for a
proposed LNG receiving and regasification terminal offshore Baja California, Mexico. In December
2004, the company was awarded a natural gas storage permit from the Mexican Regulatory Energy
Commission for a proposed natural gas terminal. The company also received notice from the Mexican
Communication and Transport Secretariat, through its Port Authority, that it won the public
licensing round for the offshore port terminal.

In November 2004, the company announced it had plans to submit permit applications for a proposed
LNG import terminal to be located at the company’s Pascagoula Refinery.

In December 2004, the company announced the finalization of a 20-year agreement for regasification capacity at the proposed Sabine Pass LNG terminal in Louisiana.

Downstream

Worldwide Reorganization

In early 2004, the company’s downstream businesses began operating as
global refining, marketing, and supply and trading businesses. Previously, these functions were
aligned by the individual geographic areas in which the company operates. This realignment is
targeted to improve operating efficiencies and financial performance.

Singapore Joint Venture

In
July 2004, the company acquired an additional interest in the Singapore Refining Company Pte. Ltd. (SRC),
increasing its ownership from 33 percent to 50 percent. This
additional interest in SRC is expected to strengthen ChevronTexaco’s existing strategic position in
the Asia-Pacific area, one of its core markets.

China Joint Venture

In January 2005, the company announced a preliminary agreement for a business
partner in China to take a majority interest in the company’s existing joint venture that operates
retail service stations in South China.

Asset Dispositions

Throughout 2004, the company continued the marketing and sale of service station
sites. Dispositions of about 1,600 sites occurred from the program’s inception in early 2003
through the end of 2004. In February 2005, the company announced a memorandum of understanding to
negotiate the sale of approximately 140 service stations in the United Kingdom.

Texaco Brand

Under terms of an agreement executed at the time of the merger with Texaco, the
company regained non-

exclusive rights to use the Texaco brand in the United States on July 1, 2004,
and resumed marketing gasoline under the Texaco retail brand in the United States in mid-2004. By
the end of the year, the company was supplying more than 1,000 Texaco retail sites, primarily in
the Southeast. The company plans to supply additional sites in the Southeast and West during 2005.

Chemicals

Saudi Arabia

The company’s 50 percent-owned affiliate, CPChem, began construction of an integrated
styrene facility and expansion of an adjacent aromatics plant at Al Jubail, Saudi Arabia, in the
fourth quarter 2004. The project is scheduled for completion in the first half of 2008.

Other

Common Stock Dividends and Stock Repurchase Program

In September 2004, the company increased its
quarterly common stock dividend by 10 percent and immediately followed the dividend increase with a
two-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend. In connection with a stock repurchase
program initiated in April 2004, the company purchased 42,324,000 shares in the open market for
$2.1 billion through December. Purchases through the end of February 2005 increased the total
shares acquired to 47,969,000 shares for $2.4 billion. The repurchase program is in effect for up
to three years from the date initiated for acquisitions of up to $5 billion.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Major Operating Areas

The following section presents the results of operations for the company’s
business segments, as well as for the departments and companies managed at the corporate level.
(Refer to Note 9 beginning on page FS-36 for a discussion of the company’s “reportable segments,”
as defined in FAS 131,

“Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.”

) To
aid in the understanding of changes in segment income between periods, the discussion, when
applicable, is in two parts – first, on underlying trends and second, on special-item gains and
charges that tended to obscure these trends. In the following discussions, the term “earnings” is
defined as net income or segment income before the cumulative effect of changes in accounting
principles. This section should also be read in conjunction with the discussion of the company’s
“Business Environment and Outlook” on pages FS-2 through FS-4.

Income from continuing operations in 2004 of nearly $3.9 billion was about $700 million higher than
in 2003. Nearly $400 million of the increase represented the difference in the effect on earnings
in the respective periods from special
items, which are discussed below. The remaining $300 million improvement was composed of about a $1
billion benefit from higher crude oil and natural gas prices that was largely offset by the
effects of lower production.

Income from continuing operations in 2003 was about $3.2 billion, up approximately $1.5 billion
from 2002. The benefit of higher prices between periods was about $1.7 billion and was partially
offset by the effect of lower production.

The company’s average liquids realization in 2004 was $34.12 per barrel, compared with $26.66 in
2003 and $21.34 in 2002. The average natural gas realization was $5.51 per thousand cubic feet in
2004, compared with $5.01 and $2.89 in 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Net oil-equivalent production
averaged 817,000 barrels per day in 2004, down 12 percent from 2003 and 19 percent from 2002. The
lower production in 2004 included the effects of about 30,000 barrels per day associated with
property sales and 21,000 barrels per day of production shut in as a result of damages to
facilities from Hurricane Ivan in the third quarter. Adjusting for the effects of property sales
and storms in all periods presented, oil-equivalent production in 2004 declined about 7 percent
from 2003 and 14 percent from 2002, mainly as a result of normal field declines that do not
typically reverse.

The net liquids component of oil-equivalent production for 2004 averaged 505,000
barrels per day, a decline of 10 percent from 2003 and 16 percent from 2002. Excluding the effects
of property sales and storms, net liquids production in 2004 declined 5 percent and 11 percent from
2003 and 2002, respectively.

Net natural gas production averaged 1.9 billion cubic feet per day in
2004, 16 percent lower than 2003 and 22 percent lower than 2002. Adjusting for the effects of
property sales and storms, 2004 net natural gas production declined 10 percent in 2003 and 17
percent in 2002.

Refer to the “Selected Operating Data” table on page FS-10 for the three-year
comparative production volumes in the United States.

Segment income in 2004 included special gains of $366 million from property sales, partially offset
by special charges of $55 million resulting from an adverse litigation matter. Net special charges
of $64 million in 2003 were composed of charges of $103 million for asset impairments, associated
mainly with the write-down of assets in anticipation of sale; charges of $38 million for
restructuring and reorganization, mainly for employee severance costs; and gains of $77 million
from property sales. Special charges in 2002 totaled $214 million, which included $183 million for
the impairment of a number of fields caused by the write-down of proved reserves and $31 million
for costs of environmental remediation.

Income from continuing operations of $5.6 billion in 2004 increased about $2.4 billion from 2003.
Approximately $1.1 billion of the increase was associated with higher prices for crude oil and
natural gas. Approximately $750 million of the increase was the result of the effects of special
items in each period, which are discussed below. Another $400 million resulted from lower
income-tax expense between periods, including a benefit of about $200 million in 2004 as
a result of changes in income tax laws. Otherwise, the benefit of about $200 million in lower
foreign currency losses was largely offset by higher transportation costs.

Income from continuing operations of $3.2 billion in 2003 was nearly $400 million higher than in
2002. Higher crude oil and natural gas prices accounted for an increase of about $900 million,
which was partially offset by $400 million from the effect of foreign currency changes and about
$100 million of higher income tax-expense.

Net oil-equivalent production of 1.7 million barrels per
day in 2004 – including other produced volumes of 140,000 net barrels per day from oil sands and
production under an operating service agreement – declined about 1 percent from 2003 and 2 percent
from 2002. Excluding the lower production associated with property sales and reduced volumes
associated with cost-recovery provisions of certain production-sharing agreements, 2004 net
oil-equivalent production increased nearly 3 percent from 2003 and 1 percent from 2002 – primarily
from higher oil-equivalent production in Chad, Kazakhstan and Venezuela.

The net liquids component of oil-equivalent production,
including volumes produced from oil sands and under an operating service agreement, declined about 1 percent from the
production level in 2003 and about 3 percent from 2002. Excluding the effects of property
sales and lower cost-recovery volumes under certain production-sharing agreements, 2004 net
liquids

FS-7


Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

production
increased about 1 percent from 2003 and decreased about 1 percent from 2002.

The net natural gas component of oil-equivalent production was up 1 percent from 2003 and 6 percent
from 2002. During 2004, production increases in Angola, Kazakhstan, Denmark and Australia were
partially offset by declines associated with asset sales. In 2003, areas with production increases
included Australia, Kazakhstan, the Philippines and the United Kingdom.

Refer to the “Selected Operating Data” table on page FS-10 for the three-year comparative of
international production volumes.

Special-item gains in 2004 included $585 million from the sale of producing properties in western
Canada and $266 million from the sale of other nonstrategic assets, including the company’s
operations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and a Canadian natural-gas processing business.
In 2003, net special gains of $98 million included benefits of $150 million related to income
taxes and property sales, partially offset by asset impairments in advance of sale and charges for
employee termination costs. In 2002, special charges of $137 million included $100 million for
asset impairments resulting from the write-down of proved reserves for fields in Africa and
Canada.

The earnings improvement in 2004 from both 2003 and 2002 was associated mainly with higher margins
for refined products. Margins in 2004 were the highest in recent years. Margins in 2002 were very
depressed, and at one point hovered near their 12-year lows.

Sales volumes for refined products of approximately 1.5 million barrels per day in 2004 increased
about 5 percent from 2003. The increase between periods was primarily from higher sales of
gasoline, diesel fuel and fuel oil. Branded gasoline sales volumes of 567,000 barrels per day
increased

2 percent
from 2003. The sales improvement partially reflected the reintroduction of the Texaco brand in the Southeast.
In 2003, sales volumes for refined products declined about 10
percent from the prior year. Industry demand in 2003 was weaker for branded gasoline, diesel and
jet fuels and sales were lower under certain supply contracts.

Refer to the “Selected Operating
Data” table on page FS-10 for the three-year comparative refined-product sales volumes in the
United States.

In 2003, net special charges of $123 million included $160 million for environmental
remediation and employee severance costs associated with the global downstream restructuring and
reorganization. These charges were partially offset by gains on asset sales. In 2002, special
charges of $215 million included amounts for environmental remediation, the write-down of the El
Paso refinery in advance of sale and a litigation matter.

The international downstream segment includes the company’s consolidated refining and marketing
businesses, non-U.S. marine operations, non-U.S. supply and trading activities, and
equity earnings of affiliates, primarily in the Asia-Pacific region.

Earnings of nearly $2 billion in 2004 improved significantly from 2003 and 2002, mainly the result
of higher average margins for refined products for both company and affiliate operations and
higher earnings from international shipping operations. Margins in

FS-8


2004 were the highest in recent years. Earnings in 2004 also included a benefit of $40 million
related to changes in income tax laws.

Total international refined products sales volumes were 2.4 million barrels per day in 2004, more
than 4 percent higher than 2.3 million in 2003 and about 10 percent higher than 2.2 million in
2002. Weak economic conditions dampened industry demand in 2002. Refer to the “Selected Operating
Data” table on page FS-10 for the three-year comparative refined-product sales volumes in the
international areas.

Special charges of $189 million in 2003 included the write-down of the Batangas Refinery in the
Philippines in advance of its conversion to a product terminal facility, employee severance costs
associated with the global downstream restructuring and reorganization, the impairment of certain assets in anticipation of
their sale, and the company’s share of losses from an asset sale and asset impairment by an equity
affiliate. The special charge in 2002 was for a write-down of the company’s investment in its
publicly traded Caltex Australia Limited affiliate to its estimated fair value.

The chemicals segment includes the company’s Oronite division and the company’s 50 percent
share of its equity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem). In 2004, results
for the company’s Oronite subsidiary improved on higher sales volumes. Earnings in 2004 for CPChem
increased as the result of increased chemical commodity margins and sales volumes and higher equity
affiliate income. Protracted weak demand for commodity chemicals and industry oversupply
conditions
suppressed earnings for this segment in 2003 and 2002.

All Other consists of the company’s interest in Dynegy, coal mining operations, power generation
businesses, worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative
functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, and technology companies.

The improvement between 2003 and 2004 was primarily associated with the company’s investment in
Dynegy, including gains from the redemption of certain Dynegy securities, higher interest income,
lower interest expense, and favorable corporate-level tax adjustments. The net change between 2002
and 2003 was largely attributable to the differences in the effect of net special charges. The 2003
period also included lower interest expense and other corporate charges compared with 2002.

Net special gains in 2003 included a benefit of $365 million from the exchange of the company’s
investment in Dynegy preferred stock for cash and other Dynegy securities. This benefit was
partially offset by charges for asset write-downs of $84 million, primarily in the gasification
business, which was later sold; $40 million for the company’s share of an asset impairment by
Dynegy; and employee severance costs of $16 million.

Special charges in 2002 included $2.3 billion
related to Dynegy, composed of $1.6 billion for the write-down of the company’s investment in
Dynegy common and preferred stock to its estimated fair value and $680 million for the company’s
share of Dynegy’s own special items for asset write-downs and revaluations, and a loss on an asset
sale. Refer also to page FS-11 for “Information Relating to the Company’s Investment in Dynegy.”

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Explanations follow for variations between years for the amounts in the table above – after
consideration of the effects of special gains and charges – as well as for other income statement
categories. Refer to the preceding segment discussions in this section for information relating to
special gains and charges.

Sales and other operating revenues

were $151 billion in 2004, compared with $120 billion in 2003
and $98 billion in 2002. Revenues increased in 2004 and 2003 primarily from higher prices for crude
oil, natural gas and refined products worldwide.

Income (loss) from equity affiliates

increased in 2004 and 2003, as earnings improved for a number
of affiliates, including downstream affiliates in the Asia-Pacific area, Tengizchevroil, CPChem,
Dynegy and the Caspian Pipeline Consortium.

Other income

in 2004 included net gains of $1.6 billion, primarily from upstream property sales,
compared with gains of $286 million and $94 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Interest income
increased to $199 million in 2004, compared with about $120 million in 2003 and 2002, as a result
of higher balances of cash and marketable securities. Foreign currency losses were $60 million,
$199 million and $5 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Purchased crude oil and products

were $94 billion in 2004, an increase of 32 percent from 2003, due
mainly to higher prices and increased purchases of crude oil and products. Crude oil and product
purchases increased about 25 percent in 2003, primarily due to significantly higher prices for
crude oil, natural gas and refined products.

Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses

of $14 billion increased from $13 billion
in 2003. The increases in 2004 included costs for chartering of crude oil tankers and other
transportation expenses. During 2003, operating, selling, general and administrative expenses
increased nearly $1 billion, primarily from higher freight rates for international shipping
operations and higher costs associated with employee pension plans and other employee-benefit
expenses.

Exploration expenses

were $697 million in 2004, $570 million in 2003 and $591 million in 2002. In
2004, amounts were higher for international operations, primarily for seismic costs and expenses
associated with evaluating the feasibility of different project alternatives.

Depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses

did not change materially between years after
consideration of the effects of special-item charges.

Interest and debt expense

was $406 million in 2004, compared with $474 million in 2003 and $565
million in 2002. The lower amount in 2004 reflected lower average debt balances. The decline
between 2003 and 2002 reflected lower average interest rates on commercial paper and other
variable-rate debt and lower average debt levels.

Taxes other than on income

were $19.8 billion, $17.9 billion and $16.7 billion in 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively. The increase in 2004 and 2003 primarily reflected the weakening U.S. dollar on
foreign currency-denominated duties in the company’s European downstream operations.

Income tax expense

corresponded to effective tax rates of 37 percent in 2004, 43 percent in 2003
and 45 percent in 2002 after taking into account the effect of net special items. Refer also to
Note 17 on page FS-42 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Merger-related expenses

were $576 million in 2002. No merger-related expenses were reported in 2004
or 2003, reflecting the completion of merger integration activities in 2002.

INFORMATION RELATED TO INVESTMENT IN DYNEGY INC.

At year-end 2004, ChevronTexaco owned an approximate 25 percent equity interest in the common stock
of Dynegy – an energy provider engaged in power generation, gathering and processing of natural
gas, and the fractionation, storage, transportation and marketing of natural gas liquids. The
company also held an investment in Dynegy preferred stock.

Investment in Dynegy Common Stock

At December 31, 2004, the carrying value of the company’s
investment in Dynegy common stock was approximately $150 million. This amount was about $365
million below the company’s proportionate interest in Dynegy’s underlying net assets. This
difference is primarily the result of write-downs of the investment in 2002 for declines in the
market value of the common shares below the company’s carrying value that were deemed to be other
than temporary. The difference has been assigned to the extent practicable to specific Dynegy
assets and liabilities, based upon the company’s analysis of the various factors giving rise to the
decline in value of the Dynegy shares. The company’s equity share of Dynegy’s reported earnings is
adjusted quarterly when appropriate to recognize a portion of the difference between these
allocated values and Dynegy’s historical book values. The market value of the company’s investment
in Dynegy’s common stock at December 31, 2004, was approximately $450 million.

Investments in Dynegy Notes and Preferred Stock

At the beginning of 2004, the company held $223
million face value of Dynegy Junior Unsecured Subordinated Notes due 2016 and $400 million face
value of Dynegy Series C Convertible Preferred Stock with a stated maturity of 2033.

The Junior Notes were redeemed at face value during 2004, and gains of $54 million were recorded for the
difference between the face amounts and the carrying values at the time of redemption. The face
value of the company’s investment in the Series C preferred stock at December 31, 2004, was $400
million. The stock is recorded at its fair value, which was estimated to be $370 million at
December 31, 2004. Future temporary changes in the estimated fair value of the preferred stock will
be reported in “Other comprehensive income.” However, if any future decline in fair value is deemed
to be other than temporary, a charge against income in the period would be recorded. Dividends
received from the preferred stock are recognized in income each period.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities

Total balances were $10.7 billion and $5.3 billion
at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities in 2004 was
$14.7 billion, compared with $12.3 billion in 2003 and $9.9 billion in 2002. These amounts were net
of contributions to employee pension plans of $1.6 billion, $1.4 billion and $246 million in 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively. The 2004 increase in cash provided by operating activities mainly reflected higher earnings in the worldwide upstream and downstream businesses. Cash provided by
investing activities included proceeds from asset sales of $3.7 billion in 2004, $1.1 billion in
2003 and $2.3 billion in 2002.

Cash provided by operating activities and asset sales during 2004
was sufficient to fund the company’s capital and exploratory program, pay $3.2 billion of
dividends to stockholders, reduce total debt by $1.3 billion, repurchase $2.1 billion of common
stock, and increase the balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities by $5.5
billion.

Dividends

Payments of approximately $3.2 billion in 2004 and $3 billion in 2003 and 2002 were made
for dividends. In

September 2004, the company increased its quarterly common stock dividend by 10 percent to 40 cents
per share, on a post-stock split basis.

Debt, Capital Lease and Minority Interest Obligations

Total debt and capital lease balances were
$11.3 billion at December 31, 2004, down from $12.6 billion at year-end 2003. The company also had
minority interest obligations of $172 million, down from $268 million at December 31, 2003.

The company’s debt and capital lease obligations due within one year, consisting primarily of
commercial paper and the current portion of long-term debt, totaled $5.6 billion at December 31,
2004, down from $6.0 billion at December 31, 2003. Of these amounts, $4.7 billion and $4.3 billion
were reclassified to long-term at the end of each period, respectively. At year-end 2004,
settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital in 2005, as
the company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis. The company’s practice has been to continually refinance its
commercial paper, maintaining levels it believes appropriate.

At year-end 2004, ChevronTexaco had
$4.7 billion in committed credit facilities with various major banks, which permitted the refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term basis. These facilities support commercial paper
borrowings and also can be used for general corporate purposes. The company’s practice has been to
continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms,
maintaining levels management believes appropriate. Any borrowings under the facilities would be
unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the London Interbank Offered Rate or an average
of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the company’s strong
credit rating. No borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at December 31, 2004. In
addition, the company had three existing effective “shelf” registrations on file with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that together would permit additional registered debt
offerings up to an aggregate of $3.8 billion of debt securities.

In 2004, repayments of long-term
debt at maturity included $500 million of 6.625 percent ChevronTexaco Corporation bonds, an
aggregate $265 million of various Philippine debt and $240 million of ChevronTexaco Corporation
8.11 percent notes.

FS-11


Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

In the third quarter 2004, $300 million of 6 percent Texaco Capital Inc., due June 2005, were also
retired.

Texaco Capital LLC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary, issued Deferred Preferred Shares, Series C
(Series C), in December 1995. In February 2005, the company redeemed the Series C and accumulated
dividends at a cost of approximately $140 million.

In January 2005, the company contributed $98
million to permit the ESOP to make a $144 million debt service payment, which included a principal
payment of $113 million.

In the second quarter 2004, ChevronTexaco entered into $1 billion of interest rate fixed-to-floating
swap transactions. Under the terms of the swap agreements, of which $250 million and $750
million terminate in September 2007 and February 2008, respectively, the net cash settlement will
be based on the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts.

ChevronTexaco’s senior debt is rated AA by Standard and Poor’s Corporation and Aa2 by Moody’s
Investor Service, except for senior debt of Texaco Capital Inc., which is rated Aa3.
ChevronTexaco’s U.S. commercial paper is rated A-1+ by Standard and Poor’s and Prime 1 by Moody’s,
and the company’s Canadian commercial paper is rated R-1 (middle) by Dominion Bond Rating Service.
All of these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade securities.

The company’s future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, the
capital-spending program and cash that may be generated from asset dispositions. Further reductions
from debt balances at December 31, 2004, are dependent upon many factors, including management’s
continuous assessment of debt as an appropriate component of the company’s overall capital
structure. The company believes it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash
requirements, and during periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for
refined products and commodity chemicals, the company believes that it has the flexibility to
increase borrowings or modify capital-spending plans or both to continue paying the common stock
dividend and maintain the company’s high-quality debt ratings.

Tengizchevroil Funding

As part of the funding of the expansion of Tengizchevroil’s (TCO) production
facilities, in the fourth quarter 2004 ChevronTexaco purchased from TCO $2.2 billion of 6.124
percent Series B Notes (Series B), due 2014. Interest on the notes is payable semiannually, and
principal is to be repaid semi-annually in equal installments beginning in February 2008.

Immediately following the purchase of
the Series B, ChevronTexaco received from TCO approximately
$1.8 billion, representing a repayment of subordinated loans from the company, interest

and
dividends. The $2.2 billion investment in the Series B Notes, which the company intends to hold
until maturity, and the $1.8 billion distribution were recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet
to “Investments and Advances.”

Common Stock Repurchase Program

The company announced a stock repurchase program on March 31, 2004.
Acquisitions of up to $5 billion may be made from time to time at prevailing prices, as permitted
by securities laws and other legal requirements, and subject to market conditions and other
factors. The program is for a period of up to three years and may be discontinued at any time. The
company purchased 42,324,000 shares in the open market for $2.1 billion through December 2004.
Purchases through February 2005 increased the total shares acquired to 47,969,000 for $2.4 billion.

Capital and Exploratory Expenditures

Total reported expenditures for 2004 were $8.3 billion,
including $1.56 billion for the company’s share of affiliates’ expenditures, which did not require
cash outlays by the company. In 2003 and 2002, expenditures were $7.4 billion and $9.3 billion,
respectively, including the company’s share of affiliates’ expenditures of $1.1 billion and $1.4
billion in the corresponding periods. Of the total 2004 reported expenditures, $6.3 billion, or 76
percent, was for upstream activities, compared with 77 percent in 2003 and 68 percent in 2002.
International upstream accounted for 71 percent of the worldwide upstream total in 2004 and 2003
and 70 percent in 2002, reflecting the company’s continuing focus on international exploration and
production activities.

Expenditures in 2004 increased 13 percent compared with 2003, primarily
driven by higher upstream expenditures. Downstream spending increased 21 percent from 2003.
Expenditures were higher in 2002 than in 2003, due in part to large lease acquisitions in the North
Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, spending for the Athabasca Oil Sands Project in western Canada, and
additional common stock investments in Dynegy.

Including its share of spending by affiliates, the company estimates 2005 capital and exploratory
expenditures at $10 billion, which is about 20 percent higher than 2004. About $7.4 billion, or 74
percent of the total, is targeted for exploration and production activities, with $4.9 billion of
that amount targeted for outside the United States. The upstream spending is targeted for the most
promising exploratory prospects in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and West Africa and major
development projects in Angola, Nigeria, Kazakhstan and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Included in
the upstream expenditures is about $400 million to develop the company’s international natural gas
resource base.

Worldwide downstream spending in 2005 is estimated at $1.9 billion, with about $1.5
billion for refining and marketing

and $400 million for supply and transportation projects, including pipelines to support expanded
upstream production.

Investments in chemicals businesses in 2005 are budgeted at $200 million. Estimates for energy
technology, information technology and facilities, and power-related businesses total approximately
$500 million.

Pension Obligations

In 2004, the company’s pension plan contributions totaled $1.6
billion (approximately $1.3 billion to the U.S. plans). In 2005, the company expects contributions
to be approximately $400 million. Actual amounts are dependent upon investment results, changes in
pension obligations, regulatory environments and other economic factors. Additional funding may be
required if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations. Refer
also to the discussion of pension accounting in “Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions”
beginning on page FS-18.

FINANCIAL RATIOS

Current Ratio

– current assets divided by current liabilities. The current ratio is adversely
affected by the fact that ChevronTexaco’s inventories are valued on a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)
basis. At year-end 2004, the book value of inventory was lower than replacement costs, based on
average acquisition costs during the year, by approximately $3.0 billion.

Interest Coverage Ratio

– income before income tax expense, plus interest and debt expense and
amortization of capitalized interest, divided by before-tax interest costs. The company’s interest
coverage ratio was higher in 2004, primarily due to higher before-tax income and lower average debt
balances.

Debt Ratio

– total debt as a percentage of total debt plus equity. The decrease between
the comparable periods was due to lower average debt levels and higher retained earnings.

The amounts exclude indemnifications of contingencies associated with the sale of the company’s
interest in Equilon and Motiva in 2002, as discussed in the “Indemnifications” section on page
FS-14.

At December 31, 2004, the company and its subsidiaries provided guarantees either directly or indirectly, of $963 million for
notes and other contractual obligations of affiliated companies and $130 million for
third parties as described by major category below. There are no amounts being carried as
liabilities for the company’s obligations
under these guarantees.

Of the $963 million in guarantees provided to affiliates, $774 million
relate to borrowings for capital projects or general corporate purposes. These guarantees were
undertaken to achieve lower interest rates and generally cover the construction period of the
capital projects. Approximately 90 percent of the amounts guaranteed will expire by 2009, with the
remaining guarantees expiring by the end of 2015. Under the terms of the guarantees, the company
would be required to fulfill the guarantee should an affiliate be in default of its loan terms,
generally for the full amounts disclosed. There are no recourse provisions, and no assets are held
as collateral for these guarantees. The $189 million balance of the $963 million represents
obligations in connection with pricing of power purchase agreements for certain of its cogeneration
affiliates. Under the terms of these guarantees, the company may be required to make payments
under certain conditions if the affiliate does not perform under the agreements. There are no
recourse provisions to third parties, and no assets are held as collateral for these pricing
guarantees.

Guarantees of $130 million have been provided to third parties, including guarantees of
approximately $40 million of construction loans to host governments in the company’s international
upstream operations. The remaining guarantees of $90 million were provided principally as
conditions of sale of the company’s interest in certain operations, to provide a source of
liquidity to the guaranteed parties and in connection with company marketing programs. No amounts
of the company’s obligations under these guarantees are recorded as liabilities. About 70 percent
of the total amounts guaranteed will expire in 2009, with the remainder expiring after 2009. The
company would be required to perform under the terms of the guarantees should an entity be in
default of its loan or contract terms, generally for the full amounts disclosed. Approximately $70
million of the guarantees have recourse provisions, which enable the company to recover any
payments made under the terms of the guarantees from securities held over the guaranteed parties’
assets.

At December 31, 2004, ChevronTexaco also had outstanding guarantees for approximately $215 million
of Equilon debt and leases. Following the February 2002 disposition of its interest in Equilon, the
company received an indemnification from Shell

FS-13


Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Oil Company (Shell) for any claims arising from the guarantees. The company has not recorded a
liability for these guarantees. Approximately 45 percent of the amounts guaranteed will expire
within the 2005 through 2009 period, with the guarantees of the remaining amounts expiring by 2019.

Indemnifications

The company provided certain indemnities of contingent liabilities of Equilon and
Motiva to Shell and Saudi Refining, Inc., in connection with the February 2002 sale of the
company’s interests in those investments. The indemnities cover certain contingent liabilities,
including those associated with the Unocal patent litigation. The company would be required to
perform should the indemnified liabilities become actual losses. Should that occur, the company
could be required to make future payments up to $300 million. Through the end of 2004, the company
paid approximately $28 million under these contingencies and had agreed to pay approximately $10
million additional under an award of arbitration, subject to minor adjustments yet to be resolved.
The company may receive additional requests for indemnification payments in the future.

The company has also provided indemnities relating to contingent environmental liabilities related
to assets originally contributed by Texaco to the Equilon and Motiva joint ventures and
environmental conditions that existed prior to the formation of Equilon and Motiva or that occurred
during the periods of Texaco’s ownership interests in the joint ventures. In general, the
environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to
December 2001. Claims relating to Equilon indemnities must be asserted either as early as February
2007, or no later than February 2009, and claims relating to Motiva must be asserted no later than
February 2012. Under the terms of the indemnities, there is no maximum limit on the amount of
potential future payments. The company has not recorded any liabilities for possible claims under
these indemnities. The company posts no assets as collateral and has made no payments under the
indemnities.

The amounts payable for the indemnities described above are to be net of amounts
recovered from insurance carriers and others and net of liabilities recorded by Equilon or Motiva
prior to September 30, 2001, for any applicable incident.

Securitization

In other
off-balance-sheet arrangements, the company securitizes certain retail and trade accounts
receivable in its downstream business through the use of qualifying special purpose entities
(SPEs). At December 31, 2004, approximately $1.2 billion, representing about 10 percent of
ChevronTexaco’s total current accounts receivable balance, were securitized. ChevronTexaco’s total
estimated financial exposure under these securitizations at December 31, 2004, was approximately
$50 million. These arrangements have the effect of accelerating ChevronTexaco’s collection of the
securitized amounts. In the event of the SPEs experiencing major defaults in the collection of
receivables, ChevronTexaco believes that it would have no loss exposure connected with third-party
investments in these securitizations.

Long-Term Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments, Throughput Agreements, and
Take-or-Pay Agreements

The company and its subsidiaries have certain other contingent liabilities
relating to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, throughput agreements, and take-or-pay
agreements, some of which relate to suppliers’ financing arrangements.

The agreements typically
provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity, utilities, and petroleum
products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the company’s business. The aggregate
approximate amounts of required payments under these various commitments are 2005 – $1.6 billion;
2006 – $1.7 billion; 2007 – $1.6 billion; 2008 – $1.5 billion; 2009 – $1.5 billion; 2010 and after
– $2.3 billion. Total payments under the agreements were approximately $1.6 billion in 2004, $1.4
billion in 2003 and $1.2 billion in 2002. The most significant take-or-pay agreement calls for
the company to purchase approximately 55,000 barrels per day of refined products from an equity
affiliate refiner in Thailand. This purchase agreement is in conjunction with the financing of a
refinery owned by the affiliate and expires in 2009. The future estimated commitments under this
contract are: 2005 – $1.2 billion; 2006 – $1.2 billion; 2007 – $1.3 billion; 2008 – $1.3 billion;
and 2009 – $1.3 billion. Additionally, in 2004 the company entered into a 20-year agreement to
acquire regasification capacity at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal. Payments of $1.2 billion over the
20-year period are expected to commence in 2010.

Minority Interests

The company has commitments of
approximately $172 million related to minority interests in subsidiary companies.

FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

Commodity Derivative Instruments

ChevronTexaco is exposed to market risks related to the volatility
of crude oil, refined products, electricity, natural gas and refinery feedstock prices. The
company uses financial derivative commodity instruments to manage its exposure to price volatility
on a small portion of its activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for
the purchase or sale of crude oil and refined products; feedstock purchases for company refineries; crude oil and refined products inventories; and fixed-price contracts to sell natural gas
and natural gas liquids.

FS-14


ChevronTexaco also uses financial derivative commodity instruments for trading purposes, and the
results of this activity were not material to the company’s financial position, net income or cash
flows in 2004.

The company’s positions are monitored and reported on a daily basis by an internal risk control
group to ensure compliance with the company’s risk management policy that has been approved by the
Audit Committee of the company’s Board of Directors.

The financial derivative instruments used in the company’s risk management and trading activities
consist mainly of futures, options and swap contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange
and the International Petroleum Exchange. In addition, crude oil, natural gas and refined product
swap contracts and options contracts are entered into principally with major financial
institutions and other oil and gas companies in the “over-the-counter” markets.

Virtually all derivatives beyond those designated as normal purchase and normal sale contracts are
recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected
in income. Fair values are derived principally from market quotes and other independent third-party
quotes.

Each hypothetical 10 percent increase in the price of natural gas and crude oil would increase the
fair value of the natural gas derivative contracts by approximately $40 million and reduce the fair
value of the crude oil derivative contracts by about $15 million. The same hypothetical decreases
in the prices of these commodities would result in the same opposite effects on the fair values of
the contracts.

The hypothetical effect on these contracts was estimated by calculating the cash value of the
contracts as the difference between the hypothetical and contract delivery prices multiplied by the
contract amounts.

Foreign Currency

The company enters into forward exchange contracts, generally with terms of 180
days or less, to manage some of its foreign currency exposures. These exposures include revenue and
anticipated purchase transactions, including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease
commitments forecasted to occur within 180 days. The forward exchange contracts are recorded at
fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income.

The aggregate effect on foreign exchange contracts of a hypothetical 10 percent change to year-end
exchange rates would be approximately $50 million.

Interest Rates

The company enters into interest rate swaps as part of its overall strategy to
manage the interest rate risk on its debt. Under the terms of the swaps, net cash settlements are
based on the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts calculated by
reference to agreed notional principal amounts. Interest rate swaps related to a portion of the
company’s fixed-rate debt are accounted for as fair value hedges, whereas interest rate swaps
relating to a portion of the company’s floating-rate debt are recorded at fair value on the
balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income.

During 2004, four new swaps
were initiated to hedge a portion of the company’s fixed-rate debt. At year-end 2004, the weighted
average maturity of “receive fixed” interest rate swaps was approximately three years. There were
no “receive floating” swaps outstanding at year end.

A hypothetical increase of 10 basis points in market-fixed interest rates would reduce the fair
value of the “receive fixed” swaps by approximately $4 million.

For the financial and derivative instruments discussed above, there was not a material change in
market risk from that presented in 2003.

The hypothetical variances used in this section were selected for illustrative purposes only and do
not represent the company’s estimation of market changes. The actual impact of future market
changes could differ materially due to factors discussed elsewhere in this report, including those
set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” in part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report.

TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES

ChevronTexaco enters into a number of business arrangements with related parties, principally its
equity affiliates. These arrangements include long-term supply and offtake agreements.
Internationally, there are long-term purchase agreements in place with the company’s refining affiliate in Thailand. Refer to page FS-14 for further discussion. Management believes the foregoing
agreements and others have been negotiated on terms consistent with those that would have been
negotiated with an unrelated party.

LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

MTBE

The company and many other companies in the petroleum industry have used methyl tertiary butyl
ether (MTBE) as a gasoline additive.

The company is a party to more than 70 lawsuits and claims,
the majority of which involve numerous other petroleum marketers and refiners, related to the use
of MTBE in certain oxygenated gasolines and the alleged seepage of MTBE into groundwater.
Resolution of these actions may ultimately require the company to correct or ameliorate the alleged
effects on the environment of prior release of MTBE by the company or other parties. Additional
lawsuits and claims related to the use of MTBE, including personal-injury claims, may be filed in
the future.

The company’s ultimate exposure related to these lawsuits and claims is not currently determinable,
but could be material to net income in any one period. The company does not use MTBE in the
manufacture of gasoline in the United States and there are no detectable levels of MTBE in that
gasoline.

Environmental

The company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and
regulations that in the future may require the company to take action to correct or ameliorate the
effects on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleum substances, including MTBE,
by the company or other parties. Such contingencies may exist for various sites, including, but not
limited to, federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, refineries, oil fields,
service stations, terminals, and land development areas, whether operating, closed or sold. The
following table displays the annual changes to the company’s before-tax environmental remediation
reserves, including those for federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws. In
2004, the company recorded additional provisions for estimated remediation costs primarily at refined products marketing sites and various operating, closed or divested facilities in the United
States.

The company manages environmental liabilities under specific sets of regulatory requirements,
which in the United States include the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and various state or
local regulations. No single remediation site at year-end 2004 had a recorded liability that was
material to the company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

FS-15


Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

As of December 31, 2004, ChevronTexaco was involved with the remediation activities of 210 sites at
which it had been identified as a potentially responsible party or otherwise by the U.S. Environmental

Protection Agency (EPA) or other regulatory agencies under the provisions of the
federal Superfund law or analogous state laws. The company’s remediation reserve for these sites at
year-end 2004 was $107 million. The federal Superfund law and analogous state laws provide for
joint and several liability for all responsible parties. Any future actions by the EPA or other
regulatory agencies to require ChevronTexaco to assume other potentially responsible parties’ costs
at designated hazardous waste sites are not expected to have a material effect on the
company’s consolidated
financial position or liquidity.

Of the remaining year-end 2004 environmental reserves balance of $940 million, $712 million related to more than
2,000 sites for the company’s U.S. downstream operations,
including refineries and other plants, marketing locations

(i.e., service stations and terminals), and pipelines. The remaining $228
million was associated with various sites in the international downstream ($111 million), upstream
($69 million) and chemicals ($48 million). Liabilities at all sites, whether operating, closed or
divested, were primarily associated with the company’s plans and activities to remediate soil or
groundwater contamination or both. These and other activities include one or more of the following:
site assessment; soil excavation; offsite disposal of contaminants; onsite containment, remediation
and/or extraction of petroleum hydrocarbon liquid and vapor from soil; groundwater extraction and
treatment; and monitoring of the natural attenuation of the contaminants.

It is likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities, beyond those recorded,
for environmental remediation relating to past operations. These future costs are not fully
determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown
timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the
company’s liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs
are recoverable from third parties. Although the amount of future costs may be material to the
company’s results of operations in the period in which they are recognized, the company does not
expect these costs will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or
liquidity. Also, the company does not believe its obligations to make such expenditures have had or
will have any significant impact on the company’s competitive position relative to other U.S. or
international petroleum or chemical companies.

Prior to January 1, 2003, additional reserves for dismantlement, abandonment and restoration of its
worldwide oil and gas and coal properties at the end of their productive lives, which

included
costs related to environmental issues, were recognized on a unit-of-production basis as accumulated
depreciation, depletion and amortization. Effective January 1, 2003, the company implemented FAS
143,

“Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.”

Under FAS 143, the fair
value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is recorded when there is a legal
obligation associated with the retirement of long-lived assets and the liability can be reasonably
estimated. The liability balance for asset retirement obligations at year-end 2004 was $2.9
billion. Refer also to Note 25 on page FS-53 related to FAS 143.

For the company’s other ongoing operating assets, such as refineries and chemicals facilities, no
provisions are made for exit or cleanup costs that may be required when such assets reach the end
of their useful lives unless a decision to sell or otherwise abandon the facility has been made, as
the indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevents estimation of the fair value
of the asset retirement obligation.

Refer to “Environmental Matters” on page FS-18 for additional information related to environmental
matters.

Income Taxes

The company estimates its income tax expense and liabilities quarterly. These
liabilities generally are not finalized with the individual taxing authorities until several years
after the end of the annual period for which income taxes have been estimated. The U.S. federal
income tax liabilities have been settled through 1996 for ChevronTexaco (formerly Chevron), 1997
for ChevronTexaco Global Energy Inc. (formerly Caltex), and 1991 for Texaco. California franchise
tax liabilities have been settled through 1991 for Chevron and through 1987 for Texaco. Settlement
of open tax years, as well as tax issues in other countries where the company conducts its
businesses, is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or
liquidity of the company and, in the opinion of management, adequate provision has been made for
income and franchise taxes for all years under examination or subject to future examination.

Global Operations

ChevronTexaco and its affiliates have operations in approximately 180 countries.
Areas in which the company and its affiliates have significant operations include the United
States, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, Norway, Denmark, France, the Partitioned Neutral
Zone between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, Republic of Congo, Angola, Nigeria, Chad, South Africa,
Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, China, Thailand, Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia,
Trinidad and Tobago, and South Korea. The company’s Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) affiliate
operates in Russia and Kazakhstan. The company’s Tengizchevroil affiliate operates in Kazakhstan.
The company’s CPChem affiliate manufactures and markets a wide range of petrochemicals on a
worldwide basis, with manufacturing facilities in the United States, Puerto Rico, Singapore, China,
South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Mexico and Belgium.

The company’s operations, particularly
exploration and production, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political
environments in the various countries in which it operates, including the United States. As has
occurred in the past, actions could be taken by host governments to increase public ownership of
the company’s partially or wholly owned businesses or to impose additional taxes or royalties on
the company’s operations or both.

FS-16


In certain locations, host governments have imposed restrictions, controls and taxes, and in
others, political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the
company’s continued presence in those countries. Internal unrest, acts of violence or strained
relations between a host government and the company or other governments may affect the company’s
operations. Those developments have at times significantly affected the company’s related
operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of
current and future activity in such countries.

Equity Redetermination

For crude oil and natural gas producing operations, ownership agreements may
provide for periodic reassessments of equity interests in estimated crude oil and natural gas
reserves. These activities, individually or together, may result in gains or losses that could be
material to earnings in any given period. One such equity redetermina-tion process has been under
way since 1996 for ChevronTexaco’s interests in four producing zones at the Naval Petroleum Reserve
at Elk Hills, California, for the time when the remaining interests in these zones were owned by
the U.S. Department of Energy. A wide range remains for a possible net settlement amount for the
four zones. ChevronTexaco currently estimates its maximum possible net before-tax liability at
approximately $200 million. At the same time, a possible maximum net amount that could be owed to
ChevronTexaco is estimated at about $50 million. The timing of the settlement and the exact amount
within this range of estimates are uncertain.

Suspended Wells

The company suspends the costs of
exploratory wells pending a final determination of the commercial potential of the related crude
oil and natural gas fields. The ultimate disposition of these well costs is dependent on the
results of future drilling activity or development decisions or both. If the company decides not to
continue development, the costs of these wells are expensed. At December 31, 2004, the company had
$671 million of suspended exploratory wells included in properties, plant and equipment, an
increase of $122 million from 2003 and an increase of $193 million from 2002. The balance at
year-end 2004 primarily reflects drilling activities in the United States and Nigeria.

The SEC has
issued several comment letters to companies in the oil and gas industry related to the accounting
for suspended exploratory wells, particularly for those suspended under certain circumstances for
more than one year.

The company’s accounting policy in this regard is to capitalize the cost of exploratory wells
pending determination of whether the wells found proved reserves. Costs of wells that find proved
reserves remain capitalized. Costs also are
capitalized for wells that find commercially producible reserves that cannot be classified as
proved, pending one or more of the following: (1) decisions on additional major capital
expenditures, (2) the results of additional exploratory wells that are under way or firmly
planned, and (3) securing final regulatory approvals for development. Otherwise, well costs are
expensed if a determination as to whether proved reserves were found cannot be made within one year
following completion of drilling. All other exploratory well costs are expensed.

This topic was discussed at the September 2004 meeting of the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) as
Issue 04-9, “Accounting for Suspended Well Costs” (EITF 04-9). The discussion centered on whether
certain circumstances would permit the continued capitalization of the costs for an exploratory
well beyond one year in the absence of plans for another exploratory well. The outcome of the
September 2004 EITF meeting was agreement

between the EITF and the FASB that the circumstances
outlined were inconsistent with the provisions in FASB Statement No. 19,

“Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies”

(FAS 19), and an amendment
of FAS 19 would be required to formally adopt this view. In February 2005, the FASB issued a
proposed FASB Staff Position (FSP) to amend FAS 19. Refer to Note 21 on page FS-45 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of this FSP, the SEC’s comment letters and the
company’s costs associated with suspended exploratory wells.

The future trend of the company’s exploration expenses can be affected by amounts associated with
well write-offs, including wells that had been previously suspended pending determination as to
whether the well had found reserves that could be classified as proved. The effect on exploration
expenses in future periods for the $671 million of suspended wells at year-end 2004 is uncertain,
given the referenced deliberations by the SEC and FASB, as is the effect on the normal
project-evaluation and future drilling activities for all of the wells that have been suspended.

Accounting for Buy/Sell Contracts

In January and February 2005, the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) issued comment letters to ChevronTexaco and other companies in the oil and gas
industry requesting disclosure of information related to the accounting for buy/sell contracts.
Under a buy/sell contract, a company agrees to buy a specific quantity and quality of a commodity
to be delivered at a specific location while simultaneously agreeing to sell a specified quantity
and quality of a commodity at a different location to the same counterparty. Physical delivery
occurs for each side of the transaction, and the risk and reward of ownership are evidenced by
title transfer, assumption of environmental risk, transportation scheduling, credit risk, and risk
of nonperformance by the counterparty. Both parties settle each side of the buy/sell through
separate invoicing.

The company routinely has buy/sell contracts, primarily in the United States
downstream business, associated with crude oil and refined products. For crude oil, these
contracts are used to facilitate the company’s crude oil marketing activity, which includes the
purchase and sale of crude oil production, fulfillment of the company’s supply arrangements as to
physical delivery location and crude oil specifications, and purchase of crude oil to supply the
company’s refining system. For refined products, buy/sell arrangements are used to help fulfill
the company’s supply agreements to customer locations and specifications.

The company accounts for buy/sell transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Income the same as
any other monetary transaction for which title passes, and the risk and reward of ownership are
assumed by the counterparties. At issue with the SEC is whether the industry’s accounting for
buy/sell contracts instead should be shown net on the income statement and accounted for under the
provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 29,

“Accounting for Nonmonetary
Transactions”

(APB 29).

The topic is under deliberation by the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) of the FASB as Issue No.
04-13,

“Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty.”

The EITF first discussed this issue in November 2004. Additional research is being performed by the FASB
staff, and the topic will be discussed again at a future EITF meeting. While this issue is under
deliberation, the SEC staff directed ChevronTexaco and other companies in its January and February
2005 comment letters to disclose on the face of the income statement the amounts asso-

FS-17


Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

ciated with
buy/sell contracts and to discuss in a footnote to the financial statements the basis for the
underlying accounting.

With regard to the latter, the company’s accounting treatment for buy/sell
contracts is based on the view that such transactions are monetary in nature. Monetary transactions
are outside the scope of APB 29. The company believes its accounting is also supported by the
indicators of gross reporting of purchases and sales in paragraph 3 of EITF Issue No. 99-19,

“Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent.”

Additionally, FASB Interpretation
No. 39,

“Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts”

(FIN 39), prohibits a receivable from
being netted against a payable when the receivable is subject to credit risk unless a right of
offset exists that is enforceable by law. The company also views netting the separate components of
buy/sell contracts in the income statement to be inconsistent
with the gross presentation that FIN 39 requires for the resulting receivable and payable on the
balance sheet.

The company’s buy/sell transactions are also similar to the “barrel back” example
used in other accounting literature, including EITF Issue No. 03-11,

“Reporting Realized Gains and
Losses on Derivative Instruments That Are Subject to FASB Statement No. 133 and Not ‘Held for
Trading Purposes’ as Defined in Issue No. 02-3”

(which indicates a company’s decision to show
buy/sell-types of transactions gross on the income statement as being a matter of judgment of the
relevant facts and circumstances of the company’s activities) and Derivatives Implementation Group
(DIG) Issue No. K1,

“Miscellaneous: Determining Whether Separate Transactions Should be Viewed as a
Unit"

.

The company further notes that the accounting for buy/sell contracts as separate purchases and
sales is in contrast to the accounting for other types of contracts typically described by the
industry as exchange contracts, which are considered non-monetary in nature and appropriately shown
net on the income statement. Under an exchange contract, for example, one company agrees to
exchange refined products in one location for another company’s same quantity of refined products
in another location. Upon transfer, the only amounts that may be invoiced are for transportation
and quality differentials. Among other things, unlike buy/sell contracts, the obligations of each
party to perform under the contract are not independent and the risks and rewards of ownership are
not separately transferred.

As shown on the company’s Consolidated Statement of Income, “Sales and other operating revenues”
for the three years ending December 31, 2004, included $18,650 million, $14,246 million and $7,963
million, respectively, for buy/sell contracts. These revenue amounts associated with buy/sell
contracts represented 12 percent of total “Sales and other operating revenues” in 2004 and 2003 and
8 percent in 2002. The costs associated with these buy/sell revenue amounts are included in
“Purchased crude oil and products” on the Consolidated Statement of Income in each period.

Other Contingencies

ChevronTexaco receives claims from, and submits claims to, customers, trading
partners, U.S. federal, state and local regulatory bodies, host governments, contractors, insurers,
and suppliers. The amounts of these claims, individually and in the aggregate, may be significant
and may take lengthy periods to resolve.

The company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their operations and may close,
abandon, sell, exchange, acquire or restructure assets to achieve operational or strategic benefits and to improve competitiveness and profitability. These activities, individually or together,
may result in gains or losses in future periods.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Virtually all aspects of the businesses in which the company engages are subject to various
federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These regulatory
requirements continue to increase in both number and complexity over time and govern not only the
manner in which the company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells. Most of the
costs of complying with laws and regulations pertaining to company operations and products are
embedded in the normal costs of doing business.

Accidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business. In
addition to the costs for environmental protection associated with its ongoing operations and
products, the company may incur expenses for corrective actions at various owned and previously
owned facilities and at third-party-owned waste-disposal sites used by the company. An obligation
may arise when operations are closed or sold or at non-ChevronTexaco sites where company products
have been handled or disposed of. Most of the expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to
facilities and sites where past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered
acceptable at the time but now require investigative or remedial work or both to meet current
standards. Using definitions and guidelines established by the American Petroleum Institute,
ChevronTexaco estimated its worldwide environmental spending in 2004 at approximately $1.1 billion
for its consolidated companies. Included in these expenditures were $285 million of environmental
capital expenditures and approximately $810 million of costs associated with the prevention,
control, abatement or elimination of hazardous substances and pollutants from operating, closed or
divested sites and the abandonment and restoration of sites.

For 2005, total worldwide environmental capital expenditures are estimated at $710 million. These
capital costs are in addition to the ongoing costs of complying with environmental regulations and
the costs to remediate previously contaminated sites.

It is not possible to predict with certainty the amount of additional investments in new or
existing facilities or amounts of incremental operating costs to be incurred in the future to:
prevent, control, reduce or eliminate releases of hazardous materials into the environment; comply
with existing and new environmental laws and regulations; or remediate and restore areas damaged by
prior releases of hazardous materials. Although these costs may be significant to the results of
operations in any single period, the company does not expect them to have a material effect on the
company’s liquidity or financial position.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS

Management makes many estimates and assumptions in the application of generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP) that may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial
statements and related disclosures and on the comparability of such

FS-18


information over different
reporting periods. All such estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.
Estimates and assumptions are based on management’s experience and other information available
prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Materially different results can occur as
circumstances change and additional information becomes known.

The discussion in this section of “critical” accounting estimates or assumptions is according to
the disclosure guidelines of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), wherein:

1.

the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and
judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to
change;

2.

the impact of the estimates and assumptions on the company’s financial condition or
operating performance is material.

Besides those meeting these “critical” criteria, the company makes many other accounting estimates
and assumptions in preparing its financial statements and related disclosures. Although not
associated with “highly uncertain matters,” these estimates and assumptions are also subject to
revision as circumstances warrant, and materially different results may sometimes occur.

For example, the recording of deferred tax assets requires an assessment under the accounting rules
that the future realization of the associated tax benefits be “more likely than not.” Another
example is the estimation of oil and gas reserves under SEC rules that require “... geological and
engineering data (that) demonstrate with reasonable certainty (reserves) to be recoverable in
future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions, i.e., prices
and costs as of the date the estimate is made.” Refer to Table V, “Reserve Quantity Information,”
beginning on page FS-63 for the changes in these estimates for the three years ending December 31,
2004, and to Table VII, “Changes in the Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows
From Proved Reserves,” on page FS-68 for estimates of proved-reserve values for each year-end
2002–2004, which were based on year-end prices at the time. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements includes a description of the “successful efforts” method of accounting for oil and gas
exploration and production activities. The estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are
important to the timing of expense recognition for costs incurred.

The discussion of the critical accounting policy for “Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment
and Investments in Affiliates” on page FS-20 includes reference to conditions under which downward
revisions of proved reserve quantities could result in impairments of oil and gas properties. This
commentary should be read in conjunction with disclosures elsewhere in this discussion and in the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements related to estimates, uncertainties, contingencies
and new accounting standards. Significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements on page FS-30. The development and selection of accounting
estimates and assumptions, including those deemed “critical,” and the associated disclosures in
this discussion have been discussed by management with the audit committee of the Board of
Directors.

The areas of accounting and the associated “critical” estimates and assumptions made by the company
are as follows:

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

The determination of pension plan expense is based
on a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions are the expected long-

term rate of
return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations. For other
postretirement employee benefit (OPEB) plans, which provide for certain health care and life
insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees and which are not funded, critical assumptions
in determining OPEB expense are the discount rate applied to benefit obligations and the assumed
health care cost-trend rates used in the calculation of benefit obligations.

Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, beginning on page FS-46, includes information for
the three years ending December 31, 2004, on the components of pension and OPEB expense and the
underlying assumptions as well as on the funded status for the company’s pension plans at the end
of 2004 and 2003.

To estimate the long-term rate of return on pension assets, the company employs a
rigorous process that incorporates actual historical asset-class returns and an assessment of
expected future performance and takes into consideration external actuarial advice and asset-class
factors. Asset allocations are regularly updated using pension plan asset/liability studies, and
the determination of the company’s estimates of long-term rates of return are consistent with these
studies. For example, the expected long-term rate of return on United States pension plan assets,
which account for about 70 percent of the company’s pension plan assets, has remained at 7.8
percent since 2002.

The year-end market-related value of U.S. pension plan assets used in the
determination of pension expense was based on the market value in the preceding three months as
opposed to the maximum allowable period of five years under U.S. accounting rules. Management
considers the three-month period long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from day-to-day
market volatility and still be contemporaneous to
the end of the year. For plans outside the United States, market value of assets as of the
measurement date is used in calculating the pension expense.

The discount rate assumptions used to determine pension and postretirement benefit plan
obligations and expense reflect the prevailing rates available on high-quality, fixed-income debt
instruments. At December 31, 2004, the company calculated the U.S. pension obligation using a 5.8
percent discount rate. The discount rates used at the end of 2003 and 2002 were 6 percent and 6.8
percent, respectively.

An increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets or the discount
rate would reduce pension plan expense, and vice versa. Total pension expense for 2004 was $564
million. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long-term rate of return
assumption, a 1 percent increase in the expected rate of return on assets of the company’s primary
U.S. pension plan, which accounted for about 60 percent of the company-wide pension obligation,
would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2004 by approximately $45 million. A 1 percent
increase in the discount rate for this same plan would have reduced total benefit plan expense for
2004 by approximately $115 million. The actual rates of return on plan assets and discount rates
may vary significantly from estimates because of unanticipated changes in the world’s financial
markets.

In 2004, the company’s pension plan contributions totaled $1.6 billion (approximately $1.3 billion
to the U.S. plans). In 2005, the company expects contributions to be approximately $400 million.
Actual contribution amounts are dependent upon investment results, changes in pension obligations,
regulatory environments and other economic factors. Additional funding may be required if
investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations.

FS-19


Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Pension expense is recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Income in “Operating expenses” or
“Selling, general and administrative expenses” and applies to all business segments. Depending upon
the funding status of the different plans, either a long-term prepaid asset or a long-term
liability is recorded. Any unfunded accumulated benefit obligation in excess of recorded
liabilities is recorded in “Other comprehensive income.” See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements beginning on page FS-46 for the pension-related balance sheet effects at the end of 2004
and 2003.

For the company’s OPEB plans, expense for 2004 was $197 million and was also recorded as
“Operating expenses” or “Selling, general and administrative expenses” in all business segments. At
December 31, 2004, the discount rate applied to the company’s OPEB obligations was 5.8 percent – the same discount rate used for U.S. pension obligations. Effective January 1, 2005, the company
amended its main U.S. postretirement medical plan to limit future increases in the company
contribution. For current retirees, the increase in company contribution is capped at 4 percent
each year. For future retirees, the 4 percent cap will be effective at retirement. Before
retirement, the assumed health care cost trend rates start with 10.6 percent in 2004 and gradually
drop to 4.8 percent for 2010 and beyond. Once the employee elects to retire, the trend rates are
capped at 4 percent.

As an indication of discount rate sensitivity to the determination of OPEB
expense in 2004, a 1 percent increase in the discount rate for the company’s primary U.S. OPEB
plan, which accounted for about 90 percent of the companywide OPEB obligation, would have decreased
OPEB expense by approximately $20 million.

Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates

The company assesses its
property, plant and equipment (PP&E) for possible impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Such
indicators include changes in the company’s business plans, changes in commodity prices and, for
crude oil and natural gas properties, significant downward revisions of estimated proved reserve
quantities. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected
from the asset, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value of the asset over
its fair value.

Determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on
highly uncertain matters, such as future commodity prices, the effects of inflation and technology
improvements on operating expenses, production profiles, and the outlook for global or regional
market supply and demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas, commodity chemicals and refined
products. However, the impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are
consistent with the company’s business plans and long-term investment decisions.

The amount and income statement classification of major impairments of PP&E for the three years
ending December 31, 2004, are included in the commentary on the business segments elsewhere in this
discussion, as well as in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page FS-32.
An estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used
in the impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not practicable, given the broad range of
the

company’s PP&E and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. That is, favorable
changes to some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair any assets in these periods,
whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown number of other assets to
become impaired.

Investments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method, as well
as investments in other securities of these equity investees, are reviewed for impairment when the
fair value of the investment falls below the company’s carrying value. When such a decline is deemed to be other than temporary, an
impairment charge is recorded to the income statement for the difference between the investment’s
carrying value and its estimated fair value at the time. In making the determination as to whether
a decline is other than temporary, the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of
the decline, the investee’s financial performance, and the company’s ability and intention to
retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery
in the investment’s market value. Differing assumptions could affect whether an investment is
impaired in any period and the amount of the impairment and are not subject to sensitivity
analysis.

From time to time, the company performs impairment reviews and determines that no
write-down in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required. For example, when significant downward revisions to crude oil and natural gas reserves are made for any single field or
concession, an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset
remains recoverable. Also, if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any
period has been deemed more likely than not, an impairment review is performed, and if the
estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group, no impairment charge
is required. Such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed
of. Assets that are not impaired on a held-and-used basis could possibly become impaired if a
decision was made to sell such assets, that is, the asset is held for sale and the estimated
proceeds less costs to sell were less than the associated carrying values.

Contingent Losses

Management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for
claims, litigation, tax matters and environmental remediation. Actual costs can frequently vary
from estimates for a variety of reasons. For example, the costs from settlement of claims and
litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on
culpability and assessments on the amount of damages. Similarly, liabilities for environmental
remediation are subject to change because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation;
the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination; and
improvements in technology.

Under the accounting rules, a liability is recorded for these types of contingencies if management
determines the loss to be both probable and estimable. The company generally records these losses
as “Operating expenses” or “Selling, general and administrative expenses” on the Consolidated
Statement of Income. Refer to the business segment discussions elsewhere in this discussion and in
Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page FS-32 for the effect on earnings from
losses associated with certain litigation and environmental remediation and tax matters for the
three years ended December 31, 2004.

FS-20


An estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used
in recording these liabilities is not practicable because of the number of contingencies that must
be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible
outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss.

American Jobs Creation Act of 2004

In October 2004, the American Jobs Creations Act of 2004 (the
Act) was passed into law. The Act provides deduction from income for qualified domestic refining
and upstream production activities, which will be phased in from 2005 through 2010. For that
specific category of income, the company expects the net effect of this provision of the Act to
result in a decrease in the federal effective tax rate for 2005 and 2006 to approximately 34
percent, based on current earnings levels. In the long term, the company expects that the new
deduction will result in a decrease of the federal effective tax rate to about 32 percent for that
category of income, based on current earnings levels.

Under the guidance in FASB Staff Position No. FAS 109-1,

“Application of FASB Statement No. 109,
‘Accounting for Income Taxes,’ to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by
the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004,”

the tax deduction on qualified production activities
provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 will be treated as a “special deduction,” as
described in FAS 109. As such, the special deduction has no effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities existing at the enactment date. Rather, the impact of this deduction will be reported
in the period in which the deduction is claimed on the company’s tax return.

The Act also provides for a limited opportunity to repatriate earnings from outside the United
States at a special reduced tax rate that can be as low as 5.25 percent. In early 2005, the company
was in the process of reviewing the guidance that the IRS issued on January 13, 2005, regarding
this provision and also considering other relevant information. The company does not anticipate a
major change in its plans for repatriating earnings from international operations under the
provisions of the Act.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

FASB
Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities”

(FIN 46)

In
January 2003, FIN 46 was issued, and established standards for determining under what circumstances a variable interest
entity (VIE) should be consolidated by its primary beneficiary.
FIN 46 also requires disclosures
about VIEs that the company is not required to consolidate but in
which it has a significant variable interest. In December 2003,
the FASB issued FIN 46-R,
which not only includes amendments to FIN 46, but also requires application of the interpretation
to all affected entities no later than March 31, 2004, for calendar year-reporting companies. Prior
to this requirement, companies were required to apply the interpretation to special-purpose
entities by December 31, 2003. The full adoption of the interpretation as of March 31, 2004,
including the requirement relating to special-purpose entities, did not have a material impact on
the company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

FASB Staff Position No. FAS 106-2, “Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003,”

(FSP FAS 106-2)

In December 2003,
the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the “Act”) became law.
The Act introduced a prescription drug benefit under Medicare, as well as a federal subsidy to
sponsors of retiree health care plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially
equivalent to Medicare

Part D. In May 2004, the FASB issued FSP FAS 106-2. One U.S. subsidiary was deemed at least
actuarially equivalent and eligible for the federal subsidy. The effect on the company’s
postretirement benefit obligation and the associated annual expense was

de minimis.

FASB Statement No. 151, “Inventory Costs, an Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4,”

(FAS 151)

In
November 2004, the FASB issued FAS 151 which is effective for the company on January 1, 2006. The
standard amends the guidance in Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 43, Chapter 4, “Inventory
Pricing,” to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight,
handling costs and spoilage. In addition, the standard requires that allocation of fixed
production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production
facilities. The company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard.

FASB Statement No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment”

(FAS 123R)

In December 2004, the FASB issued FAS
123R, which requires that compensation cost relating to share-based payments be recognized in the
company’s financial statements. The company currently accounts for those payments under the
recognition and measurement principles of

Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,”

and related interpretations. The company is preparing
to implement this standard effective July 1, 2005. Although the transition method to be used to
adopt the standard has not been selected, the impact of adoption is expected to have a minimal
impact on the company’s results of operations, financial position and liquidity. Refer to Note 1,
beginning on page FS-30, for the company’s calculation of the pro forma impact on net income of FAS
123, which would be similar to that under FAS 123R.

FASB
Statement No. 153, “Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets —
An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29”

(FAS 153)

In
December 2004, the FASB issued FAS 153, which is effective for the company for asset-exchange
transactions beginning July 1, 2005. Under APB No. 29, assets received in certain types of
nonmonetary exchanges were permitted to be recorded at the carrying value of the assets that were
exchanged (i.e., recorded on a carryover basis). As amended by FAS 153, assets received in some
circumstances will have to be recorded instead at their fair values. In the past, ChevronTexaco has
not engaged in a large number of nonmonetary asset exchanges for significant amounts.

MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

To the Stockholders of ChevronTexaco Corporation

Management of ChevronTexaco is responsible for preparing the accompanying Consolidated Financial
Statements and the related information appearing in this report. The statements were prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and fairly
represent the transactions and financial position of the company. The financial statements include
amounts that are based on management’s best estimates and judgment.

The independent registered public accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has audited the
company’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), as stated in their report included herein.

The Board of Directors of ChevronTexaco has an Audit Committee composed of directors who are not
officers or employees of the company. The Audit Committee meets regularly with members of
management, the internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm to review
accounting, internal control, auditing and financial reporting matters. Both the internal auditors
and the independent registered public accounting firm have free and direct access to the Audit
Committee without the presence of management.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a–15(f). The company’s
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. Based on the results of this evaluation, the company’s management concluded
that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2004.

The company management’s assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of ChevronTexaco Corporation:

We have completed an integrated audit of ChevronTexaco Corporation’s 2004 consolidated financial
statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 and audits
of its 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are
presented below.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated
statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of ChevronTexaco Corporation and its subsidiaries at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial
statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a) (2) presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are
the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that the Company maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 based on criteria established in Internal Control
– Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria.
Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal
Control – Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Company’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express
opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial
reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As discussed in Note 25 on page FS-53 to the financial statements, the Company changed its method
of accounting for asset retirement obligations as of January 1, 2003.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts

NOTE 1.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General

ChevronTexaco manages its investments in and provides administrative, financial and
management support to U.S. and foreign subsidiaries and affiliates that engage in fully integrated
petroleum, chemicals and coal mining operations. In addition, ChevronTexaco holds investments in
the power generation business. Collectively, these companies conduct business activities in more
than 180 countries. Exploration and production (upstream) operations consist of exploring for,
developing and producing crude oil and natural gas and also marketing natural gas. Refining,
marketing and transportation (downstream) operations relate to refining crude oil into finished
petroleum products; marketing crude oil, natural gas and the many products derived from petroleum;
and transporting crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor
equipment and rail car. Chemical operations include the manufacture and marketing of commodity
petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant oil additives.

The company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. These require the use of estimates and
assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the financial
statements, as well as amounts included in the notes thereto, including discussion and disclosure
of contingent liabilities. Although the company uses its best estimates and judgments, actual
results could differ from these estimates as future confirming events occur.

The nature of the company’s operations and the many countries in which it operates subject the
company to changing economic, regulatory and political conditions. The company does not believe it
is vulnerable to the risk of near-term severe impact as a result of any concentration of its
activities.

Subsidiary and Affiliated Companies

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of
controlled subsidiary companies more than 50 percent owned and variable interest entities in which
the company is the primary beneficiary. Undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures and
certain other assets are consolidated on a proportionate basis. Investments in and advances to
affiliates in which the company has a substantial ownership interest of approximately 20 percent to
50 percent or for which the company exercises significant influence but not control over policy
decisions are accounted for by the equity method. As part of that accounting, the company
recognizes gains and losses that arise from the issuance of stock by an affiliate that results in
changes in the company’s proportionate share of the dollar amount of the affiliate’s equity
currently in income. Deferred income taxes are provided for these gains and losses.

Investments are assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value of the
investment may be below the company’s carrying value. When such a condition is deemed to be other
than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value, and the
amount of the write-down is included in net income. In making the determination as to whether a
decline is other than temporary, the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of
the decline, the investee’s financial performance, and the company’s ability and

intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in
the investment’s market value. The new cost basis of investments in these equity investees is not
changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value. Subsequent recoveries in the carrying value of
other investments are reported in “Other comprehensive income.”

Differences between the company’s carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate
are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the company’s
analysis of the various factors giving rise to the difference. The company’s share of the
affiliate’s reported earnings is adjusted quarterly when appropriate to reflect the difference
between these allocated values and the affiliate’s historical book values.

Derivatives

The majority of the company’s activity in commodity derivative instruments is intended
to manage the price risk posed by physical transactions. For some of this derivative activity,
generally limited to large, discrete or infrequently occurring transactions, the company may elect
to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting. For other similar derivative instruments,
generally because of the short-term nature of the contracts or their limited use, the company does
not apply hedge accounting, and changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in
current income. For the company’s trading activity, gains and losses from the derivative
instruments are reported in current income. For derivative instruments relating to foreign currency
exposures, gains and losses are reported in current income. Interest rate swaps – hedging a portion
of the company’s fixed-rate debt – are accounted for as fair value hedges, whereas interest rate
swaps relating to a portion of the company’s floating-rate debt are recorded at fair value on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet, with resulting gains and losses reflected in income.

Short-Term Investments

All short-term investments are classified as available for sale and are in
highly liquid debt securities. Those investments that are part of the company’s cash management
portfolio and have original maturities of three months or less are reported as “Cash equivalents.”
The balance of the short-term investments is reported as “Marketable securities.” Short-term
investments are marked-to-market, with any unrealized gains or losses included in “Other
comprehensive income.”

Inventories

Crude oil, petroleum products and chemicals are generally stated at cost, using a
Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) method. In the aggregate, these costs are below market. “Materials,
supplies and other” inventories generally are stated at average cost.

Properties, Plant and Equipment

The successful efforts method is used for crude oil and natural gas
exploration and production activities. All costs for development wells, related plant and
equipment, proved mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties, and related asset
retirement obligation (ARO) assets are capitalized. Costs of exploratory wells are capitalized
pending determination of whether the wells found proved reserves. Costs of wells that are assigned
proved reserves remain capitalized. Costs are also capitalized for wells that find commercially
producible reserves that cannot be classified as proved, pending

FS-30



NOTE 1.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES – Continued

one or more of the following: (1) decisions on additional major capital expenditures, (2) the
results of additional exploratory wells that are under way or firmly planned, and (3) securing
final regulatory approvals for development. Otherwise, well costs are expensed if a determination
as to whether proved reserves were found cannot be made within one year following completion of
drilling. All other exploratory wells and costs are expensed. Refer to Note 21 on page FS-45 for
additional discussion of accounting for suspended exploratory well costs.

Long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved crude oil and natural gas properties, are
assessed for possible impairment by comparing their carrying values with their associated
undiscounted future net before-tax cash flows. Events that can trigger assessments for possible
impairments include write-downs of proved reserves based on field performance, significant
decreases in the market value of an asset, significant change in the extent or manner of use of or
a physical change in an asset, and a more-likely-than-not expectation that a long-lived asset or
asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly sooner than the end of its
previously estimated useful life. Impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values,
generally their discounted future net before-tax cash flows. For proved crude oil and natural gas
properties in the United States, the company generally performs the impairment review on an
individual field basis. Outside the United States, reviews are performed on a country, concession
or field basis, as appropriate. Globally in the refining, marketing, transportation and chemical
areas, impairment reviews are generally done on a refinery, plant, marketing area or marketing
assets by country basis. Impairment amounts are recorded as incremental “Depreciation, depletion
and amortization” expense.

Long-lived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the
carrying value of the asset with its fair value less the cost to sell. If the net book value
exceeds the fair value less cost to sell, the asset is considered impaired and adjusted to the
lower value.

Effective January 1, 2003, the company implemented Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement
No. 143,

“Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (FAS 143),”

in which the fair value of a
liability for an asset retirement obligation is recorded as an asset and a liability when there is
a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a long-lived asset and the amount can be
reasonably estimated. Refer also to Note 25 on page FS-53 relating to asset retirement obligations,
which includes additional information on the company’s adoption of FAS 143. Previously, for crude
oil, natural gas and coal producing properties, a provision was made through depreciation expense
for anticipated abandonment and restoration costs at the end of the property’s useful life.

Depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude oil and natural gas producing
properties, except mineral interests, are expensed using the unit-of-production method by
individual field as the proved developed reserves are produced. Depletion expenses for capitalized
costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using the unit-of-production method by individual
field as the related proved reserves are produced. Periodic valuation provisions for impairment of
capitalized costs of unproved mineral interests are expensed.

Depreciation and depletion expenses for coal assets are determined using the unit-of-production
method as the proved reserves are produced. The capitalized costs of all other plant and equipment
are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives. In general, the declining-balance
method is used to depreciate plant and equipment in the United States; the straight-line method
generally is used to depreciate international plant and equipment and to amortize all capitalized
leased assets.

Gains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties, plant and equipment
subject to composite group amortization or depreciation. Gains or losses from abnormal retirements
are recorded as expenses, and from sales as “Other income.”

Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor renewals to maintain facilities in operating condition are generally expensed as
incurred. Major replacements and renewals are capitalized.

Environmental Expenditures

Environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing operations or to
conditions caused by past operations are expensed. Expenditures that create future benefits or
contribute to future revenue generation are capitalized.

Liabilities related to future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments or
cleanups or both are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. For the company’s U.S. and
Canadian marketing facilities, the accrual is based in part on the probability that a future
remediation commitment will be required. For oil, gas and coal producing properties, a liability
for an asset retirement obligation is made, following FAS 143. Refer to “Properties, Plant and
Equipment” in this note for a discussion of FAS 143.

For federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, the company records a liability
for its designated share of the probable and estimable costs and probable amounts for other
potentially responsible parties when mandated by the regulatory agencies because the other parties
are not able to pay their respective shares.

The gross amount of environmental liabilities is based on the company’s best estimate of future
costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations and the company’s own
internal environmental policies. Future amounts are not discounted. Recoveries or reimbursements
are recorded as assets when receipt is reasonably assured.

Currency Translation

The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for substantially all of the
company’s consolidated operations and those of its equity affiliates. For those operations, all
gains and losses from currency translations are currently included in income. The cumulative
translation effects for those few entities, both consolidated and affiliated, using functional
currencies other than the U.S. dollar are included in the currency translation adjustment in
“Stockholders’ equity.”

Revenue Recognition

Revenues associated with sales of crude oil, natural gas, coal, petroleum and
chemicals products and all other sources are recorded when title passes to the customer, net of
royalties, discounts and allowances, as applicable. Revenues from natural gas production from
properties in which ChevronTexaco has an interest with other producers are generally recognized on
the basis of the company’s net working interest (entitlement method). Refer to Note 16 on page
FS-41 for a discussion of the accounting for buy/sell arrangements.

Stock Compensation

At December 31, 2004, the company had stock-based employee compensation plans,
which are described

Costs of stock appreciation rights reported in net income and included in the
fair-value method for these rights were $10, $1 and $(1) for 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.


The fair value is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for stock
options. Stock appreciation rights are estimated based on the method outlined in
SFAS 123 for these instruments.


Per-share amounts in all periods reflect a two-for-one stock split effected as a
100 percent stock dividend in September 2004.


The amounts in 2003 include a benefit of $0.08 for the company’s share of a
capital stock transaction of its Dynegy Inc. affiliate, which under the applicable
accounting rules was recorded directly to the company’s retained earnings and not
included in net income for the period.

Refer to Note 20 beginning on page FS-44 for a discussion of the company’s plan to implement FASB
statement No. 123R,

“Share-Based Payment,”

effective July 1, 2005.

NOTE 2.

SPECIAL ITEMS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Net income for each period presented includes amounts categorized by the company as “special
items,” to assist in the explanation of the trend of results.

Listed in the following table are categories of these items and their net increase (decrease) to
net income, after related tax effects.

In 2004, the company recorded special gains of $1,217 from the sale of nonstrategic crude oil and
natural gas assets, primarily in the United States and Canada, and a special charge of $55 for a
litigation matter.

In 2003, impairments of $103 and $30, respectively, were recorded for various U.S. and
international oil and gas producing properties, reflecting lower expected recovery of proved
reserves or a write-down to market value for assets in anticipation of sale. Impairments of $123 on
downstream assets were for

the conversion of a refinery to a products terminal and a write-down to
market value for assets in anticipation of sale. Also in 2003, ChevronTexaco exchanged its Dynegy
Series B Preferred Stock for cash, notes and Series C Preferred Stock. The $365 difference between
the fair value of these items and the company’s carrying value was included in net income.

In 2002, the company recorded write-downs of $1,626 of its investment in Dynegy common and
preferred stock and $136 of its investment in its publicly traded Caltex Australia affiliate to
their respective estimated fair values. The write-downs were required because the declines in the
fair values of the investments below their carrying values were deemed to be other than temporary.
Refer to Note 14 beginning on page FS-39 additional information on the company’s investment in
Dynegy and Caltex Australia.

Also in 2002, impairments of $183 were recorded for various U.S. exploration and production
properties and $100 for international projects.

COMMON STOCK SPLIT

On July 28, 2004, the company’s Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split in the form

SUMMARIZED FINANCIAL DATA – CHEVRON U.S.A. INC.

Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (CUSA) is a major subsidiary of ChevronTexaco Corporation. CUSA and its
subsidiaries manage and operate most of ChevronTexaco’s U.S. businesses. Assets include those
related to the exploration and production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and
those associated with the refining, marketing, supply and distribution of products derived from
petroleum, other than natural gas liquids, excluding most of the regulated pipeline operations of
ChevronTexaco. CUSA also holds ChevronTexaco’s investments in the ChevronPhillips Chemical Company
LLC (CPChem) joint venture and Dynegy Inc. (Dynegy), which are accounted for using the equity
method.

During 2003 and 2002, ChevronTexaco implemented legal reorganizations in which certain
ChevronTexaco subsidiaries transferred assets to or under CUSA and other ChevronTexaco companies
were merged with and into CUSA. The summarized financial information for CUSA and its consolidated
subsidiaries presented in the following table gives retroactive effect to the reorganization in a
manner similar to a pooling of interests, with all periods presented as if the companies had always
been combined and the reorganization had occurred on January 1, 2002. However, the financial
information included in this table may not reflect the financial position and operating results in
the future or the historical results in the periods presented had the reorganization actually
occurred on January 1, 2002.

NOTE 8.

FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

Commodity Derivative Instruments

ChevronTexaco is exposed to market risks related to price
volatility of crude oil, refined products, electricity, natural gas and refinery feedstock.

The company uses financial derivative commodity instruments to manage this exposure on a small
portion of its activity, including: firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase
or sale of crude oil; feedstock purchases for company refineries; crude oil and refined products
inventories; and fixed-price contracts to sell natural gas and natural gas liquids. The company
also uses financial derivative commodity instruments for limited trading purposes.

The company maintains a policy of requiring that an International Swaps and Derivatives Association
Agreement govern derivative contracts with certain counterparties to mitigate credit risk.
Depending on the nature of the derivative transaction, bilateral collateral arrangements may also
be required. When the company is engaged in more than one outstanding derivative transaction with
the same counterparty and also has a legally enforceable netting agreement with that counterparty,
the “net” marked-to-market exposure represents the netting of the positive and negative exposures
with that counterparty and a reasonable measure of the company’s credit risk. It is the company’s
policy to use other netting agreements with certain counterparties with which it conducts
significant transactions.

The fair values of the outstanding contracts are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as
“Accounts and notes receivable,” “Accounts payable,” “Long-term receivables – net,” and “Deferred
credits and other noncurrent obligations.” Gains and losses on the company’s risk management
activities are reported as either “Sales and other operating revenues” or “Purchased crude oil and
products,” whereas trading gains and losses are reported as “Other income.” These activities are
reported under “Operating activities” in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

Foreign Currency

The company enters into forward exchange contracts, generally with terms of 180
days or less, to manage some of its foreign currency exposures. These exposures include revenue and
anticipated purchase transactions, including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease
commitments, forecasted to occur within 180 days. The forward exchange contracts are recorded at
fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income.

The fair values of the outstanding contracts are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as
“Accounts and notes receivable” or “Accounts payable,” with gains and losses reported as “Other
income.” These activities are reported under “Operating activities” in the Consolidated Statement
of Cash Flows.

Interest Rates

The company enters into interest rate swaps as part of its overall strategy to
manage the interest rate risk on its debt. Under the terms of the swaps, net cash settlements are
based on the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts calculated by
reference to agreed notional principal amounts. Interest rate swaps related to a portion of the
company’s fixed-rate debt are accounted for as fair value hedges, whereas interest rate swaps
related to a portion of the company’s floating-rate debt are recorded at fair value on the balance
sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income.

During 2004, four new swaps relating to a portion of the company’s fixed-rate debt were initiated.
At year-end 2004, the interest rate swaps outstanding related to fixed-rate debt, and their
weighted average maturity was approximately three years.

Fair values of the interest rate swaps are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as “Accounts
and notes receivable” or “Accounts payable,” with gains and losses reported directly in income as
part of “Interest and debt expense.” These activities are reported under “Operating activities” in
the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

Fair Value

Fair values are derived either from quoted market prices or, if not available, the
present value of the expected cash flows. The fair values reflect the cash that would have been
received or paid if the instruments were settled at year-end.

Long-term debt of $5,815 and $7,229 had estimated fair values of $6,444 and $7,709 at December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively.

For interest rate swaps, the notional principal amounts of $1,665 and $665 had estimated fair
values of $36 and $65 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The company holds cash equivalents and U.S. dollar marketable securities in domestic and offshore
portfolios. Eurodollar bonds, floating-rate notes, time deposits and commercial paper are the
primary instruments held. Cash equivalents and marketable securities had fair values of $8,789 and
$3,803 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Of these balances, $7,338 and $2,803 at the
respective year-ends were classified as cash equivalents that had average maturities under 90 days.
The remainder, classified as marketable securities, had average maturities of approximately 2.3
years.

For the financial and derivative instruments discussed above, there was not a material change in
market risk from that presented in 2003.

Concentrations of Credit Ris

k

The company’s financial instruments that are exposed to
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of its cash equivalents, marketable securities,
derivative financial instruments and trade receivables. The company’s short-term investments are
placed with a wide array of financial institutions with high credit ratings. This diversified
investment policy limits the company’s exposure both to credit risk and to concentrations of credit
risk. Similar standards of diversity and creditworthiness are applied to the company’s
counterparties in derivative instruments.

The trade receivable balances, reflecting the company’s diversified sources of revenue, are
dispersed among the company’s

FS-35


Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS – Continued

broad customer base worldwide. As a consequence, concentrations of credit risk are limited. The
company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers. When the financial strength of
a customer is not considered sufficient, Letters of Credit are the principal security obtained to
support lines of credit.

Investment in Dynegy Notes and Preferred Stock

At the beginning of 2004, the company held
investments in $223 face value of Dynegy Junior Unsecured Subordinated Notes due 2016 and $400 face
value of Dynegy Series C Convertible Preferred Stock with a
stated maturity date of 2033.

The
Junior Notes were redeemed at face value during 2004, and gains of $54 were recorded for the
difference between the face amounts and the carrying values at the time of redemption. The face
value of the company’s investment in the Series C preferred stock at December 31, 2004, was $400.
The stock is recorded at its fair value, which was estimated to be $370 at December 31, 2004.
Future temporary changes in the estimated fair value of the preferred stock will be reported in
“Other comprehensive income.” However, if any future decline in fair value is deemed to be other
than temporary, a charge against income in the period would be recorded. Dividends payable on the
preferred stock are recognized in income each period.

NOTE 9.

OPERATING SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

Although each subsidiary of ChevronTexaco is responsible for its own affairs, ChevronTexaco
Corporation manages its investments in these subsidiaries and their affiliates. For this purpose,
the investments are grouped as follows: upstream – exploration and production; downstream –
refining, marketing and transportation; chemicals; and all other. The first three of these
groupings represent the company’s “reportable segments” and “operating segments” as defined in FAS
131,

“Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.”

The segments are separately managed for investment purposes under a structure that includes
“segment managers” who report to the company’s “chief operating decision maker” (CODM) (terms as
defined in FAS 131). The CODM is the company’s Executive Committee, a committee of senior officers
that includes the Chief Executive Officer and that in turn reports to the Board of Directors of
ChevronTexaco Corporation.

The operating segments represent components of the company as described in FAS 131 terms that
engage in activities (a) from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred; (b) whose
operating results are regularly reviewed by the CODM, which makes decisions about resources to be
allocated to the segments, and to assess their performance; and (c) for which discrete financial
information is available.

Segment managers for the reportable segments are directly accountable to and maintain regular
contact with the company’s CODM to discuss the segment’s operating activities and financial
performance. The CODM approves annual capital and exploratory budgets at the reportable segment
level and also approves capital and exploratory funding for major projects and major changes to the
annual capital and exploratory budgets. However, business-unit managers within the operating
segments are directly responsible for decisions relating to project implementation and all

other matters connected with daily operations. Company officers who are members of the Executive
Committee also have individual management responsibilities and participate in other committees for
purposes other than acting as the CODM.

“All Other” activities include the company’s interest in Dynegy, coal mining operations, power
generation businesses, worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate
administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.

The company’s primary country of operation is the United States of America, its country of
domicile. Other components of the company’s operations are reported as “International” (outside the
United States).

Segment Earnings

The company evaluates the performance of its operating segments on an after-tax
basis, without considering the effects of debt financing interest expense or investment interest
income, both of which are managed by the company on a worldwide basis. Corporate administrative
costs and assets are not allocated to the operating segments. However, operating segments are
billed for the direct use of corporate services. Nonbillable costs remain at the corporate level in
“All Other.” Merger-related expenses in 2002 were also included in “All Other.” After-tax segment
income (loss) from continuing operations is presented in the following table:

Segment Sales and Other Operating Revenues

Operating segment sales and other operating revenues,
including internal transfers, for the years 2004, 2003 and 2002 are presented in the following
table. Products are transferred between operating segments at internal product values that
approximate market prices.

Revenues for the upstream segment are derived primarily from the
production of crude oil and natural gas, as well as the sale of third-party production of natural
gas. Revenues for the downstream segment are derived from the refining and marketing of petroleum
products, such as gasoline, jet fuel, gas oils, kerosene, lubricants, residual fuel oils and other
products derived from crude oil. This segment also generates revenues from the transportation and
trading of crude oil and refined products. Revenues for the chemicals segment are derived
primarily from the manufacture and sale of additives for lubricants and fuel. “All Other”
activities include revenues from coal mining operations, power generation businesses, insurance
operations, real estate activities and technology companies.

Other than the United States, the only country where ChevronTexaco generates significant
revenues is the United Kingdom, where revenues amounted to $13,985, $12,121 and $10,816 in 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively.

NOTE 10.

LITIGATION

The company and many other companies in the petroleum industry have used methyl tertiary butyl
ether (MTBE) as a gasoline additive.

The company is a party to more than 70 lawsuits and claims, the majority of which involve
numerous other petroleum marketers and refiners, related to the use of MTBE in certain oxygenated
gasolines and the alleged seepage of MTBE into groundwater. Resolution of these actions may
ultimately require the company to correct or ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of
prior release of MTBE by the company or other parties. Additional lawsuits and claims related to
the use of MTBE, including personal-injury claims, may be filed in the future.

The company’s ultimate exposure related to these lawsuits and claims is not currently
determinable, but could be material to net income in any one period. The company does not use MTBE
in the manufacture of gasoline in the United States and there are no detectable levels of MTBE in
that gasoline.

NOTE 11.

LEASE COMMITMENTS

Certain noncancelable leases are classified as capital leases, and the leased assets are included
as part of “Properties, plant and equipment, at cost.” Such leasing arrangements involve tanker
charters, crude oil production and processing equipment, service stations, and other facilities.
Other leases are classified as operating leases and are not capitalized. The payments on such
leases are recorded as expense. Details of the capitalized leased assets are as follows:

RESTRUCTURING AND REORGANIZATION COSTS

NOTE 12.

RESTRUCTURING AND REORGANIZATION COSTS

In connection with various reorganizations and restructurings across several businesses and
corporate departments, the company recorded before-tax charges of $258 ($146 after tax) during 2003
for estimated termination benefits for approximately 4,500 employees. Nearly half of the liability
related to the global downstream segment. Substantially all of the employee reductions are expected
to occur by the end of 2005.

At the beginning of 2004, a $100 liability remained for employee severance charges recorded in
2002 and 2001 associated with the merger between Chevron Corporation and Texaco Inc. The balance
related primarily to deferred payment options elected by certain employees who were terminated
before the end of 2003. Approximately $80 of the liability was paid during 2004 and the remainder
in January 2005.

Activity for the company’s liability related to reorganizations and restructurings in 2004 is
summarized in the following table:

Substantially all of the balance at December 31, 2004, related to employee severance costs
that were part of a presumed ongoing benefit arrangement under applicable accounting rules in FAS
146,

“Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities,”

paragraph 8, footnote 7.
Therefore, the company accounts for severance costs in accordance with FAS 88,

“Employers’
Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits.”

At December 31, 2004, the amount was categorized as a current accrued liability on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet and the associated charges during the period were categorized as
“Operating expenses” or “Selling, general and administrative expenses” on the Consolidated
Statement of Income.

NOTE 13.

ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

At December 31, 2004, and December 31, 2003, the company classified $162 and $1,100, respectively,
of net properties, plant and equipment as “Assets held for sale” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Assets in this category at the end of 2004 related to a group of service stations. These assets are
expected to be disposed of in 2005.

Summarized income statement information relating to discontinued operations is as follows:

Included in the 2004 after-tax amount were gains totaling $257 related to the sale of a
Canadian natural-gas processing business, a wholly owned subsidiary in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo and certain producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico.

Not all assets sold or to be disposed of are classified as discontinued operations, mainly
because the cash flows from the assets were not/will not be eliminated from the ongoing operations
of the company.

Descriptions of major affiliates are as follows:

Tengizchevroil

ChevronTexaco has a 50 percent equity ownership interest in TCO, a joint venture
formed in 1993 to develop the Tengiz and Korolev oil fields in Kazakhstan over a 40-year period.

In 2004, as part of the funding of the expansion of TCO’s production facilities, ChevronTexaco
purchased from TCO $2,200 of 6.124 percent Series B Notes, due 2014, guaranteed by TCO. Interest on the notes
is payable semiannually and principal is to be repaid semiannually in equal installments beginning
in February 2008. Immediately following the purchase of the Series B Notes, ChevronTexaco received
from TCO approximately $1,800 representing a repayment of subordinated loans from the company,
interest and dividends. The $2,200 investment in the Series B Notes, which the company intends to
hold to their

maturity, and the $1,800 distribution were recorded to “Investments and Advances.”

LG-Caltex Oil Corporation

ChevronTexaco owns 50 percent of LG-Caltex, a joint venture formed in
1967 between the LG Group and Caltex to engage in importing, refining and marketing of petroleum
products and petrochemicals in South Korea.

Star Petroleum Refining Company Ltd.

ChevronTexaco has a 64 percent equity ownership interest in
Star Petroleum Refining Company Limited (SPRC), which owns the Star Refinery at Map Ta Phut,
Thailand. The Petroleum Authority of Thailand owns the remaining 36 percent of SPRC.

Caltex Australia Ltd.

ChevronTexaco has a 50 percent equity ownership interest in Caltex Australia
Limited (CAL). The remaining 50 percent of CAL is publicly owned. During 2002, the company wrote
down its investment in CAL by $136 to its estimated fair value at September 30, 2002. At December
31, 2004, the fair value of ChevronTexaco’s share of CAL common stock was $1,130. The aggregate
carrying value of the company’s investment in CAL was approximately $80 lower than the amount of
underlying equity in CAL net assets.

Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC

ChevronTexaco owns 50 percent of CPChem, formed in 2000 when
Chevron merged most of its petrochemicals businesses with those of Phillips Petroleum Company. At
December 31, 2004, the company’s carrying value of its investment in CPChem was approximately $130
lower than the amount of underlying equity in CPChem’s net assets.

Dynegy Inc.

ChevronTexaco owns an approximate 25 percent equity interest in the common stock of
Dynegy, an energy provider engaged in power generation, the gathering and processing

of natural gas, and the fractionation, storage, transportation and marketing of natural gas liquids. The
company also holds investments in Dynegy preferred stock.

Investment in Dynegy Common Stock

At December 31, 2004, the carrying value of the company’s
investment in Dynegy common stock was approximately $150. This amount was about $365 below the
company’s proportionate interest in Dynegy’s underlying net assets. This difference is primarily
the result of write-downs of the investment in 2002 for declines in the market value of the common
shares below the company’s carrying value that were deemed to be other than temporary. This
difference has been assigned to the extent practicable to specific Dynegy assets and liabilities,
based upon the company’s analysis of the various factors contributing to the decline in value of
the Dynegy shares. The company’s equity share of Dynegy’s reported earnings is adjusted quarterly
when appropriate to reflect the difference between these allocated values and Dynegy’s historical
book values. The market value of the company’s investment in Dynegy’s common stock at December 31,
2004, was approximately $450.

Investments in Dynegy Notes and Preferred Stock

NOTE 16.

ACCOUNTING FOR BUY/SELL CONTRACTS

In January and February 2005, the SEC issued comment letters to ChevronTexaco and other
companies in the oil and gas industry requesting disclosure of information related to the
accounting for buy/sell contracts. Under a buy/sell contract, a company agrees to buy a specific
quantity and quality of a commodity to be delivered at a specific location while simultaneously
agreeing to sell a specified quantity and quality of a commodity at a different location to the
same counterparty. Physical delivery occurs for each side of the transaction, and the risk and
reward of ownership are evidenced by title transfer, assumption of environmental risk,
transportation scheduling, credit risk, and risk of nonperformance by the counterparty. Both
parties settle each side of the buy/sell through separate invoicing.

The company routinely has buy/sell contracts, primarily in the United States downstream
business, associated with crude oil and refined products. For crude oil, these contracts are used
to facilitate the company’s crude oil marketing activity, which includes the purchase and sale of
crude oil production, fulfillment of the company’s supply arrangements as to physical delivery
location and crude oil specifications, and purchase of crude oil to supply the company’s refining
system. For refined products,

buy/sell arrangements are used to help fulfill the company’s
supply agreements to customer locations and specifications.

The company accounts for buy/sell transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Income the
same as any other monetary transaction for which title passes, and the risks and rewards of
ownership are assumed by the counterparties. At issue with the SEC is whether the industry’s
accounting for buy/sell contracts instead should be shown net on the income statement and accounted
for under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 29,

“Accounting for
Nonmonetary Transactions”

(APB 29).

The topic is under deliberation by the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) of the FASB as Issue
No. 04-13,

“Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty.”

The EITF
first discussed this issue in November 2004. Additional research is being performed by the FASB
staff, and the topic will be discussed again at a future EITF meeting. While this issue is under
deliberation, the SEC staff directed ChevronTexaco and other companies in its January and February
2005 comment letters to disclose on the face of the income statement the amounts associated with
buy/sell contracts and to discuss in a footnote to the financial statements the basis for the
underlying accounting.

With regard to the latter, the company’s accounting treatment for buy/sell
contracts is based on the view that such

FS-41


Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts


NOTE 16.

ACCOUNTING FOR BUY/SELL CONTRACTS – Continued

transactions are monetary in nature. Monetary transactions are outside the scope of APB 29. The
company believes its accounting is also supported by the indicators of gross reporting of purchases
and sales in paragraph 3 of EITF Issue No. 99-19,

“Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus
Net as an Agent.”

Additionally, FASB Interpretation No. 39,

“Offsetting of Amounts Related to
Certain Contracts”

(FIN 39), prohibits a receivable from being netted against a payable when the
receivable is subject to credit risk unless a right of offset exists that is enforceable by law.
The company also views netting the separate components of buy/sell contracts in the income
statement to be inconsistent with the gross presentation that FIN 39 requires for the resulting
receivable and payable on the balance sheet.

The company’s buy/sell transactions are also similar
to the “barrel back” example used in other accounting literature, including EITF Issue No. 03-11,

“Reporting Realized Gains and Losses on Derivative Instruments That Are Subject to FASB Statement
No. 133 and Not ‘Held for Trading Purposes’ as Defined in Issue No. 02-3”

(which indicates a
company’s decision to show buy/sell-types of transactions gross on the income statement as being a
matter of judgment of the relevant facts and circumstances of the company’s activities) and
Derivatives Implementation Group (DIG) Issue No. K1,

“Miscellaneous: Determining Whether Separate
Transactions Should be Viewed as a Unit.”

The company further notes that the accounting for buy/sell contracts as separate purchases and
sales is in contrast to the accounting for other types of contracts typically described by the
industry as exchange contracts, which are considered non-monetary in nature and appropriately shown
net on the income statement. Under an exchange contract, for example, one company agrees to
exchange refined products in one location for another company’s same quantity of refined products
in another location. Upon transfer, the only amounts that may be invoiced are for transportation
and quality differentials. Among other things, unlike buy/sell contracts, the obligations of each
party to perform under the
contract are not independent and the risks and rewards of ownership are not separately
transferred.

As shown on the company’s Consolidated Statement of Income, “Sales and other operating
revenues” for the three years ending December 31, 2004, included $18,650, $14,246 and $7,963,
respectively, for buy/sell contracts. The costs associated with these buy/sell revenue amounts are
included in “Purchased crude oil and products” on the Consolidated Statement of Income in each
period.

In 2004, the before-tax income for U.S. operations, including related corporate and other
charges, was $7,776, compared with a before-tax income of $5,664 in 2003 and a before-tax loss of
$2,162 in 2002. For international operations, before-tax income was $12,775, $7,012 and $6,262 in
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. U.S. federal income tax expense was reduced by $176, $196 and

The valuation allowance relates to foreign tax credit carryforwards, tax loss carryforwards
and temporary differences for which no benefit is expected to be realized. Tax loss carryforwards
exist in many foreign jurisdictions. Whereas some of these tax loss carryforwards do not have an
expiration date, others expire at various times from 2005 through 2011. Foreign tax credit
carryforwards of $93 will expire in 2014.

It is the company’s policy for subsidiaries that are included in the U.S. consolidated tax
return to record income tax expense as though they file separately, with the parent recording the
adjustment to income tax expense for the effects of consolidation.

Income taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have
been or are intended to be reinvested indefinitely.

Undistributed earnings of international consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates for which no
deferred income tax provision has been made for possible future remittances totaled approximately
$10,000 at December 31, 2004. A significant majority of this amount represents earnings reinvested
as part of the company’s ongoing international business. It is not practicable to estimate the
amount of taxes that might be payable on the eventual remittance of such earnings. The company does
not

anticipate incurring additional taxes on remittances of earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested.

American Jobs Creation Act of 2004

In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 was
passed into law. The Act provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic refining and
upstream production activities, which will be phased in from 2005 through 2010. For that specific
category of income, the company expects the net effect of this provision of the Act to result in a
decrease in the federal effective tax rate for 2005 and 2006 to approximately 34 percent, based on
current earnings levels. In the long term, the company expects that the new deduction will result
in a decrease of the federal effective tax rate to about 32 percent for that category of income,
based on current earnings
levels.

Under the guidance in FASB Staff Position No. FAS 109-1,

“Application of FASB Statement No.
109, ‘Accounting for Income Taxes,’ to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities
Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004,”

the tax deduction on qualified production
activities provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 will be treated as a “special
deduction,” as described in FAS 109. As such, the special deduction has no effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities existing at the enactment date. Rather, the impact of this deduction will be
reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on the company’s tax return.

The Act also provides for a limited opportunity to repatriate earnings from outside the United
States at a special reduced tax rate that can be as low as 5.25 percent. In early 2005, the company
was in the process of reviewing the guidance that the IRS issued on January 13, 2005, regarding
this provision and also considering other relevant information. The company does not anticipate a
major change in its plans for repatriating earnings from international operations under the
provisions of the Act.

Weighted-average interest rates at December 31, 2004 and 2003, were 1.98 percent and 1.01
percent, respectively.

Redeemable long-term obligations consist primarily of tax-exempt variable-rate put bonds that
are included as current liabilities because they become redeemable at the option of the bondholders
during the year following the balance sheet date.

The company periodically enters into interest rate swaps on a portion of its short-term debt.
See Note 8 beginning on page FS-35 for information concerning the company’s debt-related derivative
activities.

At December 31, 2004, the company had $4,735 of committed credit facilities with banks
worldwide, which permit the company to refinance short-term obligations on a long-term basis. The
facilities support the company’s commercial paper borrowings. Interest on borrowings under the
terms of specific agreements may be based on the London Interbank Offered Rate or bank prime rate.
No amounts were outstanding under these credit agreements during 2004 or at year-end.

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the company classified $4,735 and $4,285, respectively, of
short-term debt as long-term. Settlement of these obligations is not expected to require the use of
working capital in 2005, as the company has both the intent and the ability to refinance this debt
on a long-term basis.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

FASB Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities”

(FIN 46)

FIN 46 was
issued in January 2003 and established standards for determining under what circumstances a
variable interest entity (VIE) should be consolidated by its primary beneficiary. FIN 46 also
requires disclosures about VIEs that the company is not required to consolidate but in which it has
a significant variable interest. In December 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46-R, which not only
included amendments to FIN 46, but also required application of the interpretation to all affected
entities no later than March 31, 2004, for calendar year- reporting companies. Prior to this
requirement, companies were required to apply the interpretation to special-purpose entities by
December 31, 2003. The full adoption of the interpretation as of March 31, 2004, including the
requirement relating to special-purpose entities, did not have an impact on the company’s results
of operations, financial position or liquidity.

In December 2003,
the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) became law. The
Act

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS – Continued

introduced a prescription drug benefit under Medicare, as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of
retiree health care plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to
Medicare Part D. In May 2004, the FASB issued FSP FAS 106-2. One U.S. subsidiary was deemed at
least actuarially equivalent and eligible for the federal subsidy. The effect on the company’s
postretirement benefit obligation and the associated annual expense was

de minimis.

FASB Statement No. 151, “Inventory Costs, an Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4”

(FAS 151)

In
November 2004, the FASB issued FAS 151 which is effective for the company on January 1, 2006. The
standard amends the guidance in Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 43, Chapter 4,

“Inventory
Pricing,”

to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight,
handling costs and spoilage. In addition, the standard requires that allocation of fixed
production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production
facilities. The company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard.

FASB Statement No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment”

(FAS 123R)

In December 2004, the FASB issued FAS
123R, which requires that compensation costs relating to share-based payments be recognized in the
company’s financial statements. The company currently accounts for those payments under the
recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25,

“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,”

and related interpretations. The company is preparing
to implement this standard effective July 1, 2005. Although the transition method to be used to
adopt the standard has not been selected, the impact of adoption is expected to have a minimal
impact on the company’s results of operations, financial position and liquidity. Refer to Note 1,
beginning on page FS-30, for the company’s calculation of the pro forma impact on net income of FAS
123, which would be similar to that under FAS 123R.

FASB Statement No. 153, “Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, – an Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29,”

(FAS 153)

In December 2004, the FASB issued FAS 153, which is effective for the company for
asset-exchange transactions beginning July 1, 2005. Under APB 29, assets received in certain types
of nonmonetary exchanges were permitted to be recorded at the carrying value of the assets that
were exchanged (i.e., recorded on a carryover basis). As amended by FAS 153, assets received in
some circumstances will have to be recorded instead at their fair values. In the past,
ChevronTexaco has not engaged in a large number of nonmon-etary asset exchanges for significant
amounts.

NOTE 21.

ACCOUNTING FOR SUSPENDED EXPLORATORY WELLS

Refer to Note 1 on page FS-30 in the section “Properties, Plant and Equipment” for a discussion of
the company’s accounting policy for the cost of exploratory wells. The company’s suspended wells
are reviewed in this context on a
quarterly basis.

The SEC issued comment letters during 2004 and in February 2005 to a number of companies in
the oil and gas industry related to the accounting for suspended exploratory wells, particularly
for those suspended under certain circumstances for more

than one year. In February 2005, the FASB
issued a proposed FSP to amend FAS 19,

“Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing
Companies.”

Under the provisions of the draft FSP, exploratory well costs would continue to be
capitalized after the completion of drilling when (a) the well has found a sufficient quantity of
reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (b) the enterprise is making sufficient
progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. If either
condition is not met or if an enterprise obtains information that raises substantial doubt about
the economic or operational viability of the project, the exploratory well would be assumed to be
impaired, and its costs, net of any salvage value, would be charged to expense. The FSP provided a
number of indicators needing to be present to demonstrate sufficient progress was being made in
assessing the reserves and economic viability of the project.

The company will monitor the continuing deliberations of the FASB on this matter and the
possible implications, if any, to the company’s accounting policy and the amounts capitalized for
suspended-well costs. The disclosures and discussion below address those suggested in the draft FSP
and in the additional guidance issued by the SEC in its February 2005 comment letter to companies
in the oil and gas industry.

The following table indicates the changes to the company’s suspended exploratory-well costs
for the three years ended December 31, 2004:

areas requiring a major capital expenditure before production could begin and for which additional
drilling efforts were not under way or firmly planned

ACCOUNTING FOR EXPLORATORY WELLS – Continued

for the near future because the presence of hydrocarbons had already been established and other
activities were in process to enable a future decision on project development. The balance related
to wells in areas for which drilling was under way or firmly planned for the near future.

Of the $290, approximately $50 related to the well costs suspended one year or less since
drilling was completed, and $240 related to costs suspended for more than one year since the
completion of drilling. Of the $240 for 11 projects suspended for more than one year since the
completion of drilling, activities associated with assessing the reserves and the projects’
economic viability included: (a) $75 – discussions of joint development with an operator in an
adjacent field and selection of subsurface and development plans, with front-end-engineering and
design (FEED) expected to begin in 2005 (one project); (b) $63 – negotiations with contractors for
FEED and negotiations with potential customers for natural gas (two projects); (c) $42 – award of
contracts for FEED and finalization of fiscal issues with the host country (one project); (d) $20
- - finalization of commercial terms with partners with award of detailed engineering and design
contracts expected by the end of 2005 (one project); and (e) $40 – miscellaneous activities for
projects with smaller amounts suspended. Progress is being made on all projects in this category;
and the decision on the recognition of proved reserves under SEC rules in some cases may not occur
for several years because of the complexity, scale and negotiations connected with the projects.

Included in the $449 in the table on the preceding page for year-end 2004 well costs were $42
for four projects and $50 for one project that related to costs suspended in 2000 and 1998,
respectively, when drilling in the associated project areas was completed. Certain wells in the
project areas may have been suspended prior to these years of last drilling. Other well costs in
the $449 total were associated with projects for which drilling was completed since 2000.

If an FSP is implemented similar to the draft issued in February 2005, the company does not
believe it would result in

the immediate expensing of a significant amount of suspended-well
costs. However, the SEC staff has indicated that it generally would not view conducting
environmental and engineering design studies as reasonable support for the suspending of costs
beyond one year after drilling is complete. If such restrictions are included in the final FSP,
the company may be required to expense a significant amount for wells that had found sufficient
hydrocarbons to justify their completion as producing wells and for projects the company continued
to consider economically and operationally viable. If a final rule required the company to expense
the entire $240 before-tax carrying value for the 11 projects referenced above that were suspended
as of December 31, 2004, for more than one year after the completion of drilling, the after-tax
charge to earnings would be $150.

NOTE 22.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

The company has defined-benefit pension plans for many employees. The company typically funds
only those defined-benefit plans for which funding is required under laws and regulations. In the
United States, this includes all qualified tax-exempt plans subject to the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act (ERISA) minimum funding standard. The company typically does not fund domestic
nonqualified tax-exempt pension plans that are not subject to funding requirements under laws and
regulations because contributions to these pension plans may be less economic and investment
returns may be less attractive than the company’s other investment alternatives.

The company also sponsors other postretirement plans that provide medical and dental benefits,
as well as life insurance for some active and qualifying retired employees. The plans are
unfunded, and the company and the retirees share the costs. In June 2004, the company announced
changes to its primary U.S. postretirement benefit plan, which include a limit on future increases
in the company contribution, an increase in service points (combination of age and years of company
service) required to receive full coverage, and the plan’s prescription drug coverage for retirees
becoming secondary to Medicare Part D. Life insurance benefits are paid by the company and annual
contributions are based on actual plan experience.

The company uses a measurement date of December 31 to value its pension and other
postretirement benefit plan obligations.

* Discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets were reviewed and updated as
needed on a quarterly basis for the main U.S. pension plan.

Expected Return on Plan Assets

The company employs a rigorous process to determine the estimates of
long-term rate of return on pension assets. These estimates are primarily driven by actual
historical asset-class returns, an assessment of expected future performance and advice from
external actuarial firms while incorporating specific asset class risk factors. Asset allocations
are regularly updated using pension plan asset/liability studies, and the determination of the
company’s estimates of long-term rates of return are consistent with these studies.

There have been no changes in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets since 2002
for U.S. plans, which account for about 70 percent of the company’s pension plan assets. At
December 31, 2004, the estimated long-term rate of return on U.S. pension plan assets was 7.8
percent.

The year-end market-related value of U.S. pension plan assets used in the determination of
pension expense was based on the market values in the preceding three months, as opposed to the
maximum allowable period of five years under U.S. accounting rules. Management considers the
three-month time period long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from day-to-day market
volatility and yet still be contemporaneous to the end of the year. For plans outside the U.S.,
market value of assets as of the measurement date is used in calculating the pension expense.

Other Benefit Assumptions

Effective January 1, 2005, the company amended its main U.S.
postretirement medical plan to limit future increases in the company contribution. For current
retirees, the increase in company contribution is capped at 4 percent each year. For future
retirees, the 4 percent cap will be effective at retirement. Before retirement, the assumed health
care cost trend rates start with 10.6 percent in 2004 and gradually drop to 4.8 percent for 2010
and beyond. Once the employee elects to retire, the trend rates are capped at 4 percent.

For the measurement of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2003, the assumed
heath care cost trend rates start with 8.4 percent in 2003 and gradually decline to 4.5 percent for
2007 and beyond.

Assumed health care cost-trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for
retiree health care costs. A change of one percentage point in the assumed health care cost-trend
rates would have the following effects:

The pension plans invest primarily in asset categories with sufficient size, liquidity and
cost efficiency to permit investments of reasonable size. The pension plans invest in asset
categories that provide diversification benefits and are easily measured. To assess the plans’
investment performance, long-term asset allocation policy benchmarks
have been established.

For the primary U.S. pension plan, the ChevronTexaco Board of Directors has established the following
approved asset allocation ranges: Equities 40-70 percent, Fixed Income 20-65 percent, Real Estate
0-15 percent. The significant international pension plans also have established maximum and
minimum asset allocation ranges that vary by each plan. Actual asset allocation within approved
ranges is based on a variety of current economic and market conditions and consideration of specific asset category risk.

Equities include investments in the company’s common stock in the amount of $8 and $6 at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The “Other” asset category includes investments in
private equity limited partnerships.

Cash Contributions and benefit Payments

In 2004, the company contributed $1,332 and $311 to its
U.S. and international pension plans, respectively. In 2005, the company expects contributions to
be approximately $250 and $150 to its U.S. and international pension plans, respectively. Actual
contribution amounts are dependent upon investment returns, changes in pension obligations,
regulatory environments and other economic factors. Additional funding may ultimately be required
if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations.

The company anticipates paying other postretirement benefits of approximately $220 in 2005,
as compared with $199 in 2004.

The following benefit payments, which include estimated future service, are expected to be
paid by the company in the next 10 years:

Employee Savings Investment Plan

Eligible employees of
ChevronTexaco and certain of its subsidiaries participate in the ChevronTexaco Employee Savings
Investment Plan
(ESIP). In 2002, the Employees Thrift Plan of Texaco Inc., Employees Savings Plan of ChevronTexaco
Global Energy Inc. (formerly Caltex Corporation), Stock Plan of ChevronTexaco Global Energy, Inc.,
and Employees Thrift Plan of Fuel and Marine Marketing LLC were merged into the ChevronTexaco ESIP.

Charges to expense for the ESIP represent the company’s contributions to the plan, which are
funded either through the purchase of shares of common stock on the open market or through the
release of common stock held in the leveraged employee stock ownership plan (LESOP), which is
discussed below. Total company matching contributions to employee accounts within the ESIP were
$139, $136 and $136 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. This cost was reduced by the value of
shares released from the LESOP totaling $(138), $(23) and $(73) in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The remaining amounts, totaling $1, $113 and $63 in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, represent open market purchases.

Employee Stock Ownership Plan

Within the ChevronTexaco Employee Savings Investment Plan (ESIP), is
an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP). In 1989, Chevron established a leveraged employee stock
ownership plan (LESOP) as a constituent part of the ESOP. The LESOP provides partial prefunding of
the company’s future commitments to the ESIP.

As permitted by American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of
Position 93-6,

“Employers’ Accounting for Employee Stock Ownership Plans,”

the company has elected
to continue its practices, which are based on AICPA 76-3,

“Accounting Practices for Certain
Employee Stock Ownership Plans,”

and subsequent consensus of the EITF of the FASB. The debt of the
LESOP is recorded as debt, and shares pledged as collateral are reported as “Deferred compensation
and benefit plan trust” in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the Consolidated Statement of
Stockholders’ Equity.

The company reports compensation expense equal to LESOP debt principal repayments less
dividends received and used by the LESOP for debt service. Interest accrued on the LESOP debt is
recorded as interest expense. Dividends paid on LESOP shares are reflected as a reduction of
retained earnings. All LESOP shares are considered outstanding for
earnings-per-share computations.

Total (credits) expenses recorded for the LESOP were $(29), $24 and $98 in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, including $23, $28 and $32 of interest expense related to LESOP debt and a (credit)
charge to compensation expense of $(52), $(4) and $66.

Of the dividends paid on the LESOP shares,
$52, $61 and $49 were used in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, to service LESOP debt. Included in
the 2004 amount was a repayment of debt entered into in 1999 to pay interest on the ESOP debt.
Interest expense on this debt was recognized and reported as LESOP interest expense in 1999. In
addition, the company made no contributions in 2004 and contributions of $26 and $102 in 2003

and
2002, respectively, to satisfy LESOP debt service in excess of
dividends received by the LESOP.

In January 2005, the company contributed $98 to permit the LESOP to make a $144 debt service
payment, which included a principal payment of $113.

Shares held in the LESOP are released and allocated to the accounts of plan participants based
on debt service deemed to be paid in the year in proportion to the total of current-year and
remaining debt service. LESOP shares as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, were as follows:

Benefit Plan Trust

Texaco established a benefit plan trust for funding obligations under some of
its benefit plans. At year-end 2004, the trust contained 14.2 million shares of ChevronTexaco treasury stock. The company
intends to continue to pay its obligations under the benefit plans. The trust will sell the shares
or use the dividends from the shares to pay benefits only to the extent that the company does not
pay such benefits. The trustee will vote the shares held in the trust as instructed by the trust’s
beneficiaries. The shares held in the trust are not considered outstanding for earnings-per-share
purposes until distributed or sold by the trust in payment of benefit obligations.

Management Incentive Plans

ChevronTexaco has two incentive plans, the Management Incentive Plan
(MIP) and the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), for officers and other regular salaried employees of
the company and its subsidiaries who hold positions of significant responsibility. The plans were
expanded in 2002 to include former employees of Texaco and Caltex. The MIP is an annual cash
incentive plan that links awards to performance results of the prior year. The cash awards may be
deferred by the recipients by conversion to stock units or other investment fund alternatives.
Awards under the LTIP may take the form of, but are not limited to, stock options, restricted
stock, stock units and nonstock grants. Texaco also had a cash incentive program and a Stock
Incentive Plan (SIP) that included stock options, restricted stock and other incentive awards for
executives, directors and key employees. Awards under the Caltex LTIP were in the form of
performance units and stock appreciation rights. Aggregate charges to expense for these management
incentive plans, excluding expense related to LTIP and SIP stock options and restricted stock
awards that are discussed in Note 23 that follows, were $214, $148 and $48 in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Included in this amount for 2004 was $14 related to stock appreciation rights.

Other Incentive Plans

The company has a program that provides eligible employees, other than those
covered by MIP and LTIP, with an annual cash bonus if the company achieves certain financial and
safety goals. Charges for the program were $339, $151 and $158 in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

NOTE 23.

STOCK OPTIONS

The company applies APB Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for its
stock-based compensation programs. Stock-based compensation expense (credit) recognized in
connection with these programs and the stock appreciation rights discussed above was $16, $2 and
$(2) in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Refer to Note 1 on page FS-30 for the pro forma effects on net income and earnings per share
had the company applied the fair-value-recognition provisions of FAS No. 123.

In the discussion below, the references to share price and number of shares have been adjusted
for the two-for-one stock split in September 2004, which is discussed in Note 3 on page FS-33.

Broad-Based Employee Stock Options

In 1998, Chevron granted to all eligible employees options that
varied from 200 to 600 shares of stock or equivalents, dependent on the employee’s salary or job
grade. These options vested after two years in February 2000 and expire in February 2008. Options
for 9,641,600 shares were awarded at an exercise price of $38.15625 per share. Outstanding option
shares were 4,018,350 at the end of 2002. In 2003, exercises of 23,260 and forfeitures of 122,100
reduced the outstanding option shares to 3,872,990 at the end of the year. In 2004, exercises of
1,720,946 and forfeitures of 42,540 reduced the outstanding option shares to 2,109,504 at the end
of the year. The company recorded expense (credit) of $2, $2 and $(2) for these options in 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively.

The fair value of each option share on the date of grant under FAS No. 123 was estimated at
$9.54 using the average results of Black-Scholes models for the preceding 10 years. The 10-year
averages of each assumption used by the Black-Scholes models were: a risk-free interest rate of 7.0
percent, a dividend yield of 4.2 percent, an expected life of seven years and a volatility of 24.7
percent.

Long-Term Incentive Plan

Stock options granted under the LTIP extend for 10 years from the date of
grant. Effective with options granted in June 2002, one-third of the options vest on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant. Prior to this change, options granted by
Chevron vested one year after the date of grant, whereas options granted by Texaco under its SIP
vested over a two-year period at a rate of 50 percent each year. For a 10-year period after April
2004, no more than 160 million shares may be issued under the Plan, and no more than 64 million of
those shares may be in a form other than a stock option, stock appreciation right or award
requiring full payment for shares by the award recipient. This provision replaced a formula that
restricted annual awards to no more than one percent of shares outstanding at the beginning of each
year. Not counted against the 160 million-share maximum are shares issued as a result of the
exercise options that were granted before the change in formula in 2004.

On the closing of the merger in October 2001, outstanding options granted under the Texaco SIP
were converted to ChevronTexaco options at the merger exchange rate of 0.77. These options retained
a provision for restored options.
This feature enables a participant who exercises a stock option by exchanging previously
acquired common stock or who has shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations to receive
new options equal to the number of shares exchanged or withheld. The restored options are fully
exercisable six months after the date of grant, and the exercise price is the fair market value of
the common stock on the day the restored option is granted. Restricted shares

FS-50



NOTE 23.

STOCK OPTIONS – Continued

granted under the former Texaco plan contained a performance element that had to be satisfied in
order for all or a specified portion of the shares to vest. Upon the merger, all restricted shares
became vested and converted to ChevronTexaco shares at the merger exchange ratio of 0.77. Apart
from the restored options, no further awards may be granted under the former Texaco plans. No
amount for these plans was charged to compensation expense in 2004, 2003 or 2002.

The fair market value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant under FAS
No. 123 using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions:

fair value of the SIP restored options granted during 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $4.00, $4.03 and
$5.15 per share, respectively.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS

Income Taxes

The company estimates its income tax expense and liabilities annually. These
liabilities generally are not finalized with the individual taxing authorities until several
years after the end of the annual period for which income taxes have been estimated. The U.S.
federal income tax liabilities have been settled through 1996 for ChevronTexaco (formerly Chevron
Corporation), 1997 for ChevronTexaco Global Energy Inc. (formerly Caltex) and 1991 for Texaco Inc.
California franchise tax liabilities have been settled through 1991 for Chevron and 1987 for
Texaco. Settlement of open tax years, as well as tax issues in other countries where the company
conducts its businesses, is not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial
position or liquidity of the company, and in the opinion of management, adequate provision has been
made for income and franchise taxes for all years under examination or subject to future
examination.

Guarantees

At December 31, 2004, the company and its subsidiaries provided, either directly or
indirectly, guarantees of $963 for notes and other contractual obligations of affiliated companies
and $130 for third parties, as described by major category below. There are no amounts being
carried as liabilities for the company’s obligations under these guarantees.

Of the $963 guarantees provided to affiliates, $774 relate to borrowings for capital projects or general corporate
purposes. These guarantees were undertaken to achieve lower interest rates and generally cover the
construction period of the capital projects. Approximately 90 percent of the amounts guaranteed
will expire by 2009, with the remaining guarantees expiring by the end of 2015. Under the terms of
the guarantees, the company would be required to fulfill the guarantee should an affiliate be in
default of its loan terms, generally for the full amounts disclosed. There are no recourse
provisions, and no assets are held as collateral for these guarantees. The $189 balance of the $963
represents obligations in connection with pricing of power purchase agreements for certain of the
company’s cogeneration affiliates. Under the terms of these guarantees, the company may be
required to make payments under certain conditions if the affiliates do not perform under the
agreements. There are no provisions for recourse to third parties, and no assets are held as
collateral for these pricing guarantees.

Guarantees of $130 have been provided to third parties, including approximately $40 of
construction loans to host governments of certain of the company’s international upstream
operations. The remaining guarantees of $90 were provided

FS-51


Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts


NOTE 24.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS – Continued

principally as conditions of sale of the company’s interest in certain operations, to provide a
source of liquidity to the guaranteed parties and in connection with company marketing programs. No
amounts of the company’s obligations under these guarantees are recorded as liabilities. About 70
percent of the total amounts guaranteed will expire by 2009.
The company would be required to perform under the terms of the guarantees should an entity be in
default of its loan or contract terms, generally for the full amounts disclosed. Approximately $70
of the guarantees have recourse provisions, which enable the company to recover any payments made
under the terms of the guarantees from securities held over the guaranteed parties’ assets.

At December 31, 2004, ChevronTexaco also had outstanding guarantees for approximately $215 of
Equilon debt and leases. Following the February 2002 disposition of its interest in Equilon, the
company received an indemnification from Shell Oil Company for any claims arising from the
guarantees. The company has not recorded a liability for these guarantees. Approximately 45 percent
of the amounts guaranteed will expire by 2009, with the guarantees of the remaining amounts
expiring by 2019.

Indemnifications

The company provided certain indemnities of contingent liabilities of Equilon and
Motiva to Shell Oil Company (Shell) and Saudi Refining, Inc., in connection with the February 2002
sale of the company’s interests in those investments. The indemnities cover certain contingent
liabilities, including those associated with the Unocal patent litigation. The company would be
required to perform should the indemnified liabilities become actual losses. Should that occur,
the company could be required to make future payments up to $300. Through the end of 2004, the
company paid approximately $28 under these contingencies and had agreed to pay approximately $10
additional under an award of arbitration, subject to minor adjustments yet to be resolved. The
company may receive additional requests for indemnification payments in the future.

The company has also provided indemnities relating to contingent environmental liabilities
related to assets originally contributed by Texaco to the Equilon and Motiva joint ventures and
environmental conditions that existed prior to the formation of Equilon and Motiva or that occurred
during the periods of Texaco’s ownership interests in the joint ventures. In general, the
environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to
December 2001. Claims relating to Equilon indemnities must be asserted either as early as February
2007, or no later than February 2009, and claims relating to Motiva must be asserted no later than
February 2012. Under the terms of the indemnities, there is no maximum limit on the amount of
potential future payments. The company has not recorded any liabilities for possible claims under
these indemnities. The company posts no assets as collateral and has made no payments under the
indemnities.

The amounts payable for the indemnities described above are to be net of amounts
recovered from insurance carriers and others and net of liabilities recorded by Equilon or Motiva
prior to September 30, 2001, for any applicable incident.

Securitization

The company securitizes certain retail and trade accounts receivable in its
downstream business through the use

of qualifying SPEs. At December 31, 2004, approximately
$1,200, representing about 10 percent of ChevronTexaco’s total current accounts receivables
balance, were securitized. ChevronTexaco’s total estimated financial exposure under these
securitizations at December 31, 2004, was approximately $50. These arrangements have the effect of
accelerating ChevronTexaco’s collection of the securitized amounts. In the event that the SPEs
experience major defaults in the collection of receivables, ChevronTexaco believes that it would
have no loss exposure connected with third-party investments in these securitizations.

Long-Term Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments, Throughput Agreements, and
Take-or-Pay Agreements

The company and its subsidiaries have certain other contingent liabilities
relating to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, throughput agreements,
and take-or-pay agreements, some of which relate to suppliers’ financing arrangements. The
agreements typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity, utilities,
and petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the company’s business. The
aggregate approximate amounts of required payments under these
various commitments are 2005 –
$1,600; 2006 – $1,700; 2007 – $1,600; 2008 – $1,500; 2009 – $1,500; 2010 and after – $2,300. Total
payments under the agreements were approximately $1,600 in 2004, $1,400 in 2003 and $1,200 in 2002.

The most significant take-or-pay agreement calls for the company to purchase approximately
55,000 barrels per day of refined products from an equity affiliate refiner in Thailand. This
purchase agreement is in conjunction with the financing of a refinery owned by the affiliate and
expires in 2009. The future estimated commitments under this contract
are: 2005 – $1,200; 2006 – $1,200; 2007 – $1,300; 2008 – $1,300; and 2009 – $1,300. Additionally, in 2004 the company entered
into a 20-year agreement to acquire regasification capacity at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal.
Payments of $1,200 over the 20-year period are expected to commence in 2010.

Minority Interests

The company has commitments of approximately $172 related to minority interests
in subsidiary companies.

Texaco Capital LLC, a wholly owned financial subsidiary, issued Deferred Preferred Shares,
Series C, in December 1995. In February 2005, the company redeemed current obligations related to
minority interests of approximately $140.

Environmental

The company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and
regulations that in the future may require the company to take action to correct or ameliorate the
effects on the environment of prior release of chemical or petroleum substances, including MTBE, by
the company or other parties. Such contingencies may exist for various sites, including but not
limited to federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, refineries, oil fields,
service stations, terminals, and land development areas, whether operating, closed or divested.
These future costs are not fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of
possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be
required, the determination of the company’s liability in proportion to other responsible parties,
and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties.

Although the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and
reasonably estimable,

FS-52



NOTE 24.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS — Continued

the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in
which they are recognized. The company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on
its consolidated financial position or liquidity. Also, the company does not believe its
obligations to make such expenditures have had or will have any significant impact on the
company’s competitive position relative to other U.S. or international petroleum or chemical
companies.

ChevronTexaco’s environmental reserve as of December 31, 2004, was $1,047. The company
manages environmental liabilities under specific sets of regulatory requirements, which in the
United States include the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and various state and local
regulations. No single remediation site at year-end 2004 had a recorded liability that was material
to the company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Included in the year-end 2004 balance was $107 related to sites for which ChevronTexaco had
been identified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or other regulatory agencies under the
provisions of the federal Superfund law or analogous state laws as a “potentially responsible
party” or otherwise involved in the remediation.

Of the remaining year-end 2004 environmental reserves balance of $940, $712 related to more
than 2,000 sites for the company’s U.S. downstream operations, including refineries and other
plants, marketing locations (i.e., service stations and terminals) and pipelines. The remaining
$228 was associated with various sites in the international downstream ($111), upstream ($69) and
chemicals ($48). Liabilities at all sites, whether operating, closed or divested, were primarily
associated with the company’s plans and activities to remediate soil or groundwater contamination
or both. These and other activities include one or more of the following: site assessment; soil
excavation; offsite disposal of contaminants; onsite containment, remediation and/or extraction of
petroleum hydrocarbon liquid and vapor from soil; groundwater extraction and treatment; and
monitoring of the natural attenuation of the contaminants.

Global Operations

ChevronTexaco and its affiliates conduct business activities in approximately
180 countries. Areas in which the company and its affiliates have significant operations include
the United States, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, Norway, Denmark, France, the Partitioned
Neutral Zone between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, Republic of Congo, Angola, Nigeria, Chad, South
Africa, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, China, Thailand, Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil,
Colombia, Trinidad and Tobago, and South Korea. The company’s CPC affiliate operates in Russia
and Kazakhstan. The company’s TCO affiliate operates in Kazakhstan. The company’s CPChem affiliate
manufactures and markets a wide range of petrochemicals on a worldwide basis, with manufacturing
facilities in the United States, Puerto Rico, Singapore, China, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Qatar,
Mexico and Belgium.

The company’s operations, particularly exploration and production, can be
affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in
which it operates, including the United States. As has occurred in the past, actions could be taken
by host governments to increase public

ownership of the company’s partially or wholly owned
businesses or assets or to impose additional taxes or royalties on the company’s operations or
both.

In certain locations, host governments have imposed restrictions, controls and taxes, and in
others, political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the
company’s continued presence in those countries. Internal unrest, acts of violence or strained
relations between a host government and the company or other governments may affect the company’s
operations. Those developments have at times significantly affected the company’s related
operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of
current and future activity in such countries.

Equity Redetermination

For oil and gas producing operations, ownership agreements may provide for
periodic reassessments of equity interests in estimated crude oil and natural gas reserves. These
activities, individually or together, may result in gains or losses that could be material to
earnings in any given period. One such equity redetermination process has been under way since 1996
for ChevronTexaco’s interests in four producing zones at the
Naval Petroleum Reserve at Elk Hills, California, for the time when the remaining interests in
these zones were owned by the U.S. Department of Energy. A wide range remains for a possible net
settlement amount for the four zones. ChevronTexaco currently estimates its maximum possible net
before-tax liability at approximately $200. At the same time, a possible maximum net amount that
could be owed to ChevronTexaco is estimated at about $50. The timing of the settlement and the
exact amount within this range of estimates were uncertain.

Other Contingencies

ChevronTexaco receives claims from and submits claims to customers, trading
partners, U.S. federal, state and local regulatory bodies, host governments, contractors, insurers,
and suppliers. The amounts of these claims, individually and in the aggregate, may be significant
and take lengthy periods to resolve.

The company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their operations and may
close, abandon, sell, exchange, acquire or restructure assets to achieve operational or strategic
benefits and to improve competitiveness and profitability. These activities, individually or
together, may result in gains or losses in future periods.

NOTE 25.

FAS 143 — ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

The company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 143,

“Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations”

(FAS 143), effective January 1, 2003. This accounting standard applies to
the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation that is recorded when there is a
legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset and the liability
can be reasonably estimated. Obligations associated with the retirement of these assets require
recognition in certain circumstances: (1) the present value of a liability and offsetting asset for
an ARO, (2) the subsequent accretion of that liability and depreciation of the asset, and (3) the
periodic review of the ARO liability estimates and discount rates. FAS 143 primarily affects the
company’s accounting for crude oil and natural gas producing assets and differs in several respects
from previous accounting under FAS 19,

“Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing
Companies.”

NOTE 25.

FAS 143 – ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS – Continued

In the first quarter 2003, the company recorded a net after-tax charge of $200 for the
cumulative effect of the adoption of FAS 143, including the company’s share of amounts attributable
to equity affiliates. The cumulative-effect adjustment also increased the following balance sheet
categories: “Properties, plant and equipment,” $2,568; “Accrued liabilities,” $115; and “Deferred
credits and other noncurrent obligations,” $2,674. “Noncurrent deferred income taxes” decreased by
$21.

Upon adoption, no significant asset retirement obligations associated with any legal
obligations to retire refining, marketing and transportation (downstream) and chemical long-lived
assets generally were recognized, as indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements
prevented estimation of the fair value of the associated ARO. The company performs periodic reviews
of its downstream and chemical long-lived assets for any changes in facts and circumstances that
might require recognition of a retirement obligation.

Other than the cumulative-effect net charge,
the effect of the new accounting standard on net income in 2003 was not materially different from
what the result would have been under FAS 19 accounting. Included in “Depreciation, depletion and
amortization” were $52 related to the depreciation of the ARO asset and $132 related to the
accretion of the ARO liability.

The following table illustrates what the company’s net income before extraordinary items, net
income and related per-share amounts would have been if the provisions of FAS 143 had been applied
retroactively:

Excludes cumulative-effect charge of $200 ($0.09 per basic and diluted share) for the
adoption of FAS 143.


Includes benefit of $5 that represents the reversal of FAS 19 depreciation related
to abandonment offset partially by pro forma expenses for the depreciation and accretion of the ARO
asset and liability, net of tax. There is a

de minimis

effect to net income per basic or diluted
share.


Reported net income before extraordinary items was also $3.57 per basic and diluted

shares for 2003 and $0.53 per basic and diluted shares for 2002.


Reported net income was $3.48 per basic and diluted shares for 2003 and $0.53 per
basic and diluted shares for 2002.

Prior to the implementation of FAS 143, the company had recorded a provision for abandonment
that was part of “Accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization.” Upon implementation of FAS
143, the provision for abandonment was reversed and ARO liability was recorded. The amount of the
abandonment reserve at the end of 2002 was $2,263. The 2002 pro-forma ARO liability at January 1
and December 31 was $2,792 and $2,797, respectively.

The following table indicates the changes to the company’s before-tax asset retirement
obligations in 2004 and 2003:

EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic earnings per share (EPS) is based upon net income less preferred stock dividend requirements
and includes the effects of deferrals of salary and other compensation awards that are invested in
ChevronTexaco stock units by certain officers and employees of the company and the company’s share
of stock transactions of affiliates, which, under the applicable accounting rules may be recorded
directly to the company’s retained earnings instead of net income. Diluted EPS includes the effects
of these items as well as the dilutive effects of outstanding stock

TABLE V – RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION

Reserves Governance

The company has adopted a comprehensive reserves and resource classification system modeled after a system developed and approved by the Society of Petroleum Engineers,
the World Petroleum Congress and the American Association of Petroleum Geologists. The system
classifies recoverable hydrocarbons into six categories, three deemed commercial and three
noncommercial. Within the commercial classification are proved reserves and two categories of
unproved, probable and possible. The noncommercial categories are also referred to as contingent
resources. For reserves estimates to be classified as proved they must meet all SEC standards and
demonstrate a high probability of being produced.

Proved reserves are the estimated quantities that
geologic and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future
years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Net proved reserves
exclude royalties and interests owned by others and reflect contractual arrangements and royalty
obligations in effect at the time of the estimate.

Proved reserves are classified as either developed or undeveloped. Proved developed reserves
are the quantities expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and
operating methods.

Proved reserves do not include additional quantities that may eventually result
from extensions of currently proved areas or from applying the secondary or tertiary recovery
processes not yet tested and determined to be economic.

Due to the inherent uncertainties and the
limited nature of reservoir data, estimates of underground reserves are subject to change as
additional information becomes available.

Proved reserves are estimated by company asset teams
composed of earth scientists and reservoir engineers. As part of the internal control process
related to reserves estimation, the company maintains a Reserves Advisory Committee (RAC) that is
chaired by the corporate reserves manager, who is a member of a corporate department that reports
directly to the executive vice president responsible for the company’s worldwide exploration and
production activities. All of the RAC members are knowledgeable of SEC guidelines for proved
reserves classification. The RAC coordinates its activities through two operating company-level
reserves managers. These two reserves managers are not members of the RAC so as to preserve the
corporate-level independence.

The RAC has the following primary responsibilities: provide independent reviews of the
business units’ recommended reserve changes; confirm that proved reserves are recognized in
accordance with SEC guidelines; determine that reserve volumes are calculated using consistent and
appropriate standards, procedures and technology; and maintain the

Corporate Reserves Manual

, which
provides standardized procedures used corporatewide for classifying and reporting hydrocarbon
reserves.

During the year, the RAC is represented in meetings with each of the company’s upstream
business units to review and discuss reserve changes recommended by the various asset teams. Major
changes are also reviewed with the company’s Strategy and Planning Committee, whose members include
the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. The company’s annual reserve
activity is also presented to and discussed with

the Board of Directors. Other major reserves-related issues are discussed with the Board as necessary throughout the year.

RAC subteams also conduct in-depth reviews during the year of many of the fields that have
the largest proved reserves quantities. These reviews include an examination of the proved reserve
records and documentation of their alignment with the

Corporate Reserves Manual.

Reserve Quantities

At December 31, 2004, total oil-equivalent reserves for the company’s
consolidated operations were 8.2 billion barrels. (Refer to page E-12 for the definition of
oil-equivalent reserves.) Nearly 30 percent were in the United States and about 10 percent in
Indonesia. For the company’s interests in equity affiliates, oil-equivalent reserves were 3.1
billion barrels, nearly 85 percent of which were associated with the company’s 50 percent ownership
in TCO. Fewer than 20 other individual properties in the company’s portfolio of assets each
contained between 1 percent and 4 percent of the company’s oil-equivalent proved reserves, which in
the aggregate accounted for about 35 percent of the company’s proved reserves total. These other properties were geographically
dispersed, located in the United States, South America, Europe, West Africa, the Middle East and
the Asia-Pacific region.

In the United States, total oil-equivalent reserves at year-end 2004 were 2.4 billion barrels.
Of this amount, 45 percent, 20 percent and 35 percent were located in California, the Gulf of
Mexico and other U.S. areas, respectively.

In California, liquids reserves represented 95 percent of the total, with most classified as
heavy oil. Because of heavy oil’s high viscosity and the need to employ enhanced recovery methods,
the producing operations are capital intensive in nature. Most of the company’s heavy-oil fields
in California employ a continuous steamflooding process.

In the Gulf of Mexico region, liquids represented approximately 60 percent of total
oil-equivalent reserves. Production operations are mostly offshore and, as a result, are also
capital intensive. Costs include investments in wells, production platforms and other facilities,
such as gathering lines and storage facilities.

In other U.S. areas, the reserves were split about equally between liquids and natural gas.
For production of crude oil, some fields utilize enhanced recovery methods, including water-flood and CO


injection.

ChevronTexaco operates the Boscan Field in Venezuela under a service agreement, but has
not recorded reserve quantities for this operation.

The pattern of net reserve changes shown in the
following tables, for the three years ending December 31, 2004, is not necessarily indicative of
future trends. The company’s ability to add proved reserves is affected by, among other things,
matters that are outside the company’s control, such as delays in government permitting, partner
approvals of development plans, declines in oil and gas prices, OPEC constraints, geopolitical
uncertainties and civil unrest.

The company’s estimated net proved underground oil and natural gas reserves and changes
thereto for the years 2002, 2003 and 2004 are shown in the following tables.

Includes reserves disposed of through property exchanges.


Net reserve changes (excluding production) in 2004 consist of 5 million barrels of
developed reserves and (209) million barrels of undeveloped reserves for consolidated companies and
315 million barrels of developed reserves and (111) million barrels of undeveloped reserves for
affiliated companies.


During 2004, the percentages of undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2003,
transferred to developed reserves were 13 percent and 15 percent for consolidated companies and
affiliated companies, respectively.

INFORMATION ON CANADIAN OIL SANDS NET PROVED RESERVES NOT INCLUDED ABOVE:

In addition to conventional liquids and natural gas proved reserves, ChevronTexaco has significant
interests in proved oil sands reserves in Canada associated with the Athabasca project. For
internal management purposes, ChevronTexaco views these reserves and their development as an
integral part of total upstream operations. However, SEC regulations define these reserves as
mining-related and not a part of conventional oil and gas reserves. Net proved oil sands reserves
were 167 million barrels as of December 31, 2004. Production began in late 2002.

The oil sands reserves are not considered in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash
flows for conventional oil and gas reserves, which is found on page FS-67.

Noteworthy amounts in the categories of proved-reserves changes for 2002 through 2004 in
the above table are discussed below:

Revisions

In 2002, net revisions reduced liquids volumes worldwide by 49 million barrels for consolidated companies. International areas accounted for a net
increase of 67 million barrels. The largest upward net revision internationally was 161 million
barrels for a contract extension in Angola. The largest negative net revision was 155 million
barrels in Indonesia, mainly for the effect of higher year-end prices on the calculation of
reserves associated with cost-oil recovery under a production-sharing contract. In the United
States, the total downward net

revision was 116 million barrels across many fields in each of the geographic
sections. The 199-million-barrel increase for the TCO affiliate was associated
with the project approval to expand gas processing facilities.

In 2003, net revisions increased reserves by 57 million barrels for consolidated
companies. Whereas net U.S. reserve changes were minimal, international volumes
increased 66 million barrels. The largest increase was in Kazakhstan in the Asia-Pacific
area based on an updated geologic model for one field. The 200-million-barrel
increase for TCO was based on an updated model of reservoir and well performance.

FS-64


TABLE V – RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION – Continued

In 2004, net revisions decreased reserves 218 million barrels for consolidated companies
and increased reserves for affiliates by 204 million barrels. For consolidated companies, the
decrease was composed of 161 million barrels for international areas and 57 million barrels for the
United States. The largest downward revision internationally was 70 million barrels in Africa. One
field in Angola accounted for the majority of the net decline as changes were made to oil-in-place
estimates based on reservoir performance data. One field in the Asia-Pacific area essentially
accounted for the 43-million-barrel downward revision for that region. The revision was associated
with reduced well performance. Part of the 36-million-barrel net downward revision for Indonesia
was associated with the effect of higher year-end prices on the calculation of reserves for
cost-oil recovery under a production-sharing contract. In the United States, the 68-million-barrel
net downward revision in the Gulf of Mexico area was across several fields and based mainly on
reservoir analyses and

assessments
of well performance. For affiliated companies, the 206-million-barrel increase for TCO
was based on an updated assessment of reservoir performance for the Tengiz Field. Partially
offsetting this net increase was a downward effect of higher year-end prices on the variable
royalty-rate calculation. Downward revisions also occurred in other geographic areas because of the
effect of higher year-end prices on various production-sharing terms and variable royalty
calculations.

Improved Recovery

In 2002, improved recovery increased liquids volumes worldwide by 239
million barrels for consolidated companies. The largest increase of 99 million barrels occurred in
the United States, primarily in the California region due to pattern modifications, injector
conversions and infill drilling on a large heavy oil field under thermal recovery.

Extensions and Discoveries

In 2002, extensions and discoveries increased liquids volumes
worldwide by 442 million barrels for consolidated companies. The largest increase was 301 million
barrels in Africa, principally 172 million barrels reflecting the project sanction of a recent
discovery in Nigeria and 96 million barrels associated with approval of several development
projects in Angola.

TABLE V – RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION – Continued

Sales

In 2004, sales of liquids volumes reduced reserves of consolidated companies by 179
million barrels. Sales totaled 130 million barrels in the United States and 33 million barrels in
the “other” international region. Sales in the “other” region of the United States totaled 103
millions barrels, with two fields accounting for approximately one-half of the volume. The 27
million barrels sold in the Gulf of Mexico reflect the sale of a number of Shelf properties. The
“other” international sales include the disposal of western Canada properties and several fields
in the United Kingdom. All the sales were associated with the company’s program to dispose of
assets deemed nonstrategic to the portfolio of producing properties.

Noteworthy amounts in the categories of proved-reserves changes for 2002 through 2004 in the
table on page FS-65 are discussed below:

Revisions

In 2002, reserves were revised upward by a net
161 billion cubic feet (BCF) for consolidated companies, as increases of 759 BCF internationally
were partially offset by net downward revisions of 598 BCF in the United States. Internationally,
the majority of the 277 BCF net upward revision in Africa was associated primarily with a
performance assessment of several fields and a multifield gas development project. An increase of
375 BCF in the Asia-Pacific region included the effect of securing a contract to supply LNG to
China markets from company producing operations in Australia. In the United States, about
one-fourth of the 598 BCF net downward revision was associated with two fields in the midcontinent
region based on an updated assessment of production performance and changes to operating conditions
of the wells. Most of the remaining negative revision was associated with reviews of performance in
many fields. For the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan, the 293 BCF increase related mainly to project
approval to expand gas processing facilities.

In 2003, revisions accounted for a net increase of 1,627 BCF for consolidated companies, as net increases of 2,233 BCF internationally were partially
offset by net downward revisions of 606 BCF in the United States. Internationally, the net 879 BCF
increase in the Asia-Pacific region related primarily to Australia and Kazakhstan. In Australia,
the increase was associated mainly with a change to the probabilistic method of aggregating the
reserves for multiple fields produced through common offshore infrastructure into a single LNG
plant. The increase in Kazakhstan related to an updated geologic model for one field and higher
gas sales to a third-party processing plant. The net 976 BCF increase in the “Other” international
area was mainly the result of operating contract extensions for two fields in South America. In
the United States, about one-third of the net 606 BCF negative revision related to two coal bed
methane fields in the midcontinent region, based on performance data for producing wells. Downward
revisions for the balance of the write-down were associated with several fields, based on
assessments of well performance and other data.

In 2004, revisions increased reserves for consolidated companies by a net 248 BCF, composed of increases of 928 BCF internationally and
decreases of 680 BCF in the United States. Internationally, about half of the 346 BCF increase in
Africa related to properties in Nigeria, for which changes were associated with well performance
reviews, development drilling and lease fuel calculations. The 236 BCF addition in the Asia-Pacific

region was related primarily to reservoir analysis for a single field. Most of the 325 BCF in
the “Other” international area is related to a new gas sales contract in Trinidad and Tobago. In
the United States, the net 391 BCF downward revision in the Gulf of Mexico was related to
well-performance reviews and technical analyses in several fields. Most of the net 316 BCF
negative revision in the “Other” U.S. area related to two coal bed methane fields in the
midcontinent region and their associated wells’ performance. The 963 BCF increase for TCO was
connected with updated analyses of reservoir performance and processing plant yields.

Extensions and Discoveries

In 2002, consolidated companies increased reserves by 892 BCF,
including 395 BCF in the United States and 227 BCF in the Asia-Pacific region. In the United
States, 229 BCF was added in the Gulf of Mexico and 161 BCF in the “other” region, primarily due to
drilling activities. The addition in Asia-Pacific resulted from a gas supply contract in Australia
that enabled booking of a previous discovery.

In 2003, extensions and discoveries accounted for an increase of 526 BCF for consolidated
companies, reflecting a 388 BCF increase in the United States, with 270 BCF added in the Gulf of
Mexico and 118 BCF in the “other” region. The Gulf of Mexico increase includes discoveries in
several offshore Louisiana fields, with a large number of fields in Texas, Louisiana and other
states accounting for the increase in “other.”

In 2004, extensions and discoveries accounted for an
increase of 214 BCF, reflecting an increase in the United States of 144 BCF, with 89 BCF added in
the “other” region and 54 BCF added in the Gulf of Mexico through drilling activities in a large
number of fields.

Sales

In 2004, sales for consolidated companies totaled 547 BCF. Of this total, 436 BCF was in
the United States and 111 BCF in the “other” international region. In the United States, “other”
region sales accounted for 289 BCF, reflecting the disposal of a large number of smaller
properties, including a coal bed methane field. Gulf of Mexico sales of 147 BCF reflected the
sale of Shelf properties, with four fields accounting for more than one-third of the total sales.
Sales in the “other” international region reflected the disposition of the properties in Western
Canada and the United Kingdom.

TABLE VI – STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS RELATED TO PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES

The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, related to the preceding proved
oil and gas reserves, is calculated in accordance with the requirements of FAS 69. Estimated future
cash inflows from production are computed by applying year-end prices for oil and gas to year-end
quantities of estimated net proved reserves. Future price changes are limited to those provided by
contractual arrangements in existence at the end of each reporting year. Future development and
production costs are those estimated future expenditures necessary to develop and produce year-end
estimated proved reserves based on year-end cost indices, assuming continuation of year-end
economic conditions, and include estimated costs for asset retirement obligations. Estimated future
income taxes are calculated by applying appropriate year-end statutory tax rates. These rates reflect allowable deductions and tax credits and are applied to estimated future pretax net cash flows, less the tax basis of related assets. Discounted future net cash flows are calculated using
10 percent

midperiod discount factors. Discounting requires a year-by-year estimate of when future
expenditures will be incurred and when reserves will be produced.

The information provided does not represent management’s estimate of the company’s expected
future cash flows or value of proved oil and gas reserves. Estimates of proved reserve quantities
are imprecise and change over time as new information becomes available. Moreover, probable and
possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, are excluded from the calculations. The
arbitrary valuation prescribed under FAS 69 requires assumptions as to the timing and amount of
future development and production costs. The calculations are made as of December 31 each year and
should not be relied upon as an indication of the company’s future cash flows or value of its oil
and gas reserves. In the following table, “Standardized Measure Net Cash Flows” refers to the
standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows.
