CAUTIONARY
    STATEMENT RELEVANT TO FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

FOR THE PURPOSE OF “SAFE HARBOR” PROVISIONS OF THE

PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

This Annual Report on

Form 10-K

of Chevron Corporation contains forward-looking statements
    relating to Chevron’s operations that are based on
    management’s current expectations, estimates and
    projections about the petroleum, chemicals and other
    energy-related industries. Words such as
    “anticipates,” “expects,”
    “intends,” “plans,” “targets,”
    “projects,” “believes,” “seeks,”
    “schedules,” “estimates,”
    “budgets” and similar expressions are intended to
    identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are
    not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain
    risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond
    our control and are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual
    outcomes and results may differ materially from what is
    expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. The
    reader should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking
    statements, which speak only as of the date of this report.
    Unless legally required, Chevron undertakes no obligation to

    restrictions on scope of company operations; the effects of
    changed accounting rules under generally accepted accounting
    principles promulgated by rule-setting bodies; and the factors
    set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” in this
    report. In addition, such statements could be affected by
    general domestic and international economic and political
    conditions. Unpredictable or unknown factors not discussed in
    this report could also have material adverse effects on
    forward-looking statements.

General
    Development of Business

Summary
    Description of Chevron

Chevron
    Corporation,


a Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries
    and affiliates and provides administrative, financial,
    management and technology support to U.S. and foreign
    subsidiaries that engage in fully integrated petroleum
    operations, chemicals operations, mining operations of coal and
    other minerals, power generation and energy services. The
    company conducts business activities in the United States and
    approximately 180 other countries. Exploration and production
    (upstream) operations consist of exploring for, developing and
    producing crude oil and natural gas and also marketing natural
    gas. Refining, marketing and transportation (downstream)
    operations relate to refining crude oil into finished petroleum
    products; marketing crude oil and the many products derived from
    petroleum; and transporting crude oil, natural gas and petroleum
    products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail
    car. Chemical operations include the manufacture and marketing
    of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and
    fuel and lubricant oil additives.

A list of the company’s major subsidiaries is presented on
    pages

E-4

and

E-5

of
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

As of December 31, 2006, Chevron had nearly 62,500
    employees (including about 6,600 service station employees).
    Approximately 28,800, or 46 percent, of the company’s
    employees were employed in U.S. operations.

Acquisition
    of Unocal Corporation

On August 10, 2005, the company acquired Unocal Corporation
    (Unocal), an independent oil and gas exploration and production
    company. This acquisition was accounted for under the rules of
    Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 141,

Business Combinations.

Unocal’s principal upstream
    operations were in North America and Asia, including the Caspian
    region. Other activities included ownership interests in
    proprietary and common carrier pipelines, natural gas storage
    facilities and mining operations. Further discussion of the
    Unocal acquisition is contained in Note 2 beginning on

page FS-34

of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Overview
    of Petroleum Industry

Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced
    by many factors, and individual petroleum companies have little
    control over some of them. Governmental policies, particularly
    in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment have a
    significant impact on petroleum activities, regulating how
    companies are structured and where and how companies conduct
    their operations and formulate their products and, in some
    cases, limiting their profits directly. Prices for crude oil and
    natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are
    determined by supply and demand for these commodities. The
    members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
    (OPEC) are typically the world’s swing producers of crude
    oil, and their production levels are a major factor in
    determining worldwide supply. Demand for crude oil and its
    products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions
    of local, national and global economies, although weather
    patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play
    a significant part. Seasonality is not a primary driver to
    changes in the company’s quarterly earnings during the year.

Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and
    petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and
    chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. Chevron
    competes with fully integrated major petroleum companies as well
    as independent and national petroleum companies for the
    acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other
    properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop
    and operate those properties. In its downstream business,
    Chevron also competes with fully integrated major petroleum
    companies and other independent refining, marketing and
    transportation entities in the sale or acquisition of various
    goods or services in many national and international markets.


Incorporated
    in Delaware in 1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the
    company adopted the name Chevron Corporation in 1984 and
    ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2001. In 2005, ChevronTexaco
    Corporation changed its name to Chevron Corporation. As used in
    this report, the term “Chevron” and such terms as
    “the company,” “the corporation,”
    “our,” “we” and “us” may refer to
    Chevron Corporation, one or more of its consolidated
    subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated
    otherwise, it does not include “affiliates” of
    Chevron — i.e., those companies accounted for by the
    equity method (generally owned 50 percent or less) or
    investments accounted for by the cost method. All of these terms
    are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise
    description of any of the separate companies, each of which
    manages its own affairs.



Operating
    Environment

Refer to pages FS-2 through FS-9 of this

Form 10-K

in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion on the
    company’s current business environment and outlook.

Chevron
    Strategic Direction

Chevron’s primary objective is to create value and achieve
    sustained financial returns from its operations that will enable
    it to outperform its competitors. As a foundation for achieving
    this objective, the company had established the following
    strategies, which continue into 2007:

Strategies
    for Major Businesses

•

Upstream

— grow profitably in core
    areas, build new legacy positions and commercialize the
    company’s natural gas equity resource base while growing a
    high-impact global gas business

•

Downstream

— improve base-business
    returns and selectively grow, with a focus on integrated value
    creation

The company will also continue to invest in renewable-energy
    technologies, with an objective of capturing profitable
    positions in important renewable sources of energy.

Enabling
    Strategies Companywide

•

Invest in people

to achieve the company’s
    strategies

•

Leverage technology

to deliver superior
    performance and growth

•

Build organizational capability

to deliver
    world-class performance in operational excellence, cost
    reduction, capital stewardship and profitable growth

Description
    of Business and Properties

The upstream, downstream and chemicals activities of the company
    and its equity affiliates are widely dispersed geographically,
    with operations in North America, South America, Europe, Africa,
    the Middle East, Asia, and Australasia. Tabulations of segment
    sales and other operating revenues, earnings and income taxes
    for the three years ending December 31, 2006, and assets as
    of the end of 2006 and 2005 — for the United States
    and the company’s international geographic
    areas — are in Note 8 to the consolidated
    financial statements beginning on

page FS-38

of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

In addition, similar comparative data for the company’s
    investments in and income from equity affiliates and property,
    plant and equipment are in Notes 12 and 13 on pages FS-41
    to FS-43.

Capital
    and Exploratory Expenditures

Total reported expenditures for 2006 were $16.6 billion,
    including $1.9 billion for Chevron’s share of
    expenditures by affiliated companies, which did not require cash
    outlays by the company. In 2005 and 2004, expenditures were
    $11.1 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively,
    including the company’s share of affiliates’
    expenditures of $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion in the
    corresponding periods. The 2005 amount excludes the
    $17.3 billion acquisition of Unocal.

Of the $16.6 billion in expenditures for 2006,
    77 percent, or $12.8 billion, related to upstream
    activities. Approximately the same percentage was also expended
    for upstream operations in 2005 and 2004. International upstream
    accounted for about 70 percent of the worldwide upstream
    investment in each of the three years, reflecting the
    company’s continuing focus on opportunities that are
    available outside the United States.

In 2007, the company estimates capital and exploratory
    expenditures will be 18 percent higher at
    $19.6 billion, including $2.4 billion of spending by
    affiliates. About three-fourths, or $14.6 billion, is
    budgeted for exploration and production activities, with
    $10.6 billion of that amount outside the United States.

    exploratory expenditures on

Boscan Operating Service Agreement



—

—



(through September 30,
    2006 — see footnote 6 above)



In 2006, Chevron conducted exploration and production operations
    in the United States and approximately 35 other countries.
    Worldwide oil-equivalent production of 2.67 million barrels
    per day in 2006, including volumes produced from oil sands in
    Canada and production under the Boscan operating service
    agreement in Venezuela, increased approximately 6 percent
    from 2005. The increase between periods was mostly attributable
    to the Unocal acquisition. Refer to the “Results of
    Operations” section beginning on

page FS-6

for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the
    2004–2006 changes in production for crude oil and natural
    gas liquids and natural gas.

The company estimates that its average worldwide oil-equivalent
    production in 2007 will be approximately 2.6 million
    barrels per day. This estimate is subject to many uncertainties,
    including quotas that may be imposed by OPEC, the price effect
    on production volumes calculated under cost-recovery and
    variable-royalty provisions of certain contracts, changes in
    fiscal terms or restrictions on scope of company operations, and
    production that may have to be shut in due to weather
    conditions, civil unrest, changing geopolitics or other
    disruptions to daily operations. Future production levels also
    are affected by the size and number of economic investment
    opportunities and, for new large-scale projects, the time lag
    between initial exploration and the beginning of production.
    Expected additions to production capacity in 2008 through 2010
    may permit worldwide oil-equivalent production levels to
    increase from 2007 levels. Refer to the “Review of Ongoing
    Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas,”
    beginning on page 9, for a discussion of the company’s
    major oil and gas development projects.

    Sales Prices and Production Costs per Unit of
    Production

Refer to Table IV on

page FS-68

of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

Reserves

Table V, beginning on

page FS-68,

provides a tabulation of the company’s proved net oil and
    gas reserves, by geographic area, as of each year-end 2004
    through 2006 and an accompanying discussion of major changes to
    proved



reserves by geographic area for the three-year period. During
    2006, the company provided oil and gas reserves estimates for
    2005 to the Department of Energy, Energy Information Agency.
    Such estimates are consistent with, and do not differ more than
    5 percent from, the information furnished to the Securities
    and Exchange Commission on the company’s Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

During 2007, the company will file estimates of oil and gas
    reserves with the Department of Energy, Energy Information
    Agency, consistent with the reserve data reported in
    Table V.

Acreage

At December 31, 2006, the company owned or had under lease
    or similar agreements undeveloped and developed oil and gas
    properties located throughout the world. The geographical
    distribution of the company’s acreage is shown in the

Gross acreage includes the total
    number of acres in all tracts in which the company has an
    interest. Net acreage is the sum of the company’s
    fractional interests in gross acreage.


Developed acreage is spaced or
    assignable to productive wells. Undeveloped acreage is acreage
    where wells have not been drilled or completed to permit
    commercial production and that may contain undeveloped proved
    reserves. The gross undeveloped acres that will expire in 2007,
    2008 and 2009 if production is not established by certain
    required dates are 12,459, 7,731 and 10,207, respectively.

Contract
    Obligations

The company sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing
    operations under a variety of contractual obligations. Most
    contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based
    on production from specified properties, but certain natural gas
    sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable
    quantities.

In the United States, the company is contractually committed to
    deliver to third parties and affiliates approximately
    281 billion cubic feet of natural gas through 2009 from
    U.S. reserves. The company believes it can satisfy these
    contracts from quantities available from production of the
    company’s proved developed U.S. reserves. These
    contracts include variable-pricing terms.

Outside the United States, the company is contractually
    committed to deliver to third parties a total of approximately
    560 billion cubic feet of natural gas from 2007 through
    2009 from Argentina, Australia, Canada, Colombia and the
    Philippines. The sales contracts contain variable pricing
    formulas that are generally referenced to the prevailing market
    price for crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at
    the time of delivery and in some cases consider inflation or
    other factors. The company believes it can satisfy these
    contracts from quantities available from



production of the company’s proved developed reserves in
    Argentina, Australia, Colombia and the Philippines. The company
    plans to meet its Canadian contractual delivery commitments of
    27 billion cubic feet through third-party purchases.

Development
    Activities

Details of the company’s development expenditures and costs
    of proved property acquisitions for 2006, 2005 and 2004 are
    presented in Table I on

page FS-63

of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

The table below summarizes the company’s net interest in
    productive and dry development wells completed in each of the
    past three years and the status of the company’s
    development wells drilling at December 31, 2006. A
    “development well” is a well drilled within the proved
    area of a crude oil or natural gas reservoir to the depth of a
    stratigraphic horizon known to be productive.

The following table summarizes the company’s net interests
    in productive and dry exploratory wells completed in each of the
    last three years and the number of exploratory wells drilling at
    December 31, 2006. “Exploratory wells” are wells
    drilled to find and produce crude oil or natural gas in unproved
    areas and include delineation wells, which are wells drilled to
    find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be
    productive of crude oil or natural gas in another reservoir or
    to extend a known reservoir beyond the proved area.

Review of
    Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key
    Areas

Chevron’s 2006 key upstream activities, also discussed in
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations beginning on

page FS-2,

are presented below. The comments below include references to
    “total production” and “net production,”
    which are defined under “Production” in
    Exhibit 99.1 on

page E-11

of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

In addition to the activities discussed, Chevron was active in
    other geographic areas, but those activities are considered less
    significant.

The discussion below also references the status of proved
    reserves recognition for significant long-lead-time projects not
    yet on production and for projects recently placed on
    production. Reserves are not discussed for recent discoveries
    that have yet to advance to a project stage and for production
    in mature areas.



Consolidated
    Operations

Chevron has production and
    exploration activities in most of the world’s major
    hydrocarbon basins. The company’s upstream strategy is to
    grow profitably in core areas, build new legacy positions and
    commercialize the company’s natural gas equity resource
    base while growing a high-impact global gas business. The map at
    left indicates Chevron’s primary areas of production and
    exploration as well as the target markets for the company’s
    natural gas resources.

a)  United
    States

Upstream activities in the United States are concentrated in the
    Gulf of Mexico, Louisiana, Texas, New Mexico, the Rocky
    Mountains and California. Average daily net production during
    2006 was 462,000 barrels of crude oil and natural gas
    liquids and 1.8 billion cubic feet of natural gas, or
    763,000 barrels per day on an oil-equivalent basis. Refer to
    Table V beginning on

page FS-68

for a discussion of the net proved reserves and different
    hydrocarbon characteristics for the company’s major
    U.S. producing areas.

California:

The
    company has significant production in the San Joaquin
    Valley. In 2006, average daily net production was
    202,000 barrels of crude oil, 101 million cubic feet
    of natural gas and 5,000 barrels of natural gas liquids, or
    224,000 barrels of oil-equivalent. Approximately
    80 percent of the crude oil production is considered heavy
    oil (typically with API gravity lower than 22 degrees).

Gulf of
    Mexico:

Average
    daily net production rates during 2006 for the company’s
    combined interests in the Gulf of Mexico shelf and deepwater
    areas and the fields onshore Louisiana were 102,000 barrels
    of crude oil, 661 million cubic feet of natural gas and
    12,000 barrels of natural gas liquids, or
    224,000 barrels of oil-equivalent. Net production at the
    end of 2006 was approximately the same rate, which reflects
    restoration of most of the volumes that were economic to restore
    following the production outages caused by hurricanes in 2005.



In the Gulf of Mexico deepwater areas, the company’s
    producing fields during 2006 included:

•

Genesis — 57 percent-owned and operated. Daily
    net production in 2006 averaged 7,000 barrels of crude oil
    and 10 million cubic feet of natural gas, or
    9,000 barrels of oil-equivalent.

•

Petronius — 50 percent-owned and operated and
    includes the Perseus discovery, which started production from
    the Petronius platform in 2005. Daily net production in 2006 was
    20,000 barrels of crude oil and 22 million cubic feet
    of natural gas, or 25,000 barrels of oil-equivalent.

•

Mad Dog — 16 percent-owned and nonoperated and
    started production in 2005. Net production in 2006 averaged
    5,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day. Ongoing
    development work is expected to increase the maximum total daily
    production in 2008 to the design capacity of 80,000 barrels
    of crude oil and 40 million cubic feet of natural gas.

The company’s interests in the deepwater Typhoon and Boris
    fields were sold during 2006. The production platform at Typhoon
    capsized during Hurricane Rita in 2005 and was safely converted
    into an artificial reef prior to the sale.

During 2006, Chevron was engaged in other development and
    exploration activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.
    Development work continued at the 58 percent-owned and
    operated Tahiti Field, where production

start-up

is
    expected in 2008. Development drilling commenced in February
    2006, and well completion work is expected to be finalized
    during 2007. Initial booking of proved undeveloped reserves
    occurred in 2003, and the transfer of these reserves into the
    proved developed category is anticipated near the time of
    production

start-up.

With an estimated production life of 30 years, Tahiti is
    designed to have a maximum total daily production of
    125,000 barrels of crude oil and 70 million cubic feet
    of natural gas.

At the 63 percent-owned and operated Blind Faith discovery,
    a subsea development plan utilizing a semi-submersible
    production system was approved by Chevron and its partner in
    late 2005, at which time the company made its initial booking of
    proved undeveloped reserves. Development drilling at Blind Faith
    commenced in early 2007. Reclassification of the reserves to the
    proved developed category is anticipated near the time of
    production

start-up

in
    2008. Initial total daily production rates for the field are
    estimated at 30,000 barrels of crude oil and 30 million
    cubic feet of natural gas, thereafter rising to maximum rates of
    40,000 barrels of crude oil and 35 million cubic feet
    of natural gas. The expected production life of the field is
    approximately 20 years.

In the fourth quarter 2006, the company announced its decision
    to participate in the ultra-deep Perdido Regional Development in
    the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The development encompasses the
    installation of a producing host facility designed to service
    multiple fields, including Chevron’s 33 percent-owned
    Great White, 60 percent-owned Silvertip and
    58 percent-owned Tobago. Chevron has a 38 percent
    interest in the Perdido Regional Host. All of these fields and
    the production facility are partner-operated. First oil is
    expected to occur by 2010, with the facility capable of handling
    130,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day. The
    company’s initial booking of proved undeveloped reserves
    occurred in 2006, and the phased reclassification of these
    reserves to the proved developed category is anticipated near
    the time of production

start-up.

The project has an expected life of approximately 25 years.

Exploration activities in 2006 included the announcement of a
    discovery early in the year at the 60 percent-owned and
    operated Big Foot prospect located in Walker Ridge
    Block 29. A sidetrack well at Big Foot was completed
    mid-year and encountered the same pay intervals as the discovery
    well. Additional appraisal drilling is planned for the first
    half of 2007.

At the 50 percent-owned and operated Jack discovery in
    Walker Ridge Block 758, a successful extended production
    flow test on the Jack #2 well was completed in
    mid-2006. Additional appraisal drilling is scheduled for the
    2007–2008 time frame. Data evaluation continued in early
    2007 at the nearby 41 percent-owned and operated Saint Malo
    prospect. Saint Malo was discovered in 2003, and an appraisal
    well was completed in 2004. Future appraisal drilling is being
    planned based on ongoing technical studies that are
    incorporating additional regional data. At the
    25 percent-owned and nonoperated 2005 Knotty Head
    discovery, a successful sidetrack well was drilled during 2006.
    Additional appraisal drilling and possible development
    alternatives were being evaluated in early 2007. At the
    30 percent-owned and nonoperated Tubular Bells prospect, an
    appraisal well in 2006 successfully tested the eastern portion
    of the reservoir structure. Additional appraisal work is being
    planned to further delineate the reservoir and to evaluate
    potential deeper targets. Plans were in progress in early 2007
    at the 22 percent-owned and nonoperated Puma discovery to
    complete an in-progress appraisal well and to schedule
    additional appraisal drilling for 2007.

At the end of 2006, the company had not yet recognized proved
    reserves for any of the exploration projects discussed above.



Besides the activities connected with the development and
    exploration projects in the Gulf of Mexico area, Chevron also
    moved forward with the federal, state and local permitting
    process for construction of a natural gas import terminal at
    Casotte Landing in Jackson County, Mississippi. In February
    2007, the company received approval from the Federal Energy
    Regulatory Commission to construct the facility. The terminal
    would be located adjacent to the company’s Pascagoula
    Refinery and be designed to process imported liquefied natural
    gas (LNG) for distribution to industrial, commercial and
    residential customers in Mississippi, Florida and the Northeast.
    The terminal would have an initial natural-gas processing
    capacity of 1.3 billion cubic feet per day. A decision to
    construct the facility will be timed to align with the
    company’s LNG supply projects.

The company also has contractual rights to 1 billion cubic
    feet per day of regasification capacity at the third party-owned
    Sabine Pass LNG terminal beginning in 2009. Also in the Sabine
    Pass area, the company has up to 1 billion cubic feet per
    day of pipeline capacity in a new pipeline that will be
    connected to the Sabine Pass LNG terminal. The new pipeline
    system will provide access to Chevron’s Sabine and
    Bridgeline pipelines, which connect to the Henry Hub.
    Interconnect capacity of 600 million cubic feet per day has
    also been secured to an existing pipeline. The Henry Hub is the
    pricing point for natural gas futures contracts traded on the
    New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and is located on the
    natural gas pipeline system in Louisiana. Henry Hub
    interconnects to nine interstate and four intrastate pipelines.

Other U.S. Areas:

Outside California and the
    Gulf of Mexico, the company manages operations in areas of the
    midcontinent United States that extend from the Rockies to
    southern Texas. In the Piceance Basin of northwestern Colorado,
    the company drilled 14 tight-gas delineation wells during 2006
    on the Skinner Ridge properties. Development drilling is
    scheduled to begin in the second quarter 2007 with the delivery
    of two custom-built drilling rigs. Chevron also operates 10
    offshore platforms and five producing natural gas fields in
    Alaska’s Cook Inlet and owns nonoperated production on the
    North Slope. During 2006, the company’s operations outside
    California and the Gulf of Mexico averaged daily net production
    of 141,000 barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and
    about 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas
    (315,000 barrels of oil-equivalent).

b)  Africa

Angola:

Chevron has working interests in four concessions in Angola — Blocks 0 and 14, which are company-operated, and Block 2 and the FST area, which are nonoperated.

The 39 percent-owned Block 0 and 31 percent-owned Block 14 are off the coast, north of the Congo River. In Block
0, the company operates in two areas — A and B — composed of 20 fields that produced 127,000 barrels per day of net liquids in 2006. The Block 0 concession extends through 2030.

Area A of Block 0 comprises 14 producing fields and averaged daily net production of approximately 67,000 barrels of crude oil and 1,000 barrels of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) in
2006. The first phase of development of the Mafumeira Field in Area A was approved in 2006 and will target the northern portion of the field. Initial booking of proved undeveloped reserves for this development occurred in 2003, and reclassification of proved undeveloped reserves into the proved developed category is anticipated near the time of first production, which is expected in 2008. Maximum total
daily production is expected to be approximately 30,000 barrels of crude oil in 2011.

In Area B of Block 0, average daily net production from six
    producing fields was 52,000 barrels of crude oil and
    condensate and 7,000 barrels of LPG in 2006. Included in
    this production were 28,000 barrels of liquids per day from
    the Sanha condensate natural gas utilization and Bomboco crude
    oil project. Initial reclassification of reserves from proved
    undeveloped to proved developed for this project occurred in
    2004 and is expected to continue during the drilling program
    that is scheduled for completion in 2007. Maximum total daily
    production from the Sanha and Bomboco fields reached 100,000
    barrels of liquids in 2006.

In Block 14, net production from the Kuito, Belize, Lobito
    and Landana fields averaged 25,000 barrels of crude oil per
    day in 2006. Belize and Lobito are part of the Benguela
    Belize-Lobito Tomboco (BBLT) development project. Phase 1
    of the BBLT project involved the installation of an integrated
    drilling and production platform and the



development of the Benguela and Belize fields. First oil was
    produced at the Belize Field in January 2006. Phase 2 of
    the project involved the installation of subsea production
    systems, pipelines and wells for the development of Lobito and
    Tomboco fields. First oil was produced from the Lobito Field in
    June 2006. Maximum total production for both phases of BBLT is
    estimated at 200,000 barrels of crude oil per day and is
    scheduled to occur in 2008. Proved undeveloped reserves for
    Benguela and Belize were initially recognized in 1998 and for
    Lobito and Tomboco in 2000. Certain proved developed reserves
    for Belize and Lobito were recognized in 2006, and additional
    BBLT reserves are expected to be reclassified to proved
    developed as project milestones are met. The concession period
    for these fields expires in 2027.

Another major project in Block 14 is the development of the
    Tombua and Landana fields. Construction on the project started
    in 2006. The maximum total daily production of
    100,000 barrels of crude oil is expected to occur by 2010.
    First oil was produced from the Landana North reservoir in June
    2006, using the BBLT infrastructure. Proved undeveloped reserves
    were recognized for Tombua and Landana in 2001 and 2002,
    respectively. Initial reclassification from proved undeveloped
    to proved developed for Landana occurred in 2006. Further
    reclassification is expected from 2009, when the

Tombua-Landana

facilities are completed, through 2012, when the drilling
    program is scheduled for completion. The concession for these
    fields expires in 2028. The total cost of the

Tombua-Landana

project is estimated at $3.8 billion.

Four exploration wells were drilled in Block 14 in 2006.
    One well resulted in a crude oil discovery at the deepwater
    Lucapa prospect. A second well appraised a prior-year discovery
    at Gabela, where development options are being studied. The
    remaining two wells are expected to be completed in the
    first-half 2007.

In Chevron’s other two concessions, the nonoperated working
    interests are 20 percent in Block 2, which is adjacent
    to the northwestern part of Angola’s coast, south of the
    Congo River, and 16 percent in the onshore FST area.
    Combined net production from these properties in 2006 was
    4,000 barrels of crude oil per day.

In addition to the producing activities in Angola, Chevron has a
    36 percent interest in the planned Angola LNG project,
    which will be integrated with natural gas production in the
    area. As of early 2007, participants in the Angola LNG project
    were finalizing the engineering, procurement, construction and
    commissioning contract for the

5-million-metric-ton-per-year

onshore LNG plant to be located in the northern part of the
    country. Chevron and Sonangol, Angola’s national oil
    company, are co-leaders of the project. Construction is expected
    to begin in late 2007. At the end of 2006, the company had not
    yet recognized proved reserves for the natural gas associated
    with this project.

Democratic Republic of the Congo:

Chevron has an
    18 percent nonoperated working interest in a
    production-sharing contract (PSC) off the coast of Democratic
    Republic of the Congo. Daily net production from seven fields
    averaged 3,000 barrels of crude oil in 2006.

Republic of the Congo:

Chevron has a 32 percent
    nonoperated working interest in the Nkossa, Nsoko and
    Moho-Bilondo exploitation permits and a 29 percent
    nonoperated working interest in the Kitina and Sounda
    exploitation permits, all of which are offshore Republic of the
    Congo. Net production from the Republic of the Congo fields
    averaged 11,000 barrels of crude oil per day in 2006. The
    Moho-Bilondo development continued in 2006, with first
    production expected in 2008. The development plan calls for
    crude oil produced by subsea well clusters to flow into a
    floating processing unit. Maximum total daily production of
    80,000 barrels of crude oil is expected by 2010. Proved
    undeveloped reserves were initially recognized in 2001. Transfer
    to the proved developed category is expected near the time of
    first production. The Moho-Bilondo concession expires in 2030.

Angola-Republic of the Congo Joint Development
    Area:

Chevron is operator and holds a 31 percent
    interest in the 14K/A-IMI Unit, located in a joint development
    area shared equally between Angola and Republic of the Congo. In
    2006, Chevron submitted a conceptual field development plan to a
    committee of representatives from the two countries.

Chad/Cameroon:

Chevron is a nonoperating partner in
    a project to develop crude oil fields in southern Chad and
    transport the crude oil by pipeline to the coast of Cameroon for
    export. Chevron has a 25 percent working interest in the
    producing operations and a 21 percent interest in the
    pipeline. Average daily net production from five fields in 2006
    was 34,000 barrels of crude oil. The first of the
    satellite-field development projects was completed in the first
    quarter of 2006, and first oil was achieved in 2005 from the Nya
    Field and in March 2006 from the Moundouli Field. The second
    satellite-field development project, Maikeri, was approved for
    funding in the second half of 2006, with first oil anticipated
    for fourth quarter 2007. The Chad producing operations are
    conducted under a concession agreement that expires in 2030.

Libya:

In 2005, the company was awarded
    Block 177 in Libya’s first exploration license round
    under the Exploration and Production Sharing Agreement IV.
    Chevron is the operator and holds a 100 percent interest in
    the block.



Acquisition and evaluation of seismic data is scheduled for
    completion in late 2007. A drilling program is scheduled for
    2008.

Equatorial Guinea:

Until October 2006, Chevron was a 22 percent partner and operator of Block L, offshore Equatorial Guinea. Following the drilling of two noncommercial wells and expiration of the exploration period, the company relinquished its equity in the block.

Nigeria:

Chevron’s principal
subsidiary in Nigeria, Chevron Nigeria Limited (CNL), operates and holds a 40 percent interest in 14 concessions, predominantly in the onshore and near-offshore regions of the Niger Delta. CNL operates under a joint-venture arrangement with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), which owns a 60 percent interest. In 2006, daily net production from 30 fields averaged 137,000 barrels
of crude oil, 29 million cubic feet of natural gas and 2,000 barrels of LPG.

During 2006, the company continued development activities for the deepwater Agbami project, in which Chevron has a 68 percent operated interest. The total capital investment for this project is estimated at $5.2 billion. The Agbami Field is located approximately 70 miles off the coast in the
central Niger Delta. Discovered in 1998, Agbami is at a water depth of approximately 4,800 feet. The geologic structure spans 45,000 acres across Oil Mining License (OML) 127

and OML 128. Agbami is designed as an all-subsea development,
    with the wells tied back to a floating production, storage and
    offloading (FPSO) vessel. The subsea wells will be connected to
    the FPSO by a system of flexible flowlines, manifolds and
    control umbilicals. All wells are to be drilled by a mobile
    drilling unit. Development drilling and completion operations
    were conducted throughout 2006.

During 2006, the Agbami development achieved the following major
    milestones: the FPSO hull was floated out of drydock in South
    Korea; topside modules fabricated in South Korea were installed
    on the FPSO and modules fabricated in Nigeria were received at
    the shipyard in South Korea. All other major equipment items
    were shipped to South Korea for installation, and manufacturing
    began on the equipment for the subsea wells. Completion of the
    FPSO and subsequent transport to Nigeria are expected in the
    fourth quarter 2007.

Agbami’s maximum total daily production of
    250,000 barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids is
    expected to be reached within the first year after

start-up

in
    the second half 2008. The company initially recognized proved
    undeveloped reserves for Agbami in 2002. A portion of the proved
    undeveloped reserves will be reclassified to proved developed in
    advance of production

start-up.

The expected field life is approximately 20 years.

For Chevron’s Aparo discovery in 2003 on OML 132 (formerly
    Oil Prospecting License [OPL] 213), the company entered into a
    joint-study agreement in 2004 with the partner group of the
    Bonga SW Field in OML 118 (formerly OPL 212) for the
    unitization and joint development of Aparo, which straddles OML
    132 and OPL 249. Negotiation of final terms for a unitization
    agreement for this development was ongoing as of early 2007.
    Front-end engineering and design (FEED) continued through 2006,
    and discussions were under way in early 2007 with potential
    contractors. Development will likely involve an FPSO and subsea
    wells. Partners are expected to make the investment decision
    during 2007, with production

start-up

estimated to occur in 2011. Maximum total production of
    150,000 barrels of crude oil per day is expected to be
    reached within one year of production

start-up.

The company recognized initial proved undeveloped reserves in
    2006 for its approximate 20 percent nonoperated working
    interest in the unitized project.

The company holds a 30 percent nonoperated working interest
    in the Usan project, located offshore in OPL 222. FEED for the
    Usan Field continued through 2006 on a selected FPSO concept.
    Technical tendering for the major contracts were under way as of
    early 2007. Project partners expect to make the investment
    decision during 2007. The company recognized proved undeveloped
    reserves for the project in 2004. Production

start-up

is
    estimated for late 2011, before which time certain proved
    undeveloped reserves are expected to be reclassified to the
    proved developed category. Maximum total production of
    180,000 barrels of crude oil per day is expected to be
    achieved within one year of

start-up.

The end date of the concession period will be determined after
    final regulatory approvals are obtained.



Chevron operates and holds a 95 percent interest in the
    2003 Nsiko discovery, also on OPL 249. Two successful appraisal
    wells were drilled in 2004, with subsurface evaluations and
    field development planning ongoing in early 2007. The company
    expects FEED to begin in late 2007. Maximum total production of
    100,000 barrels of oil per day is anticipated within one
    year of initial

start-up,

targeted for 2012. At the end of 2006, no proved reserves had
    been recognized for this project.

The Nnwa Field in OML 129 (formerly OPL 218) was discovered
    in 1999 and extends into two adjacent non-Chevron leased blocks.
    Chevron’s nonoperated working interest in OML 129 is
    46 percent. A later discovery in OML 129 was made in the
    Bilah Field. Commerciality of these fields is dependent upon
    resolution of the Nigerian Deepwater Gas fiscal regime and
    collaboration agreements with adjacent blocks. The Bilah Field
    discovery was under evaluation in early 2007 for further
    appraisal and the viability of a stand-alone condensate liquid
    recovery scheme.

Chevron is a participant in the South Offshore Water Injection
    Project, an enhanced crude-oil recovery project in the south
    offshore area of OML 90. The company operates and holds a
    40 percent interest as part of the joint venture with NNPC.
    The objective of the project is to increase production by
    providing water injection, natural-gas lift and production
    debottlenecking in the South Offshore Asset Area (Okan and Delta
    fields). The

25-year-life

project is in its development phase and by the end of 2006 was
    contributing incremental production of approximately
    7,000 net barrels of crude oil per day. Maximum total
    production from this project is expected to be 35,000 barrels of
    crude oil per day in 2010. The major project milestones expected
    in 2007 include commencement of water injection from the new
    Delta South Water Inject Platform facility, drilling of 10
    additional wells and the installation of pipelines. Initial
    recognition of proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves
    was made in 2005. Reclassification of proved reserves to the
    proved developed category is expected to occur after the
    evaluation of the water injection performance.

In May 2006, the company announced the discovery of crude oil at
    the

Uge-1

well in the 20 percent-owned and nonoperated offshore OPL
    214. Future drilling is contingent primarily on completing
    technical studies.

Chevron is involved in projects in Nigeria that support the
    company’s strategic initiative to commercialize its
    significant natural gas resource base outside the United States.
    Construction began in early 2006 on the Phase 3A expansion
    of the Escravos Gas Plant (EGP). Engineering, procurement and
    construction are expected to continue through 2007, with

start-up

targeted for early 2009. The scope of EGP Phase 3A includes
    offshore natural gas gathering and compression infrastructure
    and a second plant, which potentially would increase processing
    capacity from 285 million to 680 million cubic feet of
    natural gas per day and increase LPG and condensate export
    capacity from 4,000 to 43,000 barrels per day. Proved
    undeveloped reserves associated with EGP Phase 3A were
    recognized in 2002. These reserves are expected to be
    reclassified to proved developed as various project milestones
    are reached and related projects are completed. The anticipated
    life of the project is 25 years. Chevron holds a
    40 percent operated interest in this project.

Refer also to page 25 for a discussion on the planned

gas-to-liquids

facility at Escravos.

Chevron holds a 38 percent interest in the West African Gas
    Pipeline, which is expected to start up in the first-half 2007
    and supply Nigerian natural gas to customers in Ghana, Benin and
    Togo for industrial applications and power generation. A

350-mile

offshore segment of the West African Gas Pipeline connects to an
    existing onshore pipeline in Nigeria. Chevron is the managing
    sponsor in West African Pipeline Company Limited, which
    constructed, owns and will operate the pipeline.

In February 2006, Chevron signed a Project Development Agreement
    for a 19 percent nonoperated working interest in the
    Olokola LNG Project, which involves construction of a
    four-train,

22-million-metric-ton-per-year

natural gas liquefaction facility and marine terminal located in
    a free trade zone between Lagos and Escravos. Chevron is
    expected to supply approximately 1.8 billion cubic feet per
    day of natural gas to the LNG plant. The project entered FEED in
    the first quarter 2006. The partners’ investment decision
    is scheduled for 2007, and initial production is targeted for
    2012. The company had not recognized proved reserves for this
    project at the end of 2006.

Nigeria-São Tomé e Príncipe Joint Development
    Zone (JDZ):

Chevron is the operator of JDZ Block 1
    and holds a 46 percent interest following the sale of a
    5 percent interest in 2006. In March 2006, the first
    exploration well was completed and encountered hydrocarbons. In
    early 2007, commercial options were being examined to determine
    the possible need for additional drilling.



c)  Asia-Pacific

Australia:

During 2006, the net daily production from Chevron’s interests in Australia was 34,000 barrels of crude oil and condensate, 5,000 barrels of LPG, and 360 million cubic feet of natural gas.

Chevron has a 17 percent nonoperated working interest in the North West Shelf (NWS)
Venture offshore Western Australia. Daily net production from the project during 2006 averaged 29,000 barrels of crude oil and condensate, 358 million cubic feet of natural gas, and 5,000 barrels of LPG. Approximately 75 percent of the natural gas was sold in the form of LNG to major utilities in Japan and South Korea, primarily under long-term contracts. The remaining natural gas
was sold to the Western Australia domestic market. A fifth LNG train, which is intended to increase export capacity by more than 4 million metric tons per year to more than 16 million, is expected to be commissioned in 2008. The Angel natural gas field, being developed at an estimated total cost of $1.2 billion, will supply the fifth LNG train. NWS reserves are recorded according to
existing sales agreements.

Start-up

of the fifth train is projected to accelerate production of proved reserves and additional reclassification of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed. The end of the concession period for the NWS Venture is 2034.

On Barrow and Thevenard islands off the northwest coast of
    Australia, Chevron operates crude oil producing facilities that
    had combined net production of 5,000 barrels per day in
    2006. Chevron’s interest in this operation is
    57 percent for Barrow Island and 51 percent for
    Thevenard Island.

Also off the northwest coast of Australia, Chevron is the
    operator of the Gorgon-area fields and has a 50 percent
    ownership interest across most of the Greater Gorgon Area.
    Chevron and its two joint-venture participants signed a
    Framework Agreement in 2005 that will enable the combined
    development of Gorgon and the nearby natural gas fields as one
    world-scale project. In early 2007, progress continued toward
    securing environmental regulatory approvals necessary for the
    development of the Greater Gorgon LNG project on Barrow Island.
    A two-train,

10-million-metric-ton-per-year

LNG development is planned for the island, with natural gas
    supplied from the Gorgon and Jansz natural gas fields.

Elsewhere in the Greater Gorgon Area during 2006, concept
    studies were undertaken on the

Wheatstone-1

natural gas discovery located northeast of the Gorgon Field.
    Appraisal drilling is scheduled for 2007. The company also
    announced in 2006 two significant natural gas discoveries at the
    67 percent-owned Clio-1 and 50 percent-owned Chandon-1
    exploration wells located offshore northwestern coast in the
    Greater Gorgon development area. Additional work on these two
    company-operated prospects includes a

3-D

seismic
    survey program that started in late 2006 to better determine the
    potential of the natural gas find and subsequent development
    options.

Chevron was also awarded exploration rights to Blocks WA-374-P
    (Greater Gorgon Area) and WA-383-P (Exmouth West) in the
    Carnarvon Basin offshore Western Australia. Chevron holds a
    50 percent operated interest in the blocks. Operations
    commenced in WA-374-P with the acquisition of

3-D

seismic
    data. On WA-383-P, a three-year work program includes
    geotechnical studies and

2-D

seismic
    work. In early 2007, the company was also named operator and
    awarded a 50 percent interest in exploration acreage in
    Block W06-12 in the Greater Gorgon Area. A three-year work
    program includes geotechnical studies, seismic surveys and
    drilling of an exploration well.

At the end of 2006, the company had not recognized proved
    reserves for any of the Greater Gorgon Area fields. Recognition
    is contingent on securing sufficient LNG sales agreements and
    achieving other key project milestones. The company has signed
    separate nonbinding Heads of Agreements totaling
    4.2 million metric tons per year with three companies in
    Japan to supply LNG from the Gorgon project. As of early 2007,
    negotiations were continuing to finalize binding sales
    agreements. Purchases by each of these customers are expected to
    range from 1.2 million metric tons per year to
    1.5 million metric tons per year of LNG over 25 years
    beginning after 2010.



Azerbaijan:

Chevron holds a 10 percent nonoperated working interest in the Azerbaijan International Operating Company (AIOC), which holds offshore crude oil reserves in the Caspian Sea from the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) project. Chevron also has a 9 percent equity interest in the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline,
which transports AIOC production from Baku, Azerbaijan, through Georgia to deepwater port facilities in Ceyhan, Turkey. (Refer to “Pipelines” under “Transportation Operations” on page 27 for a discussion of the BTC operations.)

In 2006, the company’s daily net crude oil production from AIOC averaged 46,000 barrels. Phase II of the ACG development project
began producing from the West Azeri Field in late 2005 and was completed with the production of first oil from the East Azeri Field in October 2006. Phase III was in the final phase of development in early 2007, with production

start-up

targeted for 2008. Total crude oil production from the project is expected to increase to about 700,000 barrels
per day in 2007 and to more than 1 million barrels per day by 2009. Proved undeveloped reserves for ACG are expected to be reclassified to proved developed reserves as new wells are drilled and completed. The AIOC operations are conducted under a

30-year

PSC that expires at the end of 2024.

Kazakhstan:

Chevron holds a 20 percent
    nonoperated working interest in the Karachaganak project that is
    being developed in phases. During 2006, Karachaganak daily net
    production averaged 38,000 barrels of liquids and
    143 million cubic feet of natural gas.

The Karachaganak operations are conducted under a

40-year

concession agreement that expires in 2038. In 2006, access to
    the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) and Atyrau-Samara
    pipelines allowed Karachaganak sales of approximately 143,000
    barrels per day (27,000 net barrels) of processed liquids at
    prices available in world markets. A fourth train was approved
    in December 2006 that is designed to increase this export of
    processed liquids by 56,000 barrels per day (11,000 net
    barrels). The fourth train is expected to start up in 2009.

Phase III of Karachagnak field development is contingent
    upon the Republic of Kazakhstan’s identifying and enabling
    a commercially attractive outlet for the increased natural gas
    volumes. Timing for the recognition of Phase III proved
    reserves and an increase in production are uncertain, and both
    depend on achieving a natural gas sales agreement and finalizing
    a viable Phase III project design.

Refer also to page 23 for a discussion of Tengizchevroil, a
    50 percent-owned affiliate with operations in Kazakhstan.

Russia:

In 2005, OAO Gazprom, Russia’s largest
    natural gas producer, included Chevron on a list of companies
    that could continue discussions concerning the development and
    related commercial activities of the Shtokmanovskoye Field, a
    very large natural gas field offshore Russia in the Barents Sea.
    In October 2006, OAO Gazprom issued a public statement
    indicating its plan to develop Shtokmanovskoye without foreign
    partners. Refer also to page 24 for a discussion of the
    company’s interest in a Russian joint venture.

Bangladesh:

Chevron is the operator of four onshore
    blocks, with a 98 percent interest in Blocks 12, 13
    and 14 and a 43 percent interest in Block 7. In 2006,
    the properties averaged daily net production of 126 million
    cubic feet of natural gas. Following a two-year development
    program, production from the Bibiyana Field in Block 12 is
    scheduled to start in the first-half 2007, reaching maximum
    total production of 500 million cubic feet per day by late
    2010. The development program includes a gas processing plant
    with capacity of 600 million cubic feet per day and a
    natural gas pipeline. Initial proved reserves were recognized in
    2005. In 2006, additional proved reserves were  recognized based
    on additional development wells drilled during the year, and
    certain proved undeveloped reserves were reclassified to the
    proved developed category in recognition of imminent completion
    of the gas plant and pipeline infrastructure required for
    production

start-up.

The Bibiyana PSC expires in 2034.



Cambodia:

Chevron operates and holds a 55 percent interest in the

1.6 million-acre Block

A, located offshore in the Gulf of Thailand. A third drilling campaign commenced in third quarter 2006 and is expected to be completed by first quarter 2007.

Myanmar:

Chevron has a 28 percent nonoperated working interest in a PSC for the production of natural gas from the Yadana and Sein fields, located offshore Myanmar in the Andaman Sea. The company also has a 28 percent interest in a pipeline company that transports the natural gas from the Yadana Field to the Myanmar-Thailand border for final delivery to power plants in Thailand.
The company’s average net natural gas production in Myanmar was 89 million cubic feet per day in 2006.

Thailand:

Chevron has both operated and nonoperated
    working interests in several different offshore blocks in
    Thailand. The company’s daily net production averaged
    73,000 barrels of crude oil and condensate and
    856 million cubic feet of natural gas in 2006.

Operated interests include concessions with ownership interests
    ranging from 35 percent to 80 percent in
    Blocks 10 through 13 and B12/27, 52 percent-owned
    Blocks B8/32 and 9A, 60 percent-owned G4/43 and
    71 percent-owned G4/48.

In the concession containing Blocks 10 through 13 and
    B12/27, debottlenecking of all central processing platforms was
    completed, which is expected to add more than 160 million
    cubic feet per day of natural gas processing capability. The
    company anticipates this additional capacity will be used when
    PTT Public Company Limited completes the third natural gas
    pipeline to shore in 2007. In late 2007, the company expects to
    complete the evaluation of a possible second natural gas central
    processing facility in Platong to support a Heads of Agreement
    signed in 2003 for additional natural gas sales to meet future
    natural gas demands in Thailand. This Platong Gas II Project, in
    which the company has a 70 percent interest, would add
    330 million cubic feet per day of processing capacity in
    the Platong area, which spans Blocks 10, 10A, 11 and 11A in
    the Gulf of Thailand. The new facilities would include a central
    processing platform, pipelines and five initial wellhead
    platforms. First gas sales would occur in 2010. Proved reserves
    would be recognized throughout the

12-year

project life as the required wellhead platforms are developed.

In Blocks B8/32 and 9A, crude oil is produced from six operating
    areas within the Pattani Field. First production from Lanta area
    in Block G4/43 is anticipated in the first-half 2007.

Chevron has a 16 percent nonoperated working interest in
    Blocks 14A, 15A, 16A and G9/48, known collectively as the
    Arthit Field. Development of Arthit is progressing with six
    wellhead platforms installed and 41 wells drilled in 2006.
    First production is planned for 2008.

In 2006, the company signed two exploration concessions, Blocks
    G4/48 and G9/48. Two delineation wells are scheduled to be
    drilled in Block G4/48 in 2007. One exploration well in Block
    G9/48 is required to be drilled by the first quarter 2009. As of
    early 2007, processing and interpretation of seismic data were
    under way in Block G9/48. Chevron also holds exploration
    interests in a number of blocks that are currently inactive,
    pending resolution of border issues between Thailand and
    Cambodia.

Vietnam:

The company is operator in two PSCs
    offshore southwest Vietnam in the northern part of the Malay
    Basin. Chevron has a 42 percent interest in Blocks B and
    48/95 and a 43 percent interest in Block 52/97. In
    April 2006, the company signed a

30-year

PSC
    for Block 122 located offshore eastern Vietnam. The company
    has a 50 percent operated interest in this block and has
    undertaken a three-year work program for seismic acquisition and
    drilling of an exploratory well.

In July 2006, the company submitted a revised summary
    development plan to state-owned PetroVietnam for Blocks B, 48/95
    and 52/97 for the Vietnam Gas Project. The final detailed
    development plan is expected to be submitted in the third
    quarter 2007, with FEED projected to begin by the end of 2007.
    First natural gas production is targeted for 2011 but is
    dependent on the progress of commercial negotiations. Maximum
    total production of approximately 500 million cubic feet of
    natural gas per day is projected within four years of the
    production

start-up.

Recognition of initial proved reserves is expected to follow
    execution of the gas sales agreements and anticipated project
    sanction in 2008. Total development cost for the project is
    approximately $3.5 billion.



China:

Chevron has a 33 percent nonoperated
    working interest in Blocks 16/08 and 16/19 located in the
    Pearl River Delta Mouth Basin, a 25 percent nonoperated
    working interest in QHD-32-6 in Bohai Bay, and a 16 percent
    nonoperated working interest in the unitized and producing
    Bozhong

25-1

Field in Bohai Bay Block 11/19. Daily net production from
    the company’s interests in China averaged
    23,000 barrels of crude oil and condensate and
    18 million cubic feet of natural gas in 2006. Production
    during 2006 included first natural gas in January from the
    HZ21-1 natural gas development project, located in
    Block 16/08. Chevron also has interests ranging from
    36 percent to 50 percent in four prospective onshore
    natural gas blocks in the Ordos Basin totaling about
    1.5 million acres.

Partitioned Neutral Zone (PNZ):

Saudi Arabian
    Chevron Inc., a Chevron subsidiary, holds a

60-year

concession that expires in 2009 to produce crude oil from
    onshore properties in the PNZ, which is located between the
    Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the State of Kuwait. In September
    2006, Chevron submitted to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia a
    proposal to extend the concession agreement. Under the current
    concession, Chevron has the right to Saudi Arabia’s
    50 percent undivided interest in the hydrocarbon resource
    and pays a royalty and other taxes on volumes produced. During
    2006, average daily net production was 111,000 barrels of
    crude oil and 19 million cubic feet of natural gas.
    Facilities for the first phase of a steamflood project were
    completed in December 2005, and steam injection began in
    February 2006. The success of the first phase has led to the
    approval of funding for a second phase steamflood pilot project
    that is expected to be completed by late 2008. This pilot is a
    unique application of steam injection into a carbonate reservoir.

Philippines:

The company holds a 45 percent
    nonoperated working interest in the Malampaya natural gas field
    located about 50 miles offshore Palawan Island. Daily net
    production in 2006 was 108 million cubic feet of natural
    gas and 6,000 barrels of condensate. Chevron also develops
    and produces steam resources under an agreement with the
    National Power Corporation, a Philippine government-owned
    company. The combined generating capacity is 634 megawatts.

d)  Indonesia

Chevron’s operated interests
    in Indonesia are managed by several wholly owned subsidiaries,
    including PT. Chevron Pacific Indonesia (CPI), Chevron Indonesia
    Company, Chevron Makassar Ltd, Chevron Geothermal Indonesia
    (CGI) and Chevron Geothermal Salak Ltd (CGS), and a subsidiary
    P.T. Mandau CiptaTenaga Nusantara (MCTN). CPI operates four
    PSCs, with interests ranging from 50 percent to
    100 percent. In addition Chevron operates five PSCs in the
    Kutei Basin, East Kalimantan and one PSC in the Tarakan Basin,
    Northeast Kalimantan. These interests range from 35 percent
    to 100 percent. Chevron also has a 25 percent working
    interest in a nonoperated joint venture in South Natuna Sea
    Block B and a 40 percent working interest in the
    nonoperated NE Madura III Block in the East Java Sea Basin.
    CGI is a power generation company that operates the Darajat
    geothermal contract area in West Java, with a total capacity of
    145 megawatts. MCTN operates a cogeneration facility in support
    of CPI’s operation in North Duri. CGS operates the Salak
    geothermal field, located in West Java, with a total capacity of
    377 megawatts.

In North Duri, located in the Rokan PSC, development is
    progressing on steamflood activity for the sequential
    development of three possible expansion areas. The first
    expansion involves the development of Area 12, in which the
    company has a 100 percent interest, and is planned to come
    onstream in 2008, with maximum total daily production estimated
    at 34,000 barrels of crude oil in 2012. Proved undeveloped
    reserves for North Duri were recognized in previous years, and
    reclassification from proved undeveloped to proved developed
    will occur during various stages of sequential project
    completion.

A drilling campaign is scheduled to continue through 2007 in
    South Natuna Sea Block B, with first oil from Kerisi Field
    expected in late 2007. In 2006, the company executed a farm-out
    agreement relinquishing five Indonesian PSCs in exchange for a
    40 percent nonoperated working interest in the NE
    Madura III Block.

In early 2007, the company submitted preliminary plans of
    development to the government of Indonesia for the Bangka,
    Gendalo Hub and Gehem Hub deepwater natural gas projects,
    located in the Kutei Basin. These projects will



likely be developed in parallel, with first production for all
    projects targeted for 2013. The actual timing is partially
    dependent on government approvals, market conditions and the
    achievement of key project milestones.

The development concept for the 50 percent-owned and
    operated Sadewa project, located in the Kutei Basin is under
    evaluation and is expected to be completed in late 2007.
    Assuming the evaluation is positive, initial proved reserves
    recognition would be expected to occur in 2008, with first
    production expected in 2010.

Daily net production from all producing areas in Indonesia
    averaged 198,000 barrels of crude oil and 302 million
    cubic feet of natural gas in 2006.

e)  Other
    International Areas

Argentina:

Chevron operates in Argentina through its subsidiary, Chevron Argentina S.R.L. The company and its partners hold 17 operated production concessions and four exploration blocks (two operated and two nonoperated) in the Neuquen and Austral basins. Working interests range from approximately 19 percent to 100 percent
in operated license areas. Daily net production in 2006 averaged 38,000 barrels of crude oil and 54 million cubic feet of natural gas. Chevron also holds a 14 percent interest in Oleoductos del Valle S.A. pipeline and a 28 percent interest in the Oleoducto Transandino pipeline.

Brazil:

Chevron holds working interests ranging from 20 percent to 52 percent
in four deepwater blocks. In Block BC-4, located in the Campos Basin, the company is the operator and has a 52 percent interest in the Frade Field.

In 2006, the Frade project completed FEED and started construction with all major contracts in place. The total project cost is estimated at $2.8 billion. Proved undeveloped reserves were recorded for the first time in 2005. Reclassification
of proved undeveloped reserves to the proved developed category is anticipated upon production

start-up

in early 2009 and is expected to continue until 2011. Estimated maximum total production of 90,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day is anticipated in 2011. The Frade concession expires in 2025.

The company concentrates its exploration efforts in the Campos
    and Santos basins. In the nonoperated Campos Basin Block BC-20,
    two areas — 38 percent-owned Papa-Terra (formerly
    RJS610) and 30 percent-owned RJS609 — have been
    retained for development following the end of the exploration
    phase of this block. In the Papa-Terra area, the appraisal phase
    has been completed confirming hydrocarbons in three separate
    reservoirs. In June 2006, a field development plan was submitted
    to the government. FEED for the Papa-Terra Field is expected to
    commence in late 2007 after completing an appraisal program
    planned for mid-2007. In the RJS609 area, all appraisal drilling
    was completed to fulfill requirements for a Declaration of
    Commerciality that was filed in December 2006 for a new field,
    designated Maromba. Elsewhere in Campos, the company holds a
    30 percent nonoperated working interest in the

BM-C-4

Block, in which drilling of the final obligatory exploration
    well began in October 2006. As of early 2007, drilling of the
    Guarana prospect was ongoing, with completion and evaluation
    expected to occur later in 2007. In the 20 percent-owned
    and nonoperated Santos Basin BS-4 Block, the evaluation of an
    exploration campaign was completed in 2006, with the Declaration
    of Commerciality filed in December 2006 designating two new
    fields, Atlanta and Oliva.

Colombia:

The company operates three natural gas
    fields in Colombia — the offshore Chuchupa and the
    onshore Ballena and Riohacha. The fields are part of the Guajira
    Association contract, a joint venture agreement that was
    extended in 2003. At that time, additional proved reserves were
    recognized. The company continues to operate the fields and
    receives 43 percent of the production for the remaining
    life of each field as well as a variable production volume from
    a fixed-fee Build-Operate-Maintain-Transfer (BOMT) agreement
    based on prior Chuchupa capital contributions. The BOMT
    agreement expires in 2016. Net production averaged
    174 million cubic feet of natural gas per day in 2006. New
    production capacity was commissioned in 2006 and will help meet
    the demand of the growing Colombian natural gas market.



Trinidad and Tobago:

The company has a
    50 percent nonoperated working interest in four blocks in
    offshore Trinidad, which include the Dolphin and Dolphin Deep
    producing natural gas fields and the Starfish discovery. Net
    natural gas production from Dolphin and Dolphin Deep in 2006
    averaged 174 million cubic feet per day.

Natural gas supply to the Atlantic LNG Train 3 from the Dolphin
    Field began in 2005. In July 2006, Chevron delivered the first
    natural gas from the Dolphin Deep development to the Atlantic
    LNG Train 3 and Train 4. The initial phase of the development
    became fully operational during 2006 and supplied an average of
    38 million net cubic feet of natural gas per day to Train 3
    and 31 million net cubic feet of natural gas per day to
    Train 4. Proved reserves associated with the Train 4 gas sales
    agreement were recognized in 2004. Reserves associated with
    Trains 3 and 4 were transferred to the proved developed category
    in 2005. The contract period for Train 3 ends in 2023 and for
    Train 4 in 2026.

Chevron also holds a 50 percent operated interest in the
    Manatee area of Block 6d. After successful exploration
    drilling results in 2005, the company assessed alternative
    development strategies for the Loran Field in Venezuela and
    Manatee area in 2006. As of early 2007, negotiations were in
    progress between Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela to unitize
    the Loran and Manatee discoveries.

Venezuela:

As of October 2006, the company’s
    operations at the Boscan and LL-652 fields were converted to two
    joint stock companies. From that date, these activities were
    treated as affiliate operations and accounted for under the
    equity method. Refer to page 23 for a further discussion of
    these operations.

The company also has ongoing exploration activity in two blocks
    offshore Plataforma Deltana, in which the company is operator
    and holds a 60 percent interest. In Block 2, which
    includes the Loran Field, evaluation and project development
    work continued during 2006. In the 100 percent-owned and
    operated Block 3, Chevron discovered natural gas in 2005.
    The discovery is in close proximity to the Loran natural gas
    field and provides significant resources that will be included
    in the detailed evaluation as a potential gas supply source for
    Venezuela’s first LNG train. Seismic work elsewhere in
    Block 3 started in 2006. Chevron also has 100 percent
    interest in the Cardon III exploration block, located
    offshore western Venezuela north of the Maracaibo producing
    region. Seismic work in this block, which has natural gas
    potential, is planned for 2007.

Refer also to page 23 for a discussion of the Hamaca heavy
    oil production and upgrading project in Venezuela.

Canada:

The company’s assets in Canada include
    a 27 percent nonoperated working interest in the Hibernia
    Field offshore eastern Canada, a 20 percent nonoperated
    working interest in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project (AOSP) and
    exploration acreage in the Mackenzie Delta and Orphan Basin.
    Excluding volumes mined at the AOSP, daily net production in
    2006 from the company’s Canadian operations was
    46,000 barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and
    6 million cubic feet of natural gas. The company also owns
    a 28 percent operated interest in the Hebron project
    offshore eastern Canada. Negotiations with the government of
    Newfoundland and Labrador on commercial terms for the
    development of the field were suspended in April 2006, and the
    project team was demobilized. The timing for a possible
    resumption of negotiations was uncertain as of early 2007.

At the AOSP, which began operations in 2003, bitumen is mined
    from oil sands and upgraded into synthetic crude oil using
    hydroprocessing technology. Chevron’s share of bitumen
    production in 2006 averaged 27,000 barrels per day.

In 2006, the company elected to participate in the first phase
    of expansion of the AOSP. The expansion is being designed to
    produce approximately 100,000 barrels of bitumen per day
    (20,000 net barrels) and upgrade it into synthetic crude
    oil at an estimated total cost of $10 billion. The
    expansion will increase total AOSP design capacity to
    approximately 255,000 barrels of bitumen per day by 2010.
    This phase of expansion includes the construction of mining and
    extraction facilities at the Jackpine Mine, for which net proved
    undeveloped oil sands reserves were recorded in 2006.

Net proved oil sands reserves at the end of 2006 were
    443 million barrels, increasing from 2005 primarily due to
    the addition of reserves for the Jackpine Mine and proved
    developed oil sands reserves for the Muskeg River Mine.
    Securities and Exchange Commission regulations define these
    reserves as mining-related and not a part of conventional oil
    and gas reserves.

Chevron also holds a 60 percent operated interest in the
    Ells River “In Situ” Oil Sands Project in the
    Athabasca region. This project consists of heavy oil leases of
    more than 75,000 acres that were acquired in 2005 and 2006.
    The area contains significant volumes with the potential for
    recovery using Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage, a proven
    technology that employs steam and horizontal drilling to extract
    the bitumen through wells rather than through mining operations.
    Initial drilling began in January 2007.



Denmark:

Chevron holds a 15 percent nonoperated working interest in the Danish Underground Consortium (DUC), which produces crude oil and natural gas from 15 fields in the Danish North Sea and involves 12 percent to 27 percent interests in five exploration licenses. Daily net production in 2006 from the DUC
was 44,000 barrels of crude oil and 146 million cubic feet of natural gas.

Faroe Islands:

During 2006, the company focused on the interpretation of the seismic program over License 008, located near the Rosebank/Lochnagar discovery in the United Kingdom. The company has a 40 percent interest in five offshore blocks and is the operator.

Netherlands:

Chevron
is the operator and holds interests ranging from 34 percent to 80 percent in nine blocks in the Netherlands sector of the North Sea. The company’s daily net production from seven producing fields averaged 3,000 barrels of crude oil and 7 million cubic feet of natural gas in 2006. Production

start-up

at the first stage of the
A/B Gas Project is scheduled for early 2008.

Norway:

At the 8 percent-owned and nonoperated
    Draugen Field, the company’s share of production during
    2006 was 6,000 barrels of crude oil per day. In the
    30 percent-owned and nonoperated PL 324 Field, the first
    exploration well is planned for the first-half 2007. In the
    40 percent-owned and operated PL 325, seismic data was
    acquired in 2006. Pending the results of the ongoing seismic
    processing, a first exploration well is planned for 2008. At PL
    283, in which Chevron holds a 25 percent nonoperated
    working interest, an exploration well that tested natural gas in
    the Stetind prospect in 2006 will be followed by another
    exploration well in mid-2007.

Through an Area of Mutual Interest with a partner in the Barents
    Sea, Chevron was awarded a 40 percent nonoperated working
    interest in PL 397 in April 2006, encompassing six blocks
    located in the Nordkapp East Basin. A

3-D

seismic
    survey was acquired and is planned to be processed in 2007.

United Kingdom:

Offshore United Kingdom, the
    company’s daily net production in 2006 from nine fields was
    75,000 barrels of crude oil and 242 million cubic feet
    of natural gas. Of this volume, daily net production from the
    85 percent-owned and operated Captain Field was
    37,000 barrels of crude oil and from the co-operated and
    32 percent-owned Britannia Field was 5,000 barrels of crude
    oil and 138 million cubic feet of natural gas. In December
    2006, Chevron exchanged interests in the nonproducing North Sea
    Blocks 16/22 and 16/23 for an additional 2 percent
    interest in the Chevron-operated Alba Field, raising the
    company’s total interest to 23 percent. Daily net
    production from this field averaged 11,000 barrels of crude
    oil in 2006.

As of early 2007, development activities were continuing at the
    Britannia satellite fields Callanish and Brodgar, in which
    Chevron holds 17 percent and 25 percent nonoperated
    working interests, respectively. A new platform and all subsea
    equipment and pipelines were installed in 2006. Production

start-up

from these two satellite fields is expected to occur in 2008.
    Together, these fields are expected to achieve maximum total
    daily production of 25,000 barrels of crude oil and
    133 million cubic feet of natural gas several months after
    both fields start up. Proved undeveloped reserves were initially
    recognized in 2000. In 2006, proved undeveloped reserves were
    reclassified to the proved developed category. This project has
    an expected production life of approximately 15 years.

Production

start-up

occurred in June 2006 at the Area C project in the eastern
    portion of the Captain Field. The project included the
    installation of subsea infrastructure and the drilling of two
    new subsea wells. Maximum total production of
    14,000 barrels of crude oil per day was achieved in
    September 2006. Initial proved undeveloped reserves were booked
    in 2004 and were reclassified as proved developed in 2006
    following completion of development drilling. Further additions
    to proved reserves are expected to occur as the field matures.

The Alder discovery, west of the Britannia Field, is being
    evaluated and likely to be developed as a tieback to existing
    infrastructure. The company has a 70 percent operated
    interest in the project, which is expected to start up and reach
    maximum total daily production rates of 9,000 barrels of
    crude oil and 80 million cubic feet of natural gas in 2011.
    No proved reserves had been recognized as of year-end 2006.



In late 2006, the first well in a three-well program began
    drilling to evaluate the commercial potential of the
    Rosebank/Lochnagar discovery and adjacent acreage.

In early 2007, Chevron was awarded eight operated exploration
    blocks and two nonoperated blocks west of Shetland Islands in
    the 24th United Kingdom Offshore Licensing Round.

f)  Affiliate
    Operations

Kazakhstan:

The company holds a 50 percent
    interest in Tengizchevroil (TCO), which is developing the Tengiz
    and Korolev crude oil fields located in western Kazakhstan under
    a

40-year

concession that expires in 2033. Chevron’s share of daily
    net production in 2006 averaged 135,000 barrels of crude
    oil and natural gas liquids and 193 million cubic feet of
    natural gas.

TCO is undergoing a significant expansion composed of two
    integrated projects referred to as the Second Generation Plant
    (SGP) and Sour Gas Injection (SGI). At a total combined
    cost of approximately $6 billion, these projects are
    designed to increase TCO’s crude oil production capacity
    from 300,000 barrels per day to between 460,000 and
    550,000 barrels per day in 2008. The actual production
    level within the estimated range is dependent partially on the
    effects of the SGI, which are discussed below. The

start-up

of
    the SGP/SGI project is expected in 2007.

SGP involves the construction of a large processing train for
    treating crude oil and the associated sour gas (i.e., high in
    sulfur content). The SGP design is based on the same
    conventional technology employed in the existing processing
    trains. Proved undeveloped reserves associated with SGP were
    recognized in 2001. During 2006, 55 wells were drilled,
    deepened

and/or

completed in the Tengiz and Korolev reservoirs to generate
    volumes required for the new SGP train, and reserves associated
    with the project were reclassified to the proved developed
    category. Over the next decade, ongoing field development is
    expected to result in the reclassification of additional proved
    undeveloped reserves to proved developed.

SGI involves taking a portion of the sour gas separated from the
    crude oil production at the SGP processing train and reinjecting
    it into the Tengiz reservoir. Chevron expects that SGI will have
    two key effects. First, SGI will reduce the sour gas processing
    capacity required at SGP, thereby increasing liquid production
    capacity and lowering the quantities of sulfur and gas that
    would otherwise be generated. Second, it is expected that over
    time SGI will increase production efficiency and recoverable
    volumes as the injected gas maintains higher reservoir pressure
    and displaces oil toward producing wells. Between 2007 and 2008,
    the company anticipates recognizing additional proved reserves
    associated with the SGI expansion. The primary SGI risks include
    uncertainties about compressor performance associated with
    injecting high-pressure sour gas and subsurface responses to
    injection.

Essentially all of TCO’s production is exported through the
    Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) pipeline that runs from Tengiz
    in Kazakhstan to tanker loading facilities at Novorossiysk on
    the Russian coast of the Black Sea. CPC is seeking stockholder
    approval for an expansion to accommodate increased TCO volumes
    beginning in 2009. During 2006, TCO continued the construction
    of expanded rail car loading and rail export facilities, which
    is expected to be completed by third quarter 2007. As of early
    2007, other alternatives were also being explored to increase
    export capacity prior to expansion of the CPC pipeline.

Venezuela:

Chevron has a 30 percent interest in
    the Hamaca heavy oil production and upgrading project located in
    Venezuela’s Orinoco Belt. The crude oil upgrading began in
    late 2004. In 2005, the facility reached total design capacity
    of processing and upgrading 190,000 barrels per day of
    heavy crude oil (8.5 degrees API gravity) into
    180,000 barrels of lighter, higher-value crude oil (26
    degrees API gravity). In 2006, daily net production averaged
    36,000 barrels of liquids and 8 million cubic feet of
    natural gas. In late February 2007, the President of Venezuela
    issued a decree announcing the government’s intention for
    the state-owned oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela
    S.A., to increase its ownership later this year in all Orinoco
    Heavy Oil Associations, including Chevron’s
    30 percent-owned Hamaca project, to a minimum of
    60 percent. The impact on Chevron from such an action is
    uncertain but is not expected to have a material effect on the
    company’s results of operations, consolidated financial
    position or liquidity.

The company operated the onshore Boscan Field for 10 years
    under an operating service agreement with Petróleos de
    Venezuela S.A. In October 2006, the contract was converted into
    a joint stock company, Petroboscan, in which Chevron is a
    39 percent owner. At the same time, operatorship was
    transferred from Chevron to Petroboscan. No proved reserves had
    been recognized under the operating service agreement, but
    proved reserves associated with this new

20-year

production contract were recorded in 2006. Under the operating
    service agreement, Boscan had average net production of 109,000
    oil-equivalent barrels per day for the first nine months of
    2006. Net production for the final three months of 2006 under
    the joint stock company was 30,000 oil-equivalent barrels per
    day.



The company operated the LL-652 Field for eight years under a
    risked-service agreement with a 63 percent interest until
    the contract was converted in October 2006 to a
    25 percent-owned joint stock company, Petroindependiente.
    Under the new contract, Petroindependiente is the operator
    during the

20-year

contract period. Located in Lake Maracaibo,

LL-652’s

net production averaged 3,000 barrels of liquids per day
    and 25 million cubic feet of natural gas per day during
    2006. Chevron had previously booked reserves for LL-652 under
    the risked-service agreement.

Russia:

In October 2006, Chevron signed a framework
    agreement with OAO Gazpromneft, establishing a Russian joint
    venture for exploration and development activities focused in
    the Yamal-Nenets region of Western Siberia. Chevron will
    maintain a 49 percent joint-operated interest in the
    venture. Refer to page 17 for a discussion of the
    company’s other activities in Russia.

Sales of
    Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids

The company sells natural gas and natural gas liquids from its
    producing operations under a variety of contractual
    arrangements. Outside the United States, the majority of the
    company’s natural gas sales occur in Australia, Indonesia,
    Latin America, Thailand and the United Kingdom and in the
    company’s affiliate operations in Kazakhstan. International
    natural gas liquids sales take place in Africa, Australia and
    Europe. Refer to “Selected Operating Data,” on

page FS-11

in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations, for further information on
    the company’s natural gas and natural gas liquids sales

Average crude oil distillation capacity utilization during 2006
    was 90 percent, compared with 86 percent in 2005. In
    general, this increase resulted from less planned and unplanned
    downtime in 2006, due partly to downtime in 2005 that was
    attributable to hurricanes in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. No
    downtime was caused by hurricanes in 2006. At the U.S. fuel
    refineries, crude oil distillation capacity utilization averaged
    99 percent in 2006, compared with 90 percent in 2005,
    and cracking and coking capacity utilization averaged
    86 percent and 76 percent in 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Cracking and coking units, including fluid
    catalytic cracking units, are the primary facilities used in
    fuel refineries to convert heavier products into gasoline and
    other light products.

The company’s U.S. West Coast, Gulf Coast and Salt
    Lake refineries produce low-sulfur fuels that meet 2006 federal
    government specifications. Investments required to produce
    low-sulfur fuels in Europe, Canada, South Africa and Australia
    were completed in 2006. The company is evaluating alternatives
    for clean-fuel projects in its Southeast Asia refineries.

In 2006, the company completed an expansion of the Pascagoula,
    Mississippi, refinery’s Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit to
    increase the production of gasoline and other light products. In
    addition, construction projects began at the El Segundo,
    California, refinery to increase heavy, sour crude oil
    processing capability and at the Pembroke, United Kingdom,
    refinery to increase the capability to process Caspian-blend
    crude oils. Completion of these projects is expected in 2007.
    Additional projects to upgrade the company’s refineries in
    Mississippi and California were being evaluated in early 2007.

Also in 2006, GS Caltex, the company’s
    50 percent-owned affiliate, began construction of an
    upgrade project at the

650,000-barrel-per-day

Yeosu refining complex in South Korea. At a total estimated cost
    of $1.5 billion, this project is designed to increase the
    yield of high-value refined products and reduce feedstock costs
    through the processing of heavy crude oil. Completion of the
    Yeosu project is expected in late 2007.

In April 2006, Chevron purchased a 5 percent interest in
    Reliance Petroleum Limited, a company formed by Reliance
    Industries Limited to own and operate a new export refinery
    being constructed in Jamnagar, India. The

580,000-barrel-per-day-crude-oil-capacity

refinery is expected to begin operation in December 2008.
    Chevron has future rights to increase its equity ownership to
    29 percent. The new refinery would be the world’s
    sixth largest on a single site.

Refer to

page FS-2

for a discussion of the pending disposition of the
    company’s 31 percent interest in the Nerefco Refinery
    in the Netherlands.

Chevron processes imported and domestic crude oil in its
    U.S. refining operations. Imported crude oil accounted for
    about 87 percent and 83 percent of Chevron’s
    U.S. refinery inputs in 2006 and 2005, respectively.

(GTL) business. Through this venture, the company is pursuing
    GTL opportunities in Qatar and other countries.

In Nigeria, Chevron Nigeria Limited and the Nigerian National
    Petroleum Corporation are developing a

34,000-barrel-per-day

GTL facility at Escravos that will process natural gas supplied
    from the Phase 3A expansion of the Escravos Gas Plant
    (EGP). Plant construction began in 2005, and the first process
    modules are expected to be delivered to the site by the second
    half of 2007. The GTL plant is expected to be operational by the
    end of the decade. Refer also to page 15 for a discussion
    on the EGP Phase 3A expansion.

    equity affiliates’ sales:




In the United States, the company markets under the Chevron and
    Texaco brands. The company supplies directly or through
    retailers and marketers almost 9,600 branded motor vehicle
    retail outlets, concentrated in the mid-Atlantic, southern and
    western states. Approximately 600 of the outlets are
    company-owned or -leased stations. By the end of 2006, the
    company was supplying more than 2,100 Texaco retail sites,
    primarily in the Southeast and West. All rights to the Texaco
    brand in the United States reverted to Chevron in July 2006.

Outside the United States, Chevron supplies directly or through
    retailers and marketers approximately 16,200 branded service
    stations, including affiliates, in about 75 countries. In
    British Columbia, Canada, the company markets under the Chevron
    brand. In Europe, the company has marketing operations under the
    Texaco brand primarily in the United Kingdom, Ireland, the
    Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. In West Africa, the company
    operates or leases to retailers in Benin, Cameroon, Côte
    d’Ivoire, Nigeria, Republic of the Congo and Togo. In these
    countries, the company uses the Texaco brand. The company also
    operates across the Caribbean, Central America and South
    America, with a significant presence in Brazil, using the Texaco
    brand. In the Asia-Pacific region, southern, Central and East
    Africa, Egypt, and Pakistan, the company uses the Caltex brand.

The company also operates through affiliates under various brand
    names. In South Korea, the company operates through its
    50 percent-owned affiliate, GS Caltex, using the GS Caltex
    brand. The company’s 50 percent-owned affiliate in
    Australia operates using the Caltex, Caltex Woolworths and Ampol
    brands. In Scandinavia, the company sold its 50 percent
    interest in the HydroTexaco joint venture in 2006.

The company continued the marketing and sale of service station
    sites, focusing on selected areas outside the United States. In
    2006, the company sold its interest in more than 450 service
    stations, primarily in the United Kingdom and Latin America.
    Since the beginning of 2003, the company has sold its interests
    in nearly 2,800 service station sites. The vast majority of
    these sites will continue to market company-branded gasoline
    through new supply agreements.

The company also manages other marketing businesses globally.
    Chevron markets aviation fuel in approximately
    75 countries, representing a worldwide market share of
    about 12 percent, and is the leading marketer of jet fuels
    in the United States. The company also markets an extensive line
    of lubricant and coolant products in about 175 countries under
    brand names that include Havoline, Delo, Ursa and Revtex.

In the United States during 2006, the company completed the sale
    of three refined-product pipeline systems in Texas and New
    Mexico as well as its interest in the Windy Hill natural gas
    storage project in northeastern Colorado. By year-end 2006, work
    to restore the company’s Empire Terminal in Louisiana,
    which was damaged in the 2005 hurricanes, was substantially
    complete. During 2006, the company began a project to expand
    capacity at its Keystone natural gas storage facility by about
    3 billion cubic feet to meet increased demand in the
    Permian Basin production region near the Waha Hub. The Waha Hub
    is a pricing point for natural-gas-basis swap-futures contracts
    traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and is
    located in West Texas south of the natural gas deposits in the
    San Juan and Permian Basins.

Chevron also has a 15 percent ownership interest in the
    Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC). CPC operates a crude oil
    export pipeline from the Tengiz Field in Kazakhstan to the
    Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk. At the end of 2006, CPC
    had transported an average of 664,000 barrels of crude oil
    per day, including 519,000 barrels per day from the Caspian
    region and 145,000 barrels per day from Russia.

In addition, the company has a 9 percent equity interest in
    the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline, which transports
    Azerbaijan International Operating Company (AIOC) production
    from Baku, Azerbaijan, through Georgia to deepwater port
    facilities in Ceyhan, Turkey. Chevron holds a 10 percent
    nonoperated working interest in AIOC. The first tanker loading
    at the Ceyhan marine terminal on the Mediterranean Sea occurred
    in June 2006. The pipeline has a crude oil capacity of
    1 million barrels per day and is expected to accommodate
    the majority of the AIOC production. Another crude oil
    production export route is the

515-mile

Baku-Supsa pipeline, wholly owned by AIOC, with crude oil
    capacity to transport 145,000 barrels per day from Baku,
    Azerbaijan, to the terminal at Supsa, Georgia.

    Chad/Cameroon pipeline, the West African Gas Pipeline and the
    expansion of the CPC pipeline, refer to pages 13, 15
    and 23, respectively.



Tankers:

At any given time during 2006, the company
    had approximately 70 vessels chartered on a voyage basis or
    for a period of less than one year. Additionally, all tankers in
    Chevron’s controlled seagoing fleet were utilized during
    2006. The following table summarizes cargo transported on the
    company’s controlled fleet.

Federal law requires that cargo transported between
    U.S. ports be carried in ships built and registered in the
    United States, owned and operated by U.S. entities, and
    manned by U.S. crews. At year-end 2006, the company’s
    U.S. flag fleet was engaged primarily in transporting
    refined products between the Gulf Coast and the East Coast and
    from California refineries to terminals on the West Coast and in
    Alaska and Hawaii. During the year, the company contracted for
    the building of four U.S. flagged product tankers, each
    capable of carrying 300,000 barrels of cargo. These tankers
    are scheduled for delivery from 2007 through 2010 and are
    intended to replace the existing three U.S. flag ships.

The international flag vessels were engaged primarily in
    transporting crude oil from the Middle East, Asia, Black Sea,
    Mexico and West Africa to ports in the United States, Europe,
    Australia and Asia. Refined products were also transported by
    tanker worldwide. During 2006, the company took delivery of two
    new double-hulled tankers with a total capacity of
    2.5 million barrels and terminated the lease on its last
    single-hulled vessel.

In addition to the vessels described above, the company owns a
    one-sixth interest in each of seven liquefied natural gas (LNG)
    tankers transporting cargoes for the North West Shelf (NWS)
    project in Australia. Additionally, the NWS project has two LNG
    tankers under long-term time charter. In 2005, Chevron placed
    orders for two additional LNG tankers to support expected growth
    in the company’s LNG business. These carriers are planned
    to be delivered in 2009.

The Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 requires the scheduled
    phase-out by year-end 2010 of all single-hull tankers trading to
    U.S. ports or transferring cargo in waters within the
    U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone. This has raised the demand
    for double-hull tankers. At the end of 2006, 100 percent of
    the company’s owned and bareboat-chartered fleet was
    double-hulled. The company is a member of many
    oil-spill-response cooperatives in areas around the world in
    which it operates.

Chemicals

Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem) is equally owned
    with ConocoPhillips Corporation. At the end of 2006, CPChem
    owned or had joint venture interests in 30 manufacturing
    facilities and six research and technical centers in the United
    States, Puerto Rico, Belgium, China, Saudi Arabia, Singapore,
    South Korea and Qatar

.

In 2006, construction progressed on CPChem’s integrated,
    world-scale styrene facility in Al Jubail, Saudi Arabia. Jointly
    owned with the Saudi Industrial Investment Group (SIIG), the
    project’s operational

start-up

is
    anticipated in late 2007. The styrene facility is located
    adjacent to CPChem and SIIG’s existing aromatics complex in
    Al Jubail. Also during the year, CPChem continued development of
    plans for a third petrochemical project in Al Jubail.
    Preliminary studies are focused on the construction of a
    world-scale olefins unit, as well as related downstream units,
    to produce polyethylene, polypropylene, 1-hexene and polystyrene.

In addition, construction continued on the Q-Chem II
    project in 2006. The Q-Chem II project includes a
    350,000-metric-ton-per-year polyethylene plant and a
    345,000-metric-ton-per-year normal alpha olefins
    plant — each utilizing CPChem proprietary
    technology — and is located adjacent to the existing
    Q-Chem I complex in Mesaieed, Qatar. The

Q-Chem II

project also includes a separate joint venture to develop a

1.3-million-metric-ton-per-year

ethylene cracker at Qatar’s Ras Laffan Industrial City, in
    which Q-Chem II owns 54 percent of the capacity
    rights. CPChem and its partners expect to start up the plants in
    early 2009. CPChem owns a 49 percent interest in
    Q-Chem II.



Chevron’s Oronite brand fuel and lubricant additives
    business is a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of
    performance additives for fuels and lubricating oils. The
    company owns and operates facilities in the United States,
    Brazil, France, Japan, the Netherlands and Singapore and has
    equity interests in facilities in India and Mexico.

Oronite provides additives for lubricating oil in most engine
    applications, such as passenger car, heavy-duty diesel, marine,
    locomotive and motorcycle engines, and additives for fuels to
    improve engine performance and extend engine life.

Other
    Businesses

Mining

Chevron’s mining companies in the United States produce and
    market coal, molybdenum, rare earth minerals and calcined
    petroleum coke. Sales occur in both U.S. and international
    markets.

The company’s coal mining and marketing subsidiary, The
    Pittsburg & Midway Coal Mining Co. (P&M), owns and
    operates two surface mines, McKinley, in New Mexico, and
    Kemmerer, in Wyoming, and one underground mine, North River, in
    Alabama. Sales of coal from P&M’s wholly owned mines
    were 12.6 million tons, down 1.0 million tons from
    2005. Final reclamation activities continued in 2006 at the
    Farco surface mine in Texas.

At year-end 2006, P&M controlled approximately
    225 million tons of proven and probable coal reserves in
    the United States, including reserves of environmentally
    desirable low-sulfur coal. The company is contractually
    committed to deliver between 11 million and 12 million
    tons of coal per year through the end of 2009 and believes it
    will satisfy these contracts from existing coal reserves.

Molycorp Inc. is the company’s mining and marketing
    subsidiary for molybdenum and rare earth minerals. Molycorp owns
    and operates the Questa molybdenum mine in New Mexico and the
    Mountain Pass lanthanides mine in California. In addition, the
    company owns a 33 percent interest in Sumikin Molycorp, a
    manufacturer of neodymium compounds, located in Japan. During
    2006, Molycorp performed environmental remediation activities at
    Questa and Mountain Pass, and at its closed rare-earth
    processing facility in Pennsylvania. The company’s
    35 percent interest in Companhia Brasileira de Metalurgia e
    Mineracao, a producer of niobium in Brazil, was sold in 2006.

At year-end 2006, Molycorp controlled approximately
    60 million pounds of proven molybdenum reserves at Questa
    and 240 million pounds of proven and probable lanthanide
    reserves at Mountain Pass.

The company also owns the Chicago Carbon Company, a producer and
    marketer of calcined petroleum coke, which operates a
    250,000-ton-per-year petroleum coke calciner facility in Lemont,
    Illinois.

Global
    Power Generation

Chevron’s Global Power Generation (GPG) business has more
    than 20 years experience in developing and operating
    commercial power projects and owns 15 power assets located in
    the United States and Asia. GPG manages the production of more
    than 2,334 megawatts of electricity at 11 facilities it owns
    through joint ventures. The company operates gas-fired
    cogeneration facilities that use waste heat recovery to produce
    additional electricity or to support industrial thermal hosts. A
    number of the facilities produce steam for use in upstream
    operations to facilitate production of heavy oil.

The company has major geothermal operations in Indonesia and the
    Philippines and is investigating several advanced solar
    technologies for use in oil field operations as part of its
    renewable energy strategy. For additional information on the
    company’s geothermal operations and renewable energy
    projects, refer to pages 19 and 30, respectively.

In September 2006, the company sold its interest in the
    8-megawatt Amada Rayong power generation facility in Thailand.

Chevron
    Energy Solutions

Chevron Energy Solutions (CES) is a wholly owned subsidiary that
    provides public institutions and businesses with projects
    designed to increase energy efficiency and reliability, reduce
    energy costs and utilize renewable and alternative power
    technologies. CES has energy-saving projects installed in more
    than a thousand buildings nationwide. Major



projects completed by CES in 2006 include energy efficiency and
    renewable power installations for U.S. Postal Service
    facilities, the first megawatt-class hydrogen fuel cell
    cogeneration plant in California, and cogeneration and biomass
    facilities for a municipal water pollution control plant.

Research
    and Technology

The company’s Energy Technology Company supports
    Chevron’s upstream and downstream businesses with
    technologies that span the hydrocarbon value chain from
    exploration to refining and marketing.

The Technology Ventures Company identifies, grows and
    commercializes emerging technologies with the potential to
    transform energy production and use. The business development
    portfolio includes biofuels, hydrogen infrastructure, advanced
    batteries, nano-materials and renewable energy applications.

In the second quarter 2006, the company completed the
    acquisition of a 22 percent interest in Galveston Bay
    Biodiesel L.P., which is building one of the first large-scale
    biofuel plants in the United States. During 2006, the company
    also entered into research alliances with the University of
    California, Davis and the Georgia Institute of Technology. Both
    are focused on converting cellulosic biomass into viable
    transportation fuels.

Chevron’s research and development expenses were
    $468 million, $316 million and $242 million for
    the years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Some of the investments the company makes in the areas described
    above are in new or unproven technologies and business
    processes, and ultimate successes are not certain. Although not
    all initiatives may prove to be economically viable, the
    company’s overall investment in this area is not
    significant to the company’s consolidated financial
    position.

Environmental
    Protection

Virtually all aspects of the company’s businesses are
    subject to various U.S. federal, state and local
    environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and
    similar laws and regulations in other countries. These
    regulatory requirements continue to change and increase in both
    number and complexity and to govern not only the manner in which
    the company conducts its operations, but also the products it
    sells. Chevron expects more environmental-related regulations in
    the countries where it has operations. Most of the costs of
    complying with the many laws and regulations pertaining to its
    operations are embedded in the normal costs of conducting
    business.

In 2006, the company’s U.S. capitalized environmental
    expenditures were $385 million, representing approximately
    7 percent of the company’s total consolidated
    U.S. capital and exploratory expenditures. These
    environmental expenditures include capital outlays to retrofit
    existing facilities as well as those associated with new
    facilities. The expenditures are predominantly in the upstream
    and downstream segments and relate mostly to air- and
    water-quality projects and activities at the company’s
    refineries, oil and gas producing facilities, and marketing
    facilities. For 2007, the company estimates U.S. capital
    expenditures for environmental control facilities will be
    approximately $350 million. The future annual capital costs
    of fulfilling this commitment are uncertain and will be governed
    by several factors, including future changes to regulatory
    requirements.

Further information on environmental matters and their impact on
    Chevron and on the company’s 2006 environmental
    expenditures, remediation provisions and year-end environmental
    reserves are contained in Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on

Item 1A.    Risk
    Factors

Chevron is a major fully integrated petroleum company with a
    diversified business portfolio, strong balance sheet, and a
    history of generating sufficient cash to fund capital and
    exploratory expenditures and to pay dividends. Nevertheless,
    some inherent risks could materially impact the company’s
    financial results of operations or financial condition.

Chevron
    is exposed to the effects of changing commodity
    prices.

Chevron is primarily in a commodities business with a history of
    price volatility. The single largest variable that affects the
    company’s results of operations is crude oil prices. Except
    in the ordinary course of running an integrated petroleum
    business, Chevron does not seek to hedge its exposure to price
    changes. A significant, persistent decline in crude oil prices
    may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations
    and its capital and exploratory expenditure plans.

The
    scope of Chevron’s business will decline if the company
    does not successfully develop resources.

The company is in an extractive business; therefore, if Chevron
    is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it
    produces with good prospects for future production, the
    company’s business will decline. Creating and maintaining
    an inventory of projects depends on many factors, including
    obtaining rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons in
    promising areas; drilling success; ability to bring
    long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion on
    budget and schedule; and efficient and profitable operation of
    mature properties.

The
    company’s operations could be disrupted by natural or human
    factors.

Chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes
    inhospitable regions. The company’s operations and
    facilities are therefore subject to disruption from either
    natural or human causes, including hurricanes, floods and other
    forms of severe weather, war, civil unrest and other political
    events, fires, earthquakes, and explosions, any of which could
    result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the
    natural environment.

Chevron’s
    business subjects the company to liability risks.

The company produces, transports, refines and markets materials
    with potential toxicity, and it purchases, handles and disposes
    of other potentially toxic materials in the course of the
    company’s business. Chevron operations also produce
    by-products, which may be considered pollutants. Any of these
    activities could result in liability, either as a result of an
    accidental, unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions
    on the effects of the company’s operations on human health
    or the environment.

Political
    instability could harm Chevron’s business.

The company’s operations, particularly exploration and
    production, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and
    political environments in the various countries in which it
    operates. As has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by
    governments to increase public ownership of the company’s
    partially or wholly owned businesses

and/or

to
    impose additional taxes or royalties.

In certain locations, governments have imposed restrictions,
    controls and taxes, and in others, political conditions have
    existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the
    company’s continued presence in those countries. Internal
    unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a
    government and the company or other governments may affect the
    company’s operations. Those developments have, at times,
    significantly affected the company’s related operations and
    results and are carefully considered by management when
    evaluating the level of current and future activity in such
    countries. At December 31, 2006, 24 percent of the
    company’s proved reserves were located in Kazakhstan. The
    company also has significant interests in Organization of
    Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)-member countries including
    Indonesia, Nigeria and Venezuela. Approximately 25 percent
    of the company’s net proved reserves, including affiliates,
    were located in OPEC countries at December 31, 2006. In
    December 2006, OPEC admitted Angola as a new member effective
    January 1, 2007. Oil-equivalent reserves at the end of 2006
    in Angola represented 5 percent of the company’s total.

Regulation
    of greenhouse gas emissions could increase Chevron’s
    operational costs and reduce demand for Chevron’s
    products.

Management believes it is reasonably likely that the scientific
    and political attention to issues concerning the existence and
    extent of climate change, and the role of human activity in it,
    will continue, with the potential for further regulation that
    affects the company’s operations. Although uncertain, these
    developments could increase costs or reduce



the demand for the products the company sells. The
    company’s production and processing operations (e.g., the
    production of crude oil at offshore platforms and the processing
    of natural gas at liquefied natural gas facilities) typically
    result in emissions of greenhouse gases. Likewise, emissions
    arise from midstream and downstream operations, including crude
    oil transportation and refining. Finally, although beyond the
    control of the company, the use of passenger vehicle fuels and
    related products by consumers also results in these emissions.

International agreements, domestic legislation and regulatory
    measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions are currently in
    various phases of discussion or implementation. These include
    the Kyoto Protocol, proposed federal legislation and current
    state-level actions. Some of the countries in which Chevron
    operates have ratified the Kyoto Protocol, and the company is
    currently complying with greenhouse gas emissions limits within
    the European Union. Although resolutions supporting “cap
    and trade” systems have been introduced in the
    U.S. Congress, no bill restricting greenhouse gas emissions
    has been passed to date.

In California, the Global Warming Solutions Act became effective
    on January 1, 2007. This law caps California’s
    greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by 2020; directs the Air
    Resources Board, the responsible state agency, to determine
    greenhouse gas emissions in and outside California to adopt
    mandatory reporting rules for significant sources of greenhouse
    gases; delegates to the agency the authority to adopt compliance
    mechanisms (including market-based approaches); and permits a
    one-year extension of the targets under extraordinary
    circumstances. Related regulatory activity is under way within
    the California Public Utilities Commission. The company extracts
    crude oil and natural gas, operates refineries, and markets and
    sells gasoline in California. It is not known at this time
    whether or to what extent the state agencies’ regulations
    will affect the company’s California operations.

Item 3.    Legal
    Proceedings

Chevron’s U.S. refineries are implementing a consent
    decree with the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
    and four state air agencies to resolve claims about
    Chevron’s past application of “New Source Review”
    permitting programs under the Clean Air Act. The consent decree
    provides that Chevron will pay stipulated penalties for certain
    violations of the consent decree, if demand is made by the EPA.
    In July 2006, Chevron’s refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi
    exceeded its emission limit under the consent decree for
    particulate matter. The exceedance was reported at the time and
    the possibility of a penalty was discussed. In January 2007, the
    Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) and the
    EPA issued a notice of violation and a request for payment of
    $210,000 in stipulated penalties for the July 2006 particulate
    matter exceedance. The company, the EPA and the MDEQ are in
    negotiation with regard to the nature and amount of the penalty
    demand.

Refer to the “Results of Operations” section
beginning on page FS-6 for a detailed discussion of
financial results by major operating area for the
three years ending December 31, 2006.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND OUTLOOK

Chevron’s current and future earnings depend
largely on the profitability of its upstream
(exploration and production) and
downstream (refining, marketing and transportation)
business segments. The single biggest factor that
affects the results of operations for both segments is
movement in the price of crude oil. In the downstream
business, crude oil is the largest cost component of
refined products. The overall trend in earnings is
typically less affected by results from the company’s
chemicals business and other activities and
investments. Earnings for the company in any period may
also be influenced by events or transactions that are
infrequent and/ or unusual in nature. Chevron and the
oil and gas industry at large are currently
experiencing an increase in certain costs that exceeds
the general trend of inflation in many areas of the
world. This increase in costs is affecting the
company’s

operating expenses for all business segments and
capital expenditures, particularly for the
upstream business.

To sustain its long-term competitive position in
the upstream business, the company must develop and
replenish an inventory of projects that offer adequate
financial returns for the investment required.
Identifying promising areas for exploration, acquiring
the necessary rights to explore for and to produce
crude oil and natural gas, drilling successfully, and
handling the many technical and operational details in
a safe and cost-effective manner are all important
factors in this effort. Projects often require long
lead times and large capital commitments. Changes in
economic, legal or political circumstances can have
significant effects on the profitability of a project
over its expected life. In the current environment of
higher commodity prices, certain governments have
sought to renegotiate contracts or impose additional
costs on the company. Other governments may attempt to
do so in the future. The company will continue to
monitor these developments, take them into account in
evaluating future investment opportunities, and
otherwise seek to mitigate any risks to the company’s
current operations or future prospects. In late February 2007, the
President of Venezuela issued a decree announcing the
government’s intention for the state-owned oil company,
Petróleos de Venezuela S.A., to increase its ownership later
this year in all Orinoco Heavy Oil Associations, including
Chevron’s 30 percent-owned Hamaca project, to a minimum of
60 percent. The impact on Chevron from such an action is
uncertain but is not expected to have a material effect on the
company’s results of operations, consolidated financial position
or liquidity.

The company also continually evaluates
opportunities to dispose of assets that are not key to
providing sufficient long-term value, or to acquire
assets or operations complementary to its asset base to
help augment the company’s growth. During the first
quarter 2007, the company authorized the sale of its 31
percent ownership interest in the Nerefco Refinery and
the associated TEAM Terminal in the Netherlands. The
transaction is subject to signing of the sales
agreement and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals.
The company expects to record a gain upon close of the
sale. In early 2007, the company was also in
discussions regarding the possible sale of its fuels
marketing operations in the Netherlands, Belgium and
Luxembourg. Neither the refining nor marketing assets
were classified as held-for-sale as of December 31,
2006, in
accordance with the held-for-sale criteria of
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement
No. 144,

Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

. Other
asset dispositions and restructurings may occur in
future periods and could result in significant gains or
losses.

Comments related to earnings trends for the
company’s major business areas are as follows:

Upstream

Earnings for the upstream segment are
closely aligned with industry price levels for crude
oil and natural gas. Crude oil and natural gas prices
are subject to external factors over which the company
has no control, including product demand connected with
global economic conditions, industry inventory levels,
production quotas imposed by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), weather-related
damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and
regional supply interruptions that may be caused by
military conflicts, civil unrest or political
uncertainty.

FS-2


Moreover, any of these factors could also inhibit the
company’s production capacity in an affected region.
The company monitors developments closely in the
countries in which it operates and holds investments,
and attempts to manage risks in operating its
facilities and business.

Price levels for capital and exploratory costs and
operating expenses associated with the efficient
production of crude oil and natural gas can also be
subject to external factors beyond the company’s
control. External factors include not

only the general level of inflation, but also prices
charged by the industry’s product- and
service-providers, which can be affected by the
volatility of the industry’s own supply and demand
conditions for such products and services. The oil and
gas industry worldwide experienced significant price
increases for these items during 2005 and 2006, and an
upward trend in prices may continue into 2007. Capital
and exploratory expenditures and operating expenses
also can be affected by uninsured damages to production
facilities caused by severe weather or civil unrest.

Industry price levels for crude oil generally
increased in the first half of 2006 and declined in the
second half. Prices at the end of 2006 were slightly
lower than at the beginning of the year. The spot price
for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, a
benchmark crude oil, averaged $66 per barrel in 2006,
an increase of approximately $9 per barrel from the
2005 average price. The rise in crude oil prices
between years reflected, among other things, increasing
demand in growing economies, the heightened level of
geopolitical uncertainty in some areas of the
world and supply concerns in other key producing
regions. For early 2007 into late February, the WTI
spot price averaged about $56 per barrel.

As was the case in 2005, a wide differential in
prices existed in 2006 between high-quality,
light-sweet crude oils (such as the U.S. benchmark
WTI) and heavier types of crude. The price for the
heavier crudes has been dampened because of ample
supply and lower relative demand due to the limited
number of refineries that are able to process this
lower-quality feedstock into light products (i.e.,
motor gasoline, jet fuel, aviation gasoline and diesel
fuel). The price

for higher-quality, light-sweet crude oil has remained
high, as the demand for light products, which can be
more easily manufactured by refineries from light-sweet
crude oil, has been strong worldwide. Chevron produces
heavy crude oil in California, Chad, Indonesia, the
Partitioned Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait, Venezuela and in certain fields in Angola,
China and the United Kingdom North Sea. (Refer to page
FS-11 for the company’s average U.S. and international
crude oil prices.)

In contrast to price movements in
the global market for crude oil, price changes for
natural gas are more closely aligned with regional
supply and demand conditions. In the United States
during 2006, benchmark prices at Henry Hub averaged
about $6.50 per thousand cubic feet (MCF), compared
with about $8 in 2005. For early 2007 into late
February, prices averaged about $7 per MCF.
Fluctuations in the price for natural gas in the United
States are closely associated with the volumes produced
in North America and the inventory in underground
storage relative to customer demand. Natural gas prices
in the United States are also typically higher during
the winter period when demand for heating is greatest.

In contrast to the United States, certain other
regions of the world in which the company operates have
different supply, demand and regulatory circumstances,
typically resulting in significantly lower average
sales prices for the company’s production of natural
gas. (Refer to page FS-11 for the company’s average
natural gas prices for the United States and
international regions.) Additionally, excess supply
conditions that exist in certain parts of the world
cannot easily serve to mitigate the relatively
high-price conditions in the United States and other
markets because of the lack of infrastructure to
transport and receive liquefied natural gas.

To help address this regional imbalance between
supply and demand for natural gas, Chevron is
planning increased

FS-3


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

investments in long-term projects in areas of
excess supply to install infrastructure to produce and
liquefy natural gas for transport by tanker, along with
investments and commitments to regasify the product in
markets where demand is strong and supplies are not as
plentiful. Due to the significance of the overall
investment in these long-term projects, the natural gas
sales prices in the areas of excess supply (before the
natural gas is transferred to a company-owned or
third-party processing facility) are expected to remain
well below sales prices for natural gas that is
produced much nearer to areas of high demand and can be
transported in existing natural gas pipeline networks
(as in the United States).

Besides the impact of the fluctuation in price
for crude oil and natural gas, the longer-term trend
in earnings for the upstream segment is also a
function of other factors, including the company’s
ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce
crude oil and natural gas, changes in fiscal terms,
and the cost of goods and services.

Chevron’s worldwide net oil-equivalent production
in 2006, including volumes produced from oil sands and
production under an operating service agreement,
averaged 2.67 million barrels per day, or 6 percent
higher than production in 2005. The increase between
periods was largely due to volumes associated with the
acquisition of Unocal in August 2005. The company
estimates that oil-equivalent production in 2007 will
average approximately 2.6 million barrels per day. This
estimate is subject to many uncertainties, including
quotas that may be imposed by OPEC, the price effect on
production volumes calculated under cost-recovery and
variable-royalty provisions of certain contracts,
changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of
company operations, and production disruptions that
could be caused by severe weather, local civil unrest
and changing geopolitics. Future production levels also
are affected by the size and number of economic
investment opportunities and, for new large-scale
projects, the time lag between initial exploration and
the beginning of production. Most of Chevron’s upstream
investment is currently being made outside the United
States. Investments in upstream projects generally are
made well in advance of the start of the associated
crude oil and natural gas production.

Approximately 24 percent of the company’s net
oil-equivalent production in 2006 occurred in the
OPEC-member countries of Indonesia, Nigeria and
Venezuela and in the Partitioned Neutral Zone between
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. In December 2006, OPEC
admitted Angola as a new member effective January 1,
2007. Oil-equivalent
production for 2006 in Angola represented 6
percent of the company’s total. In October 2006, OPEC
announced its decision to reduce OPEC-member
production quotas by 1.2 million barrels of crude oil
per day, or 4.4 percent, from a production level of
27.5 million barrels, effective

November 1, 2006. In December 2006, OPEC announced an additional
quota reduction of 500,000 barrels of crude oil per
day, effective February 1, 2007. OPEC quotas did not
significantly affect Chevron’s production level in
2006. The impact of quotas on the company’s production
in 2007 is uncertain.

In October 2006, Chevron’s Boscan and LL-652
operating service agreements in Venezuela were
converted to Empresas Mixtas (i.e. joint stock
contractual structures), with Petróleos de Venezuela
S.A., as majority shareholder. Beginning in October,
Chevron reported its equity share of the Boscan and
LL-652 production, which was approximately 90,000
barrels per day less than what the company previously
reported under the operating service agreements. The
change to the Empresa Mixta structure did not have a
material effect on the company’s results of operations,
consolidated financial position or liquidity.

At the end of 2005 in certain onshore areas of
Nigeria, approximately 30,000 barrels per day of the
company’s net production capacity remained shut-in
following civil unrest and damage to production
facilities that occurred in 2003. By the end of 2006,
the company had resumed operations in portions of all
the affected fields, and more than 20,000 barrels per
day of production had been restored. In early 2007,
additional production restoration activities continued
in the area; however, intermittent civil unrest could
adversely impact company operations in the future.

Refer to pages FS-6 through FS-7 for additional
discussion of the company’s upstream operations.

Downstream

Earnings for the downstream segment are
closely tied to global and regional supply and demand
for refined products and the associated effects on
industry refining and marketing margins. Other factors
include the reliability and efficiency of the company’s
refining and marketing network, the effectiveness of
the crude-oil and product-supply functions, and the
economic returns on invested capital. Profitability can
also be affected by the volatility of charter expenses
for the company’s shipping operations, which are driven
by the industry’s demand for crude oil and product
tankers. Other factors that are beyond the company’s
control include the general level of inflation and
energy costs to operate the company’s refinery and
distribution network.

The company’s core marketing areas are the West
Coast of North America, the U.S. Gulf Coast, Latin
America, Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The company
operates or has ownership interests in refineries in
each of these areas, except Latin America. In 2006,
earnings for the segment improved substantially,
mainly as the result of higher average margins for
refined products and improved operations at the
company’s refineries.

FS-4


Industry margins in the future may be volatile
and are influenced by changes in the price of crude
oil used for refinery feedstock and by changes in the
supply and demand for crude oil and refined products.
The industry supply and demand balance can be affected
by disruptions at refineries resulting from
maintenance programs and unplanned outages, including
weather-related disruptions; refined-product inventory
levels; and geopolitical events.

Refer to pages FS-8 through FS-9 for additional
discussion of the company’s downstream operations.

Chemicals

Earnings in the petrochemicals business
are closely tied to global chemical demand, industry
inventory levels and plant capacity utilization.
Feedstock and fuel costs, which tend to follow crude
oil and natural gas price movements, also influence
earnings in this segment.

Refer to page FS-9 for additional discussion of
chemicals earnings.

OPERATING DEVELOPMENTS

Key operating developments and other events
during 2006 and early 2007 included:

Upstream

United States

In the Gulf of Mexico, the company
announced in September 2006 the completion of a
successful production test on the 50 percent-owned and
operated Jack #2 well. The test was a follow-up to the
2004 Jack discovery and was the deepest well-test ever
accomplished in the Gulf of Mexico.

Also in the Gulf of Mexico, the company announced
in October its decision to develop the Great White,
Tobago and Silvertip fields via a common producing hub, the
Perdido Regional Host,

which will have a
processing capacity of
130,000 barrels of
oil-equivalent per day.
First
production from the 38
percent-owned Perdido
Regional Host is
anticipated by 2010. The
company’s ownership
interests in the fields
are Great White – 33
percent, Tobago – 58
percent and Silvertip –
60 percent.

Angola

In June 2006,
the company produced the
first crude oil from the
offshore Lobito field,
located in Block 14.
Lobito is part of the 31
percent-owned and
operated Benguela
Belize–Lobito Tomboco
(BBLT) development
project. As fields and
wells are added over the
next two years, BBLT’s maximum production is expected
to reach approximately 200,000 barrels of oil per day.
Also in Block 14, the company produced first crude oil
in June 2006

from the Landana North reservoir in the 31
percent-owned and operated Tombua-Landana development
area. This initial production is tied back to the
nearby BBLT production facilities. Tombua-Landana is
the company’s third deepwater development offshore
Angola. Maximum production from the completed
Tombua-Landana development is estimated at 100,000
barrels per day by 2010.

In early 2007, the company announced a discovery
of crude oil at the 31 percent-owned and operated
Lucapa-1 well in deepwater Block 14. The company
plans to conduct appraisal drilling and additional
geologic and engineering studies to assess the
potential resource.

Australia

In July 2006, the company discovered
natural gas at the Chandon-1 exploration well offshore
the northwestern coast in the Greater Gorgon
development area. The company’s interest in the
property is 50 percent.

Also offshore the northwestern coast, the company
announced in November 2006 a significant natural gas
discovery at its Clio-1 exploration well. The company
holds a 67 percent interest in the block where Clio-1
is located. Chevron will be undertaking further work,
including a 3-D seismic survey program that started in
late 2006, to better determine the potential of the
gas find and subsequent development options.

In early 2007, the company was also named
operator and awarded a 50 percent interest in
exploration acreage in the Greater Gorgon Area. A
three-year work program includes geotechnical studies,
seismic surveys and drilling of an exploration well.

Azerbaijan

The first tanker lifting of crude oil
transported through the 9 percent-owned
Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline occurred in June
2006. The crude is being supplied by the Azerbaijan
International Oil Company, in which the company has a
10 percent nonoperated working interest.

Brazil

In June 2006, the company announced the
decision to develop the 52 percent-owned and operated
offshore Frade Field. Initial production is targeted by
early 2009, with a maximum annual rate estimated at
90,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day in 2011.

Canada

The company acquired heavy oil leases in
the Athabasca region of northern Alberta, Canada in
2005 and 2006. The leases comprise more than 75,000
acres and contain significant volumes that have
potential for recovery using Steam Assisted Gravity
Drainage technology.

Also in Alberta, the company announced its
decision in October 2006 to participate in the
expansion of the Athabasca Oil Sands Project (AOSP).
The expansion is expected to add 100,000 barrels per
day of mining and upgrading capacity at an estimated
total project cost of $10 billion. Completion of the
expansion is planned for 2010, increasing total
capacity of the project to approximately 255,000
barrels per day. The company holds a 20 percent
nonoperated working interest in AOSP.

Nigeria

In May 2006, the company announced the
discovery of crude oil at the nonoperated Uge-1
exploration well in the 20 percent-owned offshore Oil
Prospecting License 214. Future drilling is contingent
primarily on the outcome of ongoing technical studies.

Norway

In April 2006, the company was
awarded the rights to six blocks in the 19th Norwegian
Licensing Round. The 40 percent-owned blocks are
located in the Nordkapp East Basin in the Norwegian
Barents Sea. A 3-D seismic survey was acquired and is
planned to be processed in 2007.

Thailand

In early 2006, the company signed two
petroleum exploration concessions in the Gulf of
Thailand. Chevron has a 71 percent operated interest in
one concession, which is in the proximity of the
company’s Tantawan and Plamuk fields. Initial drilling
in the concession is scheduled during 2007. Drilling is
projected by 2009 for the other concession, in which
Chevron has a 16 percent nonoperated working interest.

United Kingdom

In June 2006, the company produced
the first crude oil from the 85 percent-owned and
operated Area C in the Captain Field. The project
reached maximum production of 14,000 barrels of crude
oil per day in September 2006.

In early 2007, the company was awarded eight
operated exploration blocks and two nonoperated blocks
west of Shetland Islands in the 24th United Kingdom
Offshore Licensing Round.

Vietnam

In April 2006, the company signed a
30-year production-sharing contract with Vietnam Oil
and Gas Corporation for Block 122 offshore eastern
Vietnam. The company has a 50 percent interest in this
block and has undertaken a three-year work program for
seismic acquisition and drilling of an exploratory
well.

Downstream

United States

In December 2006, the company
completed the expansion of the Fluid Catalytic
Cracking Unit at the company’s refinery in Pascagoula,
Mississippi, increasing the refinery’s gasoline
manufacturing capacity by about 10 percent. The
company also submitted an environmental permit
application for construction of facilities to increase
gasoline output by another 15 percent.

India

In April 2006, the company acquired a 5
percent interest in Reliance Petroleum Limited, a
company formed by Reliance Industries Limited to
construct, own and operate a refinery in Jamnagar,
India. The new refinery would be the world’s sixth
largest, designed for a crude oil processing capacity
of 580,000 barrels per day. Chevron and Reliance
Industries also signed two memoranda of understanding
to jointly pursue other downstream and upstream
business opportunities. If discussions pursuant to the
memoranda of understanding lead to definitive
agreements, Chevron may increase its equity stake in
Reliance Petroleum to 29 percent.

Other

Biofuels

In May 2006, the company announced that
it had completed the acquisition of a 22 percent
interest in
Galveston Bay Biodiesel L.P., which is building one of
the first large-scale biodiesel plants in the United
States. The following month, the company entered into a
research alliance with the Georgia Institute of
Technology to pursue advanced technology aimed at
making cellulosic biofuels and hydrogen into
transportation fuels. In September, the company
announced a research collaboration with the University
of California, Davis aimed at converting cellulosic
biomass into transportation fuels.

Common Stock Dividends and Stock Repurchase
Program

In April 2006, the company increased its
quarterly common stock dividend by 15.5 percent to
$0.52 per share. In November, the company completed
its second $5 billion common stock buyback program
since 2004 and in December authorized the acquisition
of up to $5 billion of additional shares over a
period of up to three years.

U.S. upstream income of $4.3 billion in 2006
increased approximately $100 million from 2005.
Earnings in 2006 benefited about $850 million from
higher average prices on oil-equivalent production and
the effect of seven additional months of production
from the Unocal properties that were acquired in
August 2005. Substantially offsetting these benefits
were increases in operating expense and expenses for
depreciation and exploration. Included in the
operating expense increases were costs associated with
the carryover effects of hurricanes in the Gulf of
Mexico in 2005.

Income of $4.2 billion in 2005 was $230 million
higher
than 2004. The 2004 amount included gains of
approxi-

FS-6


mately $400 million from asset sales. Higher prices for
crude oil and natural gas in 2005 and five months of
earnings from the former Unocal operations contributed
approximately $2 billion to the increase between
periods. Approximately 90 percent of this amount
related to the effects of higher prices on
heritage-Chevron production. These benefits were
substantially offset by the adverse effects of lower
production, higher operating expenses and higher
depreciation expense associated with the heritage
Chevron properties.

The company’s average realization for crude oil
and natural gas liquids in 2006 was $56.66 per barrel,
compared with $46.97 in 2005 and $34.12 in 2004. The
average natural gas realization was $6.29 per thousand
cubic feet in 2006, compared with $7.43 and $5.51 in
2005 and 2004, respectively.

Net oil-equivalent production in 2006 averaged
763,000 barrels per day, up 5 percent from 2005 and
down 7 percent from 2004. The increase between 2005 and
2006 was due to the full-year benefit of production
from the former Unocal

properties. The decrease from 2004 was associated
mainly with the effects of hurricanes, property sales
and normal field declines, partially offset by
additional volumes from the former Unocal properties.

The net liquids component of oil-equivalent
production for 2006 averaged 462,000 barrels per day,
an increase of approximately 2 percent from 2005 and a
decrease of 9 percent from 2004. Net natural gas
production averaged 1.8 billion cubic feet per day in
2006, up 11 percent from 2005 and down 3 percent from
2004.

International upstream income of
approximately $8.9 billion in 2006 increased $1.3
billion from 2005. Earnings in 2006 benefited
approximately $3.0 billion from higher prices for crude
oil and natural gas and an additional seven months of
production from the former Unocal properties. About 70
percent of this benefit was associated with the
impact of higher prices. Substantially offsetting these
benefits were increases in depreciation expense,
operating expense and exploration expense. Also
adversely affecting 2006 income were higher taxes
related to an increase in tax rates in the U.K. and
Venezuela and settlement of tax claims and other tax
items in Venezuela, Angola and Chad. Foreign currency
effects reduced earnings by $371 million in 2006, but
increased income $14 million in 2005.

Income in 2005 was approximately $7.5 billion,
compared with $5.8 billion in 2004, which included
gains of approximately $850 million from property
sales. Higher prices for crude oil and natural gas in
2005 and five months of earnings from the former
Unocal operations increased income approximately $2.9
billion between periods. About 80 percent of this
benefit arose from the effects of higher prices on
heritage-Chevron production. Partially offsetting
these benefits were higher expenses between periods
for certain income tax items, including the absence of
a $200 million benefit in 2004 relating to changes in
income tax laws. Foreign currency effects increased
income $14 million in 2005 but reduced income $129
million in 2004.

The company’s average realization for crude oil
and natural gas liquids in 2006 was $57.65 per barrel,
compared with $47.59 in 2005 and $34.17 in 2004. The
average natural gas realization was $3.73 per thousand
cubic feet in 2006, compared with $3.19 and $2.68 in
2005 and 2004, respectively.

Net oil-equivalent production of 1.9 million
barrels per day in 2006, including about 100,000 net
barrels per day from oil sands in Canada and
production under an operating service agreement in
Venezuela prior to its conversion to a joint stock
company, increased about 6 percent from 2005 and 13
percent from 2004. This trend was largely the result
of the effects of the Unocal acquisition in August
2005, partially offset by the effect of normal field
declines and property sales in 2004.

The net liquids component of oil-equivalent
production was 1.4 million barrels per day in 2006, an
increase of approximately 2 percent from 2005 and 2004.
Net natural gas production of 3.1 billion cubic feet
per day in 2006 was up 21 percent and 51 percent from
2005 and 2004, respectively.

U.S. downstream earnings of $1.9 billion in
2006 increased about $1 billion from 2005 and
approximately $700 million from 2004. Average

refined-product

margins in 2006 were higher than in
2005, which in turn were also higher than in 2004.
Refinery crude inputs were higher in 2006 than in the
other comparative periods and also benefited
earnings. However, earnings declined in 2005
from

a year earlier due mainly to increased downtime at
the company’s refineries, including the shutdown of
operations at Pascagoula, Mississippi, for more than a
month due to hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. The
company’s marketing and pipeline operations along the
Gulf Coast were also disrupted for an extended period
due to the hurricanes. Fuel costs were also higher in
2005 than in 2004.

Sales volumes of refined products in 2006 were
approximately 1.5 million barrels per day, an increase
of 1 percent from 2005 and relatively unchanged from
2004. The reported sales volume for 2006 was on a
different basis than in 2005 and 2004 due to a change
in accounting rules that became effective April 1,
2006, for certain purchase and sale

(buy/sell) contracts with the same counterparty.
Excluding the impact of the accounting change, refined
product sales in 2006 increased by approximately 6
percent and 3 percent from 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Branded gasoline sales volumes of approximately 614,000
barrels per day in 2006 increased about 4 percent from
2005, largely due to the growth of the Texaco brand. In
2005, refined-product sales volumes decreased about 2
percent from 2004, primarily due to disruption related
to the hurricanes.

International downstream income of $2 billion in 2006
increased about $250 million from 2005 and about
$50 million from 2004. The increase in 2006 from 2005
was associated mainly with the

benefit of higher-refined
product margins in
Asia-Pacific and Canada
and improved results from
crude-oil and
refined-product trading
activities. The decrease
in earnings in 2005 from
2004 was due mainly to
lower sales volumes;
higher costs for fuel and
transportation; expenses
associated with a fire at
a 40 percent-owned,
nonoperated terminal in
the United Kingdom; and
tax adjustments in various
countries. These items
more than offset an
improvement in average
refined-product margins
between periods. Foreign

2006. Refined-product sales volume of 2.3 million
barrels per day in 2005 were about 4 percent lower than
in 2004, primarily the result of lower gasoline trading

corporate-level tax adjustments. Higher charges in 2005 also
were associated with environmental remediation of
properties that had been sold or idled and Unocal
corporate-level activities. Interest expense was higher

Crude oil and product purchases in 2006
increased from 2005 on higher prices for crude oil and
refined products and the inclusion of Unocal-related
amounts for a full year in 2006. The increase was
mitigated by the effect of the accounting change in
April 2006 for buy/sell contracts. Purchase costs
increased 35 percent in 2005 from the prior year as a
result of higher prices for crude oil, natural gas and
refined products, as well as to the inclusion of
Unocal-related amounts for five months.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Operating, selling, general and
administrative expenses in 2006 increased 16 percent
from a year earlier. Expenses associated with the
former Unocal operations are included for the full year
in 2006, vs. five months in 2005. Besides this effect,
expenses were higher in 2006 for labor, transportation,
uninsured costs associated with the hurricanes in 2005
and a number of corporate items that individually were
not significant. Total expenses increased in 2005 from
2004 due mainly to the inclusion of former-Unocal
expenses for five months, higher costs for labor and
transportation, uninsured costs associated with storms
in the Gulf of Mexico, and asset write-offs.

Exploration expenses in 2006 increased from
2005 mainly due to higher amounts for well write-offs
and geological and geophysical costs for operations
outside the United States, as well as the inclusion of
expenses for the former Unocal operations for a full
year in 2006. Expenses increased in 2005 from 2004 due
mainly to the inclusion of Unocal-related amounts for
five months.

Depreciation, depletion and amortization
expenses
increased from 2004 through 2006 mainly as a

for certain heritage-Chevron crude oil and natural
gas producing fields worldwide.

Interest and debt expense

$


Interest and debt expense in 2006 decreased
from 2005 primarily due to lower average debt balances
and an increase in the amount of interest capitalized,
partially offset by higher average interest rates on
commercial paper and other variable-rate debt. The
increase in 2005 over 2004 was mainly due to the
inclusion of debt assumed with the Unocal acquisition
and higher average interest rates for commercial paper
borrowings.

Taxes other than on income were essentially
unchanged in 2006 from 2005, with the effect of
higher U.S. refined product sales being offset by
lower sales volumes subject to duties in the
company’s European downstream operations.

The increase in 2005 from 2004 was the result of higher
international taxes assessed on product values, higher
duty rates in the areas of the company’s European
downstream operations and higher U.S. federal excise
taxes on jet fuel resulting from a change in tax law
that became effective in 2005.

Effective income tax rates were 46 percent in

higher tax rate in 2006 included the effect of one-time
charges totaling $400 million, including an increase in
tax rates on upstream operations in the U.K. North Sea
and settlement of a tax claim in Venezuela. Rates were
higher in 2005 compared with the prior year due to an
increase in earnings in countries with higher tax rates
and the absence of benefits in 2004 from changes in the
income tax laws for certain international operations.

INFORMATION RELATED TO INVESTMENT IN

DYNEGY INC.

At year-end 2006, Chevron owned a 19 percent
equity interest in the common stock of Dynegy Inc., a
provider of electricity to markets and customers
throughout the United States.

Investment in Dynegy Common Stock

At December 31,
2006, the carrying value of the company’s investment in
Dynegy common stock was approximately $250 million.
This amount was about $180 million below the company’s
proportionate interest in Dynegy’s underlying net
assets. This difference is primarily the result of
write-downs of the investment in 2002 for declines in
the market value of the common shares below the
company’s carrying value that were deemed to be other
than temporary. The difference had been assigned to the
extent practicable to specific Dynegy assets and
liabilities, based upon the company’s analysis of the
various factors associated with the decline in value of
the Dynegy shares. The company’s equity share of
Dynegy’s reported earnings is adjusted quarterly when
appropriate to recognize a portion of the difference
between these allocated values and Dynegy’s historical
book values. The market value of the company’s
investment in Dynegy’s common stock at December 31,
2006, was approximately $700 million.

Investments in Dynegy Preferred Stock

In May
2006, the company’s investment in Dynegy Series C
preferred stock was redeemed at its face value of
$400 million. Upon redemption of the preferred stock,
the company recorded a before-tax gain of $130
million ($87 million after tax).

Dynegy Proposed Business Combination with LS Power
Group

Dynegy and LS Power Group, a privately held power
plant investor, developer and manager, announced in
September 2006 that the companies had executed a
definitive agreement to combine Dynegy’s assets and
operations with LS Power Group’s power-generation
portfolio and for Dynegy to acquire a 50 percent
ownership interest in a development joint venture with
LS Power. Upon close of the transaction, Chevron will
receive the same number of shares of the new company’s
Class A common stock that it currently holds in Dynegy.
Chevron’s ownership interest in the combined company
will be approximately 11 percent. The transaction is
subject to specified conditions, including the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of Dynegy’s common
shareholders and the receipt of regulatory approvals.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities

Total
balances were $11.4 billion and $11.1 billion at
December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Cash provided
by operating activities in 2006 was $24.3 billion,
compared with $20.1 billion in 2005 and $14.7 billion
in 2004.

The 2006 increase in cash provided by operating
activities mainly reflected higher earnings in the
upstream and downstream segments, including a full year
of earnings from the former Unocal operations that were
acquired in August 2005. Cash provided by operating
activities was net of contributions to employee pension
plans of $0.4 billion, $1.0 billion and $1.6 billion in
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Cash provided by
investing activities included proceeds from asset sales
of $1.0 billion in 2006, $2.7 billion in 2005 and $3.7
billion in 2004.

Cash provided by operating activities and asset
sales during 2006 was sufficient to fund the company’s
$13.8 billion capital and exploratory program, pay
$4.4 billion of dividends to stockholders, repay
approximately $2.9 billion in debt and repurchase $5
billion of common stock.

Dividends

The company paid dividends of
approximately $4.4 billion in 2006, $3.8 billion in
2005 and $3.2 billion in 2004. In April 2006, the
company increased its quarterly common stock dividend
by 15.5 percent to 52 cents per share.

Debt, capital lease and minority interest
obligations

Total debt and capital lease balances were
$9.8 billion at

December 31, 2006, down from $12.9 billion at year-end 2005.
The company also had minority interest obligations of
$209 million, up from $200 million at December 31,
2005.

The $3.1 billion reduction in total debt and
capital lease obligations during 2006 included the
early redemption and maturity of several individual
debt issues. In the first quarter, $185 million of
Union Oil Company bonds matured. In the second quarter,
the company redeemed approximately $1.7 billion of
Unocal debt prior to maturity. In the fourth quarter, a
$129 million Texaco Capital Inc. bond matured, and
Union Oil Company bonds of $196 million were redeemed
prior to maturity. Commercial paper balances at the end
of 2006 were reduced $626 million from year-end 2005.
In February 2007, a $144 million Texaco Capital Inc.
bond matured.

The company’s debt and capital lease obligations
due within one year, consisting primarily of
commercial paper and the current portion of long-term
debt, totaled $6.6 billion at December 31, 2006, up
from $5.6 billion at year-end 2005. Of these amounts,
$4.5 billion and $4.9 billion
were reclassified to long-term at the end of each
period, respectively. At year-end 2006, settlement of
the reclassified amount was not expected to require
the use of working capital in 2007, as the company had
the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed
credit facilities, to refinance the amounts on a
long-term basis. The company’s practice has been to
maintain commercial paper levels it believes
appropriate and economic.

At year-end 2006, the company had $5 billion in
committed credit facilities with various major banks,
which permitted the refinancing of short-term
obligations on a long-term basis. These facilities
support commercial paper borrowings and can be used for
general corporate purposes. The company’s practice has
been to continually replace expiring commitments with
new commitments on substantially the same terms,
maintaining levels management believes appropriate. Any
borrowings under the facilities would be unsecured
indebtedness at interest rates based on the London
Interbank Offered Rate or an average of base lending
rates published by specified banks and on terms
reflecting the company’s strong credit rating. No
borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at
December 31, 2006. In addition, the company has three
existing effective “shelf” registration statements on
file with the Securities and Exchange Commission that
together would permit additional registered debt
offerings up to an aggregate $3.8 billion of debt
securities.

In 2004, Chevron entered into $1 billion of
interest rate swap transactions, in which the company
receives a fixed interest rate and pays a floating
rate, based on the notional principal amounts. Under
the terms of the swap agreements, of which $250 million
and $750 million will terminate in September 2007 and
February 2008, respectively, the net
cash settlement will be based on the difference between
fixed interest rates and floating interest rates.

FS-12


The company has outstanding public bonds issued by
Chevron Corporation Profit Sharing/Savings Plan Trust
Fund, Chevron Canada Funding Company (formerly Chevron
Texaco Capital Company), Texaco Capital Inc. and Union
Oil Company of California. All of these securities are
guaranteed by Chevron Corporation and are rated AA by
Standard and Poor’s Corporation and Aa2 by Moody’s
Investors Service. The company’s U.S. commercial paper
is rated A-1+ by Standard and Poor’s and P-1 by
Moody’s, and the company’s Canadian commercial paper is
rated R-1 (middle) by Dominion Bond Rating Service. All
of these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade
securities.

The company’s future debt level is dependent
primarily on results of operations, the
capital-spending
program and cash that may be generated from asset
dispositions. The company believes that it has
substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated
cash requirements and that during periods of low
prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow
margins for refined products and commodity chemicals,
it has the flexibility to increase borrowings and/or
modify capital-spending plans to continue paying the
common stock dividend and maintain the company’s
high-quality debt ratings.

Common stock repurchase program

A $5 billion
stock repurchase program initiated in December 2005
was completed in November 2006. During 2006, about
78.5 million common shares were repurchased under this
program at a total cost of $4.9 billion.

In December 2006, the company authorized the
acquisition of up to an additional $5 billion of its
common shares from time to time at prevailing prices,
as permitted by securities laws and other legal
requirements and subject to market conditions and other
factors. The program is for a period of up to three
years and may be discontinued at any time. Under this
program, the company acquired approximately 1.3 million
shares in the open market for $100 million during
December 2006 and through mid-February 2007 increased
the total shares acquired to 8.2 million at a cost of
$592 million.

Capital and exploratory expenditures

Total
reported expenditures for 2006 were $16.6 billion,
including $1.9 billion for the company’s share of
affiliates’ expenditures, which did not require cash
outlays by the company. In 2005 and 2004, expenditures
were $11.1 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively,
including the company’s share of affiliates’
expenditures of $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion in the
cor-

responding periods. The 2005 amount excludes the
$17.3 billion acquisition of Unocal Corporation.

Of the $16.6 billion in expenditures for 2006,
about three-fourths, or $12.8 billion, related to
upstream activities. Approximately the same percentage
was also expended for upstream operations in 2005 and
2004. International upstream accounted for about 70
percent of the worldwide upstream investment in each of
the three years, reflecting the company’s continuing
focus on opportunities that are available outside the
United States.

In 2007, the company estimates capital and
exploratory expenditures will be 18 percent higher at
$19.6 billion,
including $2.4 billion of
spending by affiliates.
About three-fourths of the
total, or $14.6 billion,
is budgeted for

exploration and production
activities, with $10.6
billion of this amount
outside the United States.
Spending in 2007 is
primarily targeted for
exploratory prospects in
the deepwater Gulf of
Mexico and western Africa
and major development
projects in Angola,
Australia, Brazil,
Kazakhstan, Nigeria, the
deepwater Gulf of Mexico
and an oil sands project
in Canada.

Worldwide downstream
spending in 2007 is
estimated at $3.8
billion, with about $1.6
billion for projects in
the United States.
Capital projects include
upgrades to refineries in
the
United States and South Korea and construction of
liquefied natural gas tankers and gas-to-liquids
facilities in support of associated upstream projects.

Investments in chemicals, technology and other
corporate businesses in 2007 are budgeted at $1.2
billion. Technology investments include projects
related to molecular transformation, unconventional
hydrocarbons, oil and gas reservoir management and development of
second-generation biofuel production.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Pension Obligations

In 2006, the company’s pension
plan contributions totaled approximately $450 million.
Approximately $225 million of the total was contributed
to U.S. plans. In 2007, the company estimates total
contributions will be $500 million. Actual amounts are
dependent upon plan-investment results, changes in
pension obligations, regulatory requirements and other
economic factors. Additional funding may be required if
investment returns are insufficient to offset increases
in plan obligations. Refer also to the discussion of
pension accounting in “Critical Accounting Estimates
and Assumptions,” beginning on page FS-20.

Current Ratio

– current assets divided by

adversely affected by the fact that Chevron’s
inventories are valued on a Last-In-First-Out basis. At
year-end 2006, the book value of inventory was lower
than replacement costs, based on average acquisition
costs during the year, by approximately $6 billion.

Interest Coverage Ratio

– income before income
tax expense, plus interest and debt expense and
amortization of capitalized interest, divided by before-tax interest
costs. The interest coverage ratio was higher in 2006 compared
with 2005, primarily due to higher before-tax income and lower average
debt balances. The company’s interest coverage ratio was essentially unchanged between 2005 and 2004.

Debt Ratio

– total
debt as a percentage of total debt plus equity.
The decrease between 2005 and 2006 was due to lower average debt
levels and an increase in stockholders’ equity. Although total debt was
slightly higher at the end of 2005 than a year earlier due to the assumption of
debt associated with the Unocal acquisition, the debt ratio declined as a result of higher stockholders’
equity

balances for retained earnings and the capital stock that was issued in connection with the Unocal
acquisition.

company’s interest in Equilon and Motiva in 2002, as
discussed in the “Indemnifications” section on page
FS-15.

At December 31, 2006, the company and its
subsidiaries provided guarantees, either directly or
indirectly, of $296 million for notes and other
contractual obligations of affiliated companies and
$131 million for third parties, as described by major
category below. There are no amounts being carried as
liabilities for the company’s obligations under these
guarantees.

The $296 million in guarantees provided to
affiliates related to borrowings for capital projects.
These guarantees were undertaken to achieve lower
interest rates and generally cover the construction
periods of the capital projects. Included in these
amounts are the company’s guarantees of $214 million
associated with a construction completion guarantee for
the debt financing of the company’s equity interest in
the BTC crude oil pipeline project. Substantially all
of the $296 million guaranteed will expire between 2007
and 2011, with the remaining expiring by the end of
2015. Under the terms of the guarantees, the company
would be required to fulfill the guarantee should an
affiliate be in default of its loan terms, generally
for the full amounts disclosed.

The $131 million in guarantees provided on behalf
of third parties relate to construction loans to
governments of certain of the company’s international
upstream operations. Substantially all of the $131
million in guarantees expire by 2011, with the
remainder expiring by 2015. The company would be
required to perform under the terms of the guarantees
should an entity be in default of its loan or contract
terms, generally for the full amounts disclosed.

At December 31, 2006, Chevron also had
outstanding guarantees for about $120 million of
Equilon debt and leases. Following the February 2002
disposition of its interest in Equilon, the company
received an indemnification from Shell for any claims
arising from the guarantees. The company has

FS-14


not recorded a liability for these guarantees.
Approximately 50 percent of the amounts guaranteed
will expire within the 2007 through 2011 period, with
the guarantees of the remaining amounts expiring by
2019.

Indemnifications

The company provided certain
indemnities of contingent liabilities of Equilon and
Motiva to Shell and Saudi Refining, Inc., in connection
with the February 2002 sale of the company’s interests in
those investments. The company would be required to
perform if the indemnified liabilities become actual
losses. Were that to occur, the company could be
required to make future payments up to $300 million.
Through the end of 2006, the company paid approximately
$48 million under these indemnities and continues to be
obligated for possible additional indemnification
payments in the future.

The company has also provided indemnities relating
to contingent environmental liabilities related to
assets originally contributed by Texaco to the Equilon
and Motiva joint ventures and environmental conditions
that existed prior to the formation of Equilon and
Motiva or that occurred during the period of Texaco’s
ownership interest in the joint ventures. In general,
the environmental conditions or events that are subject
to these indemnities must have arisen prior to December
2001. Claims relating to Equilon indemnities must be
asserted either as early as February 2007 or no later
than February 2009, and claims relating to Motiva
indemnities must be asserted either as early as
February 2007 or no later than February 2012. Under the
terms of these indemnities, there is no maximum limit
on the amount of potential future payments. The company
has not recorded any liabilities for possible claims
under these indemnities. The company posts no assets as
collateral and has made no payments under the
indemnities.

The amounts payable for the indemnities described
above are to be net of amounts recovered from insurance
carriers and others and net of liabilities recorded by
Equilon or Motiva prior to September 30, 2001, for any
applicable incident.

In the acquisition of Unocal, the company assumed
certain indemnities relating to contingent
environmental liabilities associated with assets that
were sold in 1997. Under the indemnification agreement,
the company’s liability is unlimited until April 2022,
when the liability expires. The acquirer shares in
certain environmental remediation costs up to a maximum
obligation of $200 million, which had not been reached
as of December 31, 2006.

Securitization

The company securitizes certain
retail and trade accounts receivable in its downstream
business through the use of qualifying Special Purpose
Entities (SPEs). At December 31, 2006, approximately
$1.2 billion, representing about 7 percent of Chevron’s
total current accounts and notes receivable balance,
were securitized. Chevron’s total estimated financial
exposure under these securitizations at December 31,
2006, was approximately $80 million. These arrangements
have the effect of accelerating Chevron’s collection of
the securitized amounts. In the event that the SPEs
experience major defaults in the collection of
receivables, Chevron believes that it would have no loss exposure
connected with third-party investments in these
securitizations.

Long-Term Unconditional Purchase Obligations and
Commitments, Including Throughput and Take-or-Pay
Agreements

The company and its subsidiaries have
certain other contingent liabilities relating to
long-term unconditional purchase obligations and
commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay
agreements, some of which relate to suppliers’
financing arrangements. The agreements typically
provide goods and services, such as pipeline and
storage capacity, drilling rigs, utilities, and
petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary
course of the company’s business. The aggregate
approximate amounts of required payments under these
various commitments are: 2007 – $3.2 billion; 2008 –
$1.7 billion; 2009 – $2.1 billion; 2010 – $1.9
billion; 2011 – $0.9 billion; 2012 and after – $4.1
billion. A portion of these commitments may ultimately
be shared with project partners. Total payments under
the agreements were approximately $3.0 billion in 2006,
$2.1 billion in 2005 and $1.6 billion in 2004.

Minority Interests

The company has commitments of
$209 million related to minority interests in
subsidiary companies.

FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

Commodity Derivative Instruments

Chevron is
exposed to market risks related to the price volatility
of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural
gas liquids, liquefied natural gas and refinery
feedstocks.

The company uses derivative commodity instruments
to manage these exposures on a portion of its activity,
including: firm commitments and anticipated
transactions for the purchase, sale and storage of
crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas
liquids and feedstock for company refineries. The
company also uses derivative commodity instruments for
limited trading purposes. The results of this activity
were not material to the company’s financial position,
net income or cash flows in 2006.

The company’s market exposure positions are
monitored and managed on a daily basis by an internal
Risk

FS-15


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Control group to ensure compliance with the
company’s risk management policies that have been
approved by the Audit Committee of the company’s Board
of Directors.

The derivative instruments used in the company’s
risk management and trading activities consist mainly
of futures, options, and swap contracts traded on the
NYMEX (New York Mercantile Exchange) and on electronic
platforms of ICE (Inter-Continental Exchange) and
GLOBEX (Chicago Mercantile Exchange). In addition,
crude oil, natural gas and refined product swap
contracts and option contracts are entered into
principally with major financial institutions and other
oil and gas companies in the “over-the-counter”
markets.

Virtually all derivatives beyond those designated
as normal purchase and normal sale contracts are
recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in
income. Fair values are derived principally from
published market quotes and other independent
third-party quotes.

Each hypothetical 10 percent increase in the
price of natural gas, crude oil and refined products
would increase the fair value of the natural gas
purchase derivative contracts by approximately $10
million, increase the fair value of the crude oil purchase derivative
contracts by about $4 million and reduce the fair
value of the refined product sale derivative contracts
by about $30 million, respectively. The same
hypothetical decrease in the prices of these
commodities would result in approximately the same
opposite effects on the fair values of the contracts.

The hypothetical effect on these contracts was
estimated by calculating the fair value of the
contracts as the difference between the hypothetical
and current market prices multiplied by the contract
amounts.

Foreign Currency

The company enters into forward
exchange contracts, generally with terms of 180 days
or less, to manage some of its foreign currency
exposures. These exposures include revenue and
anticipated purchase transactions, including foreign
currency capital expenditures and lease commitments,
forecasted to occur within 180 days. The forward
exchange contracts are recorded at fair value on the
balance sheet with resulting gains and losses
reflected in income.

The aggregate effect of a hypothetical 10 percent
increase in the value of the U.S. dollar at year-end
2006 would be a reduction in the fair value of the
foreign exchange contracts of approximately $40
million. The effect would be the opposite for a
hypothetical 10 percent decrease in the year-end value
of the U.S. dollar.

Interest Rates

The company enters into interest
rate swaps as part of its overall strategy to manage
the interest rate risk on its debt. Under the terms
of the swaps, net cash settlements are based on the
difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts calculated by
reference to agreed notional principal amounts.
Interest rate swaps related

to a portion of the
company’s fixed-rate debt are accounted for as fair
value hedges, whereas interest rate swaps related to a
portion of the company’s floating-rate debt are
recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with
resulting gains and losses reflected in income.

At year-end 2006, the weighted average maturity
of “receive fixed” interest rate swaps was
approximately one year. There were no “receive
floating” swaps outstanding at year end. A
hypothetical increase of 10 basis points in fixed
interest rates would reduce the fair value of the
“receive fixed” swaps by approximately $2 million.

For the financial and derivative instruments
discussed above, there was not a material change in
market risk between 2006 and 2005.

The hypothetical variances used in this section
were selected for illustrative purposes only and do not
represent the company’s estimation of market changes.
The actual impact of future market changes could differ
materially due to factors discussed elsewhere in this
report, including those set forth under the heading
“Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, of the company’s
2006 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES

Chevron enters into a number of business
arrangements with related parties, principally its
equity affiliates. These arrangements include long-term
supply or offtake agreements. Long-term purchase
agreements are in place with the company’s refining
affiliate in Thailand. Refer to page FS-15 for further
discussion. Management believes the foregoing
agreements and others have been negotiated on terms
consistent with those that would have been negotiated
with an unrelated party.

LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

MTBE

Chevron and many other companies in the
petroleum industry have used methyl tertiary butyl
ether (MTBE) as a gasoline additive. Chevron is a party
to approximately 75 lawsuits and claims, the majority
of which involve numerous other petroleum marketers and
refiners, related to the use of MTBE in certain
oxygenated gasolines and the alleged seepage of MTBE
into groundwater. Resolution of these actions may
ultimately require the company to correct or ameliorate
the alleged effects on the environment of prior release
of MTBE by the company or other parties. Additional
lawsuits and claims related to the use of MTBE,
including personal-injury claims, may be filed in the
future.

The company’s ultimate exposure related to these
lawsuits and claims is not currently determinable, but
could be material to net income in any one period. The
company currently does not use MTBE in the manufacture
of gasoline in the United States.

RFG Patent

Fourteen purported class actions were
brought by consumers of reformulated gasoline (RFG)

FS-16


alleging that Unocal misled the California Air
Resources Board into adopting standards for
composition of RFG that overlapped with Unocal’s
undisclosed and pending patents. Eleven lawsuits are
now consolidated in U.S. District Court for the
Central District of California and three are
consolidated in California State Court. Unocal is
alleged to have monopolized, conspired and engaged in
unfair methods of competition, resulting in injury to
consumers of RFG. Plaintiffs in both consolidated
actions seek unspecified actual and punitive damages,
attorneys’ fees, and interest on behalf of an alleged
class of consumers who purchased “summertime” RFG in
California from January 1995 through August 2005.
Unocal believes it has valid defenses and intends to vigorously defend against
these lawsuits. The company’s potential exposure
related to these lawsuits cannot currently be
estimated.

Environmental

The company is subject to loss
contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and
regulations that in the future may require the company
to take action to correct or ameliorate the effects on
the environment of prior release of chemicals or
petroleum substances, including MTBE, by the company or
other parties. Such contingencies may exist for various
sites, including, but not limited to,
federal Superfund sites
and analogous sites under
state laws, refineries, crude oil fields, service
 stations, terminals,

land
development areas, and
mining operations,
whether operating, closed
or divested. These future
costs are not fully
determinable due to such
factors as the unknown
magnitude of possible
contamination, the
unknown timing and extent
of the corrective actions
that may be required, the
determination of the
company’s liability in
proportion to other
responsible parties, and
the extent to which such
costs are recoverable
from third parties.

Although the company has provided for known
environmental obligations that are probable and
reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future
costs may be material to results of operations in the
period in which they are recognized. The company does
not expect these costs will have a material effect on
its consolidated financial position or liquidity. Also,
the company does not believe its obligations to make
such expenditures have had, or will have, any
significant impact on the company’s competitive
position relative to other U.S. or international
petroleum or chemical companies.

The following table displays the annual changes
to the company’s before-tax environmental
remediation reserves, including those for federal Superfund sites and
analogous sites under state laws.

Chevron’s environmental reserve as of
December 31, 2006, was $1,441 million. Included in this
balance were remediation activities of 242 sites for
which the company had been identified as a potentially
responsible party or otherwise involved in the
remediation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) or other regulatory agencies under the provisions
of the federal Superfund law or analogous state laws.
The company’s remediation reserve for these sites at
year-end 2006 was $122 million. The federal Superfund
law and analogous state laws provide for joint and
several liability for all responsible parties. Any
future actions by the EPA or other regulatory agencies
to require Chevron to assume other potentially
responsible parties’ costs at designated hazardous
waste sites are not expected to have a material effect
on the company’s consolidated financial position or
liquidity.

Of the remaining year-end 2006 environmental
reserves balance of $1,319 million, $834 million
related to approximately 2,250 sites for the company’s
U.S. downstream operations, including refineries and
other plants, marketing locations (i.e., service
stations and terminals), and pipelines. The remaining
$485 million was associated with various sites in the
international downstream ($117 million), upstream ($252
million), chemicals ($61 million) and other ($55
million). Liabilities at all sites, whether operating,
closed or divested, were primarily associated with the
company’s plans and activities to remediate soil or
groundwater contamination or both. These and other
activities include one or more of the following: site
assessment; soil excavation; offsite disposal of
contaminants; onsite containment, remediation and/or
extraction of petroleum hydrocarbon liquid and vapor
from soil; groundwater extraction and treatment; and
monitoring of the natural attenuation of the
contaminants.

The company manages environmental liabilities
under specific sets of regulatory requirements, which
in the United States include the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act and various state or local
regulations. No single remediation site at year-end
2006 had a recorded liability that was material to the
company’s financial position, results of operations or
liquidity.

It is likely that the company will continue to
incur additional liabilities, beyond those recorded,
for environmental remediation relating to past
operations. These future costs are not fully determinable due to
such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible
contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the
corrective actions that may be required, the
determination of the company’s liability in proportion
to other responsible parties, and the extent to which
such costs are recoverable from third parties.

Effective January 1, 2003, the company
implemented FASB Statement No. 143,

Accounting for
Asset Retirement Obligations

(FAS 143). Under FAS 143, the fair
value of a liability for an asset retirement
obligation is recorded when there is a legal
obligation associated with the retirement of

FS-17


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

long-lived assets and the liability can be reasonably
estimated. The liability balance of approximately $5.8
billion for asset retirement obligations at year-end
2006 related primarily to upstream and mining
properties. Refer to Note 24 on page FS-58
for a discussion of the company’s asset retirement
obligations.

For the company’s other ongoing operating assets,
such as refineries and chemicals facilities, no
provisions are made for exit or cleanup costs that may
be required when such assets reach the end of their
useful lives unless a decision to sell or otherwise
abandon the facility has been made, as the
indeterminate settlement dates for the asset
retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of
the asset retirement obligation.

Refer also to Note 24, on page FS-58,
related to FAS 143 and the company’s adoption in 2005
of FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 47,

Accounting for
Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations – An
Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143

(FIN 47), and
the discussion of “Environmental Matters” on page
FS-19.

Income Taxes

The company calculates its income tax
expense and liabilities quarterly. These liabilities
generally are not finalized with the individual taxing
authorities until several years after the end of the
annual period for which income taxes have been
calculated. The U.S. federal income tax liabilities
have been settled through 1996 for Chevron Corporation,
1997 for Unocal Corporation (Unocal) and 2001 for
Texaco Corporation (Texaco). California franchise tax
liabilities have been settled through 1991 for Chevron,
1998 for Unocal and 1987 for Texaco. Settlement of open
tax years, as well as tax issues in other countries
where the company conducts its businesses, is not
expected to have a material effect on the consolidated
financial position or liquidity of the company and, in
the opinion of management, adequate provision has been made for income and
franchise taxes for all years under examination or
subject to future examination.

Global Operations

Chevron and its affiliates
conduct business activities in approximately 180
countries. Besides the United States, the company and
its affiliates have significant operations in the
following countries: Angola, Argentina, Australia,
Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Brazil, Cambodia, Canada, Chad,
China, Colombia, Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Denmark, France, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Myanmar,
the Netherlands, Nigeria, Norway, the Partitioned
Neutral Zone between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, the
Philippines, Republic of the Congo, Singapore, South
Africa, South Korea, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, the
United Kingdom, Venezuela, and Vietnam.

The company’s operations, particularly
exploration and production, can be affected by
changing economic, regulatory and political
environments in the various countries

in which it operates, including the United States. As has occurred
in the past, actions could be taken by governments to
increase public ownership of the company’s partially
or wholly owned businesses or assets or to impose
additional taxes or royalties on the company’s
operations or both.

In certain locations, governments have imposed
restrictions, controls and taxes, and in others,
political conditions have existed that may threaten the
safety of employees and the company’s continued
presence in those countries. Internal unrest, acts of
violence or strained relations between a government and
the company or other governments may affect the
company’s operations. Those developments have at times
significantly affected the company’s related operations
and results and are carefully considered by management
when evaluating the level of current and future
activity in such countries.

Suspended Wells

The company suspends the costs of
exploratory wells pending a final determination of the
commercial potential of the related crude oil and
natural gas fields. The ultimate disposition of these
well costs is dependent on the results of future
drilling activity or development decisions or both. At
December 31, 2006, the company had approximately $1.2
billion of suspended exploratory wells included in
properties, plant and equipment, an increase of $130
million from 2005 and an increase of $568 million from
2004. More than $300 million of suspended wells were
added at the time of the Unocal acquisition in August
2005.

The future trend of the company’s exploration
expenses can be affected by amounts associated with
well write-offs, including wells that had been
previously suspended pending determination as to whether the
well had found reserves that could be classified as
proved. The effect on exploration expenses in future
periods of the $1.2 billion of suspended wells at
year-end 2006 is uncertain pending future activities,
including normal project evaluation and additional
drilling.

Refer to Note 20, beginning on page FS-47, for
additional discussion of suspended wells.

Equity Redetermination

For oil and gas producing
operations, ownership agreements may provide for
periodic reassessments of equity interests in estimated
crude oil and natural gas reserves. These activities,
individually or together, may result in gains or losses
that could be material to earnings in any given period.
One such equity redetermination process has been under
way since 1996 for Chevron’s interests in four
producing zones at the Naval Petroleum Reserve at Elk
Hills, California, for the time when the remaining
interests in these zones were owned by the U.S.
Department of Energy. A wide range remains for a
possible net settlement amount for the four zones. For
this range of settlement, Chevron estimates its maximum possible net
before-tax liability at approximately $200 million,
and the possible maximum net amount that could be
owed to Chevron is

FS-18


estimated at about $150 million.
The timing of the settlement and the exact amount
within this range of estimates are uncertain.

Other Contingencies

Chevron receives claims from
and submits claims to customers, trading partners,
U.S. federal, state and local regulatory bodies,
governments, contractors, insurers, and suppliers.
The amounts of these claims, individually and in the
aggregate, may be significant and take lengthy
periods to resolve.

The company and its affiliates also continue to
review and analyze their operations and may close,
abandon, sell, exchange, acquire or restructure assets
to achieve operational or strategic benefits and to
improve competitiveness and profitability. These
activities, individually or together, may result in
gains or losses in future periods.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Virtually all aspects of the businesses in which
the company engages are subject to various federal,
state and local environmental, health and safety laws
and regulations. These regulatory requirements continue
to increase in both number and complexity over time and
govern not only the manner in which the company
conducts its operations, but also the products it
sells. Most of the costs of complying
with laws and regulations pertaining to company
operations and products are embedded in the normal
costs of doing business.

Accidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may
occur in the ordinary course of business. In addition
to the costs for environmental protection associated
with its ongoing operations and products, the company
may incur expenses for corrective actions at various
owned and previously owned facilities and at
third-party-owned waste-disposal sites used by the
company. An obligation may arise when operations are
closed or sold or at non-Chevron sites where company
products have been handled or disposed of. Most of the
expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to
facilities and sites where past operations followed
practices and procedures that were considered
acceptable at the time but now require investigative or
remedial work or both to meet current standards.

Using definitions and guidelines established by
the American Petroleum Institute, Chevron estimated its
worldwide environmental spending in 2006 at
approximately $2.2 billion for its consolidated
companies. Included in these expenditures were
approximately $870 million of environmental capital
expenditures and $1.3 billion of costs associated with
the prevention, control, abatement or elimination of
hazardous substances and pollutants from operating,
closed or divested sites, and the abandonment and
restoration of sites.

For 2007, total worldwide environmental capital
expenditures are estimated at $1.2 billion. These
capital costs are in addition to the ongoing costs of
complying with environmental regulations and the
costs to remediate previously contaminated sites.

It is not possible to predict with certainty
the amount of additional investments in new or
existing facilities or amounts of incremental operating costs to be incurred
in the future to: prevent, control, reduce or eliminate
releases of hazardous materials into the environment;
comply with exist-

ing and new environmental laws or
regulations; or remediate and restore areas damaged by
prior releases of hazardous materials. Although these
costs may be significant to the results of operations
in any single period, the company does not expect them
to have a material effect on the company’s liquidity or
financial position.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS

Management makes many estimates and assumptions in
the application of generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP) that may have a material impact on
the company’s consolidated financial statements and
related disclosures and on the comparability of such information over
different reporting periods. All such estimates and
assumptions affect reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.
Estimates and assumptions are based on management’s
experience and other information available prior to the
issuance of the financial statements. Materially
different results can occur as circumstances change and
additional information becomes known.

The discussion in this section of “critical”
accounting estimates or assumptions is according to the
disclosure guidelines of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC), wherein:

1.

the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels
of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for
highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such
matters to change; and

2.

the impact of the estimates and assumptions on the company’s financial condition or
operating performance is material.

Besides those meeting these “critical” criteria,
the company makes many other accounting estimates and
assumptions in preparing its financial statements and
related disclosures. Although not associated with
“highly uncertain matters,” these estimates and
assumptions are also subject to revision as
circumstances warrant, and materially different results
may sometimes occur.

For example, the recording of deferred tax assets
requires an assessment under the accounting rules that
the future realization of the associated tax benefits
be “more likely than not.” Another example is the
estimation of crude oil and natural gas reserves under
SEC rules that require “... geological and engineering
data (that) demonstrate with reasonable certainty
(reserves) to be recoverable in future years from known
reservoirs under existing economic and operating
conditions, i.e., prices and costs as of the date the
estimate is made.” Refer to Table V, “Reserve Quantity
Information,” beginning on page FS-68, for the changes
in these estimates for the three years ending December
31, 2006, and to Table VII, “Changes in the
Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash
Flows From Proved Reserves” on page FS-76 for estimates
of proved-reserve values for each of the three years
ending December 31, 2004 through 2006, which were based
on year-end prices at the time. Note 1 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, beginning on page FS-32, includes a
description of the “successful efforts” method of
accounting for oil and gas exploration and production
activities. The estimates of crude oil and

FS-19


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

natural gas reserves are important to the timing of
expense recognition for costs incurred.

The discussion of the critical accounting policy
for “Impairment of Properties, Plant and Equipment and
Investments in Affiliates,” on page FS-21, includes
reference to conditions under which downward revisions
of proved-reserve quantities could result in
impairments of oil and gas properties. This commentary
should be read in conjunction with disclosures
elsewhere in this discussion and in the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements related to
estimates, uncertainties, contingencies and new
accounting standards. Significant accounting policies
are discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, beginning on page FS-32. The development
and selection of accounting estimates and assumptions,
including those deemed “critical,” and the associated
disclosures in this discussion have been discussed by
management with the Audit Committee of the Board of
Directors.

The areas of accounting and the associated
“critical” estimates and assumptions made by the
company are as follows:

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

The determination of pension plan obligations and
expense is based on a number of actuarial assumptions.
Two critical assumptions are the expected long-term
rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate
applied to pension plan obligations. For other
postretirement employee benefit (OPEB) plans, which
provide for certain health care and life insurance
benefits for qualifying retired employees and which
are not funded, critical assumptions in determining
OPEB obligations and expense are the discount rate and
the assumed health care cost-trend rates.

Note 21, beginning on page FS-48, includes
information on the funded status of the company’s
pension and OPEB plans at the end of 2006 and 2005, the
components of pension and OPEB expense for the three
years ending December 31, 2006, and the underlying
assumptions for those periods. The note also presents
the incremental impact of recording the funded status
of each of the company’s pension and OPEB plans at
year-end 2006 under the provisions of FASB Statement
No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of
FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132R

(FAS 158).

Pension and OPEB expense is recorded on the
Consolidated Statement of Income in “Operating
expenses” or “Selling, general and administrative
expenses” and applies to all business segments. With
the adoption of FAS 158, the year-end 2006 funded
status, measured as the difference between plan assets
and obligations, of each of the company’s pension and OPEB plans is recognized
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The funded status of overfunded pension
plans is recorded as a long-term asset in “Deferred
charges and other assets.” The funded status of
underfunded or unfunded

pension and OPEB plans is
recorded in “Accrued liabilities” or “Reserves for
employee benefit plans.” Amounts yet to be recognized
as components of pension or OPEB expense are recorded
in “Accumulated other comprehensive income.”

To
estimate the long-term rate of return on pension
assets, the company uses a process that incorporates
actual historical asset-class returns and an assessment
of expected future performance and takes into
consideration external actuarial advice and asset-class
factors. Asset allocations are periodically updated
using pension plan asset/liability studies, and the
determination of the company’s estimates of long-term
rates of return are consistent with these studies. The
expected long-term rate of return on U.S. pension plan
assets, which account for 70 percent of the company’s
pension plan assets, has remained at 7.8 percent since
2002. For the 10 years ending December 31, 2006, actual
asset returns averaged 9.7 percent for this plan.

The year-end market-related value of assets of the
major U.S. pension plan used in the determination of
pension expense was based on the market value in the
preceding three months as opposed to the maximum
allowable period of five years under U.S. accounting
rules. Management considers the three-month period long
enough to minimize the effects of distortions from
day-to-day market volatility and still be
contemporaneous to the end of the year. For other
plans, market value of assets as of the measurement
date is used in calculating the pension expense.

The discount rate assumptions used to determine
U.S. and international pension and postretirement
benefit plan obligations and expense reflect the
prevailing rates available on high-quality fixed-income
debt instruments. At December 31, 2006, the company
selected a 5.8 percent discount rate for the major U.S.
pension and postretirement plans. This rate was
selected based on Moody’s Aa Corporate Bond Index and a
cash flow analysis that matched estimated future
benefit payments to the Citigroup Pension Discount
Yield Curve as of year-end 2006. The discount rates at
the end of 2005 and 2004 were 5.5 percent and 5.8
percent, respectively.

An increase in the expected long-term return on
plan assets or the discount rate would reduce pension
plan expense, and vice versa. Total pension expense
for 2006 was approximately $585 million. As an
indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to
the long-term rate of return assumption, a 1 percent
increase in the expected rate of return on assets of the company’s primary U.S.
pension plan would have reduced total pension plan
expense for 2006 by approximately $60 million. A 1
percent increase in the discount rate for this same
plan, which accounted for about 60 percent of the
companywide pension obligation, would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2006 by
approximately $160 million.

FS-20


An increase in the discount rate would decrease
pension obligation, thus changing the funded status of
a plan recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The
total pension liability on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet at December 31, 2006, for underfunded plans was
approximately $1.7 billion. As an indication of the
sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate
assumption, a 0.25 percent increase in the discount
rate applied to the company’s primary U.S. pension plan
would have reduced the plan obligation by approximately
$275 million, which would have changed the plan’s
funded status from underfunded to overfunded, resulting
in a pension asset of about $250 million. Other plans
would be less underfunded as discount rates increase.
The actual rates of return on plan assets and discount
rates may vary significantly from estimates because of
unanticipated changes in the world’s financial markets.

In 2006, the company’s pension plan
contributions were approximately $450 million
(approximately $225 million to the U.S. plans). In
2007, the company estimates contributions will be
approximately $500 million. Actual contribution
amounts are dependent upon plan-investment results,
changes in pension obligations, regulatory
requirements and other economic factors. Additional
funding may be required if investment returns are
insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations.

For the company’s OPEB plans, expense for 2006
was about $230 million and the total liability, which
reflected the underfunded status of the plans at the
end of 2006, was $3.3 billion.

As an indication of discount rate sensitivity to
the determination of OPEB expense in 2006, a 1 percent
increase in the discount rate for the company’s primary
U.S. OPEB plan, which accounted for about 75 percent of
the company-wide OPEB expense, would have decreased
OPEB expense by approximately $25 million. A 0.25
percent increase in the discount rate for the same
plan, which accounted for about 90 percent of the
companywide OPEB liabilities, would have decreased
total OPEB liabilities at the end of 2006 by
approximately $70 million.

For the main U.S. postretirement medical plan, the
annual increase to company contributions is
limited to 4 percent per year. The cap becomes
effective in the year of retirement for
pre–Medicare-eligible employees retiring on or after
January 1, 2005. The cap was effective as of January 1,
2005, for pre–Medicare-eligible employees retiring
before that date and all Medicare-eligible retirees.
For active employees and retirees under age 65 whose
claims experiences are combined for rating purposes,
the assumed health care cost-trend rates start with 9
percent in 2007 and gradually drop to 5 percent for
2011 and beyond. As an indication of the health care
cost-trend rate sensitivity to the determination of
OPEB expense in 2006, a 1 percent increase in the rates
for the main U.S. postretirement medical plan, which
accounted for about 90 percent of the companywide OPEB
obligations, would have increased OPEB expense $8
million.

Differences between the various assumptions used
to determine expense and the funded status of each
plan and actual experience are not included in
benefit plan costs in

the year the difference occurs.
Instead, the differences are included in actuarial
gain/loss and unamortized amounts have been reflected
in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Refer to Note 21,
beginning on page FS-48, for information on the $2.6
billion of actuarial losses recorded by the company
as of December 31, 2006; a description of the method
used to amortize those costs; and an estimate of the
costs to be recognized in expense during 2007.

Impairment of Properties, Plant and Equipment and
Investments in Affiliates

The company assesses its
properties, plant and equipment (PP&E) for possible
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not
be recoverable. Such indicators include changes in the
company’s business plans, changes in commodity prices
and, for crude oil and natural gas properties,
significant downward revisions of estimated
proved-reserve quantities. If the carrying value of an
asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows
expected from the asset, an impairment charge is
recorded for the excess of carrying value of the asset
over its fair value.

Determination as to whether and how much an asset
is impaired involves management estimates on highly
uncertain matters such as future commodity prices, the
effects of inflation and technology improvements on
operating expenses, production profiles, and the
outlook for global or regional market supply and demand
conditions for crude oil, natural gas, commodity
chemicals and refined products. However, the impairment
reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that
are consistent with the company’s business plans and
long-term investment decisions.

No major impairments of PP&E were recorded for the
three years ending December 31, 2006. An estimate as to
the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other
assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and
impairment calculations is not practicable, given the
broad range of the company’s PP&E and the number of
assumptions involved in the estimates. That is,
favorable changes to some assumptions might have
avoided the need to impair any assets in these periods,
whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an
additional unknown number of other assets to become
impaired.

Investments in common stock of affiliates that are
accounted for under the equity method, as well as
investments in other securities of these equity
investees, are reviewed for impairment when the fair
value of the investment falls below the company’s
carrying value. When such a decline is deemed to be
other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded
to the income statement for the difference between the
investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair
value at the time. In making the determination as to
whether a decline is other than temporary, the company
considers such factors as the duration and extent of
the decline, the investee’s financial performance, and
the company’s ability and intention to retain its
investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated
recovery in the investment’s market value. Differing
assumptions could affect whether an investment is
impaired in any period or

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

the amount of the impairment
and are not subject to sensitivity analysis.

From time to time, the company performs impairment
reviews and determines that no write-down in the
carrying value of an asset or asset group is required.
For example, when significant downward revisions to
crude oil and natural gas reserves are made for any
single field or concession, an impairment review is
performed to determine if the carrying value of the
asset remains recoverable. Also, if the expectation of
sale of a particular asset or asset group in any period
has been deemed more likely than not, an impairment
review is performed, and if the estimated net proceeds
exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group,
no impairment charge is required. Such calculations are
reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is
disposed of. Assets that are not impaired on a
held-and-used basis could possibly become impaired if a
decision is made to sell such assets. That is, the
assets would be impaired if they are classified as
held-for-sale and the estimated proceeds from the sale, less costs to sell, are
less than the assets’ associated carrying values.

Business Combinations – Purchase-Price Allocation

Accounting for business combinations requires the
allocation of the company’s purchase price to the
various assets and liabilities of the acquired business
at their respective fair values. The company uses all
available information to make these fair value
determinations, and for major acquisitions, may hire an
independent appraisal firm to assist in making
fair-value estimates. In some instances, assumptions
with respect to the timing and amount of future
revenues and expenses associated with an asset might
have to be used in determining its fair value. Actual
timing and amount of net cash flows from revenues and
expenses related to that asset over time may differ
materially from those initial estimates, and if the
timing is delayed significantly or if the net cash
flows decline significantly, the asset could become
impaired.

Goodwill

Goodwill acquired in a business
combination is not subject to amortization. As required
by FASB Statement No. 142,

Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets

, the company tests such goodwill at
the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual
basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or
circumstances change that would more likely than not
reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its
carrying amount. The goodwill arising from the Unocal
acquisition is described in more detail in Note 2,
beginning on page FS-34.

Contingent Losses

Management also makes judgments
and estimates in recording liabilities for claims,
litigation, tax matters and environmental remediation.
Actual costs can frequently vary from estimates for a
variety of reasons. For example, the costs from settlement of claims and
litigation can vary from estimates based on differing
interpretations of laws, opinions on culpability and
assessments on the

amount of damages. Similarly,
liabilities for environmental remediation are subject
to change because of changes in laws, regulations and
their interpretation, the determination of additional
information on the extent and nature of site
contamination, and improvements in technology.

Under the accounting rules, a liability is
recorded for these types of contingencies if management
determines the loss to be both probable and estimable.
The company generally records these losses as
“Operating expenses” or “Selling, general and
administrative expenses” on the Consolidated Statement
of Income. Refer to the business segment discussions
elsewhere in this section for the effect on earnings
from losses associated with certain litigation and
environmental remediation and tax matters for the three
years ended December 31, 2006.

An estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings
for these periods if other assumptions had been used
in recording these liabilities is not practicable
because of the number of contingencies that must be
assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and
the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, both
in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates
of such loss.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

EITF Issue No. 04-6, Accounting for Stripping
Costs Incurred During Production in the Mining Industry
(Issue 04-6)

In March 2005, the FASB ratified the
earlier Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) consensus on
Issue 04-6, which was adopted by the company on January
1, 2006. Stripping costs are costs of removing
overburden and other waste materials to access mineral
deposits. The consensus calls for stripping costs
incurred once a mine goes into production to be treated
as variable production costs that should be considered
a component of mineral inventory cost subject to
Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 43,

Restatement
and Revision of Accounting Research Bulletins

. Adoption
of this accounting for the company’s coal, oil sands
and other mining operations resulted in a $19 million
reduction of retained earnings as of January 1, 2006.

FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes – An Interpretation of
FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48)

In July 2006, the FASB
issued FIN 48, which became effective for the company
on January 1, 2007. This interpretation clarifies the
accounting for income tax benefits that are uncertain
in nature. Under FIN 48, a company will recognize a tax
benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain
tax position only if management’s assessment is that
its position is “more likely than not” (i.e., a greater
than 50 percent likelihood) to be upheld on audit based
only on the technical merits of the tax position. This
accounting interpretation also provides guidance on
measurement methodology, derecognition thresholds,
financial statement classification and disclosures,
interest and penalties recogni-

FS-22


tion, and accounting for the cumulative-effect adjustment. The new
interpretation is intended to provide better financial
statement comparability among companies.

Required annual disclosures include a tabular
reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits at the
beginning and end of the period; the amount of
unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would
affect the effective tax rate; the amounts of interest
and penalties recognized in the financial statements;
any expected significant impacts from unrecognized tax
benefits on the financial statements over the
subsequent 12-month reporting period; and a description
of the tax years remaining to be examined in major tax
jurisdictions.

As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, the
company expects to recognize an increase in the
liability for unrecognized tax benefits and associated
interest and penalties as of January 1, 2007. In
connection with this increase in liability, the
company estimates retained earnings at the beginning
of 2007 will be reduced by $250 million or less. The
amount of the liability and impact on retained
earnings will depend in part on clarification expected
to be issued by the FASB related to the criteria for
determining the date of ultimate settlement with a tax
authority.

FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements
(FAS 157)

In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS 157,
which will become effective for the company on January
1, 2008. This standard defines fair value, establishes
a framework for measuring fair value and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements. FAS 157 does
not require any new fair value measurements but would
apply to assets and liabilities that are required to be
recorded at fair value under other accounting
standards. The impact, if any, to the company from the
adoption of FAS 157 in 2008 will depend on the
company’s assets and liabilities at that time that are
required to be measured at fair value.

FASB Statement No. 158, Employers’ Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans
– an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and
132(R) (FAS 158)

In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS
158, which was adopted by the company on December 31,
2006. Refer to Note 21, beginning on page FS-48, for
additional information.

MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

To the Stockholders of Chevron Corporation

Management of Chevron is responsible for preparing the accompanying Consolidated Financial
Statements and the related information appearing in this report. The statements were prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and fairly
represent the transactions and financial position of the company. The financial statements include
amounts that are based on management’s best estimates and judgment.

As stated in its report included herein, the independent registered public accounting firm of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has audited the company’s consolidated financial statements in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).

The Board of Directors of Chevron has an Audit Committee composed of directors who are not
officers or employees of the company. The Audit Committee meets regularly with members of
management, the internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm to review
accounting, internal control, auditing and financial reporting matters. Both the internal auditors
and the independent registered public accounting firm have free and direct access to the Audit
Committee without the presence of management.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a–15(f). The
company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted
an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. Based on the results of this evaluation, the company’s management concluded
that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2006.

The company management’s assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report included herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Chevron Corporation:

We have completed integrated audits of Chevron
Corporation’s consolidated financial statements and of
its internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2006, in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented
below.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements listed in the index appearing under Item
15(a)(1) of the Annual Report on Form 10-K present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of Chevron Corporation and its subsidiaries at December
31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the
financial statement
schedule listed in the index appearing under Item
15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein when read in conjunction
with the related consolidated financial statements. These
financial statements and financial statement schedule are
the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted
our audits of these statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit of financial statements
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 14 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, the Company changed its method
of accounting for buy/sell contracts on April 1, 2006.

As discussed in Note 21 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, the Company changed its method of
accounting for defined benefit pension and other
postretirement plans on December 31, 2006.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment,
included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that the
Company maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on
criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is

fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those
criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the
COSO. The Company’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on management’s
assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over
financial reporting in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. An audit of
internal control over financial reporting includes
obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, evaluating management’s
assessment, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we consider
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal
control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements
in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on
the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts

NOTE 1.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General

Exploration and
production (upstream) operations consist of exploring
for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas
and also marketing natural gas. Refining, marketing and
transportation (downstream) operations relate to
refining crude oil into finished petroleum products;
marketing crude oil and the many products derived from
petroleum; and transporting crude oil, natural gas and
petroleum products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor
equipment and rail car. Chemical operations include the
manufacture and marketing of commodity petrochemicals,
plastics for industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant
oil additives.

The company’s Consolidated Financial Statements
are prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.
These require the use of estimates and assumptions
that affect the assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses reported in the financial statements, as well
as amounts included in the notes thereto, including
discussion and disclosure of contingent liabilities.
Although the company uses its best estimates and
judgments, actual results could differ from these
estimates as future confirming events occur.

The nature of the company’s operations and the
many countries in which it operates subject the company
to changing economic, regulatory and political
conditions. The company does not believe it is
vulnerable to the risk of near-term severe impact as a
result of any concentration of its activities.

Subsidiary and Affiliated
Companies

The Consolidated Financial
Statements include the accounts of controlled
subsidiary companies more than 50 percent-owned and
variable-interest entities in which the company is the
primary beneficiary. Undivided interests in oil and gas
joint ventures and certain other assets are
consolidated on a proportionate basis. Investments in
and advances to affiliates in which the company has a
substantial ownership interest of approximately 20
percent to 50 percent or for which the company
exercises significant influence but not control over
policy decisions are accounted for by the equity
method. As part of that accounting, the company
recognizes gains and losses that arise from the
issuance of stock by an affiliate that results in
changes in the company’s proportionate share of the
dollar amount of the affiliate’s equity currently in
income. Deferred income taxes are
provided for these gains and losses.

Investments are assessed for possible impairment
when events indicate that the fair value of the
investment may be below the company’s carrying value.
When such a condition is deemed to be other than
temporary, the carrying value of the investment is
written down to its fair value, and the amount of the
write-down is included in net income. In making the
determination as to whether a decline is other than
temporary, the company considers such factors as the

duration and extent of the decline, the investee’s
financial performance, and the company’s ability and
intention to retain its investment for a period that
will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated
recovery in the investment’s market value. The new cost
basis of investments in these equity investees is not
changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value.
Subsequent recoveries in the carrying value of other
investments are reported in “Other comprehensive
income.”

Differences between the company’s carrying
value of an equity investment and its underlying equity
in the net assets of the affiliate are assigned to the
extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities
based on the company’s analysis of the various factors
giving rise to the difference. The company’s share of
the affiliate’s reported earnings is adjusted quarterly
when appropriate to reflect the difference between
these allocated values and the affiliate’s historical
book values.

Derivatives

The majority
of the company’s activity in commodity derivative
instruments is intended to manage the financial risk
posed by physical transactions. For some of this
derivative activity, generally limited to large,
discrete or infrequently occurring transactions, the
company may elect to apply fair value or cash flow
hedge accounting. For other similar derivative
instruments, generally because of the short-term
nature of the contracts or their limited use, the
company does not apply hedge accounting, and changes
in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in
current income. For the company’s trading activity,
gains and losses from the derivative instruments are
reported in current income. For derivative instruments
relating to foreign currency exposures, gains and
losses are reported in current income. Interest rate
swaps – hedging a portion of the company’s fixed-rate
debt – are accounted for as fair value hedges,
whereas interest rate swaps relating to a portion of
the company’s floating-rate debt are recorded at fair
value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, with
resulting gains and losses reflected in income.

Short-Term Investments

All
short-term investments are classified as available for
sale and are in highly liquid debt securities. Those
investments that are part of the company’s cash
management portfolio and have original maturities of
three months or less are reported as “Cash
equivalents.” The balance of the short-term investments
is reported as “Marketable securities” and are
marked-to-market, with any unrealized gains or losses
included in “Other comprehensive income.”

Inventories

Crude oil,
petroleum products and chemicals are generally stated
at cost, using a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) method. In
the aggregate, these costs are below market.
“Materials, supplies and other” inventories generally
are stated at average cost.

FS-32


NOTE
1.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
– Continued

Properties, Plant and
Equipment

The successful efforts method is
used for crude oil and natural gas exploration and
production activities. All costs for development wells,
related plant and equipment, proved mineral interests
in crude oil and natural gas properties, and related
asset retirement obligation (ARO) assets are
capitalized. Costs of exploratory wells are capitalized
pending determination of whether the wells found proved
reserves. Costs of wells that are assigned proved
reserves remain capitalized. Costs are also capitalized
for exploratory wells that have found crude oil and
natural gas reserves even if the reserves cannot be
classified as proved when the drilling is completed,
provided the exploratory well has found a sufficient
quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a
producing well and the company is making sufficient
progress assessing the reserves and the economic and
operating viability of the project. All other
exploratory wells and costs are expensed. Refer to Note
20, beginning on page FS-47, for additional discussion
of accounting for suspended exploratory well costs.

Long-lived assets to be held and used, including
proved crude oil and natural gas properties, are
assessed for possible impairment by comparing their
carrying values with their associated undiscounted
future net before-tax cash flows. Events that can
trigger assessments for possible impairments include
write-downs of proved reserves based on field
performance, significant decreases in the market value
of an asset, significant change in the extent or manner
of use of or a physical change in an asset, and a
more-likely-than-not expectation that a long-lived
asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed
of significantly sooner than the end of its previously
estimated useful life. Impaired assets are written down
to their estimated fair values, generally their
discounted future net before-tax cash flows. For proved
crude oil and natural gas properties in the United
States, the company generally performs the impairment
review on an individual field basis. Outside the United
States, reviews are performed on a country, concession,
development area, or field basis, as appropriate. In
the refining, marketing, transportation and chemical
areas, impairment reviews are generally done on the
basis of a refinery, a plant, a marketing area or
marketing assets by country. Impairment amounts are
recorded as incremental “Depreciation, depletion and
amortization” expense.

Long-lived assets that are held for sale are
evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the
carrying value of the asset with its fair value less
the cost to sell. If the net book value exceeds the
fair value less cost to sell, the asset is considered
impaired and adjusted to the lower value.

As required under Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) Statement No. 143,

Accounting for
Asset Retirement Obligations

(FAS 143), the fair value
of a liability for an ARO is recorded as an asset and a
liability when there is a legal obligation associated
with the retirement of a long-lived

asset and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Refer
also to Note 24, on page FS-58, relating to
AROs.

Depreciation and depletion of all capitalized
costs of proved crude oil and natural gas producing
properties, except mineral interests, are expensed
using the unit-of-production method by individual field
as the proved developed reserves are produced.
Depletion expenses for capitalized costs of proved
mineral interests are recognized using the
unit-of-production method by individual field as the
related proved reserves are produced. Periodic
valuation provisions for impairment of capitalized
costs of unproved mineral interests are expensed.

Depreciation and depletion expenses for mining
assets are determined using the unit-of-production
method as the proven reserves are produced. The
capitalized costs of all other plant and equipment are
depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful
lives. In general, the declining-balance method is used
to depreciate plant and equipment in the United States;
the straight-line method generally is used to
depreciate international plant and equipment and to
amortize all capitalized leased assets.

Gains or losses are not recognized for normal
retirements of properties, plant and equipment subject
to composite group amortization or depreciation. Gains
or losses from abnormal retirements are recorded as
expenses and from sales as “Other income.”

Expenditures
for maintenance (including those for planned major
maintenance projects), repairs and minor renewals to
maintain facilities in operating condition are
generally expensed as incurred. Major replacements and
renewals are capitalized.

Goodwill

Goodwill acquired
in a business combination is not subject to
amortization. As required by FASB Statement No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

, the company tests
such goodwill at the reporting unit level for
impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests
if an event occurs or circumstances change that would
more likely than not reduce the fair value of a
reporting unit below its carrying amount. The goodwill
arising from the Unocal acquisition is described in
more detail in Note 2, beginning on page FS-34.

Environmental Expenditures

Environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing
operations or to conditions caused by past operations
are expensed. Expenditures that create future benefits
or contribute to future revenue generation are
capitalized.

Liabilities related to future remediation costs
are recorded when environmental assessments or
cleanups or both are probable and the costs can be
reasonably estimated. For the company’s U.S. and
Canadian marketing facilities, the accrual is based in
part on the probability that a future remediation
commitment will be required. For crude oil, natural
gas and mineral producing properties, a liability for
an asset retire-

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES – Continued

ment obligation is made, following FAS 143.
Refer to Note 24, on page FS-58, for a
discussion of FAS 143.

For federal Superfund sites and analogous sites
under state laws, the company records a liability for
its designated share of the probable and estimable
costs and probable amounts for other potentially
responsible parties when mandated by the regulatory
agencies because the other parties are not able to pay
their respective shares.

The gross amount of environmental liabilities is
based on the company’s best estimate of future costs
using currently available technology and applying
current regulations and the company’s own internal
environmental policies. Future amounts are not
discounted. Recoveries or reimbursements are recorded
as assets when receipt is reasonably assured.

Currency Translation

The
U.S. dollar is the functional currency for
substantially all of the company’s consolidated
operations and those of its equity affiliates. For
those operations, all gains and losses from currency
translations are currently included in income. The
cumulative translation effects for those few entities,
both consolidated and affiliated, using functional
currencies other than the U.S. dollar are included in
the currency translation adjustment in “Stockholders’
Equity.”

Revenue Recognition

Revenues associated with sales of crude oil, natural
gas, coal, petroleum and chemicals products, and all
other sources are recorded when title passes to the
customer, net of royalties, discounts and allowances,
as applicable. Revenues from natural gas production
from properties in which Chevron has an interest with
other producers are generally recognized on the basis
of the company’s net working interest (entitlement
method). Excise, value-added and other similar taxes
assessed by a governmental authority on a
revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a
customer are presented on a gross basis. The associated
amounts are shown as a footnote to the Consolidated
Statement of Income on page FS-27. Refer to Note 14,
on page FS-43, for a discussion of the
accounting for buy/sell arrangements.

Stock Options and Other Share-Based
Compensation

Effective July 1, 2005, the
company adopted the provisions of FASB Statement No.
123R,

Share-Based Payment

(FAS 123R), for its
share-based compensation plans. The company
previously accounted for these plans under the
recognition and measurement principles of Accounting
Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees

(APB 25), and related
interpretations and disclosure requirements established
by FASB Statement No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation

(FAS 123).

Refer to Note 22, beginning on page FS-53, for a
description of the company’s share-based compensation
plans,

information related to awards granted under those plans
and additional information on the company’s adoption of
FAS 123R.

The following table illustrates the effect on net
income and earnings per share as if the company had
applied the fair-value recognition provisions of FAS
123 to stock options, stock appreciation rights,
performance units and restricted stock units for
periods prior to adoption of FAS 123R and the actual
effect on 2005 net income and earnings per share for
periods after adoption of FAS 123R.

ACQUISITION OF UNOCAL CORPORATION

In August 2005, the company acquired Unocal
Corporation (Unocal), an independent oil and gas
exploration and
production company. Unocal’s principal upstream
operations were in North America and Asia, including
the Caspian region. Also located in Asia were Unocal’s
geothermal energy and electrical power businesses.
Other activities included ownership interests in
proprietary and common carrier pipelines, natural gas
storage facilities and mining operations.

The aggregate purchase price of Unocal was
approximately $17,288. A third-party appraisal firm
was engaged to assist the company in the process of
determining the fair values of Unocal’s tangible and
intangible assets. The final purchase-price
allocation to the assets and liabilities acquired was
completed as of June 30, 2006.

NOTE 7.

FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

Commodity Derivative Instruments

Chevron is
exposed to market risks related to price volatility of
crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas
liquids, liquefied natural gas and refinery
feedstocks.

The company uses derivative commodity instruments
to manage these exposures on a portion of its
activity, including: firm commitments and anticipated
transactions for the purchase, sale and storage of
crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas
liquids, and feedstock for company refineries. The
company also uses derivative commodity instruments for
limited trading purposes.

The company uses International Swaps Dealers
Association agreements to govern derivative contracts
with certain counterparties to mitigate credit risk.
Depending on the nature of the derivative transactions,
bilateral collateral arrangements may also be required.
When the company is engaged in more than one
outstanding derivative transaction
with the same counterparty and also has a legally
enforceable netting agreement with that counterparty,
the net marked-to-market exposure represents the
netting of the positive and negative exposures with
that counterparty and is a reasonable measure of the
company’s credit risk exposure. The company also uses
other netting agreements with certain counterparties
with which it conducts significant transactions to
mitigate credit risk.

The fair values of the outstanding contracts are
reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as “Accounts
and notes receivable,” “Accounts payable,” “Long-term
receivables – net” and “Deferred credits and other
noncurrent obligations.” Gains and losses on the
company’s risk management activities are reported as
either “Sales and other operating revenues” or
“Purchased crude oil and products,” whereas trading
gains and losses are reported as “Other income.”

Foreign Currency

The company enters into forward
exchange contracts, generally with terms of 180 days or
less, to manage some of its foreign currency exposures.
These exposures include revenue and anticipated
purchase transactions,

including foreign currency capital expenditures and
lease commitments, forecasted to occur within 180
days. The forward exchange contracts are recorded at
fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains
and losses reflected in income.

The fair values of the outstanding contracts are
reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as “Accounts
and notes receivable” or “Accounts payable,” with gains
and losses reported as “Other income.”

Interest Rates

The company enters into interest rate
swaps as part of its overall strategy to manage the
interest rate risk on its debt. Under the terms of the
swaps, net cash settlements are based on the difference
between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts
calculated by reference to agreed notional principal
amounts. Interest rate swaps related to a portion of
the company’s fixed-rate debt are accounted for as fair
value hedges, whereas interest rate swaps related to a
portion of the company’s floating-rate debt are
recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with
resulting gains and losses reflected in income.

Fair values of the interest rate swaps are
reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as
“Accounts and notes receivable” or “Accounts payable,”
with gains and losses reported directly in income as
part of “Interest and debt expense.”

Fair Value

Fair values are derived either from quoted
market prices or, if not available, the present value
of the expected cash flows. The fair values reflect
the cash that would have been received or paid if the
instruments were settled at year-end.

Long-term debt of $5,131 and $7,424 had
estimated fair values of $5,621 and $7,945 at
December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The company holds cash equivalents and marketable
securities in U.S. and non-U.S. portfolios. Eurodollar
bonds, floating-rate notes, time deposits and
commercial paper are the primary instruments held.
Cash equivalents and marketable securities had fair
values of $9,200 and $8,995 at December 31, 2006 and
2005, respectively. Of these balances, $8,247 and
$7,894 at the respective year-ends were classified as
cash equivalents that had average maturities under 90
days. The remainder, classified as marketable
securities, had average maturities of approximately
1.4 years.

For the financial and derivative instruments
discussed above, there was not a material change in
market risk from that presented in 2005.

Fair values of other financial and derivative
instruments at the end of 2006 and 2005 were not
material.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

The company’s financial
instruments that are exposed to concentrations of
credit risk consist primarily of its cash equivalents,
marketable securities, derivative financial
instruments and trade receivables. The company’s
short-term investments are placed with a wide
array of finan-

FS-37


Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts

NOTE 7.

FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS – Continued

cial institutions with high credit
ratings. This diversified investment policy limits the
company’s exposure both to credit risk and to
concentrations of credit risk. Similar standards of
diversity and creditworthiness are applied to the
company’s counterparties in derivative instruments.

The trade receivable balances, reflecting the
company’s diversified sources of revenue, are dispersed
among the company’s broad customer base worldwide. As a
consequence, the company believes concentrations of
credit risk are limited. The company routinely assesses
the financial strength of its customers. When the
financial strength of a customer is not considered
sufficient, requiring Letters of Credit is a principal
method used to support sales to customers.

NOTE 8.

OPERATING SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

Although each subsidiary of Chevron is
responsible for its own affairs, Chevron Corporation
manages its investments in these subsidiaries and
their affiliates. For this purpose, the investments
are grouped as follows: upstream – exploration and
production; downstream – refining, marketing and
transportation; chemicals; and all other. The first
three of these groupings represent the company’s
“reportable segments” and “operating segments” as
defined in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
Statement No. 131,

Disclosures About Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information

(FAS 131).

The segments are separately managed for investment
purposes under a structure that includes “segment
managers” who report to the company’s “chief operating
decision maker” (CODM) (terms as defined in FAS 131).
The CODM is the company’s Executive Committee, a
committee of senior officers that includes the Chief
Executive Officer and that, in turn, reports to the
Board of Directors of Chevron Corporation.

The operating segments represent components of
the company as described in FAS 131 terms that engage
in activities (a) from which revenues are earned and
expenses are incurred; (b) whose operating results are
regularly reviewed by the CODM, which makes decisions
about resources to be allocated to the segments and to
assess their performance; and (c) for which discrete
financial information is available.

Segment managers for the reportable segments are
accountable directly to and maintain regular contact
with the company’s CODM to discuss the segment’s
operating activities and financial performance. The
CODM approves annual capital and exploratory budgets at
the reportable segment level, as well as reviews
capital and exploratory funding for major projects and
approves major changes to the annual capital and
exploratory budgets. However, business-unit managers
within the operating segments are directly responsible
for decisions relating to project implementation and
all other matters connected with daily operations.
Company officers who are members of the Executive
Committee also have individual

management responsibilities and participate in other
committees for purposes other than acting as the
CODM.

“All Other” activities include the company’s
interest in Dynegy, mining operations, power
generation businesses, worldwide cash management and
debt financing activities, corporate administrative
functions, insurance operations, real estate
activities, alternative fuels, and technology
companies.

The company’s primary country of operation is
the United States of America, its country of
domicile. Other components of the company’s
operations are reported as “International” (outside
the United States).

Segment Earnings

The company evaluates the performance
of its operating segments on an after-tax basis,
without considering the effects of debt financing
interest expense or investment interest income, both of
which are managed by the company on a worldwide basis.
Corporate administrative costs and assets are not
allocated to the operating segments. However, operating
segments are billed for the direct use of corporate
services. Nonbillable costs remain at the corporate
level in “All Other.” After-tax segment income from
continuing operations is presented in the following
table:

Segment Sales and Other Operating Revenues

Operating
segment sales and other operating revenues,
including internal transfers, for the years 2006, 2005
and 2004 are presented in the following table.
Products are transferred between operating segments at
internal product values that approximate market
prices.

Revenues for the upstream segment are derived
primarily from the production and sale of crude oil and
natural gas, as well as the sale of third-party
production of natural gas. Revenues for the downstream
segment are derived from the refining and marketing of
petroleum products, such as gasoline, jet fuel, gas
oils, kerosene, lubricants, residual fuel oils and
other products derived from crude oil. This segment
also generates revenues from the transportation and
trading of crude oil and refined products. Revenues for
the chemicals segment are derived primarily from the
manufacture and sale of additives for lubricants and
fuel. “All Other” activities include revenues from
mining operations of coal and other minerals, power
generation businesses, insurance operations, real
estate activities, and technology companies.

Other than the United States, no single country
accounted for 10 percent or more of the company’s total
sales and other operating revenues in 2006.

RESTRUCTURING AND REORGANIZATION COSTS

In connection with the Unocal acquisition, the
company implemented a restructuring and
reorganization program as part of the effort to
capture the synergies of the combined companies by
eliminating redundant operations,
consolidating offices and facilities, and sharing
common services and functions.

As part of the restructuring and reorganization,
approximately 600 employees were eligible for severance
payments. Most of the associated positions are in the
United States and relate primarily to corporate and
upstream executive and administrative functions. By
year-end 2006, the program was substantially complete.

ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

At December 31, 2004, the company classified $162
of net properties, plant and equipment as “Assets held
for sale” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Assets in
this category related to a group of service stations
outside the United States.

Summarized income statement information relating
to discontinued operations is as follows:

Not all assets sold or to be disposed of are
classified as discontinued operations, mainly because
the cash flows from the assets were not, or will not
be, eliminated from the ongoing operations of the
company.

Subsequent to December 31, 2006, approximately
$300 of the company’s refining assets in the
Netherlands met the criteria for classifying the
assets as held for sale. The company expects to record
a gain upon close of sale, which is subject to

signing of the sales agreement and obtaining necessary
regulatory approvals.

INVESTMENTS AND ADVANCES – Continued

Petroboscan

Chevron has a 39 percent interest in
Petroboscan, a joint stock company formed in 2006 to
operate the Boscan Field in Venezuela. Chevron
previously operated the field under an operating
service agreement. At December 31, 2006, the company’s
carrying value of its
investment in Petroboscan was approximately $300 higher
than the amount of underlying equity in Petroboscan’s
net assets.

GS Caltex Corporation

Chevron owns 50 percent of GS
Caltex, a joint venture with GS Holdings. The joint
venture, originally formed in 1967 between the LG
Group and Caltex, imports, refines and markets
petroleum products and petrochemicals predominantly
in South Korea.

Caspian Pipeline Consortium

Chevron has a 15 percent
interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC),
which provides the critical export route for crude oil
from both TCO and Karachaganak. At December 31, 2006,
the company’s carrying value of its investment in CPC
was about $50 higher than the amount of underlying
equity in CPC’s net assets.

Star Petroleum Refining Company Ltd.

Chevron has a 64
percent equity ownership interest in Star Petroleum
Refining Company Limited (SPRC), which owns the Star
Refinery in Thailand. The Petroleum Authority of
Thailand owns the remaining 36 percent of SPRC.

Caltex Australia Ltd.

Chevron has a 50 percent equity
ownership interest in Caltex Australia Limited (CAL).
The remaining 50 percent of CAL is publicly owned. At
December 31, 2006, the fair value of Chevron’s share
of CAL common stock was approximately $2,400. The
aggregate carrying value of the company’s investment
in CAL was approximately $60 lower than the amount of
underlying equity in CAL net assets.

Colonial Pipeline Company

Chevron owns an approximate
23 percent equity interest in the Colonial Pipeline
Company. The Colonial Pipeline system runs from Texas
to New Jersey and transports petroleum products in a
13-state market. At December 31, 2006, the company’s
carrying value of its investment in Colonial Pipeline
was approximately $590 higher than the amount of
underlying equity in Colonial Pipeline’s net assets.

Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC

Chevron owns 50
percent of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC
(CPChem), with the other half owned by ConocoPhillips
Corporation. At December 31, 2006, the company’s
carrying value of its investment in CPChem was
approximately $80 lower than the amount of underlying
equity in CPChem’s net assets.

Dynegy Inc.

Chevron owns a 19 percent equity interest
in the common stock of Dynegy, a provider of
electricity to markets and customers throughout the
United States.

Investment
in Dynegy Common Stock

At December 31,
2006, the carrying value of the company’s investment in
Dynegy common stock was approximately $250. This amount
was about $180 below the company’s proportionate
interest in Dynegy’s underlying net assets. This
difference is primarily the result of write-downs of
the investment in 2002 for declines in the market value
of the common shares below the company’s carrying value
that were deemed to be other than temporary. This
difference has been assigned to the extent practicable
to specific Dynegy assets and liabilities, based upon
the company’s analysis of the various factors
contributing to the decline in value of the Dynegy
shares. The company’s equity share of Dynegy’s reported
earnings is adjusted quarterly when appropriate to
reflect the difference between these allocated values
and Dynegy’s historical book values. The market value
of the company’s investment in Dynegy’s common stock at
December 31, 2006, was approximately $700.

Investment
in Dynegy Preferred Stock

In May 2006,
the company’s investment in Dynegy Series C preferred
stock was redeemed at its face value of $400. Upon
redemption of the preferred stock, the company
recorded a before-tax gain of $130 ($87 after tax).

Dynegy Proposed Business Combination With LS Power
Group

Dynegy and LS Power Group, a privately held
power plant investor, developer and manager, announced
in September 2006 that the companies had executed a
definitive agreement to combine Dynegy’s assets and
operations with LS Power Group’s power generation
portfolio and for Dynegy to acquire a 50 percent
ownership interest in a development joint venture with
LS Power. Upon close of the transaction, Chevron will
receive the same number of shares of the new company’s
Class A common stock that it currently holds in Dynegy.
Chevron’s ownership interest in the combined company
will be approximately 11 percent. The transaction is
subject to specified conditions, including the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of Dynegy’s common
shareholders and the receipt of regulatory approvals.

ACCOUNTING FOR BUY/SELL CONTRACTS

The company adopted the accounting prescribed by
EITF Issue No. 04-13,

Accounting for Purchases and
Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty

(Issue
04-13) on a prospective basis from April 1, 2006. Issue
04-13 requires that two or more legally separate
exchange transactions with the same counterparty,
including buy/sell transactions, be combined and
considered as a single arrangement for purposes of
applying the provisions of Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 29,

Accounting for Nonmonetary
Transactions,

when the transactions are entered into
“in contemplation” of one

another. In prior periods, the company accounted for
buy/sell transactions in the Consolidated Statement of
Income as a monetary transaction – purchases were
reported as “Purchased crude oil and products”; sales
were reported as “Sales and other operating revenues.”

With the company’s adoption of Issue 04-13, buy/sell
transactions beginning in the second quarter 2006 are
netted against each other on the Consolidated Statement
of Income, with no effect on net income. Amounts
associated with buy/ sell transactions in periods prior
to the second quarter 2006 are shown as a footnote to
the Consolidated Statement of Income on page FS-27.

LITIGATION

MTBE

Chevron and many other companies in the
petroleum industry have used methyl tertiary butyl
ether (MTBE) as a gasoline additive. Chevron is a party
to approximately 75 lawsuits and claims, the majority
of which involve numerous other petroleum marketers and
refiners, related to the use of MTBE in certain
oxygenated gasolines and the
alleged seepage of MTBE into groundwater. Resolution of
these actions may ultimately require the company to
correct or ameliorate the alleged effects on the
environment of prior release of MTBE by the company or
other parties. Additional lawsuits and claims related
to the use of MTBE, including personal-injury claims,
may be filed in the future.

The company’s ultimate exposure related to these
lawsuits and claims is not currently determinable, but
could be material to net income in any one period. The
company currently does not use MTBE in the manufacture
of gasoline in the United States.

RFG Patent

Fourteen purported class actions were
brought by consumers of reformulated gasoline (RFG)
alleging that Unocal misled the California Air
Resources Board into adopting standards for composition
of RFG that overlapped with Unocal’s undisclosed and
pending patents. Eleven lawsuits are now consolidated
in U.S. District Court for the Central District of
California and three are consolidated in California
State Court. Unocal is alleged to have monopolized,
conspired and engaged in unfair methods of competition,
resulting in injury to consumers of RFG. Plaintiffs in
both consolidated actions seek unspecified actual and
punitive damages, attorneys’ fees, and interest on
behalf of an alleged class of consumers who purchased
“summertime” RFG in California from January 1995
through August 2005. Unocal believes it has valid
defenses and intends to vigorously defend against these
lawsuits. The company’s potential exposure related to
these lawsuits cannot currently be estimated.

In 2006, deferred tax liabilities
increased by approximately $2,500 from the amount
reported in 2005. The

FS-44


NOTE 16.

TAXES – Continued

increase was primarily related to increased
temporary differences for properties, plant and
equipment.

Deferred tax assets increased by approximately
$3,800 in 2006. The increase related primarily to
higher pension and other benefit obligations resulting
from the implementation of FAS 158, increased foreign
tax credits resulting from higher crude oil prices in
tax jurisdictions with high income tax rates, and
increased asset retirement obligations.

The overall valuation allowance relates to foreign
tax credit carryforwards, tax loss carryforwards and
temporary differences for which no benefit is expected
to be realized. Tax loss carryforwards exist in many
international jurisdictions. Whereas some of these tax
loss carryforwards do not have an expiration date,
others expire at various times from 2007 through 2029.
Foreign tax credit carryforwards of $1,916 will expire
between 2009 and 2016.

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, deferred taxes

Income taxes are not accrued for unremitted
earnings of international operations that have been or
are intended to be reinvested indefinitely.
Undistributed earnings of international consolidated
subsidiaries and affiliates for which no deferred
income tax provision has been made for possible future
remittances totaled $21,035 at December 31, 2006. A
significant majority of this amount represents earnings
reinvested as part of the company’s ongoing
international business. It is not practicable to
estimate the amount of taxes that might be payable on
the eventual
remittance of such earnings. The company does not
anticipate incurring significant additional taxes on
remittances of earnings that are not indefinitely
reinvested.

American Jobs Creation Act of 2004

In October 2004, the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 was passed into law.
The Act provides a deduction for income from qualified
domestic refining and upstream production activities,
which is to be phased in from 2005 through 2010. The
company expects the net effect of this provision of the
Act to result in a decrease in the federal effective
tax rate for 2007 to approximately 33 percent, based on
current earnings levels. In the long term, the company
expects that the new deduction will result in a
decrease of the annual effective tax rate to about 32
percent for that category of income, based on current
earnings levels.

Weighted-average interest rates at December 31, 2006 and 2005, were 5.25 percent and
4.18 percent, respectively.

Redeemable long-term obligations consist
primarily of tax-exempt variable-rate put bonds that
are included as current liabilities because they become
redeemable at the option of the bondholders during the
year following the balance sheet date.

The company periodically enters into interest rate
swaps on a portion of its short-term debt. See Note 7,
beginning on page FS-37, for information concerning the
company’s debt-related derivative activities.

At December 31, 2006, the company had $4,950 of
committed credit facilities with banks worldwide,
which permit the company to refinance short-term
obligations on a long-term basis. The facilities

paper borrowings. Interest on borrowings under
the terms of specific agreements may be based on the
London Interbank Offered Rate or bank prime rate. No
amounts were outstanding under these credit agreements
during 2006 or at year-end.

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the company
classified $4,450 and $4,850, respectively, of
short-term debt as long-term. Settlement of these
obligations is not expected to require the use of
working capital in 2007, as the company has both the
intent and the ability to refinance this debt on a
long-term basis.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

EITF Issue No. 04-6, Accounting for Stripping
Costs Incurred During Production in the Mining Industry
(Issue 04-6)

In March 2005, the FASB ratified the
earlier Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) consensus on
Issue 04-6, which was adopted by the company on January
1, 2006. Stripping costs are costs of removing
overburden and other waste materials to access mineral
deposits. The consensus calls for stripping costs
incurred once a mine goes into production to be treated
as variable production costs that should be considered
a component of mineral inventory cost subject to ARB
No. 43,

Restatement and Revision of Accounting Research
Bulletins.

Adoption of this accounting for the company’s coal, oil
sands and other mining operations resulted in a $19
reduction of retained earnings as of January 1, 2006.

FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes – An Interpretation of
FASB Statement No. 109(FIN 48)

In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, which
became effective for the company on January 1, 2007.
This interpretation clarifies the accounting for
income tax benefits that are uncertain in nature.
Under FIN 48, a company will recognize a tax benefit
in the financial statements for an uncertain tax
position only if management’s assessment is that its
position is “more likely than not” (i.e., a greater
than 50 percent likelihood) to be upheld on audit
based only on the technical merits of the tax
position. This accounting interpretation also provides
guidance on measurement methodology, derecognition
thresholds, financial statement classification and
disclosures, interest and penalties recognition, and
accounting for the cumulative-effect adjustment. The
new interpretation is intended to provide better
financial statement comparability among companies.

Required annual disclosures include a tabular
reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits at the
beginning and end of the period; the amount of
unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would
affect the effective tax rate; the amounts of interest
and penalties recognized in the
financial statements; any expected significant
impacts from unrecognized tax benefits on the financial
statements over the subsequent 12-month reporting
period; and a description of the tax years remaining to
be examined in major tax jurisdictions.

As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, the
company expects to recognize an increase in the
liability for unrecog-

FS-46


NOTE 19.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS – Continued

nized tax benefits and associated interest and
penalties as of January 1, 2007. In connection with
this increase in liability, the company estimates
retained earnings at the beginning of 2007 will be
reduced by $250 or less. The amount of the liability
and impact on retained earnings will depend in part on
clarification expected to be issued by the FASB related
to the criteria for determining the date of ultimate
settlement with a tax authority.

FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS
157)

In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS 157, which
will become effective for the company on January 1,
2008. This standard defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements. The
Statement does not require any new fair value
measurements but would apply to assets and liabilities
that are required to be recorded at fair value under
other accounting standards. The impact, if any, to the
company from the adoption of FAS 157 in 2008 will
depend on the company’s assets and liabilities at that
time that are required to be measured at fair value.

FASB Statement No. 158, Employers’ Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans
– an Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and
132(R) (FAS 158)

In September 2006, the FASB issued
FAS 158, which was adopted by the company on December
31, 2006. Refer to Note 21, beginning on page FS-48
for additional information.

ACCOUNTING FOR SUSPENDED EXPLORATORY WELLS

The company accounts for the cost of exploratory
wells in accordance with FASB Statement No. 19,

Financial and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing
Companies

(FAS 19)

,

as amended by FASB Staff Position
(FSP) FAS 19-1,

Accounting for Suspended Well Costs

,
which provides that exploratory well costs continue to
be capitalized after the completion of drilling when
(a) the well has found a sufficient quantity of
reserves to justify completion as a
producing well and (b) the enterprise is making
sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the
economic and operating viability of the project. If
either condition is not met or if an enterprise obtains
information that raises substantial doubt about the
economic or operational viability of the project, the
exploratory well would be assumed to be impaired, and
its costs, net of any salvage value, would be charged
to expense. FAS 19 provides a number of indicators that
can assist an entity to demonstrate sufficient progress
is being made in assessing the reserves and economic
viability of the project.

The following table indicates the changes to the
company’s suspended exploratory well costs for the
three years ended December 31, 2006. No capitalized
exploratory well costs were charged to expense upon
the 2005 adoption of FSP FAS 19-1.

Certain projects have multiple wells or fields or both.

Of the $907 of exploratory well costs
capitalized for a period greater than one year at
December 31, 2006, $447 (23 projects) is related to
projects that had drilling activities under way or
firmly planned for the near future. An additional $63
(one project) had drilling activity during 2006. The
$397 balance related to 20 projects in areas requiring
a major capital expenditure before production could
begin and for which additional drilling efforts were
not under way or firmly planned for the near future.
Additional drilling was not deemed necessary because
the presence of hydrocarbons had already been
established, and other activities were in process to
enable a future decision on project development.

The projects for the $397 referenced above had the
following activities associated with assessing the
reserves and the projects’ economic viability: (a) $99
million (two projects) – development plans submitted
to a government in early 2007; (b) $80 million (one
project) – pre-FEED (front-end engineering and design)
studies are ongoing with FEED expected to commence in
2007; (c) $75 million (three projects) – continued to
pursue unitization opportunities on

analysis of new seismic study to determine the
development facility concept; (e) $101 – miscellaneous
activities for 13 projects with smaller amounts
suspended. While progress was being made on all the
projects in this category, the decision on the
recognition of proved reserves under SEC rules in some
cases may not occur for several years because of the
complexity, scale and negotiations connected with the
projects. The majority of these decisions are expected
to occur in the next three years.

The $907 of suspended well costs capitalized for
a period greater than one year as of December 31,
2006, represents 110 exploratory wells in 44
projects. The tables below contain the aging of these
costs on a well and project basis:

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

The company has defined-benefit pension plans for
many employees. The company typically prefunds
defined-benefit plans as required by local regulations
or in certain situations where prefunding provides
economic advantages. In the United States, all
qualified plans are subject to the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act (ERISA) minimum funding standard.
The company does not typically fund U.S. nonqualified
pension plans that are not subject to funding
requirements under laws and regulations because
contributions to these pension plans may be less
economic and investment returns may be less attractive
than the company’s other investment alternatives.

The company also sponsors other postretirement
plans that provide medical and dental benefits, as well
as life insurance for some active and qualifying
retired employees. The plans are unfunded, and the
company and the retirees share the costs. Medical coverage for
Medicare-eligible retirees in the company’s main
U.S. medical plan is secondary to Medicare (including
Part D) and the increase to the company contribution for retiree
medical coverage is limited to no more than 4 percent per year. This contribution cap becomes
effective in the year of retirement for
pre-Medicare-eligible employees retiring on or after
January 1, 2005. The cap was effective as of January 1,
2005, for pre-Medicare-eligible retirees retiring

before that date and all Medicare-eligible retirees.
Certain life insurance benefits are paid by the
company, and annual contributions are based on actual
plan experience.

In June 2006, the company announced changes to
several of its U.S. pension and other postretirement
benefit plans, primarily merging benefits under several
Unocal plans into related Chevron plans. Under the plan
combinations, former-Unocal employees retiring on or
after July 1, 2006, received recognition for Unocal pay
and service history toward benefits to be paid under
the Chevron pension and postretirement benefit plans.
Unocal employees who retired before July 1, 2006, and
were participating in the Unocal
postretirement medical plan were merged into the
Chevron primary U.S. plan effective January 1, 2007. In
addition, the company’s contributions for
Medicare-eligible retirees under the Chevron plan were
increased in 2007 in conjunction with the merger of
former-Unocal participants into the Chevron plan.

Effective December 31, 2006, the company
implemented the recognition and measurement provisions
of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
Statement No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB
Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and

132(R)

(FAS 158), which
requires the recognition of the overfunded or
underfunded status of each of its defined benefit
pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an
asset or liability, with the offset to “Accumulated
other comprehensive loss.” In addition, Chevron
recognized its share of amounts recorded by affiliated
companies in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” to
reflect their adoption of FAS 158 at December 31,
2006. The following table illustrates the incremental
effect of the adoption of FAS 158 on individual lines
in the company’s December 2006 “Consolidated Balance
Sheet” after applying the additional minimum liability
adjustment required by FASB Statement No. 87,

Net actuarial losses recorded in
“Accumulated other comprehensive income” at December
31, 2006, related to the company’s U.S. pension,
international pension and other postretirement benefit
plans are being amortized on a straight-line basis
over approximately nine, 13 and 10 years,
respectively. These amortization periods represent the
estimated average remaining service of employees
expected to receive benefits under the plans. These
losses are amortized to the extent they exceed 10
percent of the higher of the projected benefit
obligation or market-related value of plan assets. The
amount subject to amortization is determined on a
plan-by-plan basis. During 2007, the company estimates
actuarial losses of $139 and $81 will be amortized
from

accumulated other comprehensive income for U.S. and
international pension plans, and actuarial losses of
$81 will be amortized from accumulated other
comprehensive income for other postretirement benefit
plans.

The weighted average amortization period for
recognizing prior service costs (credits) recorded at
December 31, 2006, was approximately six and 13 years
for U.S. and international pension plans, respectively,
and seven years for other postretirement benefit plans.
During 2007, the company estimates prior service costs
of $46 and $17 will be amortized from accumulated other
comprehensive income for U.S. and international pension
plans, and prior service credits of $81 will be
amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income
for other postretirement benefit plans.

Discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets were reviewed and
updated as needed on a quarterly basis for the main U.S. pension plan.


The 2005 discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation
increase reflect the remeasurement of the Unocal benefit plans at July 31, 2005, due to the
acquisition of Unocal.


The 2006 U.S. discount rate reflects remeasurement on July 1,
2006, due to plan combinations and changes, primarily merging benefits under several Unocal plans
into related Chevron plans.

Expected Return on Plan Assets

The company’s
estimates of the long-term rate of return on pension
assets is driven primarily by actual historical
asset-class returns, an assessment of expected future
performance, advice from external actuarial firms and
the incorporation of specific asset-class risk
factors. Asset allocations are periodically updated
using pension plan asset/liability studies, and the
determination of the company’s estimates of long-term
rates of return are consistent with these studies.

There have been no changes in the expected
long-term rate of return on plan assets since 2002 for
U.S. plans, which account for 70 percent of the
company’s pension plan assets. At December 31, 2006,
the estimated long-term rate of return on U.S. pension
plan assets was 7.8 percent.

The market-related value of assets of the major
U.S. pension plan used in the determination of pension
expense was based on the market values in the three
months preceding the year-end measurement date, as
opposed to the maximum allowable period of five years
under U.S. accounting rules. Management considers the
three-month time period long enough to minimize the
effects of distortions from day-to-day market
volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of
the year. For other plans, market value of assets as of
the measurement date is used in calculating the pension
expense.

Discount Rate

The discount rate assumptions used to
determine U.S. and international pension and
postretirement benefit plan obligations and expense
reflect the prevailing rates available on
high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments. At
December 31, 2006, the company selected a 5.8 percent
discount rate based on Moody’s Aa Corporate Bond Index
and a cash flow analysis that matched estimated future
benefit payments to the Citigroup Pension Discount
Yield Curve. The discount rates at the end of 2005 and
2004 were 5.5 percent and 5.8 percent, respectively.

Other Benefit Assumptions

For the measurement of
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at
December 31, 2006, for the main U.S. postretirement
medical plan, the assumed health care cost-trend rates
start with 9 percent in 2007 and gradually decline to
5 percent for 2011 and beyond. For this measurement at
December 31, 2005,
the assumed health care cost-trend rates started with
10 percent in 2006 and gradually decline to 5 percent
for 2011 and beyond. In both measurements, the annual
increase to company contributions was capped at 4
percent.

Assumed health care cost-trend rates can have a
significant effect on the amounts reported for retiree
health care costs. The impact is mitigated by the 4
percent cap on the company’s medical contributions for
the primary U.S. plan. A one-percentage-point change
in the assumed health care cost-trend rates would have
the following effects:

measured. To assess the plans’ investment
performance, long-term asset allocation policy
benchmarks have been established.

For the primary U.S. pension plan, the Chevron
Board of Directors has established the following
approved asset allocation ranges: Equities 40–70
percent, Fixed Income 20–60 percent, Real Estate 0–15
percent and Other 0–5 percent. The significant
international pension plans also have established
maximum and minimum asset allocation ranges that vary
by each plan. Actual asset allocation within approved
ranges is based on a variety of current economic and
market conditions and consideration of specific asset
category risk.

Equities include investments in the company’s
common stock in the amount of $17 and $13 at December
31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The “Other” asset
category includes minimal investments in
private-equity limited partnerships.

Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments

In 2006, the
company contributed $224 and $225 to its U.S. and
international pension plans, respectively. In 2007,
the company expects contributions to be approximately
$300 and $200 to its U.S. and international pension
plans, respectively. Actual contribution amounts are
dependent upon plan-investment returns, changes in
pension obligations, regulatory environments and other
economic factors. Additional funding may ultimately be
required if investment returns are insufficient to
offset increases in plan obligations.

The company anticipates paying other
postretirement benefits of approximately $223 in
2007, as compared with $211 paid in 2006.

The following benefit payments, which include
estimated future service, are expected to be paid in
the next 10 years:

Employee Savings Investment Plan

Eligible
employees of Chevron and certain of its
subsidiaries participate in the Chevron Employee
Savings Investment Plan (ESIP).

Charges to expense for the ESIP represent the
company’s contributions to the plan, which are funded
either through the purchase of shares of common stock
on the open market or through the release of common
stock held in the leveraged employee stock ownership
plan (LESOP), which is discussed below. Total company
matching contributions to employee accounts within the
ESIP were $169, $145 and $139 in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. This cost was reduced by the value of
shares released from the LESOP totaling $6, $4 and $138
in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The remaining
amounts,

totaling $163, $141 and $1 in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively, represent open market purchases.

Employee Stock Ownership Plan

Within the Chevron ESIP
is an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP). In 1989,
Chevron established a LESOP as a constituent part of
the ESOP. The LESOP provides partial prefunding of the
company’s future commitments to the ESIP.

As permitted by American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position 93-6,

Employers’ Accounting for Employee Stock Ownership
Plans

, the company has elected to continue its
practices, which are based on AICPA Statement of
Position 76-3,

Accounting Practices for Certain
Employee Stock Ownership Plans

, and subsequent
consensus of the EITF of the FASB. The debt of the
LESOP is recorded as debt, and shares pledged as
collateral are reported as “Deferred compensation and
benefit plan trust” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet
and the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders’ Equity.

The company reports compensation expense equal to
LESOP debt principal repayments less dividends
received and used by the LESOP for debt service.
Interest accrued on LESOP debt is recorded as interest
expense. Dividends paid on LESOP shares are reflected
as a reduction of retained earnings. All LESOP shares
are considered outstanding for earnings-per-share
computations.

Total (credits) expenses recorded for the LESOP
were $(1), $94 and $(29) in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively, including $17, $18 and $23 of interest
expense related to LESOP debt and a (credit) charge
to compensation expense of $(18), $76 and $(52).

Of the dividends paid on the LESOP shares, $59,
$55 and $52 were used in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively, to service LESOP debt. The amount in
2006 included $28 of LESOP debt service that was
scheduled for payment on the first business day of
January 2007 and was paid in late December 2006.
Included in the 2004 amount was a repayment of debt
entered into in 1999 to pay interest on the ESOP debt.
Interest expense on this debt was recognized and
reported as LESOP interest expense in 1999. In
addition, the company made contributions in 2005 of
$98 to satisfy LESOP debt service in excess of
dividends received by the LESOP. No contributions were
required in 2006 or 2004 as dividends received by the
LESOP were sufficient to satisfy LESOP debt service.

Shares held in the LESOP are released and
allocated to the accounts of plan participants based
on debt service deemed to be paid in the year in
proportion to the total of current year and
remaining debt service. LESOP shares
as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, were as
follows:

Benefit
Plan Trusts

Texaco established a benefit
plan trust for funding obligations under some of its
benefit plans. At year-end 2006, the trust contained
14.2 million shares of Chevron treasury stock. The
company intends to continue to pay its obligations
under the benefit plans. The trust will sell the shares
or use the dividends from the shares to pay benefits
only to the extent that the company does not pay such
benefits. The trustee will vote the shares held in the
trust as instructed by the trust’s beneficiaries. The
shares held in the trust are not considered outstanding
for earnings-per-share purposes until distributed or
sold by the trust in payment of benefit obligations.

Unocal established various grantor trusts to fund
obligations under some of its benefit plans, including
the deferred compensation and supplemental retirement
plans. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, trust assets of
$98 and $130, respectively, were invested primarily in
interest-earning accounts.

Management
Incentive Plans

Chevron has two incentive
plans, the Management Incentive Plan (MIP) and the
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), for officers and
other regular salaried employees of the company and
its subsidiaries who hold positions of significant
responsibility. The MIP is an annual cash incentive
plan that links awards to performance results of the
prior year. The cash awards may be deferred by the
recipients by conversion to stock units or other
investment fund alternatives

.

Aggregate charges to
expense for MIP were $180, $155 and $147 in 2006, 2005
and 2004, respectively. Awards under the LTIP consist
of stock options and other share-based compensation
that are described in Note 22 below.

Other
Incentive Plans

The company has a program that
provides eligible employees, other than those covered
by MIP and LTIP, with an annual cash bonus if the
company achieves certain financial and safety goals.
Charges for the programs were $329, $324 and $339 in
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

NOTE 22.

STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

Effective July 1, 2005, the company adopted the
provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) Statement No. 123R,

Share-Based Payment

(FAS
123R)

,

for its share-based compensation plans. The
company previously accounted for these plans under the
recognition and measurement principles of Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees

, and related interpretations and
dis-

closure requirements established by FASB Statement
No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

(FAS 123).

The company adopted FAS 123R using the modified
prospective method and, accordingly, results for prior
periods were not restated. Refer to Note 1, beginning
on page FS-32, for the pro forma effect on net income
and earnings per share as if the company had applied
the fair-value recognition provisions of FAS 123 for
periods prior to adoption of FAS 123R.

For 2006 and 2005, compensation expense charged
against income for stock options was $125 ($81 after
tax) and $65 ($42 after tax), respectively. In
addition, compensation expense charged against income
for stock appreciation rights, performance units and
restricted stock units was $113 ($73 after tax), $59
($39 after tax) and $65 ($42 after tax) for 2006, 2005
and 2004, respectively. There were no significant
stock-based compensation costs at December 31, 2006 and
2005, that were capitalized.

Cash received from option exercises under all
share-based payment arrangements for 2006, 2005 and
2004 was $444, $297 and $385, respectively. Actual
tax benefits realized for the tax deductions from
option exercises were $91, $71 and $49 for 2006, 2005
and 2004, respectively.

Cash paid to settle performance units and stock
appreciation rights was $68, $110 and $23 for 2006,
2005 and 2004, respectively. Cash paid in 2005 included
$73 million for Unocal awards paid under
change-in-control plan provisions.

The company presents the tax benefits of
deductions from the exercise of stock options as
financing cash inflows in the Consolidated Statement
of Cash Flows. In the second quarter 2006, the company
implemented the transition method of FASB Staff
Position FAS 123R-3,

Transition Election Related to
Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment
Awards

, for calculating the beginning balance of the
pool of excess tax benefits related to employee
compensation and determining the subsequent impact on
the pool of employee awards that were fully vested and
outstanding upon the adoption of FAS 123R. The
company’s reported tax expense for the period
subsequent to the implementation of FAS 123R was not
affected by this election. Refer to Note 3,
beginning on page FS-35, for information on excess tax
benefits reported on the company’s Statement of Cash
Flows.

In the discussion below, the references to share
price and number of shares have been adjusted for the
two-for-one stock split in September 2004.

Chevron
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)

Awards under
the LTIP may take the form of, but are not limited to,
stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock
units, stock appreciation rights, performance units and
non-stock grants. From April 2004 through January 2014,
no more than 160 million shares may be issued under the
LTIP, and no more than 64 million of those shares may
be in a form other than a stock

option, stock appreciation right or award
requiring full payment for shares by the award
recipient.

Stock options and stock appreciation rights
granted under the LTIP extend for 10 years from grant
date. Effective with options granted in June 2002,
one-third of each award vests on the first, second and
third anniversaries of the date of grant. Prior to
this change, options granted by Chevron vested one
year after the date of grant. Performance units
granted under the LTIP settle in cash at the end of a
three-year performance period. Settlement amounts are
based on achievement of performance targets relative
to major competitors over the period, and payments are
indexed to the company’s stock price.

Texaco Stock Incentive Plan (Texaco SIP)

On the
closing of the acquisition of Texaco in October 2001,
outstanding options granted under the Texaco SIP were
converted to Chevron options. These options retained a
provision for being restored, which enables a
participant who exercises a stock option to receive
new options equal to the number of shares exchanged or
who has shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding
obligations to receive new options equal to the number
of shares exchanged or withheld. The restored options
are fully exercisable six months after the date of
grant, and the exercise price is the market value of
the common stock on the day the restored option is
granted. Apart from the restored options, no further
awards may be granted under the former Texaco plans.

Unocal Share-Based Plans (Unocal Plans)

On the closing
of the acquisition of Unocal in August 2005, outstanding
stock options and stock appreciation rights granted
under various Unocal Plans were exchanged for fully
vested Chevron options and appreciation rights at a
conversion ratio of 1.07 Chevron shares for each Unocal
share. These awards retained the same provisions as the
original Unocal Plans. Awards issued prior to 2004
generally may be exercised for up to three years after
termination of employment (depending upon the terms of
the individual award agreements) or the original
expiration date, whichever is earlier. Awards issued
since 2004 generally remain exercisable until the end
of the normal option term if termination of employment
occurs prior to August 10, 2007. Other awards issued
under the Unocal Plans, including restricted stock,
stock units, restricted stock units and performance
shares, became vested at the acquisition date, and
shares or cash were issued to recipients in accordance
with change-in-control provisions of the plans.

The fair market values of stock options and stock
appreciation rights granted in 2006, 2005 and 2004 were
measured on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model, with the following

ing period for retirement-eligible employees in
accordance with vesting provisions of the company’s
share-based compensation programs for awards issued
after adoption of FAS 123R. As of December 31, 2006,
there was $99 of total unrecognized before-tax
compensation cost related to nonvested share-based
compensation arrangements granted or restored under the
plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of 2.0 years.

At January 1, 2006, the number of LTIP performance
units outstanding was equivalent to 2,346,016 shares.
During 2006, 709,200 units were granted, 827,450 units
vested with cash proceeds distributed to recipients,
and 117,570 units were forfeited. At December 31, 2006,
units outstanding were 2,110,196, and the fair value of
the liability recorded for these instruments was $113.
In addition, outstanding stock appreciation rights that
were awarded under various LTIP and former Texaco and
Unocal programs totaled approximately 700,000
equivalent shares as of December 31, 2006. A liability
of $16 was recorded for these awards.

Broad-Based Employee Stock Options

In addition to the
plans described above, Chevron granted all eligible
employees stock options or equivalents in 1998. The
options vested after two years, in February 2000, and
expire after 10 years, in February 2008. A total of
9,641,600 options were awarded with an exercise price
of $38.16 per share.

The fair value of each option on the date of
grant was estimated at $9.54 using the Black-Scholes
model for the preceding 10 years. The assumptions
used in the model, based on a 10-year average, were: a
risk-free interest rate of 7 percent, a dividend yield
of 4.2 percent, an expected life of seven years and a
volatility of 24.7 percent.

At January 1, 2006, the number of broad-based
employee stock options outstanding was 1,682,904.
During 2006, exercises of 354,845 shares and
forfeitures of 22,000 shares reduced outstanding
options to 1,306,059. As of December 31, 2006, these
instruments had an aggregate intrinsic value of $46
and the remaining contractual term of these options
was 1.1 years. The total intrinsic value of these
options exercised during 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $10,
$9 and $16, respectively.

NOTE 23.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS

Income Taxes

The company calculates its income tax
expense and liabilities quarterly. These liabilities
generally are not finalized with the individual taxing
authorities until several years after the end of the
annual period for which income taxes have been
calculated. The U.S. federal income tax liabilities
have been settled through 1996 for Chevron Corporation,
1997 for Unocal Corporation (Unocal) and 2001 for
Texaco Corporation (Texaco). California franchise tax
liabilities have been

settled through 1991 for Chevron, 1998 for Unocal and
1987 for Texaco. Settlement of open tax years, as well
as tax issues in other countries where the company
conducts its businesses, is not expected to have a
material effect on the consolidated financial position
or liquidity of the company and, in the opinion of
management, adequate provision has been made for income
and franchise taxes for all years under examination or
subject to future examination.

Guarantees

At December 31, 2006, the company and its
subsidiaries provided guarantees, either directly or
indirectly, of $296 for notes and other contractual
obligations of affiliated companies and $131 for third
parties, as described by major category below. There
are no amounts being carried as liabilities for the
company’s obligations under these guarantees.

The $296 in guarantees provided to affiliates
related to borrowings for capital projects. These
guarantees were undertaken to achieve lower interest
rates and generally cover the construction periods of
the capital projects. Included in these amounts are
the company’s guarantees of $214 associated with a
construction completion guarantee for the debt
financing of the company’s equity interest in the
Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) crude oil pipeline project.
Substantially all of the $296 guaranteed will expire
between 2007 and 2011, with the remaining expiring by
the end of 2015. Under the terms of the guarantees,
the company would be required to fulfill the guarantee
should an affiliate be in default of its loan terms,
generally for the full amounts disclosed.

The $131 in guarantees provided on behalf of third
parties related to construction loans to governments of
certain of the company’s international upstream
operations. Substantially all of the $131 in guarantees
expire by 2011, with the remainder expiring by 2015.
The company would be required to perform under the
terms of the guarantees should an entity be in default
of its loan or contract terms, generally for the full
amounts disclosed.

At December 31, 2006, Chevron also had outstanding
guarantees for about $120 of Equilon debt and leases.
Following the February 2002 disposition of its interest
in Equilon, the company received an indemnification
from Shell for any claims arising from the guarantees.
The company has not recorded a liability for these
guarantees. Approximately 50 percent of the amounts
guaranteed will expire within the 2007 through 2011
period, with the guarantees of the remaining amounts
expiring by 2019.

Indemnifications

The company provided certain
indemnities of contingent liabilities of Equilon and
Motiva to Shell and Saudi Refining, Inc., in
connection with the February 2002 sale of the
company’s interests in those investments. The company
would be required to perform if the indemnified
liabilities become actual losses. Were that to occur,
the company
could be required to make future payments up to
$300.

NOTE 23.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS – Continued

Through the end of 2006, the company paid
approximately $48 under these indemnities and continues
to be obligated for possible additional indemnification
payments in the future.

The company has also provided indemnities
relating to contingent environmental liabilities
related to assets originally contributed by Texaco to
the Equilon and Motiva joint ventures and
environmental conditions that existed prior to the
formation of Equilon and Motiva or that occurred
during the period of Texaco’s ownership interest in
the joint ventures. In general, the environmental
conditions or events that are subject to these
indemnities must have arisen prior to December 2001.
Claims relating to Equilon indemnities must be
asserted either as early as February 2007, or no later
than February 2009, and claims relating to Motiva
indemnities must be asserted either as early as
February 2007, or no later than February 2012. Under
the terms of these indemnities, there is no maximum
limit on the amount of potential future payments. The
company has not recorded any liabilities for possible
claims under these indemnities. The company posts no
assets as collateral and has made no payments under
the indemnities.

The amounts payable for the indemnities described
above are to be net of amounts recovered from insurance
carriers and others and net of liabilities recorded by
Equilon or Motiva prior to September 30, 2001, for any
applicable incident.

In the acquisition of Unocal, the company assumed
certain indemnities relating to contingent
environmental liabilities associated with assets that
were sold in 1997. Under the indemnification agreement,
the company’s liability is unlimited until April 2022,
when the liability expires. The acquirer shares in
certain environmental remediation costs up to a maximum
obligation of $200, which had not been reached as of
December 31, 2006.

Securitization

The company securitizes certain retail
and trade accounts receivable in its downstream
business through the use of qualifying Special Purpose
Entities (SPEs). At December 31, 2006, approximately
$1,200, representing about 7 percent of Chevron’s total
current accounts and notes receivables balance, were
securitized. Chevron’s total estimated financial
exposure under these securitizations at December 31,
2006, was approximately $80. These arrangements have
the effect of accelerating Chevron’s collection of the
securitized amounts. In the event that the SPEs
experience major defaults in the collection of
receivables, Chevron believes that it would have no
loss exposure connected with third-party investments in
these securitizations.

Long-Term Unconditional Purchase Obligations and
Commitments, Including Throughput and Take-or-Pay
Agreements

The company and its subsidiaries have
certain other contingent liabilities relating to
long-term unconditional purchase obligations and
commitments, including throughput and

take-or-pay
agreements, some of which relate to suppliers’
financing arrangements. The agreements typically
provide goods and services, such as pipeline and
storage capacity, drilling rigs, utilities, and
petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary
course of the company’s business. The aggregate
approximate amounts of required payments under these
various commitments are: 2007 – $3,200; 2008 –
$1,700; 2009 – $2,100; 2010 – $1,900; 2011 – $900;
2012 and after – $4,100. A portion of these
commitments may ultimately be shared with project
partners. Total payments under the agreements were
approximately $3,000 in 2006, $2,100 in 2005 and $1,600
in 2004.

Minority
Interests

The company has commitments of
$209 related to minority interests in subsidiary
companies.

Environmental

The company is subject to loss
contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and
regulations that in the future may require the
company to take action to correct or ameliorate the
effects on the environment of prior release of
chemicals or petroleum substances, including MTBE,
by the company or other parties. Such contingencies
may exist for various sites, including, but not
limited to, federal Superfund sites and analogous
sites under state laws, refineries, crude oil
fields, service stations, terminals, land
development areas, and mining operations, whether
operating, closed or divested. These future costs
are not fully determinable due to such factors as
the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the
unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions
that may be required, the determination of the
company’s liability in proportion to other
responsible parties, and the extent to which such
costs are recoverable from third parties.

Although the company has provided for known
environmental obligations that are probable and
reasonably estimable, the amount of additional
future costs may be material to results of
operations in the period in which they are
recognized. The company does not expect these costs
will have a material effect on its consolidated
financial position or liquidity. Also, the company
does not believe its obligations to make such
expenditures have had, or will have, any significant
impact on the company’s competitive position
relative to other U.S. or international petroleum or
chemical companies.

Chevron’s environmental reserve as of December
31, 2006, was $1,441. Included in this balance were
remediation activities of 242 sites for which the
company had been identified as a potentially
responsible party or otherwise involved in the
remediation by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) or other regulatory agencies under the
provisions of the federal Superfund
law or analogous state laws. The company’s
remediation

FS-56


NOTE 23.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS – Continued

reserve for these sites at year-end 2006
was $122. The federal Superfund law and analogous state
laws provide for joint and several liability for all
responsible parties. Any future actions by the EPA or
other regulatory agencies to require Chevron to assume
other potentially responsible parties’ costs at
designated hazardous waste sites are not expected to
have a material effect on the company’s consolidated
financial position or liquidity.

Of the remaining year-end 2006 environmental
reserves balance of $1,319, $834 related to
approximately 2,250 sites for the company’s U.S.
downstream operations, including refineries and other
plants, marketing locations (i.e., service stations and
terminals) and pipelines. The remaining $485 was
associated with various sites in the international
downstream ($117), upstream ($252), chemicals ($61) and
other ($55). Liabilities at all sites, whether
operating, closed or divested, were primarily
associated with the company’s plans and activities to
remediate soil or groundwater contamination or both.
These and other activities include one or more of the
following: site assessment; soil excavation; offsite
disposal of contaminants; onsite containment,
remediation and/or extraction of petroleum hydrocarbon
liquid and vapor from soil; groundwater extraction and
treatment; and monitoring of the natural attenuation of
the contaminants.

The company manages environmental liabilities
under specific sets of regulatory requirements, which
in the United States include the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act and various state or local
regulations. No single remediation site at year-end
2006 had a recorded liability that was material to the
company’s financial position, results of operations or
liquidity.

It is likely that the company will continue to
incur additional liabilities, beyond those recorded,
for environmental remediation relating to past
operations. These future costs are not fully
determinable due to such factors as the unknown
magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing
and extent of the corrective actions that may be
required, the determination of the company’s
liability in proportion to other responsible
parties, and the extent to which such costs are
recoverable from third parties.

Effective January 1, 2003, the company
implemented FASB Statement No. 143,

Accounting for
Asset Retirement Obligations

(FAS 143). Under FAS 143,
the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement
obligation is recorded when there is a legal
obligation associated with the retirement of
long-lived assets and the liability can be reasonably
estimated. The liability balance of approximately
$5,800 for asset retirement obligations at year-end
2006 related primarily to upstream and mining
properties. Refer to Note 24 on page FS-58
for a discussion of the company’s Asset Retirement
Obligations.

For the company’s other ongoing operating assets,
such as refineries and chemicals facilities, no
provisions are made for exit or cleanup costs that may
be required when such assets reach the end of their
useful lives unless a decision to sell or otherwise
abandon the facility has been made, as the
indeterminate settlement dates for the asset
retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of
the asset retirement obligation.

Global Operations

Chevron and its affiliates conduct
business activities in approximately 180 countries.
Besides the United States, the company and its
affiliates have significant operations in the following
countries: Angola, Argentina, Australia, Azerbaijan,
Bangladesh, Brazil, Cambodia, Canada, Chad, China,
Colombia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark,
France, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Myanmar, the
Netherlands, Nigeria, Norway, the Partitioned Neutral
Zone between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, the Philippines,
Republic of the Congo, Singapore, South Africa, South
Korea, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, the United
Kingdom, Venezuela and Vietnam.

The company’s operations, particularly exploration
and production, can be affected by changing economic,
regulatory and political environments in the various
countries in which it operates, including the United
States. As has occurred in the past, actions could be
taken by governments to increase public ownership of
the company’s partially or wholly owned businesses or
assets or to impose additional taxes or royalties on
the company’s operations or both.

In certain locations, governments have imposed
restrictions, controls and taxes, and in others,
political conditions have existed that may threaten the
safety of employees and the company’s continued
presence in those countries. Internal unrest, acts of
violence or strained relations between a government and
the company or other governments may affect the
company’s operations. Those developments have at times
significantly affected the
company’s related operations and results and are
carefully considered by management when evaluating the
level of current and future activity in such countries.

Equity Redetermination

For oil and gas producing
operations, ownership agreements may provide for
periodic reassessments of equity interests in estimated
crude oil and natural gas reserves. These activities,
individually or together, may result in gains or losses
that could be material to earnings in any given period.
One such equity redetermination process has been under
way since 1996 for Chevron’s interests in four
producing zones at the Naval Petroleum Reserve at Elk
Hills, California, for the time when the remaining
interests in these zones were owned by the U.S.
Department of Energy. A wide range remains for a
possible net settlement amount for the four zones. For
this range of settlement,

FS-57


Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts

NOTE 23.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS – Continued

Chevron estimates its maximum possible net
before-tax liability at approximately $200, and the
possible maximum net amount that could be owed to
Chevron is estimated at about $150. The timing of the
settlement and the exact amount within this range of
estimates are uncertain.

Other Contingencies

Chevron receives claims from and
submits claims to customers, trading partners, U.S.
federal, state and local regulatory bodies,
governments, contractors, insurers, and suppliers. The
amounts of these claims, individually and in the
aggregate, may be significant and take lengthy periods
to resolve.

The company and its affiliates also continue to
review and analyze their operations and may close,
abandon, sell, exchange, acquire or restructure assets
to achieve operational or strategic benefits and to
improve competitiveness and profitability. These
activities, individually or together, may result in
gains or losses in future periods.

NOTE 24.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

The company accounts for asset retirement
obligations in accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards Board Statement (FASB) No. 143,

Accounting
for Asset Retirement Obligations

, (FAS 143). This
accounting standard applies to the fair value of a
liability for an asset retirement obligation (ARO) that
is recorded when there is a legal obligation
associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived
asset and the liability can be reasonably estimated.
Obligations associated with the retirement of these
assets require recognition in certain circumstances:
(1) the present value of a liability and offsetting
asset for an ARO, (2) the subsequent accretion of that
liability and depreciation of the asset, and (3) the
periodic review of the ARO liability estimates and
discount rates. In 2005, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No. 47,

Accounting for Conditional Asset
Retirement Obligations – An Interpretation of FASB
Statement No. 143

, (FIN 47), which was effective for
the company on December 31, 2005. FIN 47 clarifies that
the phrase “conditional asset retirement obligation,”
as used in FAS 143, refers to a legal obligation to
perform asset retirement activity for which the timing
and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future
event that may or may not be within the control of the
company. The obligation to perform the asset retirement
activity is unconditional even though uncertainty
exists about the timing and/or method of settlement.
Uncertainty about the timing and/or method of
settlement of a conditional ARO should be factored into
the measurement of the liability when sufficient
information exists. FAS 143 acknowledges that in some
cases, sufficient information may not be available to
reasonably estimate the fair value of an ARO. FIN 47
also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient
information to reasonably

estimate the fair value of an ARO. In adopting FIN
47, the company did not recognize any additional
liabilities for conditional AROs due to an inability
to reasonably estimate the fair value of those
obligations because of their indeterminate settlement
dates.

FAS 143 and FIN 47 primarily affect the company’s
accounting for crude oil and natural gas producing
assets. No significant AROs associated with any legal
obligations to retire refining, marketing and
transportation (downstream) and chemical long-lived
assets have been recognized, as indeterminate
settlement dates for the asset retirements prevented
estimation of the fair value of the associated ARO. The
company performs periodic reviews of its downstream and
chemical long-lived assets for any changes in facts and
circumstances that might require recognition of a
retirement obligation.

The following table indicates the changes to the
company’s before-tax asset retirement obligations in
2006, 2005 and 2004:

COMMON STOCK SPLIT

In September 2004, the company effected a
two-for-one stock split in the form of a stock
dividend. The total number of authorized common stock
shares and associated par value were unchanged by this
action. All per-share amounts in the financial
statements reflect the stock split for all periods
presented. The effect of the common stock split is
reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in “Common
stock” and “Capital in excess of par value.”

(LIFO) method is used was $6,010, $4,846 and $3,036 at
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Market
value is generally based on average acquisition costs
for the year. LIFO profits of $82, $34 and $36 were
included in net income for the years 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively.

NOTE 27.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic earnings per share (EPS) is based upon net
income less preferred stock dividend requirements and
includes the effects of deferrals of salary and other
compensation awards that are invested in Chevron stock
units by certain officers and employees of the company
and the company’s share of stock transactions of
affiliates, which, under the applicable accounting
rules, may be recorded directly to the company’s
retained earnings instead of net income. Diluted EPS
includes the effects of these items as well as the
dilutive effects of outstanding stock options awarded
under the company’s stock option programs (refer to
Note 22, “Stock Options and Other Share-Based
Compensation” beginning on page FS-53). The table on
the following page sets forth the computation of basic

TABLE V – RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION

Reserves Governance

The company has adopted a
comprehensive reserves and resource classification
system modeled after a system developed and approved by
the Society of Petroleum Engineers, the World Petroleum
Congress and the American Association of Petroleum
Geologists. The system classifies recoverable
hydrocarbons into six categories based on their status
at the time of reporting – three deemed commercial and
three noncommercial. Within the commercial
classification are proved reserves and two categories
of unproved, probable and possible. The noncommercial
categories are also referred to as contingent
resources. For reserves estimates to be classified as
proved, they must meet all SEC and company standards.

Proved reserves are the estimated quantities that
geologic and engineering data demonstrate with
reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years
from known reservoirs under existing economic and
operating conditions. Net proved reserves exclude
royalties and interests owned by others and reflect
contractual arrangements and royalty obligations in
effect at the time of the estimate.

Proved reserves are classified as either developed
or undeveloped. Proved developed reserves are the
quantities expected to be recovered through existing
wells with existing equipment and operating methods.

Due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited
nature of reservoir data, estimates of underground
reserves are subject to change as additional
information becomes available.

Proved reserves are estimated by company asset
teams composed of earth scientists and engineers. As
part of the internal control process related to
reserves estimation, the company maintains a Reserves
Advisory Committee (RAC) that is chaired by the
corporate reserves manager, who is a member of a
corporate department that reports directly to the
executive vice president responsible for the company’s
worldwide exploration and production activities. All of
the RAC members are knowledgeable in SEC guidelines for
proved reserves classification. The RAC coordinates its
activities through two operating company-level reserves
managers. These two reserves managers are not members
of the RAC so as to preserve the corporate-level
independence.

The RAC has the following primary
responsibilities: provide independent reviews of the
business units’ recommended reserve changes; confirm
that proved reserves are recognized in accordance
with SEC guidelines; determine that reserve volumes
are calculated using consistent and appropriate
standards, procedures and technology; and maintain
the

Corporate Reserves Manual,

which provides
standardized procedures used corporatewide for
classifying and reporting hydrocarbon reserves.

FS-68


TABLE V

– RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION – Continued

During the year, the RAC is represented in
meetings with each of the company’s upstream business
units to review and discuss reserve changes recommended
by the various asset teams. Major changes are also
reviewed with the company’s Strategy and Planning
Committee and the Executive Committee, whose members
include the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
Financial Officer. The company’s annual reserve
activity is also reviewed with the Board of Directors.
If major changes to reserves were to occur between the
annual reviews, those matters would also be discussed
with the Board.

RAC subteams also conduct in-depth reviews during
the year of many of the fields that have the largest
proved reserves quantities. These reviews include an
examination of the proved-reserve records and
documentation of their alignment with the

Corporate
Reserves Manual.

Reserve Quantities

At December 31, 2006,
oil-equivalent reserves for the company’s consolidated
operations were 8.6 billion barrels. (Refer to page
E-11 for the definition of oil-equivalent reserves.)
Approximately 28 percent of the total reserves were in
the United States. For the company’s interests in
equity affiliates, oil-equivalent reserves were 3
billion barrels, 80 percent of which were associated
with the company’s 50 percent ownership in TCO. During
the year, the company’s Boscan and LL-652 contracts in
Venezuela were converted to Empresas Mixtas (i.e.,
joint stock contractual structures). The company had
not previously recorded any reserves for its Boscan
operations, but did so this year as a result of the
conversion. The conversion of LL-652 reserves was
treated as the sale of consolidated company reserves
and the acquisition of equity affiliate reserves.

Aside from the TCO operations, no single property
accounted for more than 5 percent of company’s total
oil-equivalent proved reserves. Fewer than 20 other
individual properties in the company’s portfolio of
assets each contained between 1 percent and 5 percent
of the company’s oil-equivalent proved reserves, which
in the aggregate accounted for about 36 percent of the
company’s proved reserves total. These properties were
geographically dispersed, located in the United States,
South America, West Africa, the Middle East and the
Asia-Pacific region.

In the United States, total oil-equivalent
reserves at year-end 2006 were 2.4 billion barrels. Of
this amount, 40 percent, 21 percent and 39 percent were
located in California, the Gulf of Mexico and other
U.S. areas, respectively.

In California, liquids reserves represented 95
percent of the total, with most classified as heavy
oil. Because of heavy oil’s high viscosity and the need to employ
enhanced recovery methods, the producing operations are
capital intensive in nature. Most of the company’s
heavy-oil fields in California employ a continuous
steamflooding process.

In the Gulf of Mexico region, liquids represented
approximately 64 percent of total oil-equivalent
reserves. Production operations are mostly offshore
and, as a result, are also capital intensive. Costs
include investments in wells, production platforms and
other facilities, such as gathering lines and storage
facilities.

In other U.S. areas, the reserves were split
about equally between liquids and natural gas. For
production of crude oil, some fields utilize enhanced
recovery methods, including water-flood and CO


injection.

The pattern of net reserve changes shown in
the following tables, for the three years ending
December 31, 2006, is not necessarily indicative of
future trends. Apart from acquisitions, the company’s
ability to add proved reserves is affected by, among
other things, events and circumstances that are outside
the company’s control, such as delays in government
permitting, partner approvals of development plans,
declines in oil and gas prices, OPEC constraints,
geopolitical uncertainties, and civil unrest.

The company’s estimated net proved underground oil
and natural gas reserves and changes thereto for the
years 2004, 2005 and 2006 are shown in the tables on
pages FS-70 and FS-72.

percent and 28 percent for consolidated companies for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and
100 percent for TCO for each year.


Net reserve changes (excluding production) in 2006 consist
of 326 million barrels of
developed reserves and (91) million barrels of undeveloped reserves for consolidated companies
and (428) million barrels of developed reserves and 631 million barrels of undeveloped
reserves for affiliated companies.


During 2006, the percentages of undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2005, transferred
to developed reserves were 11 percent and 2 percent for consolidated companies and affiliated
companies, respectively.

INFORMATION ON CANADIAN OIL SANDS NET PROVED RESERVES NOT INCLUDED ABOVE:

In addition to conventional liquids and natural gas proved reserves, Chevron has significant
interests in proved oil sands reserves in Canada associated with the Athabasca project. For
internal management purposes, Chevron views these reserves and their development as an integral
part of total upstream operations. However, SEC regulations define these reserves as mining-related
and not a part of conventional oil and gas reserves. Net proved oil sands reserves were 443 million
barrels as of December 31, 2006. The oil sands reserves are not considered in the standardized
measure of discounted future net cash flows for conventional oil and gas reserves, which is found
on page FS-75.

Noteworthy amounts in the categories of
proved-reserve changes for 2004 through 2006 in the
table above are discussed below:

Revisions

In 2004,
net revisions decreased reserves 218 million barrels
for consolidated companies and increased reserves for
affiliates by 204 million barrels. For consolidated
companies, the decrease was composed of 161 million
barrels for international areas and 57 million barrels
for the United States. The largest downward revision
internationally was 70 million barrels in Africa. One
field in Angola accounted

for the majority of the net decline as changes were
made to oil-in-place estimates based on reservoir
performance data. One field in the Asia-Pacific area
essentially accounted for the 43 million-barrel
downward revision for that region. The revision was
associated with reduced well
performance. Part of the 36 million-barrel net
downward revision for Indonesia was associated with
the effect of higher year-end prices on the
calculation of reserves for cost-oil recovery under a
production-sharing contract. In the United States, the
68 million-barrel net downward revision in the Gulf of

FS-70


TABLE V

– RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION – Continued

Mexico area was across several fields and based
mainly on reservoir analyses and assessments of well
performance. For affiliated companies, the 206
million-barrel increase for TCO was based on an updated
assessment of reservoir performance for the Tengiz
Field. Partially offsetting this increase was a
downward effect of higher year-end prices on the
variable royalty-rate calculation. Downward revisions
also occurred in other geographic areas because of the
effect of higher year-end prices on various
production-sharing terms and variable royalty
calculations.

In 2005, net revisions reduced reserves by 239
million and 24 million barrels for worldwide
consolidated companies and equity affiliates,
respectively. For consolidated companies, the net
decrease was 199 million barrels in the international
areas and 40 million barrels in the United States. The
largest downward net revisions internationally were 108
million barrels in Indonesia and 53 million barrels in
Kazakhstan, due primarily to the effect of higher
year-end prices on the calculation of reserves
associated with production-sharing and variable-royalty
contracts. In the United States, the 40 million-barrel
reduction was across many fields in each of the
geographic sections. Most of the downward revision for
affiliated companies was a 19 million-barrel reduction
in Hamaca, attributable to revised government royalty
provisions. For TCO, the downward effect of higher
year-end prices was partially offset by increased
reservoir performance.

In 2006, net revisions increased reserves by 39
million and 84 million barrels for worldwide
consolidated companies and equity affiliates,
respectively. International consolidated companies
accounted for the net increase of 39 million barrels.
The largest upward net revisions were 61 million
barrels in Indonesia and 27 million barrels in
Thailand. In Indonesia, the increase was the result of
infill drilling and improved steamflood performance.
The upward revision in Thailand reflected additional
drilling and development activity during the year.
These upward revisions were partially offset by
reductions in reservoir performance in Nigeria and the
United Kingdom, which decreased reserves by 43 million
barrels and by 32 million barrels, respectively. Most
of the upward revision for affiliated companies was
related to a 60 million barrel increase in TCO as a
result of improved reservoir performance.

Improved Recovery

In 2006, improved recovery
increased liquids volumes worldwide by 83 million
barrels for consolidated companies. Reserves in the
United States increased 52 million barrels, with
California representing 49 million barrels of the total
increase due to steamflood expansion and revised
modeling activities. Internationally, improved recovery
increased reserves by 31 million barrels, with no
single country accounting for an increase of more than
10 million barrels.

Extensions and Discoveries

In 2006, extensions
and discoveries increased liquids volumes worldwide
by 107 million barrels for consolidated companies.
Reserves in Nigeria

increased by 27 million barrels due in part to the
initial booking of reserves for the Aparo field.
Additional drilling activities contributed 19 million
barrels in the United Kingdom and 14 million barrels
in Argentina. In the United States, the Gulf of Mexico
added 25 million barrels, mainly the result of the
initial booking of the Great White Field in the
deepwater Perdido Fold Belt area.

Purchases

In 2005, the acquisition of 572 million
barrels of liquids related solely to the acquisition of
Unocal in August. About three-fourths of the 376
million barrels acquired in the international areas
were represented by volumes in Azerbaijan and Thailand.
Most volumes acquired in the United States were in
Texas and Alaska.

In
2006, acquisitions increased liquids volumes
worldwide by 21 million barrels for consolidated
companies and 119 million barrels for equity
affiliates. For consolidated companies, the amount was
mainly the result of new agreements in Nigeria, which
added 13 million barrels of reserves. The
other-equity-affiliates quantity reflects the result of
the conversion of Boscan and LL-652 operations to joint
stock companies in Venezuela.

Sales

In 2004, sales of liquids volumes reduced
reserves of consolidated companies by 179 million
barrels. Sales totaled 130 million barrels in the
United States and 33 million barrels in the “Other”
international region. Sales in the “Other” region of
the United States totaled 103 million barrels, with two
fields accounting for approximately one-half of the
volume. The 27 million barrels sold in the Gulf of
Mexico reflect the sale of a number of Shelf
properties. The “Other” international sales include the
disposal of western Canada properties and several
fields in the United Kingdom. All the sales were
associated with the company’s program to dispose of
assets deemed nonstrategic to the portfolio of
producing properties.

In 2005, sales of 58 million barrels in the
“Other” international area related to the disposition
of the former Unocal operations onshore in Canada.

In 2006, sales decreased reserves by 15 million
barrels due to the conversion of the LL-652 risked
service agreement to a joint stock company in
Venezuela.

Included are year-end reserve quantities related to production-sharing contracts (PSC) (refer
to page E-11 for the definition of a PSC). PSC-related reserve quantities are 47 percent, 44
percent and 33 percent for consolidated companies for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and
100 percent for TCO for each year.


Net reserve changes (excluding production) in
2006 consist of 549 billion cubic
feet of developed reserves and 630 billion cubic feet of undeveloped reserves for consolidated
companies and (769) billion cubic feet of developed reserves and 849 billion cubic feet of
undeveloped reserves for affiliated companies.


During 2005, the percentages of undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2004, transferred
to developed reserves were 5 percent and 2 percent for consolidated companies and affiliated
companies, respectively.

Noteworthy amounts in the categories of
proved-reserve changes for 2004 through 2006 in the
table above are discussed below:

Revisions

In 2004,
revisions increased reserves for consolidated
companies by a net 248 billion cubic feet (BCF),
composed of increases of 928 BCF internationally and
decreases of 680 BCF in the United States.
Internationally, about half of the 346 BCF increase in
Africa related to properties in Nigeria, for which
changes were associated with well performance reviews,
development drilling and lease fuel calculations. The
236 BCF addition in the Asia-Pacific region was
related primarily to reservoir analysis for a single
field. Most of the 325 BCF in the “Other”
international area

was related to a new gas sales contract in Trinidad and
Tobago. In the United States, the net 391 BCF downward
revision in the Gulf of Mexico was related to
well-performance reviews and technical analyses in
several fields. Most of the net 316 BCF negative
revision in the “Other” U.S. area related to two coal
bed methane fields in the Mid-Continent region and
their associated wells’ performance. The 963 BCF
increase for TCO was connected with updated analyses of
reservoir performance and processing plant yields.

In 2005, reserves were revised downward by 14 BCF
for consolidated companies and 498 BCF for equity
affiliates. For consolidated companies, negative
revisions were 428 BCF in the Asia-Pacific region. Most
of the decrease was attribut-

able to one field in Kazakhstan, due mainly to the
effects of higher year-end prices on variable-royalty
provisions of the production-sharing contract. Reserves
additions for consolidated companies totaled 211 BCF
and 243 BCF in Africa and “Other,” respectively. The
majority of the African region changes were in Angola,
due to a revised forecast of fuel gas usage, and in
Nigeria, from improved reservoir performance. The
availability of third-party compression in Colombia
accounted for most of the increase in the “Other”
region. Revisions in the United States decreased
reserves by 9 BCF, as nominal increases in the San
Joaquin Valley were more than offset by decreases in
the Gulf of Mexico and “Other” region. For the TCO
affiliate in Kazakhstan, a reduction of 547 BCF
reflects the updated forecast of future royalties
payable and year-end price effects, partially offset by
volumes added as a result of an updated assessment of
reservoir performance.

In 2006, revisions accounted for a net increase of
481 BCF for consolidated companies and 26 BCF for
affiliates. For consolidated companies, net increases
of 511 BCF internationally were partially offset by a
30 BCF downward
revision in the United States. Drilling and
development activities added 337 BCF of reserves in
Thailand, while Kazakhstan added 200 BCF, largely due
to development activity. Trinidad and Tobago increased
185 BCF, attributable to improved reservoir performance
and a new contract for sales of natural gas. These
additions were partially offset by downward revisions
of 224 BCF in the United Kingdom and 130 BCF in
Australia due to drilling results and reservoir
performance. U.S. “Other” had a downward revision of
102 BCF due to reservoir performance, which was
partially offset by upward revisions of 72 BCF in the
Gulf of Mexico and California related to reservoir
performance and development drilling. TCO had an upward
revision of 26 BCF associated with additional
development activity and updated reservoir performance.

Extensions and Discoveries

In 2004, extensions and
discoveries accounted for an increase of 214 BCF,
reflecting an increase in the United States of 144 BCF,
with 89 BCF added in the “Other” region and 54 BCF
added in the Gulf of Mexico through drilling activities
in a large number of fields.

In 2005, consolidated companies increased
reserves by 370 BCF, including 167 BCF in the United
States and 118 BCF in the Asia-Pacific region. In the
United States, 99 BCF was added in the “Other” region
and 68 BCF in the Gulf of Mexico, primarily due to
drilling activities. The addition in Asia-Pacific
resulted primarily from increased drilling in
Kazakhstan.

In 2006, extensions and discoveries accounted for
an increase of 799 BCF for consolidated companies,
reflecting a 531 BCF increase outside the United States
and a U.S. increase of 268 BCF. Bangladesh added 451
BCF, the result of development activity and field
extensions, and Thailand added 59 BCF, the result of
drilling activities. U.S. “Other” contributed

157 BCF, approximately half of which was related to the
South Texas and the Piceance Basin, and the Gulf of
Mexico added 111 BCF, partly due to the initial booking
of reserves at the Great White field in the deepwater
Perdido Fold Belt area.

Purchases

In 2005, all except 7 BCF of the 5,656
BCF total purchases were associated with the Unocal
acquisition. International reserve acquisitions were
4,488 BCF, with Thailand accounting for about half the
volumes. Other significant volumes were added in
Bangladesh and Myanmar.

In 2006, acquisition of natural gas reserves were
35 BCF for consolidated companies, about evenly divided
between the company’s United States and international
operations. Affiliated companies added 54 BCF of
reserves, the result of conversion of an operating
service agreement to a joint stock company in
Venezuela.

Sales

In 2004, sales for consolidated companies
totaled 547 BCF. Of this total, 436 BCF was in the
United States and 111 BCF in the “Other” international
region. In the United States, “Other” region sales
accounted for 289 BCF, reflecting the disposal of a
large number of smaller properties, including a coal
bed methane field. Gulf of Mexico sales of 147 BCF
reflected the sale of Shelf properties, with four
fields accounting for more than one-third of the total
sales. Sales in the “Other” international region
reflected the disposition of the properties in western
Canada and the United Kingdom.

In 2005, sales of 248 BCF in the “Other”
international region related to the disposition of
former-Unocal’s onshore properties in Canada.

In 2006, sales for consolidated companies
totaled 149 BCF, mostly associated with the
conversion of a risked service agreement to a joint
stock company in Venezuela.

TABLE VI – STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS

RELATED TO PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES

The standardized measure of discounted future
net cash flows, related to the preceding proved oil and
gas reserves, is calculated in accordance with the
requirements of FAS 69. Estimated future cash inflows
from production are computed by applying year-end
prices for oil and gas to year-end quantities of
estimated net proved reserves. Future price changes are
limited to those provided by contractual arrangements
in existence at the end of each reporting year. Future
development and production costs are those estimated
future expenditures necessary to develop and produce
year-end estimated proved reserves based on year-end
cost indices, assuming continuation of year-end
economic conditions, and include estimated costs for
asset retirement obligations. Estimated future income
taxes are calculated by applying appropriate year-end
statutory tax rates. These rates reflect allowable
deductions and tax credits and are applied to estimated
future pretax net cash flows, less the tax basis of
related assets. Discounted future net cash flows are
calculated

using 10 percent midperiod discount factors.
Discounting requires a year-by-year estimate of when
future expenditures will be incurred and when
reserves will be produced.

The information provided does not represent
management’s estimate of the company’s expected future
cash flows or value of proved oil and gas reserves.
Estimates of proved-reserve quantities are imprecise
and change over time as new information becomes
available. Moreover, probable and possible reserves,
which may become proved in the future, are excluded
from the calculations. The arbitrary valuation
prescribed under FAS 69 requires assumptions as to the
timing and amount of future development and production
costs. The calculations are made as of December 31 each
year and should not be relied upon as an indication of
the company’s future cash flows or value of its oil and
gas reserves. In the following table, “Standardized
Measure Net Cash Flows” refers to the standardized
measure of discounted future net cash flows.
