Summary Description of
ChevronTexaco

ChevronTexaco Corporation


, a Delaware
corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries and
affiliates, and provides administrative, financial and
management support to, U.S. and foreign subsidiaries that engage
in fully integrated petroleum operations, chemicals operations,
coal mining, power and energy services. The company operates in
the United States and approximately 180 other countries.
Petroleum operations consist of exploring for, developing and
producing crude oil and natural gas; refining crude oil into
finished petroleum products; marketing crude oil, natural gas
and the many products derived from petroleum; and transporting
crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products by pipelines,
marine vessels, motor equipment and rail car. Chemicals
operations include the manufacture and marketing, by an
affiliate, of commodity petrochemicals and plastics for
industrial uses, and the manufacture and marketing, by a
consolidated subsidiary, of fuel and lubricating oil additives.

In this report, exploration and production of
crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas may be referred
to as “E&P” or “upstream” activities.
Refining, marketing and transportation may be referred to as
“RM&T” or “downstream” activities. A
list of the company’s major subsidiaries is presented on
page E-2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of
December 31, 2001, ChevronTexaco had 55,763 employees
(excluding 11,806 service station employees), down about
1,600 from year-end 2000. Included in this net change between
periods was an addition of about 1,000 employees who had
previously been classified as contractors in certain
international operations. Approximately 32,000, or
47 percent, of the company’s employees, including
service station employees, were employed in
U.S. operations, of which approximately 4,500 were
unionized.

Incorporated
in Delaware in 1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the
company adopted the name Chevron Corporation in 1984 and
ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2001. As used in this report, the
term “ChevronTexaco” and such terms as “the
company,” “the corporation,” “our,”
“we,” and “us” may refer to ChevronTexaco
Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or to
all of them taken as a whole, but unless it is stated otherwise,
does not include “affiliates” of
ChevronTexaco – i.e., those companies accounted for by
the equity method (generally owned 50 percent or less), or
investments accounted for by the cost method. All of these terms
are used for convenience only, and are not intended as a precise
description of any of the separate companies, each of which
manages its own affairs.

Overview of Petroleum
Industry

Petroleum industry operations and profitability
are influenced by many factors, over some of which individual
petroleum companies have little control. Governmental policies,
particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the
environment, have a significant impact on petroleum activities,
regulating where and how companies conduct their operations and
formulate their products and, in some cases, limiting their
profits directly. Prices for crude oil and natural gas,
petroleum products and petrochemicals are determined by supply
and demand for these commodities. The members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) are
typically the world’s swing producers of crude oil, and
their production levels are a major factor in determining
worldwide supply. Demand for crude oil and its products and
natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local,
national and worldwide economies, although weather patterns and
taxation relative to other energy sources also play a
significant part. Natural gas is generally produced and consumed
on a country or regional basis.

Operating Environment

Refer to page FS-2 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion
on the company’s current business environment and outlook.

Texaco Merger Transaction

On October 9, 2001, Texaco Inc. (Texaco)
became a wholly owned subsidiary of Chevron Corporation
(Chevron) pursuant to a merger transaction, and Chevron changed
its name to ChevronTexaco Corporation. The combination was
accounted for as a pooling of interests, and each share of
Texaco common stock was converted on a tax-free basis into the
right to receive 0.77 shares of ChevronTexaco common stock.
In the merger, ChevronTexaco issued approximately
425 million shares of common stock, representing about
40 percent of the outstanding ChevronTexaco common stock
after the merger. Further discussion of the Texaco merger
transaction, including merger-related expenses and synergy
savings, is contained on pages FS-2 and FS-3 of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

ChevronTexaco Strategic
Direction

ChevronTexaco’s primary strategic objective
is to achieve the highest total stockholder return in its peer
group for the five-year period 2000 - 2004. British
Petroleum, ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell are the primary
competition where ChevronTexaco operates and comprise the
company’s competitor peer group. The company had the
highest total stockholder return in its peer group for the
2000 - 2001 period.

As a foundation for attaining this goal, the
company has established four key priorities:

Supporting these four priorities is a continued
and improved focus on:

•

Organizational
	Capability:

The company has developed
	strategies to build capability systems to achieve top
	performance in the four priorities described above.

(b) Description
of Business and Properties

The company’s largest business segments are
exploration and production, and refining, marketing and
transportation. Chemicals is also a significant operation,
conducted mainly by the company’s affiliate –
Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem). The petroleum
activities of the company are

—2—


widely dispersed geographically. The company has
petroleum operations in North America, South America, Europe,
Africa, Middle East, Central and Far East Asia, and Australia.

CPChem has operations in the United States,
Belgium, China, South Korea, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and
Mexico. The company’s wholly owned Oronite additives
business has operations in the United States, France,
Netherlands, Singapore, Japan and Brazil.

An affiliate, Dynegy Inc. (Dynegy), is one of the
leading marketers of energy products and services in the United
States with customers in the United States, Canada, the United
Kingdom (U.K.) and other European countries. Its business
activities include energy marketing; independent power
generation; gathering, processing, selling and transportation of
natural gas and natural gas liquids; and broadband trading.

Tabulations of segment sales and other operating
revenues, earnings, income taxes and assets, by United States
and International geographic areas, for the years 1999 to 2001,
may be found in Note 11 to the consolidated financial
statements beginning on page FS-28 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K. In addition, similar comparative data for the
company’s investments in and income from equity affiliates
and property, plant and equipment are contained in Notes 14
and 15 on pages FS-31 to FS-33.

The company’s worldwide operations can be
affected significantly by changing economic, tax, regulatory and
political environments in the various countries in which it
operates, including the United States. Environmental regulations
and government policies concerning economic development, energy
and taxation may have a significant effect on the company’s
operations. Management evaluates the economic and political risk
of initiating, maintaining or expanding operations in any
geographical area. The company monitors political events
worldwide and the possible threat these may pose to its
activities – particularly the company’s oil and
gas exploration and production operations – and the
safety of the company’s employees.

The company attempts to avoid unnecessary
involvement in partisan politics in the communities in which it
operates, but participates in the political process to safeguard
its assets and to ensure that the community benefits from its
operations and remains receptive to its continued presence.

Capital
and Exploratory Expenditures

A discussion of the company’s capital and
exploratory expenditures is contained on page FS-10 of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Petroleum –
Exploration and Production

Liquids and Natural Gas Production

The following table summarizes the company’s
and affiliates’ net production of crude oil and natural gas
liquids, and natural gas for 2001 and 2000.

Net Production


Of Crude Oil And
Natural Gas Liquids And Natural Gas


Net

In 2001, ChevronTexaco conducted its worldwide
exploration and production operations in the United States and
approximately 25 other countries. Worldwide net crude oil
and natural gas liquids production, including that of affiliates
but excluding volumes produced under operating service
agreements, decreased by about 2 percent from the 2000 levels.
Net worldwide production of natural gas, including affiliates,
fell 1 percent in 2001. Net liquids and natural gas
production in the United States was down about 8 percent
and 7 percent, respectively. The lower production reflected
normal field declines and asset sales, partially offset by new
and enhanced production in the deepwater and other areas of the
Gulf of Mexico. International net liquids production, including
affiliates, increased about 1 percent, while net natural
gas production rose 10 percent from 2000. The increase in
gas production occurred primarily in Trinidad, Canada and the
company’s Tengizchevroil (TCO) affiliate in Kazakhstan.

While worldwide oil-equivalent production in 2001
was down less than 2 percent from 2000 levels, the company has
targeted an oil-equivalent production growth rate over the next
five years of 2.5 to 3 percent annually. However, 2002
production is expected to increase only about 1 percent
because of OPEC-related constraints.

Acreage

At December 31, 2001, the company owned or
had under lease or similar agreements undeveloped and developed
oil and gas properties located throughout the world. The
geographical distribution of the company’s acreage is shown
in the next table.

Acreage


At December 31,

(Thousands of Acres)


Gross acreage includes the total number of acres
	in all tracts in which the company has an interest. Net acreage
	is the sum of the company’s fractional interests in gross
	acreage.


Developed acreage is spaced or assignable to
	productive wells. Undeveloped acreage is acreage where wells
	have not been drilled or completed to permit commercial
	production, and may contain undeveloped proved reserves.

Refer to Table IV on page FS-48 of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K for data about the
company’s average sales price per unit of oil and gas
produced, as well as the average production cost per

—5—


unit for 2001, 2000 and 1999. The following table
summarizes gross and net productive wells at year-end 2001 for
the company and its affiliates.

Productive Oil And Gas Wells At
December 31, 2001


Includes wells producing or capable of producing
	and injection wells temporarily functioning as producing wells.
	Wells that produce both oil and gas are classified as oil wells.


Gross wells include the total number of wells in
	which the company has an interest. Net wells are the sum of the
	company’s fractional interests in gross wells.

Reserves and Contract Obligations

Table V on pages FS-48 and FS-49 of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K sets forth the
company’s net proved oil and gas reserves, by geographic
area, as of December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999. During 2002,
the company will file estimates of oil and gas reserves with the
Department of Energy, Energy Information Agency. Those estimates
are consistent with the reserve data reported on page FS-49
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In 2001, ChevronTexaco’s worldwide oil and
equivalent-gas (BOE) barrels of net proved reserves
additions exceeded production, with a replacement rate of
127 percent of net production, including sales and
acquisitions. Excluding sales and acquisitions, the replacement
rate was 112 percent of net production. In the United
States, the reserves replacement rate was impacted by a
significant downward revision in proved crude oil reserve
quantities for the Midway Sunset Field in California’s San
Joaquin Valley. The revision was the result of a determination
of lower-than-projected oil recovery from the field’s steam

—6—


injection process. The following table summarizes
the company’s net additions to net proved reserves of crude
oil and natural gas liquids and natural gas, compared with net
production during 2001.

Reserves
Replacement – 2001


mmbbls = millions of barrels


bcf = billions of cubic feet


Includes equity in affiliates

The company sells crude oil and natural gas from
its producing operations under a variety of contractual
arrangements. Most contracts generally commit the company to
sell quantities based on production from specified properties
but certain gas sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and
determinable quantities. Dynegy and ChevronTexaco have entered
into long-term strategic alliances whereby Dynegy purchases
substantially all natural gas and natural gas liquids produced
by legacy Chevron in the United States, excluding Alaska, and
supplies natural gas and natural gas liquids feedstocks to the
company’s U.S. refineries and chemical plants. In
March 2002, the company reached agreement with Dynegy to expand
those contracts to include substantially all of legacy
Texaco’s U.S. natural gas and natural gas liquids
production. Outside the United States, the company is
contractually committed to deliver approximately
110 billion cubic feet of natural gas through 2004 from
both Australian and U.K. reserves, and approximately
335 billion cubic feet of natural gas post-2004 through
2020 from Australian reserves only. The company believes it can
satisfy these contracts from quantities available from
production of the company’s proved developed Australian and
U.K. natural gas reserves. Substantially all of the contracts
discussed above include variable-pricing terms.

Development Activities

Details of the company’s development
expenditures and costs of proved property acquisitions for 2001,
2000 and 1999 are presented in Table I on page FS-45 of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The table below summarizes the company’s net
interest in productive and dry development wells completed in
each of the past three years and the status of the
company’s development wells drilling at December 31,
2001. A “development well” is a well drilled within
the proved area of an oil or gas reservoir to the depth of a
stratigraphic horizon known to be productive. “Wells
drilling” include wells temporarily suspended.

Development Well Activity


Indicates the number of wells completed during
	the year regardless of when drilling was initiated. Completion
	refers to the installation of permanent equipment for the
	production of oil or gas or, in the case of a dry well, the
	reporting of abandonment to the appropriate agency.


Gross wells include the total number of wells in
	which the company has an interest. Net wells are the sum of the
	company’s fractional interests in gross wells.

—8—


Exploration Activities

The following table summarizes the company’s
net interests in productive and dry exploratory wells completed
in each of the last three years and the number of exploratory
wells drilling at December 31, 2001.

Exploratory Well Activity


Indicates the number of wells completed during
	the year regardless of when drilling was initiated. Completion
	refers to the installation of permanent equipment for the
	production of oil or gas or, in the case of a dry well, the
	reporting of abandonment to the appropriate agency.


Gross wells include the total number of wells in
	which the company has an interest. Net wells are the sum of the
	company’s fractional interests in gross wells.

“Exploratory wells” are wells drilled
to find and produce oil or gas in unproved areas and include
delineation wells, which are wells drilled to find a new
reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of oil or
gas in another reservoir or to extend a known reservoir beyond
the proved area. “Wells drilling” include wells
temporarily suspended. The company had $783 million of suspended
exploratory wells included in properties, plant and equipment at
year-end 2001, a decrease of $87 million from 2000.
Decreases in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and
Angola were partially offset by increases in Nigeria, Brazil and
China. The wells are suspended pending a final determination of
the commercial potential of the related oil and gas fields. The
ultimate disposition of these well costs is dependent on:
(1) decisions on additional major capital expenditures,
(2) the results of additional exploratory drilling that is
underway or firmly planned, and in some cases, (3) securing
final regulatory approvals for development.

Details of the company’s exploration
expenditures and costs of unproved property acquisitions for
2001, 2000 and 1999 are presented in Table I on
page FS-45 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production
Activities in Key Areas

ChevronTexaco’s 2001 key upstream activities
not discussed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations beginning on page
FS-2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are presented
below. The comments include reference to “net
production,” which excludes partner shares and royalty
interests. “Total production” includes these
components. In addition to the activities discussed,
ChevronTexaco was active in other geographic areas, but these
activities were less significant.

—9—


Consolidated Operations

A) United States

United States exploration and production
activities are concentrated in nearly 850 fields located mainly
in the Gulf of Mexico, Texas, New Mexico, the Rocky Mountains,
California and Alaska.

Gulf of Mexico:

In
the Gulf of Mexico Shelf, the company maintained average net
production rates of 142,000 barrels of oil, 1.237 billion
cubic feet of gas, and 14,200 barrels of natural gas liquids per
day.

In the Gulf of Mexico deepwater, ChevronTexaco
has interests in three significant developments. The company
operates and has a 57 percent interest in Genesis, which
averaged net daily oil-equivalent production of
33,000 barrels during the year. Production began in July
2001 at a second development, Typhoon, in which the company has
a 50 percent interest. Net daily production averaged nearly
18,000 barrels of oil-equivalent during the fourth quarter
2001. ChevronTexaco has a 50 percent interest in a third
deepwater development, Petronius, which averaged net
oil-equivalent production of 27,000 barrels per day during
2001. Exploration programs resulted in discoveries at Trident,
Boris and Blind Faith, and confirmation of the 2000 Champlain
discovery. The Trident appraisal is ongoing.

Mid-Continent/ Permian Basin:

Onshore operations in the
mid-continent United States are located in Utah, Texas, and
Wyoming. Net natural gas production averaged 921 million
cubic feet per day, while net production of crude oil and
natural gas liquids averaged 31,000 barrels per day. Capital
spending was focused on natural gas development and coalbed
methane activity, located in northeast Utah. Permian Basin
operations are located primarily in New Mexico. In 2001, net
daily production averaged 117,500 barrels of crude oil and
natural gas liquids and 275 million cubic feet of natural
gas.

California:

During
2001, average net daily production from the company’s San
Joaquin Valley fields was 245,100 barrels of crude oil,
116 million cubic feet of natural gas and 3,900 barrels of
natural gas liquids. Approximately 210,000 barrels per day of
the crude oil production was heavy oil.

Offshore Florida:

Development of the Destin Dome area of
the Norphlet trend offshore Florida continues to be hampered by
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals. A draft environmental
impact statement was issued in August 1999 by the governing
agencies indicating no significant environmental impacts from
the project. In July 2000, ChevronTexaco and its partners in the
Destin Dome development filed a lawsuit against the federal
government to recover exploration expense and future lost
profits following continuing delays in obtaining the necessary
development permits. The company has filed a motion for summary
judgement, which could decide the liability portion of the case
and leave the amount of damages to be decided later.

B) Africa

Nigeria:

ChevronTexaco’s principal
subsidiary in Nigeria, Chevron Nigeria Limited (CNL), operates
and holds a 40 percent interest in 11 concessions,
predominantly in the swamp and near-offshore regions of the
Niger Delta. CNL operates under a joint venture arrangement with
the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), which owns
the remaining 60 percent interest. ChevronTexaco’s
subsidiaries Chevron Oil Company Nigeria Limited
(COCNL) and Texaco Overseas Nigeria Petroleum Company
Unlimited (TOPCON) each hold a 20 percent interest in
six concessions. TOPCON operates these concessions under a joint
venture agreement with NNPC, which owns the remaining
60 percent interest.

In 2001, daily net production from the 33
CNL-operated fields averaged 143,000 barrels of oil and
2,700 barrels of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). During
2001, net production from the six TOPCON-operated fields
averaged approximately 12,000 barrels of oil per day.

Phase 2 of the Escravos gas project was completed
in the first quarter 2001. As a result, processing capacity at
the plant increased to 285 million cubic feet per day.
Preliminary design for Phase 3, which includes adding a second
gas plant and expanding processing capacity to 680 million
cubic feet per day,

—10—


started in the third quarter of 2001 and is
targeted for completion in 2005. ChevronTexaco holds a
40 percent working interest in the Escravos gas project.

Feasibility engineering and preliminary technical
evaluations have been completed for a proposed gas-to-liquids
(GTL) plant at Escravos. Front-end engineering and design
started in March 2001. The proposed 33,000 barrels-per-day
(12,000 barrels per day net) GTL project is the first to use the
Sasol Chevron Global Joint Venture’s technology and
operational expertise. Project start-up is expected to be in
2005. ChevronTexaco holds a 37.5 percent interest.

Angola:

ChevronTexaco is the largest producer
in Angola and the first to produce in the deepwater. Cabinda
Gulf Oil Company Limited (CABGOC), a wholly owned subsidiary of
ChevronTexaco, is operator of two concessions, Blocks 0 and
14, off the coast of Angola’s Cabinda enclave.
Block 0, in which CABGOC has a 39 percent interest, is
a 2,100-square-mile concession adjacent to the Cabinda
coastline. Block 14, in which CABGOC has a 31 percent
interest, is a 1,560-square-mile deepwater concession located
west of Block 0.

In Block 0, the company operates in 3
areas – A, B and C. Area A, containing 15 fields
currently producing, averaged net production of approximately
96,000 barrels of crude oil per day in 2001. Area B, with
3 fields producing, averaged net production of 32,500
barrels of crude oil per day. Area C averaged net
production of 10,500 barrels of crude oil per day from
7 fields. Major development projects during 2001 included
phase 1 of a waterflood project in Area A and a
production and gas injection platform in the Area B North
Nemba Field.

In Block 14, net production in 2001 from the
Kuito Field, Angola’s first deepwater producing area,
averaged approximately 19,000 barrels of crude oil per day.
Development plans are under way for other fields within the
Block.

Texaco Panama Angola Inc., a subsidiary of
ChevronTexaco, is operator of and has a 20 percent interest
in Block 2, a 160-square-mile concession adjacent to the
northwestern part of Angola’s coast. Average net daily
production from Block 2 was about 7,000 barrels of crude
oil in 2001.

The company operates and has a 40 percent
interest in offshore exploration Blocks, 9 and 22, which
encompass approximately 2,000-square-miles each and are located
south of Luanda, Angola’s capital.

Republic of Congo:

ChevronTexaco has interests in two
license areas, Haute Mer and Kitina/ Sounda, in offshore Congo
and adjacent to the company’s concessions in Cabinda.
ChevronTexaco has a 30 percent interest in the Haute Mer
exploration permit and a 29 percent interest in the Kitina/
Sounda exploitation permits. The company’s interest in the
deepwater Mer Profonde Sud license area was relinquished in
2001. Net production from ChevronTexaco’s concessions in
the Republic of Congo averaged 20,000 barrels per day in 2001.
Field development studies continue for the deepwater Moho and
Bilondo discoveries in Haute Mer. Appraisal drilling was
underway in early 2002.

Chad-Cameroon:

ChevronTexaco is a 25 percent
partner in a project that will develop landlocked oil fields in
southern Chad and transport crude oil by pipeline to the coast
of Cameroon for export to world markets. Project financing was
secured during the second quarter 2001. At the end of 2001, the
overall development project was about one-third complete.
Pipeline construction began in the fourth quarter and drilling
initiated in the first quarter 2002. First production is
expected in 2004.

Equatorial Guinea:

ChevronTexaco is a 65 percent partner and operator of the
L Block offshore the Republic of Equatorial Guinea. The
initial 3D seismic survey was completed in 2001 and is presently
being analyzed.

C) Asia-Pacific

Indonesia:

ChevronTexaco’s interests in
Indonesia are managed by two wholly owned subsidiaries,
PT Caltex Pacific Indonesia (CPI) and Amoseas
Indonesia (AI). CPI accounts for approximately 50 percent
of Indonesia’s total crude oil output and holds an interest
in six production-sharing contracts. AI is a power generation
company that operates the Darajat geothermal contract area in
West Java and a

cogeneration facility in support of CPI’s
operation in North Duri. ChevronTexaco’s net share of
production during 2001 averaged about 320,000 barrels of crude
oil and condensate per day. CPI continues to implement enhanced
oil recovery projects to extract more oil from its existing
reservoirs. The Duri Field in the Rokan Block, under steamflood
since 1985, is the largest steamflood project in the world.
Currently 9 of 13 areas are under steam injection, with
total production averaging about 260,000 barrels of oil per day
during 2001. Area 10 is currently under development and
will be placed on injection in the second quarter of 2002. CPI
was awarded a new production-sharing contract for the Kisaran
Block in 2001. The block is located in a gas prospective basin
adjacent to the Rokan Block. A seismic review is planned for
2002.

Thailand:

The
company operates Block B8/32 in the Gulf of Thailand with a
52 percent interest. The company holds a 33 percent
interest in adjacent exploration Blocks 7, 8 and 9, which are
currently inactive pending resolution of border issues between
Thailand and Cambodia. Block B8/32 produces oil and natural gas
from three fields: Tantawan, Maliwan, and Benchamas. Initial
production from the Maliwan Field occurred in October 2001. Net
average daily production during 2001 from the company’s
interests in Thailand was 75 million cubic feet of natural
gas and 16,000 barrels of crude oil. In 2002, the Benchamas
Field will go through a major processing upgrade to bring total
field production levels up to 60,000 barrels of oil per
day. Development of the Maliwan Field will continue with
production from multiple platforms expected to begin in 2005.
Nine of the 11 exploration wells drilled in 2001 were
successful, extending the productive areas in Block B8/32
significantly. During 2002, an exploration program is planned to
evaluate the remaining portions of the concession.

Australia:

ChevronTexaco has a one-sixth interest
in the North West Shelf (NWS) Project in offshore Western
Australia. Average daily net production from the NWS Project
during 2001 was 230 million cubic feet of natural gas and
16,000 barrels per day of condensate. Net crude oil
production from the NWS Project averaged approximately
17,000 barrels per day and total LPG production averaged
about 4,000 barrels per day. Approximately 68 percent
of the natural gas was sold, primarily under long-term
contracts, in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to
major utilities in Japan. The remaining gas was sold to the
Western Australia domestic gas market. In 2001, ChevronTexaco
approved the development of the Train 4 LNG expansion
project, which is planned to increase LNG capacity by about
50 percent in 2004. The North West Shelf Venture LNG
sellers have secured LNG Sales and Purchase Agreements and
Letters of Intent with several Japanese customers, for a total
volume equal to the capacity of the new LNG Train.

The company is operator and has a 57 percent
interest in the undeveloped Gorgon area gas field offshore
north-west Australia. ChevronTexaco is actively pursuing
long-term gas sales from Gorgon to Australian industrial
customers and in international LNG markets including China,
Korea, and the west coast of North America.

Philippines:

ChevronTexaco holds a 45 percent
interest in the Malampaya gas field located about 50 miles
offshore of the Palawan Island. The Malampaya gas-to-power
project represents the first offshore production of natural gas
in the Philippines. In September 2001 production commenced. The
gas will be delivered to three power plants under Gas Sales and
Purchase Agreements. Gas sales are projected to increase
throughout 2002 as the power plants are commissioned and brought
into commercial operation.

Middle East:

ChevronTexaco holds a concession with
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to produce onshore crude oil from
the Partitioned Neutral Zone (PNZ). The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
and the State of Kuwait each own 50 percent of the
hydrocarbon resources. ChevronTexaco is entitled to
50 percent of the gross field production, for which it pays
a royalty and other taxes to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. During
2001, record production was achieved from the four producing
fields – averaging 144,000 net barrels of crude oil
per day. Planned development drilling, workover, and facilities
enhancement programs during the next few years are expected to
maintain production at similar levels. The company also has
exploration agreements in Bahrain and Qatar.

Caspian Region:

The
company holds a 20 percent equity interest in the
Karachaganak Field located in northwest Kazakhstan. Net daily
production for 2001 was 14,300 barrels of condensate and
67 million cubic feet of gas from the existing production
facilities. The current phase of the Karachaganak

—12—


development includes the building of processing
and liquid export facilities to be completed by the end of 2003.

D)     Other
International Areas

Europe:

The company
holds producing interests in 24 fields in Denmark, Norway and
the United Kingdom. The combined net average daily production
during 2001 was 171,000 barrels of crude oil and condensate and
454 million cubic feet of natural gas. The Alba Field in
the United Kingdom North Sea, where ChevronTexaco is operator
and holds a 21 percent equity interest, produced a net
average of 17,000 net barrels of crude oil and 2.8 million
cubic feet of natural gas per day. Development of the Alba
Extreme South project, which is expected to begin production in
late 2002, will maintain the Alba Field’s total production
of 80,000 barrels of crude oil per day. ChevronTexaco holds an
approximate 32 percent interest in the Britannia Field and
shares operatorship. Net production averaged 9,600 barrels of
crude oil and condensate per day and 208 million cubic feet
of natural gas per day. The Captain Field net daily production
averaged 49,000 barrels of crude oil during 2001. ChevronTexaco
is operator and holds an 85 percent interest.

In Denmark, ChevronTexaco holds a 15 percent
interest in the Danish Underground Consortium
(DUC) currently producing crude oil and natural gas from 14
fields in the Danish North Sea. The DUC also holds nine
exploration licenses with company interests ranging from 12 to
27 percent.

Canada:

Total
production from the Hibernia Field offshore Newfoundland, in
which ChevronTexaco holds an interest of about 27 percent,
averaged approximately 151,000 barrels of crude oil per day.
Average net daily production from the company’s onshore
Canadian operations was 52,000 barrels of oil equivalent during
2001.

Venezuela:

The
company operates the onshore Boscan Field, located near the city
of Maracaibo, under an Operating Services Agreement and receives
operating expense reimbursement and capital recovery, plus
interest and an incentive fee. Development drilling continued in
2001. Boscan crude oil production, subject to Venezuela’s
OPEC production restrictions, averaged 104,800 barrels per day
during 2001. The company is also the operator and has a
27 percent interest in the LL-652 Field in Lake Maracaibo.
Net production from LL-652 during 2001 averaged 4,900 barrels of
oil per day, up from 4,000 barrels of oil per day in 2000. Field
performance during 2001 indicated slower than anticipated
re-pressurization of the reservoir by water injection and a
reduction in the projected volumes of crude oil recoverable
during the company’s remaining contract period of
operations. As a result the company wrote down proved crude oil
reserve quantities at LL-652 in 2001.

Argentina:

ChevronTexaco operates in Argentina as
Chevron San Jorge S.R.L. Chevron San Jorge holds more than
6.1 million exploration and production acres in the
Neuquén and Austral basins of Argentina, with working
interest shares ranging from 18 to 100 percent in operated
license areas. In addition, the company holds a 14 percent
interest in Oleoductos del Valle S.A. (Oldeval), a major oil
export pipeline from the Neuquén producing area to the
Atlantic coast. Daily net production during 2001 in the
Neuquén and Austral areas averaged over 66,000 net barrels
of oil-equivalent, an increase of over 11 percent from 2000
production levels.

Brazil:

ChevronTexaco holds working interests
ranging from 20 to 50 percent in nine deepwater blocks
offshore Brazil totaling approximately 9.2 million acres.
Deepwater exploration is concentrated in the Campos, Santos, and
Espirito Santo basins. During 2001, the company drilled two
successful appraisal wells in the Frade Field in Block BC-4 of
the Campos Basin. ChevronTexaco’s interest in the Frade
Block is approximately 43 percent. In the non-operated
Block BS-4, where ChevronTexaco holds a 20 percent
interest, two exploratory wells were drilled during 2001. One
well resulted in a discovery.

Affiliate operations

Caspian Region:

The
Tengizchevroil (TCO) partnership, formed in 1993, includes
the Tengiz and Korolev oil fields located in western Kazakhstan.
In January 2001, the company acquired an additional

—13—


5 percent stake in TCO, increasing its
ownership interest to 50 percent. In 2001, total crude oil
production from TCO increased for the eighth consecutive year,
averaging 268,000 barrels of oil per day. Engineering for
TCO’s next major expansion, expected to come on-line during
2005, is under way. Production at Korolev, located near Tengiz,
began in November 2001. Crude oil from the field is very similar
to crude produced from Tengiz and is routed to existing
facilities at TCO through an extension of an existing gathering
system.

Venezuela:

ChevronTexaco has a 30 percent
interest in the Hamaca integrated oil production and upgrading
project located in Venezuela’s Orinoco Belt. Development
drilling and major facility construction at Hamaca continued
throughout 2001. Early production was established in October
2001, at a net rate of 9,000 barrels of crude oil per day. At
the completion of the crude oil upgrading facilities in the
first half of 2004, field production will increase to 190,000
barrels of crude oil per day and will be lighter, high-value
crude.

Petroleum –
Natural Gas Liquids

The company sells natural gas liquids from its
producing operations under a variety of contractual
arrangements. In the United States, the majority of sales are to
the company’s affiliate, Dynegy. Dynegy and ChevronTexaco
have entered into long-term strategic alliances whereby Dynegy
purchases substantially all natural gas and natural gas liquids
produced by legacy Chevron in the United States, excluding
Alaska, and supplies natural gas and natural gas liquids
feedstocks to the company’s U.S. refineries and chemical
plants. In March 2002, the company reached agreement with Dynegy
to expand those contracts to include substantially all of legacy
Texaco’s U.S. natural gas and natural gas liquids
production. Outside the United States, natural gas liquids sales
take place in the company’s Canadian upstream operations,
with lower sales levels in Africa, Australia and Europe.

Refer to “Selected Operating Data” on
page FS-7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K in
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations for further information on the
company’s natural gas liquids sales volumes.

Petroleum –
Refining

Distillation operating capacity utilization in
2001, adjusted for sales and closures, averaged 88 percent
in the United States (including asphalt plants) and
87 percent worldwide (including affiliates), compared with
88 percent in the United States and worldwide in the prior
year. ChevronTexaco’s capacity utilization at its
U.S. fuels refineries averaged 90 percent in 2001,
compared with 91 percent in 2000. ChevronTexaco’s
capacity utilization of its wholly-owned U.S. cracking and
coking facilities, which are the primary facilities used to
convert heavier products to gasoline and other light products,
averaged 84 percent in 2001, up from 80 percent in the year
earlier. The company processed imported and domestic crude oil
in its U.S. refining operations. Imported crude oil accounted
for 68 percent of ChevronTexaco’s U.S. refinery inputs
in 2001.

Prior to October 2001, the company had interests
in eight U.S. refineries with a combined capacity of about 1.3
million barrels per day through its investments in the Equilon
and Motiva affiliates. These investments were placed in trust in
October 2001, and sold, as required by the U.S. Federal
Trade Commission, in February 2002.

In the United States, the company supplies,
directly or through dealers and jobbers, more than 8,200 motor
vehicle retail outlets, of which about 1,300 are company-owned
or -leased stations. The company’s gasoline market area is
concentrated in the southern, southwestern and western states.
According to the

Lundberg Share of Market Report,

ChevronTexaco ranks among the top three gasoline marketers in 16
states. The company’s former affiliates, Equilon and
Motiva, operated through approximately 22,000 retail outlets in
the United States. ChevronTexaco sold its investments in Equilon
and Motiva in February 2002.

In Canada – primarily British
Columbia – the company’s branded products are
sold in approximately 170 stations (mainly owned or leased).

ChevronTexaco operates a network of over 8,000
service stations and 650 convenience stores in more than
30 countries that cover the Asia-Pacific region, Southern
and East Africa, and the Middle East. ChevronTexaco will
continue to use the Caltex brand name in these areas.

In Europe, the company has marketing operations
in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg
and the Scandinavian countries. In West Africa, the company
operates in Cameroon, the

—16—


Canary Islands, Cote d’Ivoire, Nigeria, Togo
and Benin. In these regions, the company mainly uses the Texaco
brand name.

ChevronTexaco operates in approximately
40 countries across the Caribbean, Central America, and
South America, with a significant presence in Brazil. In this
region, the company uses the Texaco brand name.

In addition to the above activities, the company
manages other marketing businesses globally. In global aviation
fuel marketing, the company markets more than
400,000 barrels per day of aviation fuel in about
75 countries, representing a worldwide market share of
about 12 percent. The company is the leading marketer of
jet fuels in North America and ranks third in the Asia-Pacific
region, Latin America, and the Caribbean. ChevronTexaco markets
residual fuel oils and marine lubricants in over
100 countries, and motor lubricants in nearly
200 countries.

Petroleum – Transportation

Pipelines:

ChevronTexaco owns and operates an
extensive system of crude oil, refined products, chemicals,
natural gas liquids and natural gas pipelines in the United
States. The company also has direct or indirect interests in
other U.S. and international pipelines. The company’s
ownership interests in pipelines are summarized in the following
table:

Pipeline Mileage At December 31,


Reflects equity interest in pipelines, except for
	those owned by Dynegy Inc.


Includes gathering lines related to the
	transportation function. Excludes gathering lines related to the
	U.S. and international production activities.

The Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) was
formed to build a crude oil export pipeline from the Tengiz
Field to the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk. The company
has a 15 percent ownership interest in CPC. The first
delivery of Tengizchevroil crude oil from the CPC terminal
occurred in October 2001. When the construction project,
including the pipeline, pump stations and terminal, is
essentially complete, by the second quarter of 2002, the CPC
system capacity will be 600,000 barrels of oil per day.
Additional capacity will be possible with additional pump
stations and tankage.

—17—


Tankers:

ChevronTexaco’s controlled
seagoing fleet at December 31, 2001, is summarized in the
following table. All controlled tankers were utilized in 2001.
In addition, at any given time, the company has 30 to 40 vessels
under charter on a term or voyage basis.

Controlled Tankers At December 31,

Federal law requires that cargo transported
between U.S. ports be carried in ships built and registered
in the United States, owned and operated by U.S. entities and
manned by U.S. crews. At year-end 2001, the company’s
U.S. flag fleet was engaged primarily in transporting crude
oil from Alaska to refineries on the West Coast and Hawaii,
refined products between the Gulf Coast and East Coast, and
refined products from California refineries to terminals on the
West Coast, Alaska and Hawaii.

The Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 requires
the scheduled phase-out, by year-end 2010, of all single hull
tankers trading to U.S. ports or transferring cargo in
waters within the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone. This has
resulted in the utilization of more costly double-hull tankers.
By the end of 2001, ChevronTexaco was operating a total of
16 double-hull tankers. ChevronTexaco expects to take
delivery of two additional double-hull tankers in 2003, also to
be operated under long-term bareboat charters. The company is a
member of many oil-spill response cooperatives in areas in which
it operates around the world.

At year-end 2001, two of the company’s
controlled international flag vessels continued to be used as
floating storage vessels in its upstream operations offshore
Cabinda Province, Angola. The remaining international flag
vessels were engaged primarily in transporting crude oil from
the Middle East, Indonesia, Mexico and West Africa to ports in
the United States, Europe, and Asia. Refined products also were
transported by tanker worldwide.

Energy
Marketing and Services – Dynegy

ChevronTexaco owns an approximate 26 percent
equity share of Dynegy Inc. (Dynegy), which is one of the
world’s leading energy merchants. Dynegy reported record
net income of $648 million in 2001, a 29 percent
increase compared with 2000. ChevronTexaco invested a total of
$1.7 billion in Dynegy in 2001 and January 2002.
Dynegy’s equity market value at December 31, 2001, was
$8.6 billion. Through a global physical network of assets
and marketing, logistics and risk management capabilities,
Dynegy provides energy and communications solutions to customers
in North America, the United Kingdom and continental Europe.
Dynegy’s activity extends across the entire convergence
value chain, from power generation, wholesale and direct
commercial and industrial marketing and trading of power,
natural gas, coal, emission allowances, weather derivatives, and
broadband to transportation, gathering and processing of natural
gas liquids.

Dynegy is one of the leading natural gas
marketers in North America, with sales of more than
13 billion cubic feet per day, and a leading natural gas
liquids marketer, with worldwide sales in excess of 557,000
barrels per day. Dynegy is also one of the largest processors of
natural gas in North America, with production of more than
84,000 barrels of natural gas liquids per day. As of
January 1, 2002, Dynegy

—18—


operates or controls 19,100 gross megawatts of
power generation capacity and plans to add over 1,400 gross
megawatts in 2002.

Dynegy and ChevronTexaco formed a long-term
strategic alliance in 1996 whereby Dynegy purchases essentially
all natural gas and natural gas liquids produced or controlled
by the legacy Chevron operations in the United States (excluding
Alaska) and supplies natural gas and natural gas liquids
feedstocks to most of ChevronTexaco’s U.S. refineries and
chemical plants. In March 2002, the company reached agreement
with Dynegy to expand those contracts to include substantially
all of legacy Texaco’s undedicated U.S. natural gas and
natural gas liquids production.

Chemicals

Chevron Phillips Chemical Company (CPChem) is a
50-50 joint venture with Phillips Petroleum Company formed in
July 2000, when both companies combined most of their
petrochemicals operations. CPChem owns or has joint venture
interests in 34 manufacturing facilities and five research and
technical centers in the United States, Puerto Rico, Belgium,
China, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and South Korea.

In December 2001, commercial production of
K-Resin resumed with the completion of Phase I of the
rebuild at the Houston Chemical Complex, shut down since an
explosion and fire that occurred in March 2000. Restoration of
the remaining K-Resin capacity will be completed in 2002,
bringing annual production capacity to 335 million pounds.

An olefins and polyolefins complex in Qatar is
under construction and expected to start production in late
2002. Annual production capabilities at the complex include
1.1 billion pounds of ethylene, 1 billion pounds of
polyethylene, and 100 million pounds of hexene-1. The
complex is owned and will be operated by Qatar Chemical Company,
Ltd. a joint venture between CPChem, with a 49 percent
interest, and Qatar General Petroleum, which owns the remaining
51 percent.

A 50-50 joint venture with BP Solvay to build a
new high-density polyethylene (HDPE) facility at a CPChem
site in the Houston area is on track for start-up in late 2002.
The jointly owned 700-million-pounds-per-year HDPE facility will
be the largest of its kind in the world and will use CPChem
proprietary manufacturing technology.

ChevronTexaco retained its “Oronite”
fuel and lubricant additives business. Oronite is a leading
developer, manufacturer and marketer of performance additives
for fuels and lubricating oils. The company owns and operates
five manufacturing facilities in the United States, France,
Singapore, Japan and Brazil and has equity interests in
facilities in India and Mexico.

Coal

The company’s coal mining and marketing
subsidiary, The Pittsburg & Midway Coal Mining Co.
(P&M), owned and operated two surface mines and one
underground mine at year-end 2001. P&M also owns an
approximate 30 percent interest in Inter-American Coal
Holding N.V., which has interests in mining operations in
Venezuela.

Sales and other operating revenues in 2001 were
$353 million, an increase of 19 percent from 2000.
Sales of coal from P&M’s wholly owned mines and from
its affiliates were 16.2 million tons, an increase of
17 percent from 2000. At year-end 2001, P&M controlled
approximately 196 million tons of developed and undeveloped
coal reserves, including significant reserves of environmentally
desirable low-sulfur fuel.

Other Activities – Synthetic Crude
	Oil

In Canada, ChevronTexaco has a 20 percent
interest in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project. The project is
expected to begin bitumen production in late 2002 and reach
155,000 barrels of bitumen per day at peak production. The
bitumen will be upgraded into high quality synthetic oil using
hydroprocessing technology at a synthetic crude unit, which will
start up by late 2002 or early 2003.

—19—


Power and Gasification

ChevronTexaco participates in its power and
gasification business through ownership, equity investments with
others and licensing of proprietary technology. The
company’s electrical power business includes conventional
power generation projects, as well as cogeneration facilities.
Cogeneration produces thermal energy, such as steam, and
electric power. ChevronTexaco has used steam produced in
cogeneration in its upstream operations in onshore California
and Indonesia. ChevronTexaco uses its proprietary gasification
technology to convert a wide variety of hydrocarbon feedstocks
into a clean synthesis gas. The synthetic gas can be used to
generate electricity in low-emission power plants. ChevronTexaco
licenses this technology, operates owned gasification facilities
and invests in projects using the technology. With licenses and
partners, the company has interests in over 70 gasification
facilities operating or being developed worldwide.

Research and Technology

The company’s core hydrocarbon technology
efforts support the upstream, downstream and power and
gasification businesses, aimed at developing and applying these
technologies to create increased value. These activities include
heavy oil recovery and upgrading, deepwater exploration and
production, shallow water production operations, gas-to-liquids
processing, hydrocarbon gasification to power, and new and
improved refinery processes.

Additionally, ChevronTexaco’s Technology
Ventures Company focuses upon the identification, growth, and
commercialization of emerging technologies for new energy
applications. The range of business spans early-stage venture
capital investing in emerging technologies to developing joint
venture companies in new energy systems such as advanced
batteries for distributed power and transportation systems, fuel
cells and hydrogen fuel storage.

The company is building an information technology
infrastructure encompassing computing, data management,
security, and connectivity of partners, suppliers, and
employees. The architecture, known as “Net Ready,” is
designed to provide the foundation for the company to rapidly
integrate advances in computing and network-based technology.

ChevronTexaco’s research and development
expenses were $209 million, $211 million and
$226 million for the years 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.

Because some of the investments the company makes
in the areas described above are in new or unproven technologies
and business processes, ultimate success is not always certain.
Although not all initiatives may prove to be economically
viable, the company’s overall investment in this area is
not significant to the company’s consolidated financial
position.

Environmental Protection

Virtually all aspects of the company’s
businesses are subject to various federal, state and local
environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These
regulatory requirements continue to change and increase in both
number and complexity, and govern not only the manner in which
the company conducts its operations, but also the products it
sells. ChevronTexaco expects more environmental-related
regulations in the countries where it has operations. Most of
the costs of complying with the myriad laws and regulations
pertaining to its operations are embedded in the normal costs of
conducting its business.

In 2001, the company’s U.S. capitalized
environmental expenditures were $220 million, representing
approximately 4 percent of the company’s total
consolidated U.S. capital and exploratory expenditures.
These environmental expenditures include capital outlays to
retrofit existing facilities, as well as those associated with
new facilities. The expenditures are predominantly in the
petroleum segment and relate mostly to air and water quality
projects and activities at the company’s refineries, oil
and gas producing facilities and marketing facilities. For 2002,
the company estimates U.S. capital expenditures for
environmental control facilities will be $370 million. The
future annual capital costs of fulfilling this

—20—


commitment are uncertain and will be governed by
several factors, including future changes to regulatory
requirements.

Further information on environmental matters and
their impact on ChevronTexaco, and the company’s 2001
environmental expenditures, remediation provisions and year-end
environmental reserves are contained in Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations on pages FS-10 and FS-11 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

and Results of Operations

TEXACO MERGER TRANSACTION

On October 9, 2001, Texaco Inc. (Texaco) became a wholly
owned subsidiary of Chevron Corporation (Chevron) pursuant
to a merger transaction, and Chevron changed its name to
ChevronTexaco Corporation. The combination was accounted
for as a pooling of interests, and each share of Texaco common
stock was converted on a tax-free basis into the right to receive
0.77 shares of ChevronTexaco common stock. In the merger,
ChevronTexaco issued approximately 425 million shares of
common stock, representing about 40 percent of the outstanding
ChevronTexaco common stock after the merger.

In accordance with pooling-of-interests accounting, the
accompanying audited consolidated financial statements give
retroactive effect to the merger, with all periods presented as
if Chevron and Texaco had always been combined.

As a result of the merger, the accounts of certain operations
that were jointly owned by the combining companies are consolidated
in the accompanying financial statements. These operations
are primarily those of the Caltex Group of Companies, which was
previously owned 50 percent each by Chevron and Texaco.

KEY FINANCIAL RESULTS

*

Chevron divided pre-merger.

ChevronTexaco’s net income of $3.288 billion was down
significantly from 2000 but was slightly higher than 1999. Net
income for 2001 included net charges of $1.743 billion for special
items and $1.779 billion for merger effects, for a combined
total of $3.522 billion. Special items included asset write-downs
of $1.709 billion, primarily for exploration and production
(upstream) properties as a result of downward revisions in estimated
proved crude oil reserves. Merger effects represented
merger-related expenses of $1.136 billion and net losses on
merger-related asset dispositions of $643 million. In 2000 and
1999, net special charges were $378 million and $191 million,
respectively.

Net income and special items for the individual business
segments are discussed in the Results of Operations section
beginning on page FS-4.

NET INCOME BY MAJOR OPERATING AREA


EARNINGS BY MAJOR OPERATING AREA, EXCLUDING SPECIAL ITEMS AND

MERGER EFFECTS


BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND OUTLOOK

ChevronTexaco’s overall operating earnings depend largely on the
profitability of its upstream – exploration and production – and
downstream – refining, marketing and transportation – businesses.

Upstream operating earnings align most closely with
industry price levels for crude oil and natural gas. The decline
in the company’s upstream operating earnings during 2001
tracked the downward slide in prices for these commodities.
The price trend for crude oil was largely caused by reduced
demand in weakened economies worldwide and the relative
oversupply by OPEC and certain other oil-producing countries.

FS-2


The average spot price during 2001 for West Texas Intermediate
(WTI), a benchmark crude oil, was about $26 per barrel – down
from an average of about $30 in 2000 – and ended the year
under $20. A similar trend existed for certain natural gas prices,
which are more sensitive to regional supply-demand balances.
In the United States, the company’s average natural gas sales
realization started 2001 at about $10.00 per thousand cubic feet.
By the end of the year, the average realization had dropped
below $3.00. Into early 2002, the WTI crude oil price moved
above $20 per barrel, but the company’s U.S. average natural gas
realization remained below $3.00 per thousand cubic feet. Earnings
during 2001 were also dampened by slightly lower oil-equivalent
production – down less than 2 percent from 2000
levels. However, the company anticipates an oil-equivalent production
growth rate over the next five years of 2.5 to 3 percent
annually, although 2002 production is expected to increase only
about 1 percent because of OPEC-related constraints.

Downstream operating earnings are most closely tied to
refining and marketing margins, which can vary among the geographic
areas in which the company operates. Although world-wide
demand for refined products weakened overall during
2001,margins fluctuated on regional supply-demand balances.
For example, margins improved in North America over the
prior year and sales volumes increased for all higher-value products.
Margins also improved in most of the Asia, Middle East
and eastern Africa operating areas. However, in Europe, Latin
America and certain western African countries, changes in
product prices were not able to keep pace with feedstock costs,
and margins suffered. Early in 2002, profitability was weak in all
geographic areas and is not expected to rebound in earnest until
the world economies and product demand improve.

The company’s chemical segment was not profitable during
2001, and significant improvement for certain commodity
chemicals is not expected until demand more closely matches
industry capacity.

MERGER EFFECTS

Within 18 months of the merger, ChevronTexaco expects to
realize pre-tax savings of approximately $1.8 billion annually
through operating efficiencies and the elimination of redundant
facilities and operations.

Significant one-time expenses are being incurred in connection
with the merger. Total before-tax merger-related
expenses, from the time of the merger announcement in October
2000 through the end of 2003, are estimated at $2 billion.
Major expenses include employee severance payments; incremental
pension and medical plan costs associated with work-force
reductions; legal, accounting, SEC filing and investment
banker fees; employee and office relocations; and costs for the
elimination of redundant facilities and operations. During 2001,
$1.563 billion of before-tax ($1.136 billion after tax) merger-related
expenses were recorded. Included were accruals of $891
million for employee termination benefits for approximately
4,500 employees, and other merger-related expenses that will
not benefit future operations. Payments against the accruals
were $105 million. Approximately 1,400 employees were terminated
after the merger during 2001. The year-end 2001 accrual
balance of $786 million is expected to be nearly extinguished by
early 2003, as certain terminating employees are eligible to delay
separation payments for one year or more.

As a condition of approving the merger, the U.S. Federal
Trade Commission (FTC) required the disposition of certain
Texaco assets, including investments in Equilon and Motiva –
joint ventures engaged in U.S. refining, marketing and transportation
businesses. The interests in these joint ventures were
placed in trust at the time of the merger, and ChevronTexaco
no longer exercised control over the joint ventures. Accordingly,
the method of accounting for these investments was changed in
the fourth quarter 2001 from equity to cost basis. Based on the
terms of the sale that closed in February 2002, the company
recorded an after-tax charge of $564 million in 2001 for the
anticipated loss. Cash proceeds from the sale received in 2002
were $2.2 billion. Indemnification by ChevronTexaco against
certain Equilon and Motiva contingent liabilities at the date of
sale are discussed in the “On- and off-balance-sheet arrangements”
section on page FS-8.

Additional after-tax charges of $79 million were recorded
in 2001 for other merger-related asset dispositions, which are
expected to result in proceeds of approximately $75 million.
Including the loss for the Equilon and Motiva sale, total charges
for merger-related asset dispositions of $643 million were
recorded in 2001 and classified as an “Extraordinary item” on
the Consolidated Statement of Income in accordance with pooling-of-interests reporting requirements of
Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 16, “Business Combinations.”
The net book value of these asset sales that were not completed
at year-end 2001 was $2.181 billion and was classified as “Assets
held for sale – merger related” in the “Current Assets” section of
the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Net income during 2001 for all
merger-related assets that are being sold was approximately
$375 million.

OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS AND DEVELOPMENTS

Key operating highlights and events during 2001 and early
2002 included:

Worldwide oil and gas reserves

The company added approximately
1.2 billion barrels of oil-equivalent reserves during 2001.
These additions equated to 127 percent of production for the
year. Included were slightly more than 100 million barrels each
for the Tengiz Field in Kazakhstan and the Hamaca project in
Venezuela as a result of drilling activities. Almost 200 million
oil-equivalent barrels were added for natural gas reserves for
several fields in Nigeria. About 160 million barrels of the additions
during the year were the result of successful discoveries in
areas that included Latin America, the North Sea and West
Africa. Also, approximately 175 million equivalent-barrels were
acquired early in 2001 through the purchase of an additional 5
percent interest in Tengizchevroil, the company’s 50 percent-owned
affiliate in Kazakhstan that operates the Tengiz and
Korolev fields.

Angola

Approximately 30,000 barrels per day of total crude
oil production began at the company-operated Phase 1C development
in the deepwater Kuito Field in Block 14, where the
company holds a 31 percent interest. In Block 0, the North
Nemba production and gas injection platform was installed in
March 2001. At year-end, total oil production exceeded 30,000
barrels per day. Continuation of the North Nemba development
program in 2002 will result in average production of about
40,000 barrels per day. The company is the operator and holds a
39 percent interest.

FS-3


Nigeria

The Escravos Gas Project successfully completed
Phase 2 development in 2001, increasing processing capacity to
285 million cubic feet of gas per day. Upon completion of Phase
3 in 2005,capacity is expected to increase
to 680 million cubic feet per day. The company holds a 40 percent working
interest in the Escravos project. Front-end engineering and design started in
March 2001 on the gas-to-liquids project at Escravos. This is the first project
to use the Sasol Chevron Global Joint Venture technologies. The company holds a
38 percent interest in the project.

Chad-Cameroon

The Doba oil field development — a $3.5 billion
project, including a 650-mile pipeline — reached one-third completion at the end
of 2001. Initial total production of 225,000 barrels of crude oil per day is
expected in 2004. The company holds a 25 percent interest in the project.

Kazakhstan

Tengizchevroil (TCO) increased its total production
for the eighth straight year, averaging 268,000 barrels per
day of crude oil. Engineering for the next major expansion is
under way and it is expected to come on line in 2005. The company
holds a 50 percent interest in TCO. In October, the first
tankers were loaded with crude oil from the Caspian Pipeline
Consortium (CPC) facilities near the Black Sea port of
Novorossiysk. CPC’s pipeline connects the Tengiz Field in western
Kazakhstan to Novorossiysk, enabling full access to world
market prices for Tengiz oil, and greatly reduces transportation
costs. CPC is owned 15 percent by ChevronTexaco.

U.K. North Sea

In December 2001, ChevronTexaco received
government approval to develop the company-operated Alba
Extreme South and Caledonia projects in the North Sea. Both
are located in the company’s central North Sea core area, which
includes the producing Alba and Britannia fields. frFirst oil production
from the Alba Extreme South project is scheduled for the
fourth quarter 2002 and will help maintain Alba’s total field production
at about 80,000 barrels of crude oil per day. Chevron-Texaco
operates the field and holds a 21 percent ownership. First
oil from Caledonia is expected late in the third quarter of 2002,
and peak field production is anticipated at about 13,000 barrels
per day. The company holds a 27 percent interest.

Philippines

Gas production commenced in October from
the Malampaya Field offshore the Philippine island of Palawan.
ChevronTexaco has a 45 percent interest in the landmark gas-to-power
project – the largest single foreign investment and the
first-ever offshore production of natural gas in the Philippines.

Australia

The company made two significant natural gas
discoveries offshore Western Australia. Both are located in permit
area WA-267-P, where the company operates and holds a 50
percent interest. During 2001, the company approved development
of the $1.6 billion LNG expansion project by the North
West Shelf venture. A mid-2004 start-up will increase gross
liquefied natural gas capacity by about 50 percent. The company
holds a one-sixth interest.

China

During 2001, an average of about 18,000 barrels per
day total of low-sulfur crude oil is being produced after an
October start-up at the QHD 32-6 Field in China’s Bohai Bay
where ChevronTexaco holds a 24.5 percent interest.

Bangladesh

In April 2001, ChevronTexaco was awarded a 60
percent interest in the 1.7 million-acre onshore tract, Block 9, in
Bangladesh, east of Dhaka. Block 9 surrounds the Bakhrabad
gas field and is adjacent to other major gas-producing areas.
Seismic studies are planned in 2002 with initial drilling to commence
in late 2002 or early 2003.

Venezuela

The company holds a 30 percent interest in the
Hamaca integrated oil project, located in Venezuela’s Orinoco
Belt. Early production was established during October 2001.After
completion of crude oil upgrading facilities in 2004, Hamaca total
production is expected to increase to 190,000 barrels per day.

U.S. Gulf of Mexico

Typhoon, a deepwater development project,
was completed below budget and production commenced in
July 2001, two months ahead of schedule. Daily total production
averaged about 39,000 oil-equivalent barrels through the end of
the year. ChevronTexaco is the operator with a 50 percent interest.

U.S. Refining

In December, the company approved a $150
million project at its Pascagoula, Mississippi, refinery to produce
low-sulfur gasoline that meets anticipated new U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency standards. Regulatory permits
have been secured and the activities will commence during
2002. The project is expected to take a year to complete.

Chevron Phillips Chemical Company (CPChem)

The company’s
50 percent-owned CPChem affiliate is engaged in a joint venture
with BP Solvay to build a new high-density polyethylene
(HDPE) facility at CPChem’s Cedar Bayou, Texas, facility that
is on track for a start-up in late 2002. The 700 million pounds-per-year
HDPE facility will be the largest of its kind in the
world. A world-scale olefins and polyolefins complex in Qatar
also is expected to start production in late 2002. The facility will
be owned and operated by Qatar Chemical Company, a joint
venture between CPChem, with a 49 percent interest, and Qatar
General Petroleum.

Dynegy Inc.

In November 2001, ChevronTexaco acquired
$1.5 billion in redeemable, convertible preferred shares of its
Dynegy affiliate. In early 2002, ChevronTexaco purchased
approximately $200 million of additional Dynegy common
shares to maintain its 26.5 percent ownership interest following
Dynegy’s public equity offering in December 2001.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Sales and other operating revenues were $104 billion in 2001, compared
with $117 billion in 2000 and $84 billion in 1999. Revenues
in 2001 declined on lower average realizations for crude
oil and refined products. The increase in 2000 from 1999 was
primarily the result of sharply higher prices for crude oil, natural
gas and refined products. The effect of higher prices in
2000 was partially offset by the absence of chemicals revenues in
the second half of the year due to the July 1, 2000, formation of
CPChem, which is accounted for under the equity method.

Income from equity affiliates

totaled $1.1 billion in 2001,
$1.1 billion in 2000 and $0.9 billion in 1999. Equity income
increased marginally in 2001 on the strength of improved earnings
for Equilon, Motiva and Dynegy, partially offset by lower
earnings for Tengizchevroil and LG-Caltex and by larger losses
from CPChem. In 2000, increases in earnings from Tengiz-chevroil
and Motiva were partially offset by lower earnings
from Equilon and LG-Caltex and losses from CPChem.

Other income

totaled $0.7 billion in 2001, $1.0 billion in 2000
and $0.8 billion in 1999. The fluctuations between years were
the result of changes in net gains and losses from asset sales and
interest income from investments.

FS-4


Purchased crude oil and products

costs of $60.5 billion in 2001
were lower than the $69.8 billion in 2000 – primarily due to
lower crude oil prices – but about 30 percent higher than the
$46.3 billion in 1999 when average crude oil prices were recovering
from 20-year lows that occurred in 1998. Offsetting some
of the effect of higher prices since 1999 was the absence of such
costs associated with the chemicals operations contributed to
CPChem in July 2000.

Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses,

excluding
the effects of special items, were about the same at $11.5 billion
in 2001 and 2000. Similar expenses in 1999 were $10.8 billion,
reflecting mainly higher fuel costs for the company’s plants and
facilities. Mitigating this effect since mid-2000 was the absence
of expenses associated with the chemicals operations contributed to CPChem.

Exploration expenses

were $1.0 billion in 2001, compared with
$0.9 billion in 2000 and $1.1 billion in 1999. In 2001, well write-offs
were $184 million higher compared with 2000 – which
more than offset declines in other exploration expenses. The
increased write-offs reflected, in part, a reprioritization of
development opportunities post-merger.

Depreciation, depletion and amortization

expense was $7.1 billion
in 2001, compared with $5.3 billion in 2000 and $4.9 billion in
1999. Depreciation expense associated with asset impairments
was $2.3 billion in 2001, compared with $0.7 billion in 2000 and
$0.4 billion in 1999. After adjusting for the effect of impairments,
the expense amounts were $4.8 billion in 2001, $4.6 billion
in 2000 and $4.5 billion in 1999. Higher expense in 2001 on
this adjusted basis resulted from higher capital spending,
reserve revisions and additional abandonment provisions, while
2000 was higher than 1999 because production between years
increased. The expense in 2000 also reflected lower depreciation
in chemicals, resulting from the CPChem joint venture formation.

Income tax expenses

were $4.4 billion in 2001, $6.3 billion in
2000 and $2.6 billion in 1999, reflecting effective income tax
rates of 53 percent, 45 percent and 44 percent for each of the
three years, respectively.

The increase in the 2001 effective tax rate was primarily
due to U.S. before-tax income (generally subject to a lower tax
rate) being a significantly smaller percentage of overall before-tax
income in 2001 compared with 2000. The decline in the U.S.
before-tax income arose primarily because substantially all of
the 2001 merger-related expenses were associated with operations
in the United States.

Foreign currency gains

in 2001 were $191 million, compared
with gains of $182 million in 2000 and losses of $15 million in
1999. Approximately $150 million of the gains in 2001 were
attributable to the devaluation of the Argentine peso late in the
year. Excluding this impact, currency gains were lower than in
2000 primarily due to fluctuations of the Netherlands and Australian
currencies. The losses in 1999 were primarily in Australia.

U.S. Exploration and Production

U.S. exploration and production

earnings, excluding special
items, declined in 2001 primarily because of significantly lower
crude oil prices. Oil-equivalent production was also down 8 percent.
Higher earnings in 2000, compared with 1999, were mainly
the result of increased prices for crude oil and natural gas. Partially
offsetting the benefit of higher prices was a decline in oil-equivalent
production of 7 percent between years.

The company’s average 2001 U.S. crude oil realization was
$21.70 per barrel, compared with $26.69 in 2000 and $15.50 in
1999. The average U.S. natural gas realization was $4.38 per
thousand cubic feet in 2001, compared with $3.87 and $2.12 in
2000 and 1999, respectively.

Net liquids production for 2001 averaged 614,000 barrels
per day, down 8 percent from 2000 and 14 percent from 1999.
Net natural gas production averaged 2.7 billion cubic feet per
day in 2000,down 7 percent from 2000 and 14 percent from
1999. The lower oil-equivalent production reflected normal field
declines and asset sales, partially offset by new and enhanced
production in the deep water and other areas of the Gulf of
Mexico.

Special items in 2001 included a $1.0 billion impairment of
the Midway Sunset Field in California’s San Joaquin Valley. The
impairment was a result of the write-down in proved crude oil
reserve quantities, upon determination of lower-than-projected
oil recovery from the field’s steam injection process.

International Exploration and Production

International exploration and production

earnings, excluding
special items, declined in 2001 primarily on lower average crude oil
prices. Partially offsetting this effect was an increase of about 3
percent in oil-equivalent production and higher natural gas
prices. Earnings in 2000 improved from 1999 on significantly
higher crude oil and natural gas prices; oil-equivalent production
between years was flat.

FS-5


The average liquids realization, including equity affiliates,
was $22.17 per barrel in 2001, compared with $26.04 in 2000
and $16.57 in 1999. The average natural gas realization was
$2.36 per thousand cubic feet in 2001, compared with $2.09
in 2000 and $1.66 in 1999.

Daily net liquids production of 1.345 million barrels in
2001 increased about 1 percent from 1.330 million barrels in
2000 and 1.337 million barrels in 1999. Production increases in
Kazakhstan during 2001 more than offset lower volumes from
Indonesia. In 2000, increases in Argentina, Kazakhstan, Kuwait
and Thailand did not offset declines in Indonesia and the
United Kingdom.

Net natural gas production of 1.711 billion cubic feet per
day in 2001 was up 10 percent from 2000 and more than 13 percent
from 1999. Most notable among the geographic areas with
production increases were Kazakhstan, Trinidad and Canada. In
2000, production increases were primarily in Argentina, Colombia,
Kazakhstan and Thailand,
partially offset by lower production from normal declines in
mature fields in Canada and the United Kingdom.

Special items in 2001 included a $247 million impairment
of the LL-652 Field in Venezuela – as slower-than-expected
reservoir repressurization resulted in a reduction in the projected
volumes of oil recoverable during the company’s remaining contract
period of operation.

U.S. Refining, Marketing and Transportation

U.S. refining, marketing and transportation

earnings in 2001,
excluding special items, increased 37 percent to $1.332 billion
and more than doubled 1999 earnings of $638 million. Amounts
included the company’s share of equity income for the Equilon
and Motiva joint ventures until the October 2001 merger, when
these interests were placed in trust. Post-merger, the investments
were accounted for on the cost basis, and earnings
included dividend income, a component of other income,
rather than the equity income as was recognized pre-merger.

Earnings increases in 2001 reflected significantly higher
gasoline sales margins – especially early in the year – partially
offset by weaker distillate sales margins and higher operating
expense. Higher sales volumes across all major product lines
also contributed to the improvement. Earnings in 2000 improved
from 1999, particularly on the East and Gulf coasts. Earnings in
1999 suffered from lower sales margins and operational problems
at the company’s California refineries.

Refined products sales volumes of 2.577 million barrels per
day in 2001 decreased about 3 percent from 2000 and 2 percent
from 1999. The 2001 sales volumes reflected pre-merger sales
only for Equilon and Motiva. Sales in 2000 suffered from the
effect of 1999 year-end stockpiling by customers in anticipation
of possible Year 2000-related interruptions. The average U.S.
refined products sales realization of $30.45 per barrel in 2001 was
down 25 percent from the 2000 average of $40.75, but up 19
percent from depressed levels in 1999.

International Refining, Marketing and Transportation

International refining, marketing and transportation

earnings
include results of the company’s consolidated refining and marketing
businesses, international marine operations, international
supply and trading activities, and equity earnings of primarily
Asia-Pacific affiliates. Excluding special items, 2001 earnings of
$598 million were up 14 percent from 2000, but about 3 percent
lower than in 1999.

Earnings in most of Asia, the Middle East and eastern
Africa and South Africa operating areas improved significantly
in 2001 because of improved marketing margins, particularly
early in the year. Partially offsetting the marketing improvement
were higher costs and somewhat lower refining margins. Earnings decreased in 2000, compared with 1999,
on lower marketing margins and refined products sales volumes. The region
suffered from a very competitive operating environment,
including excess refinery capacity.

European operations suffered from low marketing and
refining margins and lower sales volumes in 2001 compared
with prior years, primarily due to weaker economic conditions.
Latin American earnings were nearly level with 2000,with
improved refining margins almost offsetting the declining sales
volumes and marketing margins. In 2000, weaker margins in
Latin America and West Africa resulted in lower earnings compared with 1999.
These were partially offset by increased earnings in Europe, driven by higher margins in the United
Kingdom and the Netherlands.

International refined products sales volumes were 2.495 million
barrels per day in 2001, down about 1 percent from 2.521 million
in 2000 and about 5 percent lower than 2.621 million in 1999.
Weaker economic conditions, particularly in Europe, dampened
demand in 2001. Lower trading volumes and the third quarter 1999
sale of the company’s equity interest in Koa Oil Company Limited
in Japan were responsible for the decline in sales volumes in 2000.

FS-6


Chemicals

Chemicals

earnings include results from the company’s Oronite division, the
company’s petrochemicals business prior to its contribution to CPChem in July
2000, and equity earnings in CPChem from that date. After excluding the effect
of special items, the segment recorded a loss of $32 million in 2001, compared
with earnings of $130 million in 2000 and $174 million in 1999. Results for all
years reflected a protracted period of generally weak demand for commodity
chemicals and industry over-capacity.

Special items in 2001 and 2000 include write-downs in the
CPChem operations in Puerto Rico.

SELECTED OPERATING DATA

MBPD = Thousands of barrels per day; MMCFPD = Millions of cubic feet per day;
Bbl = Barrel; MCF = Thousands of cubic feet.


Includes equity in affiliates.


Includes Equilon and Motiva pre-merger.


Represents total field production under the Boscan operating service
agreement in Venezuela, and in 2000 included a Colombian operating service agreement.

All Other

All Other

consists of coal mining operations, the company’s
equity interest in Dynegy Inc. – a gatherer, processor, transporter and marketer
of energy products – corporate administrative costs, worldwide cash management
and debt financing activities, power and gasification ventures, technology investments
and real estate and insurance activities.

Earnings, excluding special items, for coal operations were
$19 million in 2001 compared with $1 million in 2000 and $34
million in 1999. The improved earnings in 2001 resulted from
increased sales volumes, productivity improvements and the
absence of a work stoppage that in 2000 lasted several months.

The company’s share of Dynegy earnings before special
items in 2001 was $175 million, up from $119 million in 2000
and $44 million in 1999. Significantly higher prices for natural
gas and natural gas liquids and an increase in earnings from
power generation activities were the primary reasons for the
improved results in 2001 from the previous periods.

Net charges for the balance of the All Other segment,
excluding special items, were $1.077 billion in 2001, $1.003 billion
in 2000 and $977 million in 1999. Increases in various corporate
expenses essentially offset the benefits of lower interest
expense and higher interest income in 2001 and 2000.

Merger effects in 2001 represented the sum of $1.136 billion
for merger-related expenses and $643 million for losses on
merger-related asset dispositions.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities

were approximately
$3.2 billion at the end of both 2001 and 2000. Cash provided by
operating activities in 2001 was $11.5 billion, compared with
$13.5 billion in 2000 and $7.8 billion in 1999. Cash provided by
asset sales was $0.3 billion in 2001, $1.2 billion in 2000 and $1.6
billion in 1999. During 2001, the company’s overall debt levels
increased to $17.4 billion at December 31, 2001, compared with
$15.9 billion at December 31, 2000. Improved cash flows in
2000 permitted the company to reduce overall debt levels by
$3.2 billion and repurchase $1.5 billion of the company’s common
shares, net of sales. In addition, the company received a
cash distribution of $835 million in 2000 from CPChem after
the joint venture obtained debt financing. In 1999, a payment of
$775 million was made to Occidental Petroleum in settlement
of the Cities Service lawsuit.

FS-7


In February 2002, the company completed the sale of its
investments in Equilon and Motiva to Shell and Saudi Refining
Inc. for proceeds of $2.2 billion.

Dividends

ChevronTexaco paid common stock dividends of
$2,733 million, $2,664 million and $2,589 million in 2001, 2000
and 1999, respectively. Dividends on Texaco preferred shares were
$6 million, $15 million and $28 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. In addition, dividends of $119 million, $110 million
and $55 million were paid for the three years to stockholders who
hold minority interests in ChevronTexaco subsidiary companies.

Debt, lease and minority interest obligations

ChevronTexaco’s
total debt and capital lease obligations were $17.4 billion at
December 31, 2001, up from $15.9 billion at year-end 2000. In
addition, at December 31, 2001, the company had minority
interest obligations of $283 million, down from $746 million at
December 31, 2000. In 2001, net repayments of $2.4 billion in
long-term debt were more than offset by proceeds of
$3.8 billion from new short-term debt. Changes in long-term debt during
2001 included a non-cash reduction of $100 million of
ESOP debt. In addition to the repayments of long-term debt
during 2001, $463 million of Monthly Income Preferred shares,
which were accounted for as minority interest, and $300 million
of Texaco Market Auction Preferred Shares were redeemed.

At year-end 2001, ChevronTexaco had $3.2 billion in committed
credit facilities with various major banks, which permit
the refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term basis.
These facilities support commercial paper borrowing and also
can be used for general credit requirements. No borrowings
were outstanding under these facilities during the year or at
year-end 2001. In addition, ChevronTexaco has three existing
“shelf” registrations on file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission that together would permit registered offerings of
up to $2.8 billion of debt securities. Additionally, at December
31, 2001, the company had lines of credit available for short-term
financing totaling $500 million, of which $210 million had
not been utilized.

The company’s debt due within 12 months, consisting primarily
of commercial paper and the current portion of long-term
debt, totaled $11.6 billion at December 31, 2001, up from
$8.2 billion at December 31, 2000. Of this total short-term debt,
$3.2 billion was reclassified to long-term at year-end 2001. Settlement
of these obligations was not expected to require the use
of working capital in 2002, as the company had the intent and
the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance
them on a long-term basis. The company’s practice has
been to continually refinance its commercial paper, maintaining
levels it believes to be appropriate.

The company’s future debt level is dependent primarily on
its results of operations, its capital-spending program and cash
that may be generated from asset dispositions. The company
believes it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated
cash requirements. In periods of sustained low crude oil
and natural gas prices (below levels of approximately $20 per
barrel for West Texas Intermediate benchmark crude oil and
$2.50 per thousand cubic feet for Henry Hub benchmark natural gas)
and narrow refined products margins, cash provided
by operating activities and asset sales may not be sufficient to
fund the company’s investing activities and may result in
increased borrowings or a reduction in overall cash levels.
ChevronTexaco’s senior debt is rated AA by Standard and Poor’s
Corporation and Aa2 by Moody’s Investor Service, except for
senior debt of Texaco Inc. which is rated Aa3. ChevronTexaco’s U.S.
commercial paper is rated A-1+ by Standard and Poor’s and
Prime 1 by Moody’s, and the company’s Canadian commercial
paper is rated R-1 (middle) by Dominion Bond Rating Service. All
of these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade securities.

Share repurchase programs

In December 1997, Chevron’s
Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to $2 billion
of the company’s outstanding common stock for use in its
employee stock option programs. Total repurchases from the
program’s inception through the end of 2000 were 23.3 million
shares at a cost of $1.9 billion. The program was formally terminated
in September 2001.

In March 1998, Texaco’s Board of Directors approved the
repurchase of up to $1 billion of Texaco’s outstanding common
stock. This program was suspended in October 2000, prior to the
announcement of the planned merger with Chevron. At that time,
11.4 million shares had been acquired at a cost of $643 million.

On- and off-balance-sheet arrangements

The following tables
summarize the company’s material on- and off-balance-sheet
obligations at year-end 2001.

FS-8


ChevronTexaco provided certain indemnities for contingent
liabilities of Equilon and Motiva to Shell Oil and Saudi
Refining Inc. as part of the agreement for the sale of the company’s
interests in those investments. Generally, the indemnities
provided are limited to contingent liabilities that may mature
within 18 months of the sale of the company’s interests and are
reduced by any reserves that were established prior to the sale.
Excluding environmental liabilities, the company’s financial
exposure related to those indemnities is contractually limited to
$300 million. Additionally, the company has provided indemnities
for certain environmental liabilities arising out of conditions
that existed prior to the formation of Equilon and Motiva
and during the periods of ChevronTexaco’s ownership interest
in those entities as well as for customary representation and
warranties within the agreements.

In other off-balance-sheet arrangements, the company
securitizes certain accounts receivable in its downstream
business through the use of qualifying special purpose entities
(SPEs). At December 31, 2001, approximately $850 million, representing
about 10 percent of ChevronTexaco’s total current
accounts receivable balance, were securitized. ChevronTexaco’s
total estimated financial exposure under these arrangements at
December 31, 2001, was approximately $50 million. These
arrangements have the effect of accelerating ChevronTexaco’s
collection of the securitized amounts. In the event of the SPEs
experiencing major defaults in the collection of receivables,
ChevronTexaco would have no loss exposure connected with
third-party investments in these securitization arrangements.

The above information should also be read in conjunction
with Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements – Other
Contingencies and Commitments on page FS-40.

FINANCIAL RATIOS

The year-end

current ratio

is the ratio of current assets to current
liabilities. Generally, two items adversely affected ChevronTexaco’s
current ratio, but in the company’s opinion do not affect its liquidity.
First, current assets in all years included inventories valued
on a LIFO basis, which at year-end 2001 were lower than replacement
costs, based on average acquisition costs during the year, by
nearly $1.6 billion. Also, because the company carries a larger
percentage of short-term debt, it benefits from lower interest cost
by continually refinancing its commercial paper.

The

interest coverage ratio

is defined as income before income
tax expense, plus interest and debt expense and amortization of
capitalized interest, divided by before-tax interest costs. ChevronTexaco’s interest coverage ratio was lower in 2001, primarily due
to lower before-tax income partially offset by lower interest
expense as a result of replacing long-term debt with lower interest
rate commercial paper obligations. The company’s

debt ratio

(total
debt divided by total debt plus equity) increased to 33.9 percent in
2001, due to an increase in total debt for the year.

Financial Ratios

FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

Commodity Derivative Instruments

ChevronTexaco is exposed to market
risks related to the volatility of crude oil, refined products,
natural gas and refinery feedstock prices. The company uses
derivative commodity instruments to manage its exposure to
price volatility on a small portion of its activity, including: firm
commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase or
sale of crude oil, feedstock purchases for company refineries,
crude oil and refined products inventories, and fixed-price contracts
to sell natural gas and natural gas liquids.

ChevronTexaco also uses derivative commodity instruments
for trading purposes, and the results of this activity are not material
to the company’s financial position, net income or cash flows.

The company’s positions are monitored and managed on a
daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with
the company’s stated risk management policy that has been
approved by the company’s Board of Directors.

The derivative instruments used in the company’s risk
management and trading activities consist mainly of futures
contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange and the
International Petroleum Exchange, crude oil and natural gas
swap contracts, options and other derivative products entered
into principally with major financial institutions and other oil
and gas companies. Virtually all derivatives beyond those designated
as normal purchase and normal sale contracts are
recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with
resulting gains and losses reflected in income. Fair values are
derived principally from market quotes and other independent
third-party quotes.

The aggregate effect of a hypothetical 15 percent change in
prices for natural gas, crude oil and petroleum products would
not be material to the company’s financial position, net income
or cash flows. The hypothetical loss on the related commodity
contracts was estimated by calculating the cash value of the
contracts as the difference between the hypothetical and contract
delivery prices, multiplied by the contract amounts.

Foreign Currency

The company enters into forward exchange
contracts, generally with terms of 180 days or less, to manage
some of its foreign currency exposures. These exposures include
revenue and anticipated purchase transactions, including foreign
currency capital expenditures and lease commitments
forecasted to occur within 180 days. The forward exchange
contracts are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with
resulting gains and losses reflected in income.

The aggregate effect of a hypothetical adverse change of
10 percent to year-end exchange rates (a weakening of the U.S.
dollar) would not be material to the company’s financial position,
net income or cash flows.

Interest Rates

The company enters into interest rate swaps as
part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its
debt. Under the terms of the swaps, net cash settlements are
based on the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate
interest amounts calculated by reference to agreed notional
principal amounts. Interest rate swaps hedging a portion of the
company’s fixed-rate debt are accounted for as fair value hedges,
whereas interest rate swaps relating to a portion of the company’s
floating-rate debt are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet
with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. During
2001, no new swaps were initiated in connection with debt

FS-9


issues in the year. At year-end 2001, the weighted average maturity
of interest rate swaps was approximately five years.

A hypothetical 10 percent increase in interest rates upon
the interest rate swaps would cause the fair value of the “receive
fixed” swaps to decline and the “receive floating” swaps to increase.
The aggregate effect of these changes would not be material
to the company’s financial position, net income or cash flows.

The company’s $1.5 billion investment in redeemable,
convertible preferred stock of Dynegy is carried at fair value.

TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES

ChevronTexaco enters into a number of business arrangements
with related parties, principally its equity affiliates. These
arrangements include long-term supply or offtake agreements.
In the United States, there are long-term agreements in place
with Dynegy for the purchase of substantially all natural gas
and natural gas liquids produced by legacy Chevron in the
United States, excluding Alaska, and the supply of natural gas
and natural gas liquids feedstocks to the company’s U.S. refineries
and chemicals plants. In early 2002, the company was negotiating
to expand these agreements to include substantially all
legacy Texaco U.S. production of natural gas and natural gas
liquids. Internationally, there are long-term purchase agreements
in place with the company’s refining affiliate in Thailand.
Management believes the foregoing agreements and others have
been negotiated on terms consistent with those that would have
been negotiated with an unrelated third party.

CAPITAL AND EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES

Worldwide capital and exploratory expenditures for 2001
totaled $12.0 billion,including the company’s equity share of
affiliates’ expenditures. Capital and exploratory expenditures
were $9.5 billion in 2000 and $10.1 billion in 1999. Expenditures
for exploration and production activities represented 59
percent of total outlays in 2001, compared with 65 percent in
2000 and 72 percent in 1999. International exploration and
production spending was 66 percent of worldwide exploration
and production expenditures in 2001, compared with 62
percent in 2000 and 75 percent in 1999, reflecting the company’s
continuing focus on international exploration and production
activities. Expenditures in 2001 included additional
investments in Tengizchevroil and the purchase of $1.5 billion
of redeemable, convertible preferred shares of Dynegy stock.
Expenditures in the All Other segment in 2000 included an
additional investment of approximately $300 million in Dynegy
Inc. Included in 1999 were expenditures of about $1.7 billion –
mainly cash and assumption of debt – for the acquisition of
Rutherford-Moran Oil Corporation and Petrolera Argentina
San Jorge S.A., exploration and production businesses in Thailand
and Argentina, respectively.

The company estimates 2002 capital and exploratory expenditures
at $9.4 billion, including ChevronTexaco’s share of spending by
affiliates. Excluding the 2001 amounts for the increased
investment in Tengizchevroil and the Dynegy redeemable, convertible
preferred stock, spending between years is expected to be
about 9 percent lower in 2002. About $6.1 billion,or 65 percent
of the total, is targeted for exploration and production activities,
with $1.8 billion of that in the United States. Worldwide downstream
spending is estimated at $1.7 billion,and investments in
chemicals are budgeted at $400 million. Budgeted expenditures
for power and related businesses are $800 million. The remaining
$400 million is primarily targeted for emerging technologies and
information technology infrastructure.

PRE-MERGER EMPLOYEE TERMINATION BENEFITS

AND OTHER RESTRUCTURING COSTS

Chevron recorded before-tax charges of $235 million in 1999 for
employee termination benefits and other restructuring costs as
part of a 3,500-employee reduction program in all its operating
segments across several business functions. Employees affected
were primarily U.S.-based, and all employee terminations were
completed by December 2000. Termination benefits for approximately
3,100 of the 3,500 employees were paid from the assets
of Chevron’s U.S. and Canadian pension plans.

In the fourth quarter 1998, Texaco recorded $115 million
before tax for a corporatewide reorganization affecting 1,400
employees. During the second quarter 1999, the program was
expanded by about 1,200 employees and an additional $48
million before-tax was accrued. By the end of the third quarter
2000, the employee reductions were met and all termination
payments were made.

During the first quarter of 2000, Texaco recorded $17 million
before tax for the termination of an additional 200 employees.
Terminations and payments were completed by the end of
the first quarter 2001.

Caltex recorded charges of $37 million in 1999 for restructuring
activities that included severance and other termination
benefits of $23 million for 200 employees. By December 2000, all
work force reductions and separation payments were completed.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Virtually all aspects of the businesses in which the company
engages are subject to various federal, state and local environmental,
health and safety laws and regulations. These regulatory
requirements continue to increase in both number and complexity
over time and govern not only the manner in which the

FS-10


company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells.
Most of the costs of complying with laws and regulations pertaining
to company operations and products are embedded in
the normal costs of doing business.

Accidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in
the ordinary course of business. In addition to the costs for
environmental protection associated with its ongoing operations
and products, the company may incur expenses for corrective
actions at various owned and previously owned facilities
and at third-party owned waste-disposal sites used by the company.
An obligation may arise when operations are closed or
sold or at non-ChevronTexaco sites where company products
have been handled or disposed of. Most of the expenditures to
fulfill these obligations relate to facilities and sites where past
operations followed practices and procedures that were considered
acceptable at the time but now require investigative and/or
remedial work to meet current standards.

Using definitions and guidelines established by the American
Petroleum Institute, ChevronTexaco estimated its world-wide
environmental spending in 2001 at $1.246 billion for its
consolidated companies. Included in these expenditures were
$323 million of environmental capital expenditures and $923
million of costs associated with the control and abatement of
hazardous substances and pollutants from ongoing operations.
For 2002, total worldwide environmental capital expenditures
are estimated at $495 million. These capital costs are in addition
to the ongoing costs of complying with environmental regulations
and the costs to remediate previously contaminated sites.

The following table analyzes the annual changes to the
company’s before-tax environmental remediation reserves,
including those for Superfund sites. For 2001, the company
recorded additional provisions for estimated remediation costs
at refined products marketing sites and various producing
properties in the United States.

Under provisions of the Superfund law, the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) has designated ChevronTexaco a
potentially responsible party, or has otherwise involved the
company, in the remediation of 413 hazardous waste sites. The
company made provisions or payments in 2001 and prior years
for approximately 287 of these sites. No single site is expected to
result in a material liability for the company. For the remaining
sites, investigations are not yet at a stage where the company is
able to quantify a probable liability or determine a range of reasonably
possible exposures. The Superfund law provides for joint
and several liability for all responsible parties. Any future actions
by the EPA and other regulatory agencies to require ChevronTexaco
to assume other potentially responsible parties’ costs at
designated hazardous waste sites are not expected to have a
material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position
or liquidity. Remediation reserves at year-end 2001, 2000 and
1999 for Superfund sites were $62 million, $73 million and $79
million, respectively.

It is likely that the company will continue to incur additional
liabilities, beyond those recorded, for environmental
remediation relating to past operations. These future costs are
indeterminable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude
of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of
the corrective actions that may be required, the determination
of the company’s liability in proportion to other responsible
parties and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from
third parties. While the amount of future costs may be material
to the company’s results of operations in the period in which
they are recognized, the company does not expect these costs
will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial
position or liquidity. Also, the company does not believe its
obligations to make such expenditures have had, or will have,
any significant impact on the company’s competitive position
relative to other petroleum or chemicals companies.

The company maintains additional reserves for dismantlement,
abandonment and restoration of its worldwide oil and
gas and coal properties at the end of their productive lives.
Many of these costs are related to environmental issues. Expense
provisions are recognized on a unit-of-production basis. The
reserves balance at year-end 2001 was $2.2 billion and is
included in “Accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization”
in the company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

For the company’s other ongoing operating assets, such as
refineries and chemicals facilities, no provisions are made for
exit or cleanup costs that may be required when such assets
reach the end of their useful lives, unless a decision to sell or
otherwise abandon the facility has been made.

LITIGATION AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES

Chevron, Texaco and four other oil companies (refiners) filed
suit in 1995 contesting the validity of a patent granted to Unocal
Corporation (Unocal) for reformulated gasoline, which
ChevronTexaco sells in California in certain months of the year.
In March 2000, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
upheld a September 1998 District Court decision that Unocal’s
patent was valid and enforceable and assessed damages of 5.75
cents per gallon for gasoline produced in infringement of the
patent. In May 2000, the Federal Circuit Court denied a petition
for rehearing with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
filed by the refiners in this case. The refiners petitioned the
U.S. Supreme Court, and in February 2001, the Supreme Court
denied the petition to review the lower court’s ruling, and the
case was remanded to the District Court for an accounting of all
infringing gasoline produced from August 1, 1996, to September
30, 2000. The District Court granted Unocal’s motion for
summary judgment requesting an accounting and denied the
refiners’ motion to stay the proceedings and vacate the accounting order. However, the judge presiding over this case recused
himself before entering a final judgment and a new judge was
assigned. Additionally, in May 2001, the U.S. Patent Office
(USPO) granted the refiners’petition to reexamine the validity of
Unocal’s patent and in February 2002, the USPO ruled the patent
invalid. Unocal has two months to respond to the USPO ruling.
The Federal Trade Commission also announced that it was investigating whether Unocal’s failure to disclose to the California Air
Resources Board that it had filed a patent application was unfair
competition, which may make Unocal’s patent unenforceable.

FS-11


If Unocal’s patent ultimately is upheld and is enforceable,
the company’s financial exposure includes royalties, plus interest, for production of gasoline that is proven to have infringed
the patent. Chevron and Texaco, as well as Texaco’s former affiliates Equilon and Motiva, have been accruing in the normal
course of business any future estimated liability for potential
infringement of the patent covered by the trial court’s ruling. In
2000, Chevron and Texaco made payments to Unocal totaling
approximately $28 million for the original court ruling, including interest and fees.

Unocal obtained additional patents for alternate formulations that could affect a larger share of U.S. gasoline production.
ChevronTexaco believes these additional patents are invalid and
unenforceable. However, if such patents are ultimately upheld,
the competitive and financial effects on the company’s refining
and marketing operations, while presently indeterminable,
could be material.

Another issue involving the company is the petroleum
industry’s use of methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) as a gasoline
additive and its potential environmental impact through
seepage into groundwater. Along with other oil companies, the
company is a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of
the chemical MTBE in certain oxygenated gasolines. These
actions may require the company to correct or ameliorate the
alleged effects on the environment of prior release of MTBE by
the company or other parties. Additional lawsuits and claims
related to the use of MTBE, including personal-injury claims,
may be filed in the future. Total costs to the company related to
these lawsuits and claims are not currently determinable.
ChevronTexaco continues the use of MTBE in gasoline it sells in
certain areas. The state of California had directed that MTBE be
phased out of the manufacturing process by the end of 2002. In
March 2002, the governor of California postponed the phase
out of MTBE in California until the end of 2003.

The company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to
environmental laws and regulations that in the future may
require the company to take action to correct or ameliorate
the effects on the environment of prior release of chemicals or
petroleum substances, including MTBE, by the company or
other parties. Such contingencies may exist for various sites
including, but not limited to: Superfund sites and refineries, oil
fields, service stations, terminals, and land development areas,
whether operating, closed or sold.

See “Environmental Matters” on page FS-10 for comments
related to uncertainties connected with environmental cost
estimates and financial exposures.

At year-end 2001, the projected benefit obligations
exceeded the value of the assets in the company’s combined U.S.
pension plans by $780 million. If investment returns are insufficient
to offset increases in the plan’s obligations, pension
expense may increase and additional funding may be required.

The U.S. federal income tax liabilities have been settled
through 1993 for Chevron and Caltex and through 1991 for Texaco.
California franchise tax liabilities have been settled through
1991 for Chevron and through 1987 for Texaco. Settlement of
open tax years, as well as tax issues in other countries where the
company conducts its businesses, is not expected to have a
material effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity
of the company and, in the opinion of management, adequate
provision has been made for income and franchise taxes for all
years under examination or subject to future examination.

The company’s operations, particularly exploration and
production, can be affected by other changing economic, regulatory
and political environments in the various countries in
which it operates, including the United States. In certain locations,
host governments have imposed restrictions, controls and
taxes, and in others, political conditions have existed that may
threaten the safety of employees and the company’s continued
presence in those countries. Internal unrest or strained relations
between a host government and the company or other governments
may affect the company’s operations. Those developments
have, at times, significantly affected the company’s
related operations and results and are carefully considered by
management when evaluating the level of current and future
activity in such countries.

For oil and gas producing operations, ownership agreements
may provide for periodic reassessments of equity interests
in estimated oil and gas reserves. These activities, individually
or together, may result in gains or losses that could be material
to earnings in any given period. One such equity redetermination
process has been under way since 1996 for ChevronTexaco’s
interests in four producing zones at the Naval Petroleum
Reserve at Elk Hills in California, for the time when the remaining
interests in these zones were owned by the U.S. Department
of Energy. A wide range of estimates exist for a possible net settlement
amount for the four zones. ChevronTexaco currently
estimates its maximum possible net before-tax liability at less
than $400 million. At the same time, a possible maximum net
amount that could be owed to ChevronTexaco is estimated at
more than $200 million. The timing of the settlement and the
exact amount within this range of estimates are uncertain.

Areas in which the company and its affiliates have major
operations include the United States of America, Canada, Australia,
the United Kingdom, Norway, Denmark, Kuwait, Republic of Congo,
Angola, Nigeria, Chad, Equatorial Guinea,
Democratic Republic of Congo, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea,
China, Thailand, Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia,
Trinidad, Korea, the Philippines, Singapore and South Africa.
The company’s Tengizchevroil affiliate operates in Kazakhstan.
The company’s CPChem affiliate manufactures and markets a
wide range of petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide basis,
with manufacturing facilities in existence or under construction
in the United States, Puerto Rico, Singapore, China, South
Korea, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Mexico and Belgium. The company’s Dynegy affiliate has operations in the United States,
Canada, the United Kingdom and other European countries.

ChevronTexaco receives claims from, and submits claims to,
customers, trading partners, U.S. federal, state and local regulatory
bodies, host governments, contractors, insurers and suppliers. The
amounts of these claims, individually and in the aggregate, may be
significant and may take lengthy periods to resolve.

The company and its affiliates also continue to review and
analyze their operations and may close, abandon, sell, exchange,
acquire or restructure assets to achieve operational or strategic
benefits and to improve competitiveness and profitability. These
activities, individually or together, may result in gains or losses
in future periods.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

In December 2001, the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) issued a statement addressing selection and disclosure by
public companies of “critical accounting policies and practices.”
In the statement, the SEC encouraged inclusion in Management’s
Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) commentary as to
“the likelihood of materially different reported results if different
assumptions or conditions were to prevail” in the application
of these critical accounting policies.

The accompanying ChevronTexaco consolidated financial
statements and supplementary information were prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States (GAAP). Significant accounting policies are discussed
in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Inherent in the application of many of these accounting policies
is the need for management to make estimates and judgments
in the determination of certain revenues, expenses, assets and
liabilities. As such, materially different financial results can occur
as circumstances change and additional information becomes
known. Differences have occurred in the past with respect to a
few critical accounting policies, as follows:

Successful Efforts Method of Oil and Gas Accounting

Among other
things, this accounting principle requires that capitalized costs
for producing properties be amortized on the basis of crude oil
and natural gas reserve quantities. The reserve estimates are
determined in accordance with earth science and petroleum
engineering principles and practices – and can vary as a result
of changes in such factors as forecasted oil and gas prices, reservoir performance and oil field technology.

Downward revision in reserve estimates (on a field basis in
North America; by concession or country in other producing
areas) can result in either: (a) higher depreciation and depletion
expense per barrel in future periods, or (b) an immediate write-down of the asset’s book value in accordance with accounting
rules for the impairment of properties. The latter condition
would result if the downward revisions were so significant that
the estimated future cash flows from the remaining reserves in
the field were insufficient to recover the unamortized capitalized costs. Conversely, if the oil and gas reserve quantities were
revised upward, future per-barrel depreciation and depletion
expense would be lower.

The application of successful efforts accounting can also
cause material fluctuations between periods in exploration
expense if drilling results are different than expected or if the
company changes its exploration and development plans. The
determination that exploratory drilling was unsuccessful in
finding economically producible reserves requires the immediate expensing of previously capitalized drilling costs.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

In addition to oil and gas
assets that could become impaired under the application of successful efforts accounting, other assets could become impaired
and require write-down if circumstances warrant. Conditions
that could cause an asset to become impaired include lower-than-forecasted
commodity sales prices, changes in the company’s business plans or a significant adverse change in the local
or national business climate. The amount of an impairment
charge would be based on estimates of an asset’s fair value compared with its book value.

Environmental Remediation and Litigation Reserve Estimation

Management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for environmental cleanup and litigation. Liabilities for
environmental remediation are subject to change because of
matters such as changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation; the determination of additional information on the
extent and nature of site contamination; and improvements in
technology. Likewise, actual litigation costs can vary from estimates based on the facts and circumstance and application of
laws in individual cases.

Income Tax Accounting

The computation of the company’s
income tax expense requires the interpretation of complex tax
laws and regulations in many taxing jurisdictions around the
world; the determination of expected outcomes from pending
litigation; and the assessment of audit findings that are performed by numerous taxing authorities. Actual income tax
expense can differ significantly from management’s estimates.

The above assessment of critical accounting policies is not
meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the uncertainties to
financial results that can occur from the application of the full
range of the company’s accounting policies. Materially different
financial results could occur in the application of other accounting policies as well. Likewise, materially different results can
occur upon the adoption of new accounting standards promulgated by the various rule-making bodies.

Other contingencies are discussed in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The status of pending litigation
and other information is included in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Information on contingencies and
litigation is also addressed on page FS-11.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

The company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) Statement No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities” (FAS 133), as amended by
FAS 138, “Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and
Certain Hedging Activities – an amendment of FASB Statement
No. 133,” effective January 1, 2001. The adoption of FAS 133
and FAS 138 did not have a significant impact on the company’s
results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

Recent interpretations of FAS 133 and FAS 138 by the
FASB Derivatives Implementation Group prescribe mark-to-market accounting for certain natural gas sales contracts. Some
of these interpretations became effective January 1, 2002. Adoption
at that time did not result in a material effect to earnings.
The effect of subsequent changes in the contracts’ fair values is
uncertain.

In September 2000, the FASB issued Statement No. 140,
“Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and
Extinguishments of Liabilities – A Replacement of FASB Statement No. 125” (FAS 140). FAS 140 is effective for transfers
occurring after March 31, 2001, and for disclosures relating to
securitization transactions and collateral for fiscal years ending
after December 15, 2000. Adoption of FAS 140 had no significant effect on ChevronTexaco’s accounting or disclosures for the
types of transactions in the scope of the new standard.

In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 141, “Business
Combinations” (FAS 141), Statement No. 142, “Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets” (FAS 142) and Statement No. 143,

FS-13


“Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” (FAS 143). FAS
141 is effective for all business combinations initiated after June
30, 2001, and for all business combinations accounted for using
the purchase method for which the date of acquisition is July 1,
2001, or later. FAS 142 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2001, except for goodwill and intangible assets
acquired after June 30, 2001, which were immediately subject to
the amortization and nonamortization provisions of the Statement.
FAS 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June
15, 2002. Adoption of FAS 141 will have no effect on the company’s
pooling-of-interests method of accounting for the Texaco
merger transaction, but will affect future transactions.
Similarly, adoption of FAS 142 may affect future transactions,
but is not expected to have an effect on the company’s prior
business combinations. FAS 143 differs in several significant
respects from current accounting for asset retirement obligations
under FAS 19, “Financial Accounting and Reporting by
Oil and Gas Producing Companies.” Adoption of FAS 143 will
affect future accounting and reporting of the assets, liabilities
and expenses related to these obligations. The magnitude of the
effect has not yet been determined.

In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 144,
“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets” (FAS 144). FAS 144 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2001, with initial application effective as of
the beginning of the fiscal year adopted. Adoption of FAS 144
will not affect assets classified as held for disposal as a result of
disposal activities that were initiated prior to its initial application,
but may affect future disposals.

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation – Merger of Chevron and Texaco

On October 9, 2001, Texaco
Inc. (Texaco) became a wholly owned subsidiary of Chevron Corporation (Chevron)
pursuant to a merger transaction, and Chevron changed its name to ChevronTexaco
Corporation. The combination was accounted for as a pooling of interests.

These Consolidated Financial Statements give retroactive effect to the
merger, with all periods presented as if Chevron and Texaco had always been
combined. Certain reclassifications have been made to conform the separate
presentations of Chevron and Texaco. The reclassifications had no impact on the
amount of net income or stockholders’ equity.

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of all
majority-owned, controlled subsidiaries after the elimination of significant
intercompany accounts and transactions. Included in the consolidation are the
accounts of the Caltex Group of Companies (Caltex) – a joint venture, owned 50
percent each by Chevron and Texaco prior to the merger and accounted for under
the equity method by both companies.

General

ChevronTexaco manages its investments in, and provides administrative,
financial and management support to, U.S. and foreign subsidiaries and
affiliates that engage in fully integrated petroleum operations, chemicals
operations and coal mining activities. In addition, ChevronTexaco holds
investments in power generation and gasification businesses. Collectively,
these companies operate in approximately 180 countries. Petroleum operations
consist of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas;
refining crude oil into finished petroleum products; marketing crude oil,
natural gas and the many products derived from petroleum; and transporting
crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products by pipelines, marine vessels,
motor equipment and rail car. Chemicals operations include the manufacture and
marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses and fuel
and lube oil additives.

In preparing its Consolidated Financial Statements, the company follows
accounting policies that are in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. This requires the use of estimates and
assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported
in the financial statements, as well as amounts included in the notes thereto,
including discussion and disclosure of contingent liabilities. While the
company uses its best estimates and judgments, actual results could differ from
these estimates as future confirming events occur.

The nature of the company’s operations and the many countries in which it
operates subject it to changing economic, regulatory and political conditions.
The company does not believe it is vulnerable to the risk of near-term severe
impact as a result of any concentration of its activities.

Subsidiary and Affiliated Companies

The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of controlled subsidiary companies more than 50 percent
owned. Investments in and advances to affiliates in which the company has a
substantial ownership interest of approximately 20 percent to 50 percent, or
for which the company exercises significant influence but not control over
policy decisions are accounted for by the equity method, in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 18, “The Equity Method of
Accounting for Investments in Common Stock.” Under this accounting, remaining
unamortized cost is increased or decreased by the company’s share of earnings
or losses after dividends. Gains and losses that arise from the issuance of
stock by an affiliate that results in changes in the company’s proportionate
share of the dollar amount of the affiliate’s equity are recognized currently
in income. Deferred income taxes are provided for these gains and losses.

Derivatives

The majority of the company’s activity in commodity derivative
instruments is intended to manage the price risk posed by physical
transactions. For some of this derivative activity, generally limited to large,
discrete or infrequently occurring transactions, the company may elect to apply
fair value or cash flow hedge accounting. For other similar derivative
instruments, generally because of the short-term nature of the contracts and
their limited use, the company has elected not to apply hedge accounting, and
changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in current income.
For the company’s trading activity, gains and losses from the derivative
instruments are reported in current income. For derivative instruments relating
to foreign currency exposures, gains and losses are reported in current income.
Interest rate swaps – hedging a portion of the company’s fixed rate debt – are
accounted for as fair value hedges, whereas interest rate swaps relating to a
portion of the company’s floating-rate debt are recorded at fair value on the
balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income.

Short-Term Investments

All short-term investments are classified as available
for sale and are in highly liquid debt or equity securities. Those investments
that are part of the company’s cash management portfolio with original
maturities of three months or less are reported as “Cash equivalents.” The
balance of the short-term investments is reported as “Marketable securities.”
Short-term investments are marked-to-market with any unrealized gains or losses
included in other comprehensive income.

Inventories

Crude oil, petroleum products and chemicals are generally stated at
cost, using a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) method. In the aggregate, these costs
are below market. Materials, supplies and other inventories generally are
stated at average cost.

Properties, Plant and Equipment

The successful efforts method is used for oil
and gas exploration and production activities. All costs for development wells,
related plant and equipment, and proved mineral interests in oil and gas
properties are capitalized. Costs of exploratory wells are capitalized pending
determination of whether the wells found proved reserves. Costs of wells that
are assigned proved reserves remain capitalized. Costs also are capitalized for
wells that find commercially producible reserves that cannot be classified as
proved, pending one or more of the following: (1) decisions on additional major
capital expenditures, (2) the results of additional

FS-22


NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

– Continued

exploratory wells that are under way or firmly planned, and (3) securing final
regulatory approvals for development. Otherwise, well costs are expensed if a
determination as to whether proved reserves were found cannot be made within
one year following completion of drilling. All other exploratory wells and
costs are expensed.

Long-lived assets, including proved oil and gas properties, are assessed
for possible impairment by comparing their carrying values with the
undiscounted future net before-tax cash flows. Impaired assets are written down
to their estimated fair values, generally their discounted future net
before-tax cash flows. For proved oil and gas properties in the United States,
the company generally performs the impairment review on an individual field
basis. Outside the United States, reviews are performed on a country or
concession basis. Impairment amounts are recorded as incremental depreciation
expense in the period in which the event occurs.

Depreciation and depletion (including provisions for future abandonment
and restoration costs) of all capitalized costs of proved oil and gas producing
properties, except mineral interests, are expensed using the unit-of-production
method by individual field as the proved developed reserves are produced.
Depletion expenses for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are
recognized using the unit-of-production method by individual fields as the
related proved reserves are produced. Periodic valuation provisions for
impairment of capitalized costs of unproved mineral interests are expensed.

Depreciation and depletion expenses for coal are determined using the
unit-of-production method as the proved reserves are produced. The capitalized
costs of all other plant and equipment are depreciated or amortized over their
estimated useful lives. In general, the declining-balance method is used to
depreciate plant and equipment in the United States; the straight-line method
generally is used to depreciate international plant and equipment and to
amortize all capitalized leased assets.

Gains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties,
plant and equipment subject to composite group amortization or depreciation.
Gains or losses from abnormal retirements are recorded as expenses and from
sales as Other income.

Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor renewals to maintain
facilities in operating condition are generally expensed as incurred. Major
replacements and renewals are capitalized.

Environmental Expenditures

Environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing
operations or to conditions caused by past operations are expensed.
Expenditures that create future benefits or contribute to future revenue
generation are capitalized.

Liabilities related to future remediation costs are recorded when
environmental assessments and/or cleanups are probable and the costs can be
reasonably estimated. Other than for assessments, the timing and magnitude of
these accruals are generally based on the company’s commitment to a formal plan
of action, such as an approved remediation plan or the sale or disposal of an
asset. For the company’s U.S. and Canadian marketing facilities, the accrual is
based on the probability that a future remediation commitment will be required.
For oil, gas and coal producing properties, a provision is made through
depreciation expense for anticipated abandonment and restoration costs at the
end of a property’s useful life.

For Superfund sites, the company records a liability for its share of
costs when it has been named as a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) and when
an assessment or cleanup plan has been developed. This liability includes the
company’s own portion of the costs and also the company’s portion of amounts
for other PRPs when it is probable that they will not be able to pay their
share of the cleanup obligation.

The company records the gross amount of its liability based on its best
estimate of future costs using currently available technology and applying
current regulations as well as the company’s own internal environmental
policies. Future amounts are not discounted. Recoveries or reimbursements are
recorded as assets when receipt is reasonably assured.

Currency Translation

The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for
substantially all of the company’s consolidated operations and those of its
equity affiliates. For those operations, all gains or losses from currency
translations are currently included in income. The cumulative translation
effects for those few entities, both consolidated and affiliated, using
functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are included in the currency
translation adjustment in stockholders’ equity.

Revenue Recognition

Revenues associated with sales of crude oil, natural gas,
coal, petroleum and chemicals products and all other sources are recorded when
title passes to the customer, net of royalties, discounts and allowances, as
applicable. Revenues from natural gas production from properties in which
ChevronTexaco has an interest with other producers are generally recognized on
the basis of the company’s net working interest (entitlement method).

Stock Compensation

The company applies Accounting Principles Board (APB)
Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related
interpretations in accounting for stock options, and presents in Note 21 pro
forma net income and earnings per share data as if the accounting prescribed by
FAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” had been applied.

NOTE 2. TEXACO MERGER TRANSACTION

– Continued

At the time of the merger, each share of Texaco common stock was converted, on
a tax-free basis, into the right to receive 0.77 shares of ChevronTexaco common
stock. Approximately 425 million additional shares of common stock were issued,
representing about 40 percent of the outstanding ChevronTexaco common stock
after the merger.

As a condition of approving the merger, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission
(FTC) required the divestment of certain Texaco assets: Texaco’s investments in
its U.S. refining, marketing and transportation affiliates, Equilon Enterprises
LLC (Equilon) and Motiva Enterprises LLC (Motiva), as well as other interests
in U.S. natural gas processing and transportation facilities and general
aviation fuel marketing.

Also at the time of the merger, Texaco placed its interests in Equilon and
Motiva in trust, as required by the FTC. Because the company no longer
exercised significant influence over these investments, the associated
accounting method was changed from equity to the cost basis.

NOTE 3. EXTRAORDINARY ITEM

Net income for 2001 included a loss of $643, net of a tax benefit of $144,
($0.61 per common share – diluted), related to the disposition of assets that
were required as a condition of the FTC approval of the merger and other assets
that were made duplicative by the merger. The after-tax loss on these
dispositions was reported as an extraordinary item in accordance with
pooling-of-interests accounting requirements.

Included in the total after-tax loss was a loss of $564 connected with the
sale of interests in Equilon and Motiva. Proceeds from the sale, which closed
in February 2002, were approximately $2,200.

For both assets that were being sold by order of the FTC and other assets
that were being disposed of because they were made duplicative by the merger,
the total net book value at year-end 2001 was $2,181. This amount was included
in “Current assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as “Assets held for sale
- - merger related.” Net income for 2001 associated with all such assets being
sold as a result of the merger was approximately $375.

NOTE 4. EMPLOYEE TERMINATION BENEFITS AND OTHER RESTRUCTURING COSTS

The company recorded before-tax charges of $1,563 in 2001 for merger-related
expenses, which included: employee severance benefits; incremental pension and
medical plan costs associated with work force reductions; legal, accounting,
SEC filing and investment banker fees; employee and office relocations; and
costs for the elimination of redundant facilities and operations.

Included in the 2001 charges were accruals of $891 for employee
termination benefits for approximately 4,500 employees and other merger-related
expenses that would not benefit future periods. Payments against these accruals
during the year were $105. Approximately 1,400 employees had terminated by
year-end. The year-end accrual balance of $786 is expected to be mostly
extinguished by early 2003, as certain terminating employees are eligible to
delay their separation payments one year or more. At year-end 2001,
approximately $275 of the accrual balance was classified as long term.

Accrual balances for pre-merger restructuring costs had all been
extinguished before the end of 2001.

NOTE 5. SPECIAL ITEMS, MERGER EFFECTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Net income is affected by transactions that are unrelated to or are not
necessarily representative of the company’s ongoing operations for the periods
presented. These transactions, defined by management and designated “special
items, merger
effects and extraordinary items,” can obscure the underlying results of
operations for a year as well as affect comparability of results between years.

Listed in the following table are categories of these items and their net
increase (decrease) to net income, after related tax effects.

FS-24


NOTE 5. SPECIAL ITEMS, MERGER EFFECTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION

– Continued

In accordance with its policy, the company recorded impairments of assets
to be held and used when changes in circumstances – primarily related to lower
oil and gas prices, downward revisions of reserves and changes in the use of
the assets – indicated that the carrying values of the assets could not be
recovered through estimated future before-tax undiscounted cash flows. 2001
included a $1,022 impairment of the Midway Sunset Field in California – the
result of a write-down in proved oil reserve quantities – upon determination of
a lower-than-projected oil recovery from the field’s steam injection process.
There was also a $247 impairment of the LL-652 Field in Venezuela in 2001 – as
slower-than-expected reservoir repressurization resulted in a reduction in the
projected volumes of oil recoverable during the company’s remaining contract
period of operation. Asset impairments included in “Asset write-offs and
revaluations” were for assets held for use, except for U.S. coal assets in
1999. In late 1999, these assets were reclassified to “held for use” upon
cessation of negotiations with potential buyers.

The aggregate income statement effects from special items are reflected in the
following table, including ChevronTexaco’s proportionate share of special items
related to equity affiliates.

Other financial information is as follows:

*

Includes $12, $66 and $(32) in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, for the
company’s share of equity affiliates’ foreign currency gains (losses).

The excess of market value over the carrying value of inventories for which the
LIFO method is used was $1,580, $2,339 and $1,169 at December 31, 2001, 2000
and 1999, respectively. Market value is generally based on average acquisition
costs for the year. In 2000, certain inventories were recorded at market, which
was lower than LIFO carrying value. Adjustments to market reduced net income $4
in 2000. In 2001 and 1999, the market valuation adjustment reserves established
in prior years were eliminated as market prices improved and the associated
physical units of inventory were sold. Elimination of these reserves increased
net income by $4 and $170 in 2001 and 1999, respectively.

NOTE 9. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

Retained earnings at December 31, 2001 and 2000, included approximately $2,001
and $2,300, respectively, for the company’s share of undistributed earnings of
equity affiliates. The interests in Equilon and Motiva were placed in trust at
the time of the merger, and ChevronTexaco no longer had significant influence
over the joint ventures. Accordingly, the method of accounting for these
investments was changed in the fourth quarter 2001 from equity to cost basis.

Upon the merger of Chevron and Texaco, the authorized common stock of
ChevronTexaco was increased from 2 billion shares of $0.75 par value to 4
billion shares of $0.75 par value. Under the terms of the merger agreement,
approximately 425
million shares of ChevronTexaco common stock were issued in exchange for
all of the outstanding shares of Texaco common stock based upon an exchange
ratio of 0.77 of a ChevronTexaco share for each Texaco

FS-26


NOTE 9. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

– Continued

share. Texaco’s common stock held in treasury was canceled at the effective
time of the merger.

In 1998, in connection with the renewal of Chevron’s Stockholder Rights
Plan, Chevron declared a dividend distribution on each outstanding share of its
common stock of one Right to purchase participating preferred stock. Since this
distribution in 1998, all newly issued shares of the corporation’s common stock
have been accompanied by a preferred stock purchase Right, including the shares
issued in connection with the merger between Chevron and Texaco. Following the
merger, the Chevron Stockholder Rights Plan has continued as the Stockholder
Rights plan of ChevronTexaco. The Rights issued under the plan become
exercisable, unless redeemed earlier by ChevronTexaco, if a person or group
acquires or obtains the right to acquire 10 percent or more of the outstanding
shares of common stock or commences a tender or exchange offer that would
result in that person or group acquiring 10 percent or more of the outstanding
shares of common stock, either event occurring without the prior consent of
ChevronTexaco. The ChevronTexaco Series A Participating Preferred Stock that
the holder of a Right is entitled to receive and the purchase price payable
upon exercise of the ChevronTexaco Right are both subject to adjustment. The
person or group who acquired 10 percent or more of the outstanding shares of
common stock without the prior consent of ChevronTexaco would not be entitled
to this purchase.

The Rights will expire in November 2008, or they may be redeemed by the
company at 1 cent per Right prior to that date. The Rights do not have voting
or dividend rights and until they become exercisable, have no dilutive effect
on the earnings per share of the company. Five million shares of the company’s
preferred stock have been designated Series A Participating Preferred Stock and
reserved for issuance upon exercise of the Rights. No event during 2001 made
the Rights exercisable.

In 1989, Texaco established a similar stockholder rights plan and reserved
and designated 3 million shares as Series D for issuance upon exercise of the
Rights. Prior to the merger, the Rights were not exercisable nor did they
become exercisable upon the merger. Immediately after the merger, the Texaco
Rights and Series D Junior Participating Preferred Stock were delisted and the
Texaco stockholder rights plan was terminated.

During 2000 and until June 2001, there were 1,200 shares of Texaco
cumulative variable rate preferred stock, called Market Auction Preferred
Shares (MAPS), outstanding with an aggregate value of $300. The MAPS were
redeemed in June 2001, at a liquidation preference of $250,000 per share, plus
premium and accrued and unpaid dividends.

At December 31, 2001, 30 million shares of ChevronTexaco’s authorized but
unissued common stock were reserved for issuance under the ChevronTexaco
Corporation Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), which was approved by the
stockholders in 1990. To date, all of the plan’s common stock requirements have
been met from the company’s treasury stock, and there have been no issuances of
reserved shares.

NOTE 10. FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

Commodity Derivative Instruments

ChevronTexaco is exposed to market risks
related to price volatility of crude oil, refined products, natural gas and
refinery feedstock.

The company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage this exposure
on a small portion of its activity including: firm commitments and anticipated
transactions for the purchase or sale of crude oil, feedstock purchases for
company refineries, crude oil and refined products inventories, and fixed price
contracts to sell natural gas and natural gas liquids.

The company also uses derivative commodity instruments for limited trading
purposes.

The company maintains a policy of requiring that an International Swaps
and Derivatives Association Master Agreement govern derivative contracts with
certain counterparties to mitigate credit risk. Depending on the nature of the
derivative transaction, bilateral collateral arrangements may also be required.
When the company is engaged in more than one outstanding derivative transaction
with the same counterparty and also has a legally enforceable master netting
agreement with that counterparty, the “net” mark-to-market exposure represents
the netting of the positive and negative exposures with that counterparty and a
reasonable measure of the company’s credit risk. It is the company’s policy to
use other master netting agreements with all counterparties with which it
conducts significant transactions.

The fair values of the outstanding contracts are reported on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet as “Accounts and notes receivable,” “Accounts
payable,” “Long-term receivables – net,” and “Deferred credits and other
noncurrent obligations.” Gains and losses on the company’s risk management
activities are reported as either “Sales and other operating revenues” or
“Purchased crude oil and products,” whereas trading gains and losses are
reported as “Other income.” These activities are reported under “Operating
activities” in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

Foreign Currency

The company enters into forward exchange contracts, generally
with terms of 180 days or less, to manage some of its foreign currency
exposures. These exposures include revenue and anticipated purchase
transactions, including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease
commitments, forecasted to occur within 180 days. The forward exchange
contracts are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains
and losses reflected in income.

The fair values of the outstanding contracts are reported on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet as “Accounts and notes receivable” or “Accounts
payable,” with gains and losses reported as “Other income.” These activities
are reported under “Operating activities” in the Consolidated Statement of Cash
Flows.

Interest Rates

The company enters into interest rate swaps as part of its
overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. Under the terms
of the swaps, net cash settlements are based on the difference between
fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts calculated by reference to agreed
notional principal amounts. Interest rate swaps related to a portion of the
company’s fixed-rate debt are accounted for as fair value hedges, whereas
interest rate swaps related to a portion of the company’s floating-rate debt
are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses
reflected in income.

FS-27


Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Millions of dollars, except per-share amounts

NOTE 10. FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

- Continued

During 2001, no new swaps were initiated in connection with debt issues in the
year. At year-end 2001, the weighted average maturity of interest rate swaps
was approximately five years.

Fair values of the interest rate swaps are reported on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet as “Accounts and notes receivables” or “Accounts payable,” with
gains and losses reported directly in income as part of “Interest and debt
expense.” These activities are reported under “Operating activities” in the
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

The company’s financial instruments that are
exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of its cash
equivalents, marketable securities, derivative financial instruments and trade
receivables. The company’s short-term investments are placed with a wide array
of financial institutions with high credit ratings. This diversified investment
policy limits the company’s exposure both to credit risk and to concentrations
of credit risk. Similar standards of diversity and creditworthiness are applied
to the company’s counterparties in derivative instruments.

The trade receivable balances, reflecting the company’s diversified
sources of revenue, are dispersed among the company’s broad customer base
worldwide. As a consequence, concentrations of credit risk are limited. The
company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers. Letters of
credit or negotiated contracts, when the financial strength of a customer is
not considered sufficient, are the principal securities obtained to support
lines of credit.

Fair Value

Fair values are derived either from quoted market prices or, if not
available, the present value of the expected cash flows. The fair values
reflect the cash that would have been received or paid if the instruments were
settled at year-end.

Long-term debt of $6,599 and $8,870 had estimated fair values of $7,097
and $8,991 at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

The company holds cash equivalents and U.S. dollar marketable securities
in domestic and offshore portfolios. Eurodollar bonds, floating-rate notes,
time deposits and commercial paper are the primary instruments held. Cash
equivalents and marketable securities had fair values of $2,449 and $2,543 at
December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Of these balances, $1,446 and $1,630
at the respective year-ends were classified as cash equivalents that had
average maturities under 90 days. The remainder, classified as marketable
securities, had average maturities of approximately 3.6 years.

The company’s $1,500 investment in redeemable, convertible preferred stock of
its Dynegy affiliate is carried at fair value.

NOTE 11. OPERATING SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

ChevronTexaco separately manages its exploration and production; refining,
marketing and transportation; and chemicals businesses. The company’s primary
country of operation is the United States, its country of domicile. The
remainder of the company’s operations is reported as International (outside the
United States).

Segment Earnings

The company evaluates the performance of its operating
segments on an after-tax basis, without considering the effects of debt
financing interest expense or investment interest income, both of which are
managed by the company on a worldwide basis. Corporate administrative costs and
assets are not allocated to the operating segments; instead, operating segments
are billed only for direct corporate services. Nonbillable costs and merger
effects remain as corporate expenses. After-tax segment income (loss) is
presented in the following table.

Segment Assets

Segment assets do not include intercompany investments or
intercompany receivables. “All Other” assets consist primarily of worldwide
cash and marketable securities, real estate, information systems, the
investment in Dynegy Inc., coal mining operations, power and gasification
operations, and technology investments and merger-related assets held for sale
at year-end 2001. Segment assets at year-end 2001 and 2000 follow.

FS-28


NOTE 11. OPERATING SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA —

Continued

Segment Sales and Other Operating Revenues

Revenues for the exploration and
production segment are derived primarily from the production of crude oil and
natural gas. Revenues for the refining, marketing and transportation segment
are derived from the refining and marketing of petroleum products, such as
gasoline, jet fuel, gas oils, kerosene, residual fuel oils and other products
derived from crude oil. This segment also generates revenues from the
transportation and trading of crude oil and refined products. Prior to the July
2000 formation of CPChem, chemicals segment revenues were derived from the
manufacture and sale of petrochemicals, plastic resins, and lube oil and fuel
additives. Subsequent to the formation of the joint venture, only revenues from
the manufacture and sale of lube oil and fuel additives were included.

“All Other” activities include corporate administrative costs, worldwide
cash management and debt financing activities, coal mining operations, power
and gasification operations, technology investments, insurance operations and
real estate activities. Other than the United States, the only country where
ChevronTexaco generates significant revenues is the United Kingdom, which
amounted to $10,350, $12,101 and $9,650 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Sales revenues are based on the origin of the sale.

Reportable operating segment “Sales and other operating revenues,”
including internal transfers, for the years 2001, 2000 and 1999 are presented
in the following table. Sales from the transfer of products between segments
are at prices that approximate market prices.

Segment Income Taxes

NOTE 12. LITIGATION

Chevron, Texaco and four other oil companies (refiners) filed suit in 1995
contesting the validity of a patent granted to Unocal Corporation (Unocal) for
reformulated gasoline, which ChevronTexaco sells in California in certain
months of the year. In March 2000, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit upheld a September 1998 District Court decision that Unocal’s patent
was valid and enforceable and assessed damages of 5.75 cents per gallon for
gasoline produced in infringement of the patent. In May 2000, the Federal
Circuit Court denied a petition for rehearing with the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit filed by the refiners in this case. The refiners
petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court and, in February 2001, the Supreme Court
denied the petition to review the lower court’s ruling and the case was
remanded to the District Court for an accounting of all infringing gasoline
produced from August 1, 1996, to September 30, 2000. The District Court granted
Unocal’s motion for summary judgment requesting an accounting and denied the
refiners’ motion to stay the proceedings and vacate the accounting order.
However, the judge presiding over this case recused himself before entering a
final judgment and a new judge was assigned. Additionally, in May 2001, the
U.S. Patent Office (USPO) granted the refiners’ petition to re-examine the
validity of Unocal’s patent and, in February 2002, the USPO ruled the patent
invalid. Unocal has two months to respond to the USPO ruling. The Federal Trade
Commission has also announced that it is investigating whether Unocal’s failure
to disclose to the California Air Resources Board
that it had filed a patent application was unfair competition, which may make
Unocal’s patent unenforceable.

If Unocal’s patent ultimately is upheld and is enforceable, the company’s
financial exposure includes royalties, plus interest, for production of
gasoline that is proved to have infringed the patent. Chevron and Texaco, as
well as Texaco’s former affiliates Equilon and Motiva, have been accruing in the
normal course of business any future estimated liability for potential
infringement of the patent covered by the trial court’s ruling. In 2000,
Chevron and Texaco made payments to Unocal totaling approximately $28 for the
original court ruling, including interest and fees.

Unocal has obtained additional patents for alternate formulations that
could affect a larger share of U.S. gasoline production. ChevronTexaco believes
these additional patents are invalid and unenforceable. However, if such
patents are ultimately upheld, the competitive and financial effects on the
company’s refining and marketing operations, while presently indeterminable,
could be material.

Another issue involving the company is the petroleum industry’s use of
methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) as a gasoline additive and its potential
environmental impact through seepage into groundwater. Along with other oil
companies, the company is a party to lawsuits
and claims related to the use of the chemical MTBE in certain oxygenated
gasolines. These actions may require the company to correct or ameliorate the
alleged effects on the environment of prior release of MTBE by the company or
other parties. Additional lawsuits and claims related to the use of MTBE,
including personal-injury claims, may be filed in the future. Costs to the
company related to these lawsuits and claims are not currently determinable.
ChevronTexaco continues the use of MTBE in gasoline it sells in certain areas.
The state of California has directed that MTBE be phased out of the
manufacturing process by the end of 2002.

NOTE 13. LEASE COMMITMENTS

Certain noncancelable leases are classified as capital leases, and the leased
assets are included as part of “Properties, plant and equipment, at cost.” Such
leasing arrangements involve tanker charters, crude oil production and
processing equipment, service stations and other facilities. Other leases are
classified as operating leases and are not capitalized. The payments on such
leases are recorded as expense. Details of the capitalized leased assets are as
follows:

Rental expenses incurred for operating leases during 2001, 2000 and 1999 were
as follows:

FS-30


NOTE 13. LEASE COMMITMENTS —

Continued

Contingent rentals are based on factors other than the passage of time,
principally sales volumes at leased service stations. Certain leases include
escalation clauses for adjusting rentals to reflect changes in price indices,
renewal options ranging from one to 25 years, and/or options to purchase the
leased property during or at the end of the initial or renewal lease period for
the fair market value or other specified amount at that time.

At December 31, 2001, the estimated future minimum lease payments (net of
noncancelable sublease rentals) under operating and capital leases, which at
inception had a noncancelable term of more than one year, were as follows:

NOTE 14. INVESTMENTS AND ADVANCES

Descriptions of major affiliates during 2001 are as follows:

Tengizchevroil

Tengizchevroil (TCO) is a joint venture formed in 1993 to
develop the Tengiz and Korolev oil fields in Kazakhstan over a 40-year period.
Chevron’s ownership was 45 percent during 1999 and 2000. In January 2001, the
company purchased an additional 5 percent interest. Upon formation of the joint
venture, the company incurred an obligation of $420, payable to the Republic of
Kazakhstan upon attainment of a dedicated export system with the capability of
the greater of 260,000 barrels of oil per day or TCO’s production capacity. As
a part of the January transaction, the company paid $210 of the $420
obligation. The $420 was also included in the carrying value of the original
investment, as the company believed, beyond a reasonable doubt, that its full
payment would be made.

Equilon Enterprises LLC

Effective January 1, 1998, Texaco and Shell Oil Company
(Shell) formed Equilon, a Delaware limited liability company. Equilon is a
joint venture that combined major elements of those companies’ western and
midwestern U.S. refining and marketing businesses and their nationwide trading,
transportation and lubricants businesses. The company’s 44 percent ownership
interest in Equilon was placed in trust on October 9, 2001, as required by the
FTC. The trust completed the disposition of the company’s investment in Equilon
in February 2002.

Because Equilon is a limited liability company, ChevronTexaco recorded the
provision for income taxes and related income tax liability applicable to its
share of the venture’s income separately in its consolidated financial
statements.

See Note 2 for additional information on Equilon.

Motiva Enterprises LLC

Effective July 1, 1998, Texaco, Shell and Saudi Refining
Inc., a corporate affiliate of Saudi Aramco, formed Motiva, a Delaware limited
liability company. Motiva is a joint venture that combined the East and Gulf
Coast U.S. refining and marketing businesses of Shell and Star Enterprise
(Star). Star, in turn, was a joint venture owned 50 percent each by Texaco and
Saudi Refining Inc.

Under the terms of the Limited Liability Company Agreement for Motiva, the
ownership in Motiva is subject to annual adjustment through year-end 2005,
based on the performance of the assets contributed to Motiva. Accordingly, the
company’s initial 32.5 percent ownership in Motiva was adjusted effective as of
January 1, 2000, to just under 31 percent. At January 1, 2001, the company’s
ownership percentage was adjusted to 35 percent. The company’s ownership
interest in Motiva was placed in trust on October 9, 2001, as required by the
FTC. The trust completed the disposition of the company’s investment in Motiva
in February 2002.

Because Motiva is a limited liability company, ChevronTexaco recorded the
provision for income taxes and related income tax liability applicable to its
share of the venture’s income separately in its consolidated financial
statements.

See Note 2 for additional information on Motiva.

LG-Caltex Corporation

ChevronTexaco owns 50 percent of LG-Caltex, a joint
venture formed in 1967 between the LG Group and Caltex, originally incorporated
as Honam Oil Refinery Company Limited, to engage in importing, refining and
marketing of petroleum products in Korea.

Star Petroleum Refining Company, Ltd.

ChevronTexaco has a 64 percent equity
ownership interest in Star Petroleum Refining Company Limited (SPRC), which
owns the Star refinery at Ma Ta Phut, Thailand. The Thai national petroleum
company owns the remaining 36 percent of SPRC.

Caltex Australia Ltd.

ChevronTexaco has a 50 percent equity ownership interest
in Caltex Australia Limited, which is the largest oil company in Australia. The
remaining 50 percent of Caltex Australia is publicly owned.

Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC

ChevronTexaco owns 50 percent of CPChem,
formed in July 2000 when Chevron merged most of its petrochemicals businesses
with those of Phillips Petroleum Company. Because CPChem is a limited liability
company, ChevronTexaco records the provision for income taxes and related tax
liability applicable to its share of the venture’s income separately in its
consolidated financial statements.

Dynegy Inc.

Dynegy is a gatherer, processor, transporter and marketer of energy
products in North America and the United Kingdom. These products include
natural gas, natural gas liquids, crude oil and electricity. In 2001,
ChevronTexaco exercised its preemptive rights and acquired a further 1.2
million shares of Dynegy’s common stock for $40.8. This additional investment
maintained the company’s equity ownership in Dynegy at approximately 26.5
percent. Also, in 2001, ChevronTexaco invested $1,500 in Dynegy redeemable,
convertible preferred stock. The market value of ChevronTexaco’s share of
Dynegy common stock at December 31, 2001, was $2,206, based on equivalent
closing market prices. The fair value of the redeemable convertible preferred
stock was $1,500.

NOTE 16. TAXES

The above table does not include a current U.S. tax benefit of $2 and a
U.S. deferred tax benefit of $142 associated with the extraordinary item.

In 2001, before-tax income, including related corporate and other charges,
for U.S. operations was $1,778, compared with $5,823 in 2000 and $1,738 in
1999. For international operations, before-tax income was $6,513, $8,226 and
$4,074 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. U.S. federal income tax expense
was reduced by $202, $165 and $156 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, for
business tax credits.

The company’s effective income tax rate varied from the U.S. statutory
federal income tax rate because of the following:

The increase in the 2001 effective tax rate was primarily due to U.S.
before-tax income (generally subject to a lower tax rate) being a significantly
smaller percentage of overall before-tax income in 2001 compared with 2000. The
decline in the U.S. before-tax income arose primarily because substantially all
of the 2001 merger-related expenses were associated with operations in the
United States.

The company records its deferred taxes on a tax-jurisdiction basis and
classifies those net amounts as current or noncurrent based on the balance
sheet classification of the related assets or liabilities.

The reported deferred tax balances are composed of the following:

The valuation allowance relates to foreign tax credit carryforwards, tax
loss carryforwards and temporary differences that are not expected to be
realized.

At December 31, 2001 and 2000, deferred taxes were classified in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows:

It is the company’s policy for subsidiaries included in the U.S.
consolidated tax return to record income tax expense as though they filed
separately, with the parent recording the adjustment to income tax expense for
the effects of consolidation. Income taxes are accrued for retained earnings of
international subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures intended to be
remitted. Income taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international
operations that have been or are intended to be reinvested indefinitely.

Undistributed earnings of international consolidated subsidiaries and
affiliates for which no deferred income tax provision has been made for possible
future remittances totaled approximately $9,003 at December 31, 2001.
Substantially all of this amount represents earnings reinvested as part of the
company’s ongoing business. It is not practical to estimate the amount of taxes
that might be payable on the eventual remittance of such earnings. On
remittance, certain countries impose withholding taxes that, subject to certain
limitations, are then available for use as tax credits against a U.S. tax
liability, if any.

NOTE 17. SHORT-TERM DEBT

*

Weighted-average interest rates at December 31, 2001 and 2000, were 1.99
percent and 6.57 percent, respectively, including the effect of interest rate
swaps.

Redeemable long-term obligations consist primarily of tax-exempt
variable-rate put bonds that are included as current liabilities because they
become redeemable at the option of the bondholders during the year following
the balance sheet date.

The company periodically enters into interest rate swaps on a portion of
its short-term debt. See Note 10 for information concerning the company’s
debt-related derivative activities.

Utilized lines of credit available for short-term financing totaled $210 at
December 31, 2001.

At December 31, 2001, the company had $3,200 of committed credit facilities
with banks worldwide, which permit the company to refinance short-term
obligations on a long-term basis. The facilities support the company’s
commercial paper borrowings. Interest on borrowings under the terms of specific
agreements may be based on the London Interbank Offered Rate, the Reserve
Adjusted Domestic Certificate of Deposit Rate or bank prime rate. No amounts
were outstanding under these credit agreements during 2001 or at year-end.

At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the company classified $3,200 and $5,143,
respectively, of short-term debt as long-term. Settlement of these obligations
is not expected to require the use of working capital in 2002, as the company
has both the intent and ability to refinance this debt on a long-term basis.

NOTE 18. LONG-TERM DEBT

ChevronTexaco has three “shelf” registrations on file with the Securities and
Exchange Commission that together would permit the issuance of $2,800 of debt
securities pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933.

1 Guarantee of ESOP debt.

2 Less than $150 individually; weighted-average interest rates at December 31,
2001.

Consolidated long-term debt maturing after December 31, 2001, is as
follows: 2002 — $1,095; 2003 — $536; 2004 — $857; 2005 — $570; and 2006 — $195;
after 2006 — $3,346.

NOTE 19. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

The company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement
No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (FAS
133), as amended by FAS 138, “Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and
Certain Hedging Activities — an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133,” effective
January 1, 2001. The adoption of FAS 133 and FAS 138 did not have a significant
impact on the company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

Recent interpretations of FAS 133 and FAS 138 by the FASB Derivatives
Implementation Group prescribe mark-to-market accounting for certain natural
gas sales contracts. Some of these interpretations became effective January 1,
2002. Adoption at that time did not result in a material effect to earnings.
The effect of subsequent changes in the contracts’ fair values is uncertain.

In September 2000, the FASB issued Statement No. 140, “Accounting for
Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities
- - A Replacement of FASB Statement No. 125” (FAS 140). FAS 140 is effective for
transfers occurring after March 31, 2001, and for disclosures relating to
securitization transactions and collateral for fiscal years ending after
December 15, 2000. Adoption of FAS 140 had no significant effect on
ChevronTexaco’s accounting or disclosures for the types of transactions in the
scope of the new standard.

In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 141, “Business Combinations”
(FAS 141), Statement No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (FAS 142)
and Statement No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” (FAS 143).
FAS 141 is effective for all business combinations initiated after June 30,
2001, and for all business combinations accounted for using the purchase method
for which the date of acquisition is July 1, 2001, or later. FAS 142 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, except for
goodwill and intangible assets acquired after June 30, 2001, which were
immediately subject to the amortization and nonamortization provisions of the
Statement. FAS 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002.
Adoption of FAS 141 will have no effect on the company’s pooling-of-interests
method of accounting for the Texaco merger transaction, but will affect future
transactions. Similarly, adoption of FAS 142 may affect future transactions,
but is not expected to have an effect on the company’s prior business
combinations. FAS 143 differs in several significant respects from current
accounting for asset retirements obligations under FAS 19, “Financial
Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies.” Adoption of FAS
143 will affect future accounting and reporting of the assets, liabilities and
expenses related to these obligations. The magnitude of the effect has not yet
been determined.

In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 144, “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (FAS 144). FAS 144 is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, with initial application
effective as of the beginning of the fiscal year adopted. Adoption of FAS 144
will not affect assets classified as held for disposal as a result of disposal
activities that were initiated prior to its initial application, but may affect
future disposals.

NOTE 20. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits

The company has defined benefit
pension plans for most employees and provides for certain health care and life
insurance plans for active and qualifying retired employees. For the pension
plans, the company is required to satisfy the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act minimum funding standard. The company’s annual contributions for
medical and dental benefits are limited to the lesser of actual medical and
dental claims or a defined fixed per-capita amount. Life insurance benefits are
paid by the company, and annual contributions are based on actual plan
experience. Unfunded pension and postretirement benefits are paid directly when
incurred; accordingly, these payments are not reflected as changes in plan
assets in the following table.

The status of the company’s pension plans and other postretirement benefit
plans for 2001 and 2000 is as follows:

Primarily relates to a special involuntary termination enhancement to pension
and postretirement benefits under the Texaco change-in-control program in 2001
and a special involuntary termination enhancement to pension benefits in 1999

The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value
of plan assets for pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess
of plan assets were $2,496, $2,187 and $1,269, respectively, at December 31,
2001, and $850, $737 and $33, respectively, at December 31, 2000.

For postretirement benefit measurement purposes, one set of health care
cost-trend rates was used for pre-age 65 and post-age 65 retirees. Starting in
2002, with approximately an 11 percent cost increase over the previous year,
the trend rates gradually drop to the ultimate rate of 4.5 percent over 5
years. A one-percentage-point change in the assumed health care cost-trend
rates would have had the following effects:

Profit Sharing/Savings

Plan Eligible employees of ChevronTexaco and certain of
its subsidiaries participate in either the Chevron Profit Sharing/Savings Plan
or the Employees Thrift Plan of Texaco. Charges to expense for these plans were
$157, $63 and $64 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOP)

In December 1989, Chevron established a
leveraged ESOP as part of the Profit Sharing/Savings Plan. The ESOP provides a
partial prefunding of the company’s future commitments to the Profit Sharing/
Savings Plan, which will result in annual income tax savings for the company.

In 1988, Texaco established a leveraged ESOP as part of the Employees
Thrift Plan of Texaco Inc. The Thrift Plan ESOP loan was satisfied in December
2000. The ESOP was designed to provide participants with a benefit of
approximately 6 percent of base pay.

As permitted by American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA)
Statement of Position 93-6, “Employers’ Accounting for Employee Stock Ownership
Plans,” the company has elected to continue its practices, which are based on
Statement of Position 76-3, “Accounting Practices for Certain Employee Stock
Ownership Plans,” and subsequent consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force of
the
Financial Accounting Standards Board. The debt of the ESOPs is recorded as
debt, and shares pledged as collateral are reported as “Deferred compensation
and benefit plan trust” in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the Consolidated
Statement of Stockholders’ Equity. The company reports compensation expense
equal to ESOP debt principal repayments less dividends received by the ESOPs.
Interest incurred on the ESOP debt is recorded as interest expense. Dividends
paid on ESOP shares are reflected as a reduction of retained earnings. All ESOP
shares are considered outstanding for earnings-per-share computations.

Expense recorded for the ESOPs was $75, $26 and $62 in 2001, 2000 and
1999, respectively, including $62, $48 and $51 of interest expense related to
ESOP debt. All dividends paid on the ESOP shares held are used to service the
ESOP debt. The dividends used were $86, $77 and $63 in 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.

The company made ESOP contributions of $75, $1 and $67 in 2001, 2000 and
1999, respectively, to satisfy ESOP debt service in excess of dividends
received by the ESOP. The ESOP shares were pledged as collateral for the debt.
Shares are released from a suspense account and allocated to the accounts of
plan participants, based on the debt service deemed to be paid in the year in
proportion to the total of current-year and remaining debt service. The charge
(credit) to compensation expense was $13, $(22) and $11 in 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. ESOP shares

Benefit Plan Trust

Texaco established a benefit plan trust for funding
obligations under some of its benefit plans. At year-end 2001, the trust
contained 7.1 million shares of ChevronTexaco treasury stock. The company
intends to continue to pay its obligations under the benefit plans. The trust
will use the shares, proceeds from the sale of such shares and dividends on
such shares to pay benefits only to the extent that the company does not pay
such benefits. The trustee will vote the shares held in the trust as instructed
by the trust’s beneficiaries. The shares held by the trust are not considered
outstanding for earnings-per-share purposes until distributed or sold by the
trust in payment of benefit obligations.

Management Incentive Plans

Chevron had two incentive plans, the Management
Incentive Plan (MIP) and the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) for officers and
other regular salaried employees of the company and its subsidiaries who hold
positions of significant responsibility. The plans will be expanded to include
former employees of Texaco and Caltex. The MIP is an annual cash incentive plan
that links awards to performance results of the prior year. The cash awards may
be deferred by conversion to stock units or other investment fund alternatives.
Awards under the LTIP may take the form of, but are not limited to, stock
options, restricted stock, stock units and nonstock grants. Texaco also had a
cash incentive program and a Stock Incentive Plan (SIP) that included stock
options, restricted stock and other incentive awards for executives, directors
and key employees. Awards under the Caltex LTIP were in the form of performance
units and stock appreciation rights. Charges to expense
for the combined management incentive plans, excluding expense related to LTIP
and SIP stock options and restricted stock awards, which are discussed in Note
21, were $93, $83 and $54 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Other Incentive Plans

Chevron had a program that provided eligible employees
with an annual cash bonus if the company achieved certain financial and safety
goals. The program was expanded to include former employees of Texaco and
Caltex post-merger. Texaco and Caltex also had similar programs. Charges for
the combined programs were $154, $230 and $60 in 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.

NOTE 21. STOCK OPTIONS

The company applies APB Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations in
accounting for its stock-based compensation programs, which are described
below. Stock-based compensation expense recognized in connection with these
programs was $111, $23 and $21 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Had compensation cost for the company’s combined stock options been determined
based on the fair market value at the grant dates of the awards consistent with
the methodology prescribed by FAS No. 123, net income and earnings per share
for 2001, 2000 and 1999 would have been the pro forma amounts shown on the
following table:

The effects of applying FAS No. 123 in this pro forma disclosure are not
indicative of future amounts. FAS No. 123 does not apply to awards granted
prior to 1995. In addition, certain options vest over several years, and awards
in future years, whose terms and conditions may vary, are anticipated.

Broad-Based Employee Stock Options

In 1996, Chevron granted to all its eligible
employees an option for 150 shares of stock or equivalents at an exercise price
of $51.875 per share. In addition, a portion of the awards granted under the
LTIP had terms similar to the broad-based employee stock options. The options
vested in June 1997.

Options for 7,204,800 shares, including similar-termed LTIP awards, were
granted for this program in 1996, and the program expired in 1999.

In 1998, Chevron announced another broad-based Employee Stock Option
Program that granted to all eligible employees an option that varied from 100
to 300 shares of stock or equivalents, dependent on the employee’s salary or
job grade. These options vested after two years in February 2000. Options for
4,820,800 shares were awarded at an exercise price of $76.3125 per share.
Outstanding option shares were 3,064,367 at year-end 2000. In 2001, exercises
of 653,096 and forfeitures of 44,960 reduced the outstanding option shares to
2,366,311 at the end of the year. The options expire February 11, 2008. The
company recorded expenses of $1, $(2) and $4 for these options in 2001, 2000
and 1999, respectively.

The fair value of each option share for the 1998 program on the date of
grant under FAS No. 123 was estimated at $19.08 using the average results of
Black-Scholes models for the preceding 10 years. The 10-year averages of each
assumption used by the Black-Scholes models were: a risk-free interest rate of
7.0 percent, a dividend yield of 4.2 percent, an expected life of seven years
and a volatility of 24.7 percent.

Long-Term Incentive Plan

Stock options granted under the LTIP are generally
awarded at market price on the date of grant and are exercisable not earlier
than one year and not later than 10 years from the date of grant. However, a
portion of the LTIP options granted in 1996 had terms similar to the
broad-based employee stock options. The maximum number of shares that may be
granted each year is 1 percent of the total outstanding shares of common stock
as of January 1 of such year.

Under the Texaco Stock Incentive Plan (SIP), the maximum number of shares
that were granted as stock options or restricted stock was 1 percent of the
common stock outstanding on December 31 of the previous year. Restricted shares
granted under SIP

contained a performance element, which had to be satisfied in order for
all or a specified portion of the shares to vest. Upon the merger, all
restricted shares became vested and converted to ChevronTexaco shares at the
merger exchange ratio of 0.77. Restricted performance shares awarded in each
year under the SIP on a converted basis were as follows:

Stock options granted under the SIP extend for 10 years from the date of
grant and vest over a two-year period at a rate of 50 percent in the first year
and 50 percent in the second year. The exercise price cannot be less than the
fair market value of the underlying shares of common stock on the date of the
grant. The plan provides for restored options. This feature enables a
participant who exercises a stock option by exchanging previously acquired
common stock or who has shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations
to receive new options equal to the number of shares exchanged or withheld. The
restored options are fully exercisable six months after the date of grant and
the exercise price is the fair market value of the common stock on the day the
restored option is granted. Amounts charged to compensation expense in 2001,
2000 and 1999 were $110, $25 and $19.

The fair market value of each stock option granted is estimated on the
date of grant under FAS No. 123 using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
with the following weighted-average assumptions:

The Black-Scholes weighted-average fair value of the Chevron options
granted during 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $20.45, $22.34 and $20.40 per share,
respectively, and the weighted-average fair value of the Texaco options granted
during 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $12.90, $11.56 and $11.21 per share.

Upon the merger, outstanding Texaco stock options were converted to
ChevronTexaco options at the merger exchange rate of 0.77. The following table
presents the combined stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2001, 2000
and 1999, with information on Texaco’s stock options on a converted basis. This
table excludes Chevron LTIP awards granted with terms similar to the
broad-based employee stock options:

The following table summarizes information on stock options outstanding at December 31, 2001:

NOTE 22. OTHER CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS

The U.S. federal income tax liabilities have been settled through 1993 for
Chevron and Caltex and through 1991 for Texaco. The company’s California
franchise tax liabilities have been settled through 1991 for Chevron and 1987
for Texaco.

Settlement of open tax years, as well as tax issues in other countries
where the company conducts its businesses, is not expected to have a material
effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the company and,
in the opinion of management, adequate provision has been made for income and
franchise taxes for all open years.

At December 31, 2001, the company and its subsidiaries, as direct or
indirect guarantors, had contingent liabilities of $1,118 for notes of
affiliated companies and $742 for notes of others. Following the February 2002
disposition of the interests in

FS-40


NOTE 22. OTHER CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS

– Continued

Equilon and Motiva, contingent liabilities for notes of affiliated companies
were reduced by $432.

The company and its subsidiaries have certain other contingent liabilities
relating to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments,
throughput agreements and take-or-pay agreements, some of which relate to
suppliers’ financing arrangements. The aggregate amounts of required payments
under these various commitments are 2002 – $1,370; 2003 – $1,402; 2004 –
$1,302; 2005 – $1,179; 2006 – $1,094; 2007 and after – $1,311. Total payments
under the agreements were $1,509 in 2001, $1,506 in 2000 and $1,165 in 1999.

The company has commitments related to preferred shares of subsidiary
companies, which are accounted for as minority interest. MVP Production Inc., a
subsidiary, has variable rate cumulative preferred shares of $75 owned by one
minority holder. The shares are voting and are redeemable in 2003. Dividends on
these shares were $4 in 2001, 2000 and 1999. Texaco Capital LLC, a wholly owned
finance subsidiary, has issued $65 of Deferred Preferred Shares, Series C.
Dividends amounting to $59 on Series C, at a rate of 7.17 percent compounded
annually, will be paid at the redemption date of February 28, 2005, unless
earlier redemption occurs. Early redemption may result upon the occurrence of
certain specific events.

ChevronTexaco provided certain indemnities of contingent liabilities of
Equilon and Motiva to Shell Oil and Saudi Refining Inc. as part of the
agreement for the sale of the company’s interests in those investments.
Generally, the indemnities provided are limited to contingent liabilities that
may become actual liabilities within 18 months of the sale of the company’s
interests, and are reduced by any reserves that were established prior to the
sale. Excluding environmental liabilities, the company’s financial exposure
related to those indemnities is limited to $300. Additionally, the company has
provided indemnities for certain environmental liabilities arising out of
conditions that existed prior to the formation of Equilon and Motiva and during
the periods of ChevronTexaco’s ownership interest in those entities as well as
for customary representations and warranties within the agreements.

The company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to environmental
laws and regulations that in the future may require the company to take action
to correct or ameliorate the effects on the environment of prior release of
chemical or petroleum substances, including MTBE, by the company or other
parties. Such contingencies may exist for various sites, including but not
limited to: Superfund sites and refineries, oil fields, service stations,
terminals, and land development areas, whether operating, closed or sold. The
amount of such future cost is indeterminable due to such factors as the unknown
magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the
corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the company’s
liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which
such costs are recoverable from third parties. While the company has provided
for known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable,
the amount of future costs may be material to results of operations in the
period in which they are recognized. The company does not expect these costs
will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or
liquidity. Also, the company does not believe its obligations to make such
expenditures have had, or will have, any significant impact on the company’s
competitive position relative to other U.S. or international petroleum or
chemicals concerns.

ChevronTexaco receives claims from, and submits claims to, customers,
trading partners, U.S. federal, state and local regulatory bodies, host
governments, contractors, insurers, and suppliers. The amounts of these claims,
individually and in the aggregate, may be significant and take lengthy periods
to resolve.

The company believes it has no material market or credit risks to its
operations, financial position or liquidity as a result of its commodities and
other derivatives activities, including forward exchange contracts and interest
rate swaps. However, the results of operations and the financial position of
certain equity affiliates may be affected by their business activities involving
the use of derivative instruments.

The company’s operations, particularly exploration and production, can be
affected by other changing economic, regulatory and political environments in
the various countries in which it operates, including the United States. In
certain locations, host governments have imposed restrictions, controls and
taxes, and in others, political conditions have existed that may threaten the
safety of employees and the company’s continued presence in those countries.
Internal unrest or strained relations between a host government and the company
or other governments may affect the company’s operations. Those developments
have, at times, significantly affected the company’s related operations and
results, and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level
of current and future activity in such countries.

For oil and gas producing operations, ownership agreements may provide for
periodic reassessments of equity interests in estimated oil and gas reserves.
These activities, individually or together, may result in gains or losses that
could be material to earnings in any given period. One such equity
redetermination process has been under way since 1996 for ChevronTexaco’s
interests in four producing zones at the Naval Petroleum Reserve at Elk Hills
in California, for the time when the remaining interests in these zones were
owned by the U.S. Department of Energy. A wide range remains for a possible net
settlement amount for the four zones. ChevronTexaco currently estimates its
maximum possible net before-tax liability at less than $400. At the same time,
a possible maximum net amount that could be owed to
ChevronTexaco is estimated at more than $200. The timing of the settlement
and the exact amount within this range of estimates are uncertain.

Areas in which the company and its affiliates have significant operations
include the United States of America, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom,
Norway, Denmark, Kuwait, Republic of Congo, Angola, Nigeria, Chad, Equatorial
Guinea, Democratic Republic of Congo, South Africa, Indonesia, Papua New
Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, China, Thailand, Venezuela, Argentina,
Brazil, Colombia, Trinidad and Korea. The company’s Tengizchevroil affiliate
operates in Kazakhstan. The company’s Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC
affiliate manufactures and markets a wide range of petrochemicals and plastics
on a worldwide basis, with manufacturing facilities in existence or under
construction in the United States, Puerto Rico, Singapore, China, South Korea,
Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Mexico and Belgium. The company’s Dynegy affiliate has

TABLE III – RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR OIL AND GAS PRODUCING ACTIVITIES


The company’s results of operations from oil and gas producing activities
for the years 2001, 2000 and 1999 are shown in the following table. Net income
from exploration and production activities as reported on page FS-5 reflects
income taxes computed on an effective rate basis. In accordance with FAS No.
69, income taxes in Table III are based on statutory tax rates, reflecting
allowable deductions and tax credits. Interest income and expense are excluded
from the results reported in Table III and from the net income amounts on page
FS-5.


The value of owned production consumed as fuel has been eliminated from
revenues and production expenses, and the related volumes have been deducted
from net production in calculating the unit average sales price and production
cost. This has no effect on the results of producing operations.


Includes gas processing fees, net sulfur income, foreign currency transaction
gains and losses, certain significant impairment write-downs, miscellaneous
expenses, etc. Also includes net income from related oil and gas activities
that do not have oil and gas reserves attributed to them (for example, net
income from technical and operating service agreements) and items identified in
the Management’s Discussion and Analysis on pages FS-5 and FS-6.

TABLE V – RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION

The company’s estimated net proved underground oil and gas reserves and changes
thereto for the years 2001, 2000 and 1999 are shown in the following table.
Proved reserves are estimated by company asset teams composed of earth
scientists and reservoir engineers. These proved reserve estimates are reviewed
annually by the company’s Reserves Advisory Committee to ensure that rigorous
professional standards and the reserves definitions prescribed by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission are consistently applied throughout the
company.

Proved reserves are the estimated quantities that geologic and engineering
data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years
from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Due to
the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, estimates
of underground reserves are subject to change as additional information becomes
available.

Proved reserves do not include additional quantities recoverable beyond
the term of the lease or concession agreement or that may result from
extensions of currently proved areas or from applying secondary or tertiary
recovery processes not yet tested and determined to be economic.

Proved developed reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered
through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods.

“Net” reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by others and
reflect contractual arrangements and royalty obligations in effect at the time
of the estimate.

TABLE V – RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION

– Continued

ChevronTexaco operates, under a risked service agreement, Venezuela’s
Block LL-652, located in the northeast section of Lake Maracaibo. ChevronTexaco
is accounting for LL-652 as an oil and gas activity and, at December 31, 2001,
had recorded 18 million barrels of proved crude oil reserves.

No reserve quantities have been recorded for the company’s other service
agreements – the Boscan Field in Venezuela and a long-term purchase agreement
associated with a service agreement for the Chuchupa Field in Colombia for the
period 2005 – 2016.

INFORMATION ON CANADIAN OIL SANDS NET PROVED RESERVES NOT INCLUDED ABOVE:

In addition to conventional liquids and natural gas proved reserves,
ChevronTexaco has significant interests in proved oil sands reserves in Canada
associated with the Athabasca project. For internal management purposes,
ChevronTexaco views these reserves and their development as an integral part of
total upstream operations. However, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
regulations define these reserves as mining-related and not a part of
conventional oil and gas reserves. Net proved oil sands reserves were 186
million barrels as of December 31, 2001. Production is expected to begin in
late 2002.

The oil sands reserves are not considered in the standardized measure of
discounted cash flows for conventional oil and gas reserves, which is found on
page FS-50.

TABLE VI – STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS RELATED TO PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES

The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, related to the
preceding proved oil and gas reserves, is calculated in accordance with the
requirements of FAS No. 69. Estimated future cash inflows from production are
computed by applying year-end prices for oil and gas to year-end quantities of
estimated net proved reserves. Future price changes are limited to those
provided by contractual arrangements in existence at the end of each reporting
year. Future development and production costs are those estimated future
expenditures necessary to develop and produce year-end estimated proved
reserves based on year-end cost indices, assuming continuation of year-end
economic conditions. Estimated future income taxes are calculated by applying
appropriate year-end statutory tax rates. These rates reflect allowable
deductions and tax credits and are applied to estimated future pretax net cash
flows, less the tax basis of related assets. Discounted future net cash flows
are calculated using 10 percent midperiod discount factors. Discounting
requires a year-by-year estimate of when future expenditures will be incurred
and when reserves will be produced.

The information provided does not represent management’s estimate of the
company’s expected future cash flows or value of proved oil and gas reserves.
Estimates of proved reserve quantities are imprecise and change over time as
new information becomes available. Moreover, probable and possible reserves,
which may become proved in the future, are excluded from the calculations. The
arbitrary valuation prescribed under FAS No. 69 requires assumptions as to the
timing and amount of future development and production costs. The calculations
are made as of December 31 each year and should not be relied upon as an
indication of the company’s future cash flows or value of its oil and gas
reserves.

FS-50


TABLE VII – CHANGES IN THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS FROM PROVED RESERVES

The changes in present values between years, which can be significant, reflect
changes in estimated proved reserve quantities and prices and assumptions used
in forecasting production volumes and costs. Changes in the timing of
production are included with “Revisions of previous quantity estimates.”
