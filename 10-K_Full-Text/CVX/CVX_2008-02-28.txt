CAUTIONARY
    STATEMENT RELEVANT TO FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

FOR THE PURPOSE OF “SAFE HARBOR” PROVISIONS OF THE

PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

This Annual Report on

Form 10-K

of Chevron Corporation contains forward-looking statements
    relating to Chevron’s operations that are based on
    management’s current expectations, estimates and
    projections about the petroleum, chemicals and other
    energy-related industries. Words such as
    “anticipates,” “expects,”
    “intends,” “plans,” “targets,”
    “projects,” “believes,” “seeks,”
    “schedules,” “estimates,”
    “budgets” and similar expressions are intended to
    identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are
    not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain
    risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond
    our control and are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual
    outcomes and results may differ materially from what is
    expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. The
    reader should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking
    statements, which speak only as of the date of this report.
    Unless legally required, Chevron undertakes no obligation to
    update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a

    Petroleum Exporting Countries); the potential liability for
    remedial actions under existing or future environmental
    regulations and litigation; significant investment or product
    changes under existing or future environmental statutes,
    regulations and litigation; the potential liability resulting
    from pending or future litigation; the company’s
    acquisition or disposition of assets; gains and losses from
    asset dispositions or impairments; government-mandated sales,
    divestitures, recapitalizations, changes in fiscal terms or
    restrictions on scope of company operations; foreign currency
    movements compared with the U.S. dollar; the effects of
    changed accounting rules under generally accepted accounting
    principles promulgated by rule-setting bodies; and the factors
    set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” on pages 32
    and 33 in this report. In addition, such statements could be
    affected by general domestic and international economic and
    political conditions. Unpredictable or unknown factors not
    discussed in this report could also have material adverse
    effects on forward-looking statements.

Item 1.

Business

(a)

General
    Development of Business

Summary
    Description of Chevron

Chevron
    Corporation,


a Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries
    and affiliates and provides administrative, financial,
    management and technology support to U.S. and international
    subsidiaries that engage in fully integrated petroleum
    operations, chemicals operations, mining operations, power
    generation and energy services. Exploration and production
    (upstream) operations consist of exploring for, developing and
    producing crude oil and natural gas and also marketing natural
    gas. Refining, marketing and transportation (downstream)
    operations relate to refining crude oil into finished petroleum
    products; marketing crude oil and the many products derived from
    petroleum; and transporting crude oil, natural gas and petroleum
    products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail
    car. Chemical operations include the manufacture and marketing
    of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and
    fuel and lubricant oil additives.

On August 10, 2005, the company acquired Unocal Corporation
    (Unocal), an independent oil and gas exploration and production
    company. Discussion of the Unocal acquisition is in Note 2
    on

page FS-34.

A list of the company’s major subsidiaries is presented on
    pages

E-4

and

E-5.

As
    of December 31, 2007, Chevron had approximately
    65,000 employees (including about 6,000 service station
    employees). Approximately 31,000, or 48 percent, of the
    company’s employees were employed in U.S. operations.

Overview
    of Petroleum Industry

Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced
    by many factors, and individual petroleum companies have little
    control over some of them. Governmental policies, particularly
    in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment have a
    significant impact on petroleum activities, regulating how
    companies are structured and where and how companies conduct
    their operations and formulate their products and, in some
    cases, limiting their profits directly. Prices for crude oil and
    natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally
    determined by supply and demand for these commodities. However,
    some governments impose price controls on refined products such
    as gasoline or diesel fuel. The members of the Organization of
    Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) are typically the
    world’s swing producers of crude oil, and their production
    levels are a major factor in determining worldwide supply.
    Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is
    largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global
    economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to
    other energy sources also play a significant part. Seasonality
    is not a primary driver to changes in the company’s
    quarterly earnings during the year.

Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and
    petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and
    chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. Chevron
    competes with fully integrated major global petroleum companies,
    as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the
    acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other
    properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop
    and operate those properties. In its downstream business,
    Chevron also competes with fully integrated major petroleum
    companies and other independent refining, marketing and
    transportation entities in the sale or acquisition of various
    goods or services in many national and international markets.


Incorporated
    in Delaware in 1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the
    company adopted the name Chevron Corporation in 1984 and
    ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2001. In 2005, ChevronTexaco
    Corporation changed its name to Chevron Corporation. As used in
    this report, the term “Chevron” and such terms as
    “the company,” “the corporation,”
    “our,” “we” and “us” may refer to
    Chevron Corporation, one or more of its consolidated
    subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated
    otherwise, it does not include “affiliates” of
    Chevron — i.e., those companies accounted for by the
    equity method (generally owned 50 percent or less) or
    investments accounted for by the cost method. All of these terms
    are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise
    description of any of the separate companies, each of which
    manages its own affairs.



Operating
    Environment

Refer to pages FS-2 through FS-8 of this

Form 10-K

in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the
    company’s current business environment and outlook.

Chevron
    Strategic Direction

Chevron’s primary objective is to create value and achieve
    sustained financial returns from its operations that will enable
    it to outperform its competitors. As a foundation for achieving
    this objective, the company has established the following
    strategies:

Strategies
    for Major Businesses

•

Upstream

— grow profitably in core
    areas, build new legacy positions and commercialize the
    company’s natural gas equity resource base while growing a
    high-impact global gas business

•

Downstream

— improve base-business
    returns and selectively grow, with a focus on integrated value
    creation

The company also continues to invest in renewable-energy
    technologies, with an objective of capturing profitable
    positions in important renewable sources of energy.

Enabling
    Strategies Companywide

•

Invest in people

to achieve the company’s
    strategies

•

Leverage technology

to deliver superior
    performance and growth

•

Build organizational capability

to deliver
    world-class performance in operational excellence, cost
    reduction, capital stewardship and profitable growth

Description
    of Business and Properties

The upstream, downstream and chemicals activities of the company
    and its equity affiliates are widely dispersed geographically,
    with operations in North America, South America, Europe, Africa,
    the Middle East, Asia and Australasia. Tabulations of segment
    sales and other operating revenues, earnings and income taxes
    for the three years ending December 31, 2007, and assets as
    of the end of 2007 and 2006 — for the United States
    and the company’s international geographic
    areas — are in Note 8 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements beginning on

page FS-37.

In addition, similar comparative data for the company’s
    investments in and income from equity affiliates and property,
    plant and equipment are in Notes 11 and 12 on pages FS-40
    to FS-42.

Capital
    and Exploratory Expenditures

Total reported expenditures for 2007 were $20 billion,
    including $2.3 billion for Chevron’s share of
    expenditures by affiliated companies, which did not require cash
    outlays by the company. In 2006 and 2005, expenditures were
    $16.6 billion and $11.1 billion, respectively,
    including the company’s share of affiliates’
    expenditures of $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion in the
    corresponding periods. The 2005 amount excludes
    $17.3 billion for the acquisition of Unocal.

Of the $20 billion in expenditures for 2007,
    78 percent, or $15.5 billion, related to upstream
    activities. Approximately the same percentage was also expended
    for upstream operations in 2006 and 2005. International upstream
    accounted for about 70 percent of the worldwide upstream
    investment in each of the three years, reflecting the
    company’s continuing focus on opportunities that are
    available outside the United States.

In 2008, the company estimates capital and exploratory
    expenditures will be 15 percent higher at
    $22.9 billion, including $2.6 billion of spending by
    affiliates. About three-fourths of the total, or
    $17.5 billion, is budgeted for exploration and production
    activities, with $12.7 billion of that amount outside the
    United States.

Refer also to a discussion of the company’s capital and
    exploratory expenditures on

page FS-12.

Boscan Operating Service
    Agreement

—


—

—



As shown in the table on page 5, worldwide oil-equivalent
    production of 2.59 million barrels per day in 2007 was up
    34,000 barrels per day from the prior year. Worldwide
    oil-equivalent production including “other produced
    volumes” (refer to footnote 5 to the table on
    page 5) was 2.62 million barrels per day, down
    about 2 percent from 2006. The decline was mostly
    attributable to the change in the Boscan operating service
    agreement in Venezuela to a joint-stock company in October 2006.
    Refer to the “Results of Operations” section beginning
    on

page FS-6

for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the
    2005–2007 changes in production for crude oil and natural
    gas liquids and natural gas.

The company estimates that its average worldwide oil-equivalent
    production in 2008 will be approximately 2.65 million
    barrels per day. This estimate is subject to many uncertainties,
    including quotas that may be imposed by OPEC, the price effect
    on production volumes calculated under cost-recovery and
    variable-royalty provisions of certain contracts, changes in
    fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations,
    delays in project

start-ups,

and production that may have to be shut in due to weather
    conditions, civil unrest, changing geopolitics or other
    disruptions to operations. Future production levels also are
    affected by the size and number of economic investment
    opportunities and, for new large-scale projects, the time lag
    between initial exploration and the beginning of production.
    Refer to the “Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production
    Activities in Key Areas,” beginning on page 9, for a
    discussion of the company’s major oil and gas development
    projects.

Average
    Sales Prices and Production Costs per Unit of
    Production

Refer to Table IV on

page FS-66

for data about the company’s average sales price per barrel
    of crude oil and natural gas liquids and per thousand cubic feet
    of natural gas produced and the average production cost per
    oil-equivalent barrel for 2007, 2006 and 2005.

    classified as oil wells.


Gross wells include the total
    number of wells in which the company has an interest. Net wells
    include wholly owned wells and the sum of the company’s
    fractional interests in gross wells.

Reserves

Table V, beginning on

page FS-66,

provides a tabulation of the company’s proved net oil and
    gas reserves, by geographic area, as of each year-end 2004
    through 2007, and an accompanying discussion of major changes to
    proved reserves by geographic area for the three-year period.
    During 2007, the company provided oil and gas reserves estimates



for 2006 to the Department of Energy, Energy Information
    Administration (EIA), that agree with the 2006 reserve volumes
    in Table V. This reporting fulfilled the requirement that such
    estimates are to be consistent with, and do not differ more than
    5 percent from, the information furnished to the Securities
    and Exchange Commission in the company’s 2006 Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K.

During 2008, the company will file estimates of oil and gas
    reserves with the Department of Energy, EIA, consistent with the
    2007 reserve data reported in Table V.

The net proved-reserve balances at the end of each of the three
    years 2005 through 2007 are shown in the table below:

Gross acreage includes the total
    number of acres in all tracts in which the company has an
    interest. Net acreage includes wholly owned interests and the
    sum of the company’s fractional interests in gross acreage.


Developed acreage is spaced or
    assignable to productive wells. Undeveloped acreage is acreage
    on which wells have not been drilled or completed to permit
    commercial production and that may contain undeveloped proved
    reserves. The gross undeveloped acres that will expire in 2008,
    2009 and 2010 if production is not established by certain
    required dates are 7,770, 10,860 and 4,288, respectively.



Contract
    Obligations

The company sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing
    operations under a variety of contractual obligations. Most
    contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based
    on production from specified properties, but some natural gas
    sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable
    quantities.

In the United States, the company is contractually committed to
    deliver to third parties and affiliates approximately
    456 billion cubic feet of natural gas through 2010. The
    company believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities
    available from production of the company’s proved developed
    U.S. reserves. These contracts include variable-pricing
    terms.

Outside the United States, the company is contractually
    committed to deliver to third parties a total of approximately
    631 billion cubic feet of natural gas from 2008 through
    2010 from Argentina, Australia, Canada, Colombia, Denmark and
    the Philippines. The sales contracts contain variable pricing
    formulas that are generally referenced to the prevailing market
    price for crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at
    the time of delivery and in some cases consider inflation or
    other factors. The company believes it can satisfy these
    contracts from quantities available from production of the
    company’s proved developed reserves in Argentina,
    Australia, Colombia, Denmark and the Philippines. The company
    plans to meet its Canadian contractual delivery commitments of
    30 billion cubic feet through third-party purchases.

Development
    Activities

Details of the company’s development expenditures and costs
    of proved property acquisitions for 2007, 2006 and 2005 are
    presented in Table I on

page FS-61.

The table below summarizes the company’s net interest in
    productive and dry development wells completed in each of the
    past three years and the status of the company’s

Review of
    Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key
    Areas

Chevron’s 2007 key upstream activities, some of which are
    also discussed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations beginning on

page FS-2,

are presented below. The comments include references to
    “total production” and “net production,”
    which are defined under “Production” in
    Exhibit 99.1 on

page E-23.

The discussion that follows references the status of proved
    reserves recognition for significant long-lead-time projects not
    yet on production and for projects recently placed on
    production. Reserves are not discussed for recent discoveries
    that have yet to advance to a project stage or for mature areas
    of production that do not have individual projects requiring
    significant levels of capital or exploratory investment. Amounts
    indicated for project costs represent total project costs, not
    the company’s share of costs for projects that are less
    than wholly owned. In addition to the activities discussed,
    Chevron was active in other geographic areas, but those
    activities are considered less significant.



Consolidated
    Operations

Chevron has production and exploration activities in most of the world’s major hydrocarbon basins. The company’s upstream strategy is to grow profitably in core areas, build new legacy positions and commercialize the company’s natural gas equity resource base while growing a high-impact global gas business. The map on the left indicates Chevron’s primary areas of production
and exploration as well as the potential target markets for the company’s natural gas resources.

a)

United
    States

Upstream activities in the United States are concentrated in
    California, the Gulf of Mexico, Louisiana, Texas, New Mexico,
    the Rocky Mountains and Alaska. Average net oil-equivalent
    production during 2007 was 743,000 barrels per day,
    composed of 460,000 barrels of crude oil and natural gas
    liquids and 1.7 billion cubic feet of natural gas. Refer to
    Table V beginning on

page FS-66

for a discussion of the net proved reserves and different
    hydrocarbon characteristics for the company’s major
    U.S. producing areas.

California:

The company has significant production
    in

the San Joaquin Valley. In 2007, average net

oil-equivalent

production was 221,000 barrels per day, composed of
    200,000 barrels of crude oil, 97 million cubic feet of
    natural gas and 5,000 barrels of natural gas liquids.
    Approximately 80 percent of the

crude-oil

production is considered heavy oil (typically with API gravity
    lower than 22 degrees).



Gulf of Mexico:

Average net oil-equivalent production during 2007 for the company’s combined interests in the Gulf of Mexico shelf and deepwater areas, and the onshore fields in the region was 214,000 barrels per day. The daily oil-equivalent production comprised 105,000 barrels of crude oil, 576 million cubic feet of natural gas and 13,000 barrels of natural gas
liquids.

During 2007, Chevron was engaged in various development and exploration activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Development work continued at the 58 percent-owned and operated Tahiti Field, where production

start-up

is expected in the third quarter 2009. Construction of

the spar hull and topsides was completed in 2007; however,
    installation of the spar hull was delayed for about one year
    when testing revealed a metallurgical problem with the mooring
    shackles. Six development wells were drilled in 2007, and
    flow-back tests for five of the six were completed during the
    year. Initial booking of proved undeveloped reserves occurred in
    2003, and the transfer of these reserves into the proved
    developed category is anticipated near the time of production

start-up.

With an estimated production life of 30 years, Tahiti is
    designed to have a maximum total daily production of
    125,000 barrels of crude oil and 70 million cubic feet
    of natural gas. The total cost for this project is estimated at
    $4.7 billion and includes a planned second phase of field
    development after

start-up

that involves additional wells and facility upgrades.

Also under development is the 75 percent-owned and operated
    Blind Faith discovery, in which the company increased its
    ownership from 63 percent in July 2007. Three development
    wells were drilled, and construction of the topsides and hull
    was completed in 2007. The project includes a subsea development
    plan, with tieback to a semisubmersible floating production
    facility that had an original daily-production design capacity
    of 45,000 barrels of crude oil and 45 million cubic
    feet of natural gas based on the initial three-well development
    program. A fourth development well and associated facility
    upgrades are planned to commence in the first half of 2008. The
    facility upgrades are planned to increase the daily capacity to
    60,000 barrels of crude oil and 60 million cubic feet
    of natural gas. Initial daily total production, including the
    fourth well, is estimated at 45,000 to 60,000 barrels of
    crude oil and 45 million to 60 million cubic feet of
    natural gas. Proved undeveloped reserves for the project were
    recognized in 2005. Reclassification of the reserves to the
    proved developed category is anticipated near the time of
    production

start-up

in
    the second quarter 2008. The estimated production life of the
    field is approximately 20 years.

The company is also participating in the ultra-deep Perdido
    Regional Development. The project encompasses the installation
    of a producing host facility to service multiple fields,
    including Chevron’s 33 percent-owned Great White,
    60 percent-owned Silvertip and 58 percent-owned
    Tobago. Chevron has a 38 percent interest in the Perdido
    Regional Host. All of these fields and the production facility
    are partner-operated. Activities during 2007 included facility
    construction and development drilling. First oil is expected in
    2010, with the facility capable of handling 130,000 barrels
    of oil-equivalent per day. Proved undeveloped reserves related
    to the project were first recorded in 2006, and the phased
    reclassification of these reserves to the proved developed
    category is anticipated near the time of production

start-up.

The project has an expected life of approximately 25 years.

Deepwater exploration activities in 2007 included participation
    in 12 exploratory wells — six wildcat and six
    appraisal. Exploratory work included the following:

•

Big Foot — 60 percent-owned and operated. A
    successful appraisal well was completed in January 2008.

•

Jack — 50 percent-owned and operated. A
    second appraisal well is scheduled for completion in the second
    quarter 2008.

•

Saint Malo — 41 percent-owned and
    operated. Located near the Jack discovery, a second
    appraisal well drilled in 2007 is scheduled for completion by
    the end of the first quarter 2008.

•

Tubular Bells — 30 percent-owned and nonoperated
    working interest. The second appraisal well began drilling in
    2007 and is scheduled for completion in the first quarter 2008.

•

Knotty Head — 25 percent-owned and nonoperated
    working interest. Discovered in 2005, subsurface studies were in
    progress in early 2008.

•

Puma — 22 percent-owned and nonoperated working
    interest. Two appraisal wells were drilled in 2007.



•

West Tonga — 21 percent-owned and nonoperated
    working interest. A successful discovery well was drilled in
    2007.

At the end of 2007, the company had not yet recognized proved
    reserves for any of the exploration projects discussed above.

Besides the activities connected with the development and
    exploration projects in the Gulf of Mexico area, Chevron also
    continued the federal, state and local permitting process during
    2007 and early 2008 for a proposed natural gas import terminal
    at Casotte Landing in Jackson County, Mississippi. In February
    2007, the company received approval from the Federal Energy
    Regulatory Commission for the proposed terminal. The terminal
    would be located adjacent to the company’s Pascagoula
    Refinery and designed to process imported liquefied natural gas
    (LNG) for distribution to industrial, commercial and residential
    customers in Mississippi, Florida and the Northeast. The
    terminal would have an initial natural gas processing capacity
    of 1.3 billion cubic feet per day. The decision to
    construct a facility will be timed to align with the
    company’s LNG supply projects.

The company also has contractual rights to 1 billion cubic
    feet per day of regasification capacity beginning in 2009 at the
    third party-owned Sabine Pass LNG terminal that is expected to
    be commissioned in the second quarter 2008. Also in the Sabine
    Pass area in Louisiana, the company has a binding agreement to
    be one of the anchor shippers in a
    3.2 billion-cubic-foot-per-day third party-owned natural
    gas pipeline. Chevron will have 1.6 billion cubic feet per
    day of capacity in the pipeline, of which 1 billion cubic
    feet per day is in a new pipeline and 600 million cubic
    feet per day is interconnecting capacity to an existing
    pipeline. The new pipeline system will provide access to
    Chevron’s Sabine and Bridgeline pipelines, which connect to
    the Henry Hub. The Henry Hub is the pricing point for natural
    gas futures contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange
    (NYMEX) and is located on the natural gas pipeline system in
    Louisiana. Henry Hub interconnects to nine interstate and four
    intrastate pipelines.

Other U.S. Areas:

Outside California and the
    Gulf of Mexico, the company manages operations across the
    mid-continental United States and Alaska. During 2007 in the
    Piceance Basin of northwestern Colorado, the company commenced
    development drilling in the basin’s tight-gas formation.
    Facilities to produce 50 million cubic feet of natural gas
    per day are expected to start up in 2009. The Piceance project,
    in which the company holds a 100 percent operated working
    interest, is scalable, and the work is planned to be completed
    in multiple phases over the 15- to

20-year

project life. The plans include expanding facilities to a
    production capacity of 450 million cubic feet per day. The
    total cost for this project is estimated at $7.3 billion.
    Also during 2007, Chevron initiated redevelopment programs in
    three offshore fields in Alaska’s Cook Inlet, where the
    company operates 10 offshore platforms and five producing
    natural gas fields. The company also owns nonoperated working
    interest production and exploratory acreage at the White Hills
    prospect on the North Slope of Alaska. During 2007, the
    company’s production outside California and the Gulf of
    Mexico averaged 308,000 net oil-equivalent barrels per day,
    composed of 104,000 barrels of crude oil, 1 billion
    cubic feet of natural gas and 33,000 barrels of natural gas
    liquids.



b)

Africa

Angola:

Chevron holds company-operated working interests in Blocks 0 and 14 and nonoperated working interests in Block 2 and the Fina Sonangol Texaco (FST) area. In 2007, daily net production was 179,000 barrels of oil-equivalent.

The 39 percent-owned Block 0 and 31 percent-owned Block 14 are off the west coast, north of the Congo River. In
Block 0, the company operates in two areas — A and B — composed of 21 fields that produced 120,000 barrels per day of net liquids in 2007. The Block 0 concession extends through 2030.

Area A of Block 0 comprises 15 producing fields and averaged daily net production of approximately 65,000 barrels of crude oil and 1,000 barrels of liquefied petroleum
gas (LPG) in 2007. This production includes volumes from the Banzala Field that produced first oil in June 2007. The development of the Mafumeira Field in Area A continued in 2007 and will target the northern portion of the field. Initial booking of proved

undeveloped reserves for this development occurred in 2003, and
    reclassification of proved undeveloped reserves into the proved
    developed category is anticipated near the time of first
    production expected in 2009. Maximum total daily production is
    expected to be approximately 30,000 barrels of crude oil in
    2011.

Also in Area A, construction continued during 2007 on the Takula
    Gas Processing Platform and on projects for the Cabinda Gas
    Plant and the Flare and Relief Modification. These three
    projects, called the Area A Gas Management projects, are
    scheduled to start up in 2009 and are expected to eliminate the
    routine flaring of natural gas by reinjecting excess natural gas
    into various reservoirs.

In Area B of Block 0, average daily net production in 2007
    from six producing fields was 47,000 barrels of crude oil
    and condensate and 7,000 barrels of LPG. Included in this
    production were volumes from the Sanha condensate natural gas
    utilization and Bomboco crude oil project that was completed in
    mid-2007. During 2007, a portion of the proved undeveloped
    reserves for this project was reclassified to the proved
    developed category.

In Block 14, net production in 2007 from the Benguela,
    Belize, Lobito, Tomboco, Kuito and Landana fields averaged
    48,000 barrels of liquids per day. During 2007, development
    of the Benguela Belize-Lobito Tomboco (BBLT) project continued,
    with production of first oil at the Benguela and Tomboco fields.
    Further development drilling is expected to continue at all BBLT
    fields. Maximum total production for BBLT is estimated at
    200,000 barrels of crude oil per day and is scheduled to
    occur in late 2008 or early 2009. Proved undeveloped reserves
    for Benguela and Belize were initially recognized in 1998 and
    for Lobito and Tomboco in 2000. Proved developed reserves for
    Belize and Lobito were recognized in 2006 and for Benguela and
    Tomboco in 2007. Additional BBLT reserves are expected to be
    reclassified to proved developed as project milestones are met.
    Development and production rights for these fields expire in
    2027.

Another major project in Block 14 is the development of the
    Tombua and Landana fields. Construction of facilities continued
    in 2007. Production from the Landana North reservoir is
    utilizing the BBLT infrastructure. The maximum total daily
    production from Tombua and Landana of 100,000 barrels of
    crude oil is expected to occur in 2011. Proved undeveloped
    reserves were recognized for Tombua and Landana in 2001 and
    2002, respectively. Initial reclassification from proved
    undeveloped to proved developed for Landana occurred in 2006 and
    continued in 2007. Further reclassification is expected between
    2009 when the

Tombua-Landana

facilities are completed and 2012 when the drilling program is
    scheduled for completion. Development and production rights for
    these fields expire in 2028.

As of early 2008, the Negage project in Block 14 was under
    evaluation. Front-end engineering and design (FEED) for this
    project was expected to begin in late 2008, with the date of
    production

start-up

yet
    to be determined.



Three exploration wells were drilled in Block 14 in 2007,
    one of which successfully appraised the 2006 Lucapa discovery.
    In the Malange Pinda prospect, one well resulted in a crude-oil
    discovery, and as of early 2008, evaluation was ongoing for the
    third well completed in the first quarter 2007. Appraisal
    drilling of the discoveries is expected to continue in 2008.

Chevron also has a 20 percent interest in a
    production-sharing contract (PSC) that covers Block 2,
    which is adjacent to the northwestern part of Angola’s
    coast south of the Congo River, and a 16 percent interest
    in the onshore FST area. Combined net production from these
    properties in 2007 was 3,000 barrels of liquids per day.

Refer also to page 23 for a discussion of affiliate
    operations in Angola.

Democratic Republic of the Congo:

Chevron has an
    18 percent nonoperated working interest in a concession for
    offshore properties. Daily net production from seven fields
    averaged 3,000 barrels of oil-equivalent in 2007.

Republic of the Congo:

Chevron has a 32 percent
    nonoperated working interest in the Nkossa, Nsoko and
    Moho-Bilondo exploitation permits and a 29 percent
    nonoperated working interest in the Kitina and Sounda
    exploitation permits, all of which are offshore. Net production
    from the Republic of the Congo fields averaged
    8,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day in 2007. The
    Moho-Bilondo development continued in 2007, with first
    production expected in the second half 2008. The development
    plan calls for crude oil produced by subsea well clusters to
    flow into a floating processing unit. Maximum total daily
    production of 90,000 barrels of crude oil is expected in
    2010. Proved undeveloped reserves were initially recognized in
    2001. Transfer to the proved developed category is expected near
    the time of first production. Chevron’s development and
    production rights for Moho-Bilondo expire in 2030.

Two exploration wells were drilled in the Moho-Bilondo permit
    area during 2007 and were determined to have oil accumulations.
    As of early 2008, results continued under evaluation.

Angola-Republic of the Congo Joint Development
    Area:

Chevron is the operator and holds a
    31 percent interest in the Lianzi Development Area
    (formerly referenced as the 14K/A-IMI Unitization Zone), located
    in a joint development area shared equally between Angola and
    Republic of the Congo. In 2006, the development of the Lianzi
    area was approved by the committee of representatives from the
    two countries, and a conceptual field development plan was also
    submitted to this committee. In early 2007, one additional
    exploration well was drilled in the Lianzi area, but the results
    were considered subcommercial. As of early 2008, development
    studies and planning continued for this area.

Chad/Cameroon:

Chevron is a nonoperating partner in
    a project to develop crude-oil fields in southern Chad and
    transport the produced volumes by pipeline to the coast of
    Cameroon for export. Chevron has a 25 percent nonoperated
    working interest in the producing operations and a
    21 percent interest in two affiliates that own the
    pipeline. Average daily net production from six fields in 2007
    was 32,000 barrels of oil-equivalent, including volumes
    from a satellite field development project in the Maikeri Field
    that produced first oil in July 2007. In late 2007, a
    development application was submitted for another satellite
    field, Timbre, in the Doba area. The Chad producing operations
    are conducted under a concession agreement that expires in 2030.

Libya:

Chevron is the operator and holds a
    100 percent interest in the onshore Block 177
    exploration license. Evaluation of seismic data was completed in
    late 2007, and an exploratory drilling program is scheduled for
    2008.



Nigeria:

Chevron holds a 40 percent interest in 13 concessions predominantly in the onshore and near-offshore regions of the Niger Delta and varying interests in deepwater offshore blocks. In the Niger Delta, the company operates under a joint-venture arrangement with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), which owns a 60 percent interest. In 2007, net oil- equivalent
production from 32 fields averaged 129,000 barrels per day. The daily oil-equivalent rate comprised 126,000 barrels of liquids and 15 million cubic feet of natural gas.

In the Niger Delta, Chevron has a 40 percent operated interest in the South Offshore Water Injection Project (SOWIP), an enhanced

crude-oil

recovery
project in Oil Mining License (OML) 90 aimed at increasing production through water injection, natural-gas lift and production debottlenecking in the Okan and Delta fields. The upgraded Delta South Water Injection Platform (DSWIP), which is part of SOWIP, began water injection in March 2007 at a total daily rate of 100,000 barrels. The total maximum daily water injection rate

is expected to increase to 240,000 barrels in 2009 upon the
    laying of water injection pipelines. Crude-oil production at
    year-end 2007 was approximately 5,000 barrels per day, and
    maximum total production is expected to be 35,000 barrels
    per day in 2010. Initial recognition of proved reserves was made
    in 2005. Reclassification of additional proved undeveloped
    reserves to the developed category is expected to occur  after
    the evaluation of the water injection performance. The estimated
    life of the project is 25 years.

During 2007, the company continued development activities of
    deepwater offshore projects. The 68 percent-owned and
    operated deepwater Agbami project in OML 127 and OML 128 is a
    subsea development with wells tied back to a floating
    production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel, which was
    delivered from South Korea in December 2007. Development
    drilling and completion operations started in 2006, and subsea
    installation of production equipment began in 2007. Maximum
    total daily production of 250,000 barrels of crude oil and
    natural gas liquids is anticipated within one year after

start-up,

which is expected by the third quarter 2008. The company
    initially recognized proved undeveloped reserves for Agbami in
    2002. A portion of the proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled
    to be reclassified to proved developed in 2008 near production

start-up.

The expected field life is approximately 20 years. The
    total cost for this project is estimated at $5.4 billion.

The Aparo Field in OML 132 and OML 140 and the Bonga SW Field in
    OML 118 share a common geologic structure and are planned
    to be jointly developed. The geologic structure lies
    70 miles offshore in 4,300 feet of water. A

pre-unit

agreement was executed between Chevron and the OML 118 partner
    group in 2006. Final terms for a unitization agreement are
    expected to be completed in mid-2008. In 2007, FEED and
    tendering of major contracts continued. Development will likely
    involve an FPSO vessel and subsea wells. Partners are expected
    to make the final investment decision in the second half 2008,
    with production

start-up

projected for 2012. Maximum total production of
    150,000 barrels of crude oil per day is expected to be
    reached within one year of production

start-up.

The company recognized initial proved undeveloped reserves in
    2006 for its approximate 20 percent nonoperated working
    interest in the unitized area. The expected production life of
    this project is 20 years.

The company holds a 30 percent nonoperated working interest
    in the Usan project, located offshore in OML 138 and designed to
    utilize an FPSO vessel. The company recognized proved
    undeveloped reserves in 2004. Production

start-up

is
    estimated for late 2011, before which time a portion of proved
    undeveloped reserves is expected to be reclassified to the
    proved developed category. Maximum total production of
    180,000 barrels of crude oil per day is expected to be
    achieved within one year of

start-up.

The end date of the concession period will be determined after
    final regulatory approvals are obtained.

Chevron operates and holds a 95 percent interest in the
    Nsiko discovery on OML 140. As of early 2008, subsurface
    evaluations and field development planning were ongoing. An
    investment decision is contingent on negotiations concerning the
    level of Nigerian content in the project’s contracts.

The company has a 46 percent nonoperated interest in the
    Nnwa Field in OML 129, which contains a discovery that extends
    into two adjacent blocks not owned by Chevron. Commerciality is
    dependent upon resolution of the Nigerian Deepwater Gas fiscal
    regime and collaboration agreements with the adjacent blocks. A
    joint study was initiated in 2007 with owners in adjoining block
    OML 135 to progress technical and commercial evaluations.



Chevron participated in two deepwater exploration wells during
    2007. The Uge 2 well, drilled as an appraisal well to the
    Uge 1 discovery in Oil Prospecting License (OPL) 214, confirmed
    hydrocarbons. The company has a 20 percent nonoperated
    working interest in OPL 214. The second well was deemed
    noncommercial. Two additional deepwater exploration wells are
    planned in 2008.

Chevron also is involved in projects in the Niger Delta region
    that support the company’s strategic initiative to
    commercialize its significant natural gas resource base outside
    the United States. Construction is under way on the
    Phase 3A expansion of the Escravos Gas Plant (EGP), which
    is expected to start up in 2009. Phase 3A scope includes
    offshore natural gas gathering and compression infrastructure
    and a second gas processing facility, which potentially would
    increase processing capacity from 285 million to
    680 million cubic feet of natural gas per day and increase
    LPG and condensate export capacity from 12,000 to
    47,000 barrels per day. EGP Phase 3A is designed to process
    natural gas from the Meji, Delta South, Okan and Mefa producing
    fields. Proved undeveloped reserves associated with EGP
    Phase 3A were recognized in 2002. These reserves are
    expected to be reclassified to proved developed as various
    project milestones are reached and related projects are
    completed. The anticipated life of the project is 25 years.
    Chevron holds a 40 percent operated interest in this
    project.

Refer also to page 26 for a discussion of the planned
    gas-to-liquids facility at Escravos.

Chevron holds a 37 percent interest in the West African Gas
    Pipeline, which is designed to supply Nigerian natural gas to
    customers in Ghana, Benin and Togo for industrial applications
    and power generation. First gas is anticipated to be shipped by
    mid-2008, and facility completion, with a capacity of
    170 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, is expected
    in the second-half 2008. Chevron is the managing sponsor in the
    West African Pipeline Company Limited affiliate, which
    constructed, owns and operates the

412-mile

pipeline.

In March 2007, Chevron signed a shareholders’ agreement for
    a 19 percent interest in the OKLNG Free Zone Enterprise
    (OKLNG) affiliate, which will operate the Olokola LNG project.
    OKLNG plans to build a multitrain,
    22 million-metric-ton-per-year natural gas liquefaction
    facility and marine terminal located in a free trade zone. The
    project entered FEED in 2006 and is expected to be implemented
    in phases, commencing with two trains having at least
    11 million-metric-ton-per-year total capacity.
    Approximately 50 percent of the gas supplied to the plant
    is expected to be provided from the producing areas associated
    with Chevron’s joint-venture arrangement with NNPC
    (discussed earlier in this section).

Nigeria

São Tomé e Príncipe Joint
    Development Zone (JDZ):

Chevron holds a 46 percent
    operated interest in JDZ Block 1. In 2006, the first
    exploration well encountered hydrocarbons. In 2008, technical
    studies are planned to determine the need for additional
    drilling and evaluate development alternatives.

Asia-Pacific

Australia:

During 2007, the average net oil-equivalent production from Chevron’s interests in Australia was 100,000 barrels per day, composed of 39,000 barrels of liquids and 372 million cubic feet of natural gas.

Chevron has a 17 percent nonoperated working interest in the North West Shelf (NWS) Venture offshore Western Australia. Daily net production from
the project during 2007 averaged 29,000 barrels of crude oil and condensate, 369 million cubic feet of natural gas, and 5,000 barrels of LPG. Approximately 75 percent of the natural gas was sold in the form of LNG to major utilities in Japan, South Korea and China, primarily under long-term contracts. The remaining natural gas was sold to the Western Australia domestic

market. A fifth LNG train, which is intended to increase export
    capacity by more than 4 million metric tons per year, to
    more than 16 million, is expected to be commissioned in
    late 2008. The Angel natural gas field, where development is
    under way, and the North Rankin Redevelopment project will
    supply the fifth LNG train.

Start-up

of
    the fifth train is projected to accelerate production from the
    NWS fields. An investment decision by the company and its
    partners on the North Rankin Redevelopment project is expected
    in late 2008. The end of the NWS Venture concession period is
    2034.

On Barrow and Thevenard islands off the northwest coast of
    Australia, Chevron operates crude oil producing facilities that
    had combined net production of 5,000 barrels per day in
    2007. Chevron’s interests in these operations are
    57 percent for Barrow and 51 percent for Thevenard.



Also off the northwest coast of Australia, Chevron is the
    operator of the Gorgon development and has a 50 percent
    ownership interest across most of the Greater Gorgon Area.
    Chevron and its two joint-venture participants signed a
    Framework Agreement in 2005 that will enable the combined
    development of Gorgon and the nearby natural gas fields as one
    world-scale project. In 2007, the company received environmental
    regulatory approvals necessary for the development of the
    Greater Gorgon LNG project on Barrow Island using a two-train,
    10 million-metric-ton-per-year LNG development plan. As of
    early 2008, the detailed environmental conditions were
    incorporated into the project’s updated optimization and
    engineering efforts for a three-train,
    15 million-metric-ton-per-year LNG configuration, and
    activities to secure the necessary government approvals were
    under way. Natural gas for the project will be supplied from the
    Gorgon and Jansz fields. The Gorgon project has an expected
    economic life of at least 40 years.

Elsewhere in the Greater Gorgon Area during 2007, Chevron
    participated in four successful appraisal wells — two
    in the Browse Basin and two in the Carnarvon Basin. Chevron also
    participated in two exploration wells in the Carnarvon Basin,
    with Lady Nora resulting in a natural gas discovery and Snarf-1
    expecting to be completed in 2008. As of early 2008, plans were
    also being developed to appraise the 67 percent-owned Clio
    and the 50 percent-owned Chandon natural gas discoveries.
    Concept studies continued in 2007 on the Wheatstone natural gas
    discovery, and a successful appraisal well was drilled late in
    the year. Further appraisal wells are planned to be drilled in
    the area in 2008.

At the end of 2007, the company had not recognized proved
    reserves for any of the Greater Gorgon Area fields. Recognition
    is contingent on securing sufficient LNG sales agreements and
    achieving other key project milestones. In 2007, the company
    signed a nonbinding Heads of Agreement (HOA) with GS Caltex, a
    Chevron affiliated company, to supply 250,000 metric tons of LNG
    annually from the Gorgon project. Combined with the nonbinding
    HOAs signed previously with three utility customers in Japan,
    volumes under the four HOAs totaled 4.5 million metric tons
    per year. As of early 2008, negotiations were continuing to
    finalize binding sales agreements on these HOAs. Purchases by
    each of these customers are expected to range from 300,000
    metric tons per year to 1.5 million metric tons per year
    over 25 years.

Azerbaijan:

Chevron holds a 10 percent nonoperated working interest in the Azerbaijan International Operating Company (AIOC), which produces crude oil in the Caspian Sea from the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) project. Chevron also has a 9 percent interest in the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) affiliate, which transports AIOC production by pipeline from Baku, Azerbaijan, through Georgia
to Mediterranean deepwater port facilities in Ceyhan, Turkey. (Refer to “Pipelines” under “Transportation Operations” on page 28 for a discussion of the BTC operations.)

In 2007, the company’s daily net production from AIOC averaged 61,000 barrels of oil-equivalent. First production from Phase III of ACG development is targeted for the second quarter 2008.
Total crude-oil production from the ACG project is expected to increase to about 940,000 barrels per day by the end of 2008 and to more than 1 million barrels per day in 2009. Proved undeveloped reserves for ACG are expected to be reclassified to proved developed reserves as wells are drilled and completed. The AIOC operations are conducted under a

30-year

PSC that expires in 2024.

Kazakhstan:

Chevron holds a 20 percent
    nonoperated working interest in the Karachaganak project that is
    being developed in phases. During 2007, Karachaganak net
    oil-equivalent production averaged 66,000 barrels per day,
    composed of 41,000 barrels of liquids and 149 million
    cubic feet of natural gas. In 2007, access to the Caspian
    Pipeline Consortium (CPC) and Atyrau-Samara (Russia) pipelines
    allowed Karachaganak sales of approximately 166,000 barrels
    per day (31,000 net barrels) of processed liquids at prices
    available in world markets. The remaining liquids were sold into
    Russian markets. During 2007, work continued on a fourth train
    that is designed to increase this export of processed liquids by
    56,000 barrels per day (11,000 net barrels). The
    fourth train is expected to start up in 2009.

In 2007, the Karachaganak operator signed a

15-year

natural gas sales agreement to deliver up to 1.6 billion
    cubic feet per day of sour gas to a Russian-Kazakh joint
    venture. Deliveries under the agreement commenced in September
    2007. As of early 2008, Phase III development of
    Karachaganak continued under evaluation. The project could
    increase maximum total production to 335,000 barrels of
    liquids per day and 1.7 billion cubic feet of natural gas
    per day. Timing for the recognition of Phase III proved
    reserves is uncertain and depends on finalizing a viable
    Phase III project design.



Project

start-up

is
    anticipated in 2012 or after, depending on achievement of
    project milestones. Karachaganak operations are conducted under
    a

40-year

PSC that expires in 2038.

Refer also to pages 23 and 24 for a discussion of
    Tengizchevroil, a 50 percent-owned affiliate with
    operations in Kazakhstan.

Russia:

Refer to page 24 for a discussion of
    the company’s interest in a Russian joint venture.

Bangladesh:

Chevron is the operator of three onshore
    blocks, with a 98 percent interest in Blocks 12, 13
    and 14 and operator of Block 7, in which the company holds
    a 43 percent interest. Net oil-equivalent production in
    2007 averaged 47,000 barrels per day, composed of
    275 million cubic feet of natural gas and
    2,000 barrels of liquids. Production from the Bibiyana
    Field in Block 12 started in March 2007. The project is
    expected to reach maximum total production of 500 million
    cubic feet per day by late 2010. The development program
    included a gas processing plant with capacity of
    600 million cubic feet per day and a natural gas pipeline.
    Initial proved reserves were recognized in 2005. In 2007,
    additional proved reserves were recognized based on development
    wells drilled during the year, and a portion of proved
    undeveloped reserves were reclassified to the proved developed
    category. Bibiyana operations are conducted under a PSC that
    expires in 2034.

Cambodia:

Chevron operates and holds a 55 percent interest in the

1.2 million-acre Block

A, located offshore in the Gulf of Thailand. A four-well exploration and appraisal program was completed in 2007. As of early 2008, the results and prospects for further drilling were being evaluated.

Myanmar:

Chevron
has a 28 percent nonoperated working interest in a PSC for the production of natural gas from the Yadana and Sein fields offshore in the Andaman Sea. The company also has a 28 percent interest in a pipeline company that transports the natural gas from Yadana to the Myanmar-Thailand border for delivery to power plants in Thailand. Most of the natural gas is purchased by

Thailand’s PTT Public Company Limited (PTT). The
    company’s average net natural gas production in 2007 was
    100 million cubic feet per day, or 17,000 barrels of
    oil-equivalent.

Thailand:

Chevron has operated and nonoperated
    working interests in several different offshore blocks. The
    company’s net oil-equivalent production in 2007 averaged
    224,000 barrels per day, composed of 71,000 barrels of
    crude oil and condensate and 916 million cubic feet of
    natural gas. All of the company’s natural gas production is
    sold to PTT under long-term sales contracts.

Operated interests are in Pattani and other fields with
    ownership interests ranging from 35 percent to
    80 percent in Blocks 10 through 13, B12/27, B8/32, 9A,
    G4/43 and G4/48. Blocks B8/32 and 9A produce crude oil and
    natural gas from six operating areas, and Blocks 10 through
    13 and B12/27 produce crude oil, condensate and natural gas from
    16 operating areas.

The company’s production of natural gas increased beginning
    in March 2007 with PTT’s commissioning of a third natural
    gas pipeline. In October 2007, the leases for Blocks 10
    through 13 were extended from 2012 to 2022. In December 2007,
    the company signed a natural gas sales agreement that will
    increase daily contract quantity of natural gas from these
    blocks by 500 million cubic feet, to 1.2 billion, by
    2012. In addition, this agreement is expected to enable the
    construction of a second central natural gas processing facility
    in the Platong area. The 70 percent-owned Platong
    Gas II project is designed to add 420 million cubic
    feet per day of processing capacity in the first quarter 2011.
    The company expects to recognize proved reserves throughout the
    project’s

12-year

life
    as the wellhead platforms are installed.

Chevron has a 16 percent nonoperated working interest in
    Blocks 14A, 15A, 16A, G9/48 and G8/50, known collectively
    as the Arthit Field. First production from Arthit is planned for
    the second quarter 2008 and is expected to reach an estimated
    maximum total production of 330 million cubic feet of
    natural gas per day by the end of 2008. Proved undeveloped
    reserves were recorded for the first time in 2006.
    Reclassification of proved undeveloped reserves to the proved
    developed category is anticipated in 2008, near production

start-up.

The concessions that cover Arthit operations expire in 2040.



In G9/48, one exploration well is required to be drilled by the
    first quarter 2009. Chevron also holds exploration interests in
    a number of blocks that are currently inactive, pending
    resolution of border issues between Thailand and Cambodia.

In late 2007, the company was granted the concession rights to
    four prospective offshore petroleum blocks in Thailand, which
    includes Block G8/50 (discussed earlier in this section).
    Chevron’s interest in the other three operated blocks,
    G4/50, G6/50 and G7/50, ranges from 35 percent to
    75 percent.

Vietnam:

The company is operator in two PSCs
    offshore southwest Vietnam in the northern part of the Malay
    Basin. Chevron has a 42 percent interest in one PSC that
    includes Blocks B and 48/95 and a 43 percent interest in
    the other PSC that has Block 52/97. Chevron also has a
    50 percent operated interest in Block B122 offshore eastern
    Vietnam. No production occurred in these PSCs during 2007.

The Vietnam Gas Project is aimed at developing an area in the
    two Malay Basin PSCs to supply natural gas to state-owned
    PetroVietnam. In the third quarter 2007, PetroVietnam approved
    the revised development plan, joint development area and
    unitization agreement for the project. The project includes
    installation of wellhead and hub platforms, an FPSO vessel,
    infield pipelines and a central processing platform. The timing
    of first natural gas production is dependent upon the outcome of
    commercial negotiations. Maximum total production of
    approximately 500 million cubic feet of natural gas per day
    is projected within five years of

start-up.

Recognition of initial proved undeveloped reserves would follow
    execution of the gas sales agreements and project approval. The
    PSC for Blocks B and 48/95 and the PSC for Block 52/97 will
    expire in 2022 and 2029, respectively.

In Block 122, a planned seismic program was postponed in
    2007 due to issues of territorial claim between Vietnam and
    China.

China:

Chevron has nonoperated working interests of
    33 percent in Blocks 16/08 and 16/19 located in the Pearl
    River Delta Mouth Basin, 25 percent in the QHD-32-6 Field
    in Bohai Bay and 16 percent in the unitized and producing
    BZ

25-1

Field in Bohai Bay Block 11/19. The company’s net
    oil-equivalent production in China during 2007 averaged
    26,000 barrels per day, composed of 22,000 barrels of
    crude oil and condensate and 22 million cubic feet of
    natural gas.

Joint development of the HZ25-3 and HZ25-1 crude-oil fields in
    Block 16/19 commenced in the first quarter 2007. First
    production is expected in early 2009, reaching a maximum total
    daily production of approximately 14,000 barrels of crude
    oil late in the year. Chevron also has interests ranging from
    36 percent to 50 percent in four prospective onshore
    natural gas blocks in the Ordos Basin totaling about
    1.5 million acres. In December 2007, the company signed a

30-year

PSC
    that became effective in February 2008 for the development of
    the Chuandongbei natural gas area in the onshore Sichuan Basin.
    The aggregate design input capacity of the proposed gas plants
    is expected to be 740 million cubic feet of natural gas per
    day. The company holds a 49 percent interest in the area.

Partitioned Neutral Zone (PNZ):

Chevron holds a

60-year

concession that expires in 2009 to produce crude oil from
    onshore properties in PNZ, which is located between Saudi Arabia
    and Kuwait. Negotiations to extend the concession period were
    ongoing in early 2008. Net production in PNZ for 2007
    represented 4 percent of Chevron’s net barrels of
    oil-equivalent total.

Under the current concession, Chevron has the right to Saudi
    Arabia’s 50 percent interest in the hydrocarbon
    resource and pays a royalty and other taxes on volumes produced.
    During 2007, average net oil-equivalent production was
    112,000 barrels per day, composed of 109,000 barrels
    of crude oil and 17 million cubic feet of natural gas. The
    second phase of a steamflood pilot project is expected to be
    completed in early 2009. This pilot is a unique application of
    steam injection into a carbonate reservoir and, if successful,
    could significantly increase recoverability of the heavy oil in
    place.

Philippines:

The company holds a 45 percent
    nonoperated working interest in the Malampaya natural gas field
    located 50 miles offshore Palawan Island. Net
    oil-equivalent production in 2007 averaged 26,000 barrels
    per day, composed of 126 million cubic feet of natural gas
    and 5,000 barrels of condensate. Chevron also develops and
    produces steam resources under an agreement with the National
    Power Corporation, a Philippine government — owned
    company. The combined generating capacity is 637 megawatts.



d)

Indonesia

Chevron’s operated interests in Indonesia are managed by
    several wholly owned subsidiaries, including PT. Chevron Pacific
    Indonesia (CPI). CPI holds operated interests of
    100 percent in the Rokan and Siak PSCs and 90 percent
    in the Mountain Front Kuantan PSC. Other subsidiaries operate
    four PSCs in the Kutei Basin, East Kalimantan and one PSC in the
    Tarakan Basin, Northeast Kalimantan. These interests range from
    80 percent to 100 percent. Chevron also has
    nonoperated working interests in a joint venture in South Natuna
    Sea Block B and in the NE Madura III block in the East Java
    Sea Basin. Chevron’s interests in these PSCs range from
    25 percent to 40 percent. In January 2008, Chevron
    relinquished its 35 percent nonoperated working interest

in the Donggala PSC in the Kutei Basin. In West Java, Chevron
    wholly owns a power generation company that operates the Darajat
    geothermal contract area in Garut, West Java, with a total
    capacity of 259 megawatts. This includes the Darajat III
    110-megawatt unit that was placed online in July 2007. Chevron
    also operates a 95 percent-owned

300-megawatt

cogeneration facility in support of CPI’s operation in
    North Duri and the wholly owned Salak geothermal field, located
    in West Java, with a total capacity of 377 megawatts.

The company’s net oil-equivalent production in 2007 from
    all of its interests in Indonesia averaged 241,000 barrels
    per day. The daily oil-equivalent rate comprised
    195,000 barrels of crude oil and 277 million cubic
    feet of natural gas. The largest producing field is Duri,
    located in the Rokan PSC. Duri has been under steamflood
    operation since 1985 and is one of the world’s largest
    steamflood developments. An expansion area, Area 12, is targeted
    for

start-up

in late 2008. Maximum total daily production is estimated at
    34,000 barrels of crude oil in 2012. Two other areas have
    been identified for possible sequential expansions. Proved
    undeveloped reserves for North Duri were recognized in previous
    years, and reclassification from proved undeveloped to proved
    developed is scheduled to occur during various stages of
    sequential completion. The Rokan PSC expires in 2021.

A drilling campaign continued through 2007 in South Natuna Sea
    Block B, with first oil produced from the Kerisi Field in
    December 2007. First production of LPG from the Belanak Field
    was achieved in April 2007. Additional development drilling in
    the North Belut Field is scheduled to begin in mid-2008, with
    first production expected in 2009.

In January 2007, Chevron combined the development of the Gendalo
    and Gehem deepwater natural gas fields located in the Kutei
    Basin into a single project with one development concept. In
    August 2007, the company submitted final development plans to
    the government of Indonesia. Approvals are expected during the
    first-half 2008. The Bangka natural gas project was under
    evaluation in 2007 and will likely be developed in parallel with
    Gendalo and Gehem. The development timing is partially dependent
    on government approvals, market conditions and the achievement
    of key project milestones. The company holds an 80 percent
    operated interest in these projects.

As of early 2008, the development concept for the
    50 percent-owned and operated Sadewa project in the Kutei
    Basin remained under evaluation. Also in the Kutei Basin, the
    development of the Seturian Field project continued in 2007,
    with first production anticipated in late 2008. The project is
    designed to supply natural gas to a state-owned refinery.



e)

Other
    International Areas

Argentina:

Chevron holds an operated interest in 17 concessions and one exploratory block in the Neuquen and Austral basins. Working interests range from 19 percent to 100 percent. Net oil-equivalent production in 2007 averaged 47,000 barrels per day, composed of 39,000 barrels of crude oil and 50 million cubic feet of natural gas. Chevron also holds a 14 percent
interest in the Oleoductos del Valle S.A. pipeline.

In 2007, three exploratory wells were drilled in the Austral Basin, and two were successful.

Brazil:

Chevron holds working interests ranging from 20 percent to 52 percent in three deepwater blocks. None of the blocks had production in 2007.

In Block BC-4, located in the Campos Basin, the company is the operator
and has a 52 percent interest in the Frade Field. In 2007, major construction activities included work to convert a crude-oil tanker to an FPSO vessel and the manufacture of subsea systems and flowlines for the project. Subsea installation activities began in early 2008. Proved undeveloped reserves were recorded for

the first time in 2005. Partial reclassification of proved
    undeveloped reserves to the proved developed category is
    anticipated upon production

start-up

in
    early 2009. Estimated maximum total production of 90,000

oil-equivalent

barrels per day is anticipated in 2011. The concession that
    involves the Frade project expires in 2025.

The company concentrates its exploration efforts in the Campos
    and Santos basins. In the partner-operated Campos Basin Block
    BC-20, two areas — 38 percent-owned Papa-Terra
    and 30 percent-owned Maromba — have been retained
    for development following the end of the exploration phase of
    this block. In 2006, a Papa-Terra field development plan was
    submitted to the government, and as of early 2008 this plan was
    still under evaluation. In Maromba as of early 2008, a pilot
    production system was under consideration, with first oil
    projected for 2013. Elsewhere in Campos, the company
    relinquished its 30 percent nonoperated working interest in
    BM-C-4. In the 20 percent-owned and partner-operated Santos
    Basin Block BS-4, development options for the Atlanta and Oliva
    fields were under evaluation.

Colombia:

The company operates the offshore Chuchupa
    and the onshore Ballena and Riohacha natural gas fields as part
    of the Guajira Association contract. In exchange, Chevron
    receives 43 percent of the production for the remaining
    life of each field and a variable production volume from a
    fixed-fee Build-Operate-Maintain-Transfer agreement based on
    prior Chuchupa capital contributions. Daily net production
    averaged 178 million cubic feet of natural gas, or
    30,000 barrels of oil-equivalent, in 2007. During the year,
    new dehydration facilities were constructed that enabled natural
    gas exports to Venezuela beginning in January 2008.

Trinidad and Tobago:

The company has a
    50 percent nonoperated working interest in four blocks in
    the East Coast Marine Area offshore Trinidad, which include the
    Dolphin and Dolphin Deep producing natural gas fields and the
    Starfish discovery. Net production from Dolphin and Dolphin Deep
    in 2007 averaged 174 million cubic feet of natural gas per
    day, or 29,000 barrels of oil-equivalent.

In May 2007, a domestic natural gas sales agreement was signed
    for the Trinidad Incremental Gas project. The agreement includes
    the delivery of 220 million cubic feet per day for
    11 years with an option for a four-year extension. Drilling
    operations started in late 2007 at the Dolphin platform. First
    gas for the project is expected in 2009, ramping up to maximum
    total production of 220 million cubic feet of natural gas
    per day in early 2010. Reserves were initially booked in 2006.
    In 2007, additional proved reserves were recorded, and some
    proved undeveloped reserves were reclassified to the proved
    developed category. Further reclassifications are expected in
    2008, following the drilling of additional development wells.

Chevron also holds a 50 percent operated interest in the
    Manatee area of Block 6d. In early 2007, an agreement was
    signed by the governments of Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago
    to unitize the Loran Field in Venezuela and the Manatee area.
    Negotiations are expected to continue in 2008 to achieve a
    field-specific unitization treaty.

Venezuela:

Chevron holds interest in two affiliates
    located in western Venezuela and one affiliate in the Orinoco
    Belt. The company also operates in two exploratory blocks
    offshore Plataforma Deltana, with working interests of
    60 percent in Block 2 and 100 percent in
    Block 3. In Block 2, which includes the Loran natural
    gas field, a conceptual offshore development plan was completed
    in 2007. In Block 3, Chevron discovered natural gas in 2005
    that is in close proximity to Loran. Both Block 3 and Loran
    will provide a possible supply source for Venezuela’s first
    LNG train. Seismic work elsewhere in Block 3 was completed
    in 2007. Chevron also has a 100 percent interest in the
    Cardon III



block, located north of the Maracaibo producing region. Seismic
    in this block, which has natural gas potential, was acquired in
    2007 and is planned to be processed in 2008. Petróleos de
    Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA) has the option to increase its ownership
    in all three company-operated blocks up to 35 percent upon
    declaration of commerciality.

Refer also to page 24 for a discussion of affiliate
    operations in Venezuela.

Canada:

The company has nonoperated working
    interests of 27 percent in the Hibernia Field offshore
    eastern Canada and 20 percent in the Athabasca Oil Sands
    Project (AOSP), a 60 percent operated interest in the Ells
    River “In Situ” Oil Sands Project, a 28 percent
    operated interest in the Hebron project and exploration acreage
    in the Mackenzie Delta, Beaufort Sea and the Orphan Basin.
    Excluding volumes mined at the AOSP, average net oil-equivalent
    production during 2007 was 36,000 barrels per day, composed
    of 35,000 barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and
    5 million cubic feet of natural gas. Substantially all of
    the production was from the Hibernia Field. At AOSP, bitumen
    mined and upgraded to synthetic crude oil averaged
    27,000 net barrels per day.

At AOSP, the first phase of an expansion project, with an
    estimated total project cost of $10.2 billion, is being
    designed to upgrade an additional 100,000 barrels of
    bitumen into synthetic crude oil per day. The expansion would
    increase total AOSP design capacity to more than
    255,000 barrels of bitumen per day in 2010. Preliminary
    work is under way to determine the feasibility of additional
    expansion projects.

The Ells River project consists of heavy oil leases of more than
    85,000 acres. The area contains significant volumes with
    the potential for recovery using Steam Assisted Gravity
    Drainage, a proven technology that employs steam and horizontal
    drilling to extract the bitumen through wells rather than
    through mining operations. During 2007, a successful appraisal
    drilling program involving 66 wells was completed.

Follow-up

appraisal activities are planned in 2008, with a similar number
    of wells and a small

2-D

and

3-D

seismic
    program.

The potential development at Hebron stalled in 2006 after
    unsuccessful negotiations with the provincial government of
    Newfoundland and Labrador. In mid-2007, the Hebron partners
    executed a nonbinding memorandum of understanding with the
    government that outlined fiscal, equity and local-benefit terms
    associated with the Hebron project. Execution of formal
    agreements is expected during 2008.

Exploratory activities are expected to continue during 2008 in
    the Mackenzie Delta and the Orphan Basin.

Denmark:

Chevron holds a 15 percent nonoperated working interest in the Danish Underground Consortium (DUC), which produces crude oil and natural gas from 15 fields in the Danish North Sea and has a 12 percent interest in each of four exploration licenses. Net oil-equivalent production in 2007 from DUC averaged 63,000 barrels per day, composed of 41,000 barrels of crude
oil and 132 million cubic feet of natural gas.

Faroe Islands:

Chevron has a 40 percent interest in five offshore blocks and is the operator. During 2007, the company acquired a

2-D

seismic survey over License 008, located near the Rosebank/Lochnagar discovery in the United Kingdom.

Greenland:

In October
2007, Chevron was awarded a 29 percent nonoperated working interest in an exploration license in Block 4 offshore West Greenland in the Baffin Basin. The planned four-year work program includes seismic acquisition, and geologic, engineering and environmental studies.

Netherlands:

Chevron is the operator and holds
    interests ranging from 34 percent to 80 percent in
    nine blocks in the Dutch sector of the North Sea. The
    company’s daily net production from eight producing fields
    averaged 3,000 barrels of crude oil and 5 million
    cubic feet of natural gas. Production

start-up

at
    the first stage of the A/B Gas Project from Block A12 occurred
    in December 2007 at an initial daily total rate of
    60 million cubic feet of natural gas. As of early 2008, the
    second stage of the project was under evaluation.

Norway:

At the 8 percent-owned and
    partner-operated Draugen Field, the company’s net
    production during 2007 was 6,000 barrels of oil-equivalent
    per day. In the 40 percent-owned and partner-operated
    PL397, seismic survey data was processed in 2007. Acquisition of
    additional seismic data is planned for 2008. Exploration
    activities are expected to continue in 2008 in various license
    areas.

United Kingdom:

The company’s average net
    oil-equivalent production in 2007 from nine offshore fields was
    115,000 barrels per day, composed of 78,000 barrels of
    crude oil and 220 million cubic feet of natural gas. Most
    of the



production was from the 85 percent-owned and operated
    Captain Field and the 32 percent-owned and jointly-operated
    Britannia Field.

As of early 2008, development activities were continuing at the
    Britannia satellite fields Callanish and Brodgar, in which
    Chevron holds 17 percent and 25 percent nonoperated
    working interests, respectively. Production

start-up

from these two fields is expected to occur in late 2008.
    Together, these fields are expected to achieve maximum total
    daily production of 25,000 barrels of crude oil and
    133 million cubic feet of natural gas several months after
    both fields start up. Proved undeveloped reserves were initially
    recognized in 2000

.

In 2006, proved undeveloped reserves
    were reclassified to the proved developed category. This project
    has an expected production life of approximately 15 years.

In exploration activities, the Alder discovery west of the
    Britannia Field was being evaluated in early 2008 and is likely
    to be developed as a tieback to existing infrastructure. The
    company has a 70 percent operated interest in the project,
    which is expected to start up and reach maximum total daily
    production rates of 9,000 barrels of crude oil and
    80 million cubic feet of natural gas in 2012. The timing of
    the initial proved-reserves recognition was also under
    evaluation in early 2008. This project has an expected
    production life of approximately nine years.

At the Rosebank/Lochnagar discovery west of the Shetland
    Islands, an appraisal program consisting of three wells and a
    sidetrack was completed in 2007. All four wellbores encountered
    hydrocarbons, and an evaluation for commerciality was under way
    in early 2008. Evaluation continued of a successful natural gas
    production test at the Tormore well that is also in the West of
    Shetlands gas trend. During 2007, another successful appraisal
    well was drilled in the Clair Phase 2 area.

Equity
    Affiliate Operations

Angola:

In addition to the exploration and producing
    activities in Angola, Chevron participates in the Angola LNG
    project, for which the company and partners made a final
    investment decision at the end of 2007. The LNG plant will be
    designed with a capacity to process 1 billion cubic feet of
    natural gas per day and will provide a commercial option for
    Angola’s natural gas resources. Chevron has a
    36 percent interest in the Angola LNG affiliate.
    Construction began in early 2008 on the
    5.2 million-metric-ton-per-year onshore LNG plant that is
    located in the northern part of the country. Plant

start-up

is
    expected in 2012. At the end of 2007, the company made an
    initial booking of proved natural gas reserves for the producing
    operations associated with this LNG project. The life of the LNG
    plant is estimated to be in excess of 20 years.

Kazakhstan:

The company holds a 50 percent
    interest in Tengizchevroil (TCO), which is developing the Tengiz
    and Korolev crude-oil fields located in western Kazakhstan under
    a

40-year

concession that expires in 2033. Chevron’s net
    oil-equivalent production in 2007 from these fields averaged
    176,000 barrels per day, composed of 144,000 barrels
    of crude oil and natural gas liquids and 193 million cubic
    feet of natural gas.

TCO is undergoing a significant expansion composed of two
    integrated projects referred to as the Second Generation Plant
    (SGP) and Sour Gas Injection (SGI). At a total combined cost of
    approximately $7.2 billion, these projects are designed to
    increase TCO’s crude-oil production capacity to
    540,000 barrels per day during the second half of 2008.

SGP involves the construction of a large processing train for
    treating crude oil and the associated sour gas (i.e., high in
    sulfur content). The SGP design is based on the same
    conventional technology employed in the existing processing
    trains. Proved undeveloped reserves associated with SGP were
    recognized in 2001. Wells were drilled, deepened

and/or

completed since 2002 in the Tengiz and Korolev reservoirs to
    produce volumes required for the new SGP train. Reserves
    associated with the project were reclassified to the proved
    developed category. Over the next decade, ongoing field
    development is expected to result in the reclassification of
    additional proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed.

SGI involves taking a portion of the sour gas separated from the
    crude-oil production at the SGP processing train and reinjecting
    it into the Tengiz reservoir. Chevron expects that SGI will have
    two key effects. First, SGI will reduce the sour gas processing
    capacity required at SGP, thereby increasing liquid production
    capacity and lowering the quantities of sulfur and gas that
    would otherwise be generated. Second, SGI is expected over time
    to increase production efficiency and recoverable volumes as the
    injected gas maintains higher reservoir pressure and displaces
    oil toward producing wells. The company anticipates recognizing
    additional proved reserves associated with the SGI expansion in
    late 2008. The primary SGI risks include uncertainties about
    compressor performance associated with injecting high-pressure
    sour gas and subsurface responses to injection.



Initial production from the first phase of the SGI/SGP expansion
    projects occurred in late 2007. This first phase increased
    production capacity by 90,000 barrels per day, to
    approximately 400,000, in January 2008.

As of early 2008, essentially all of TCO’s production was
    being exported through the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC)
    pipeline that runs from Tengiz in Kazakhstan to tanker loading
    facilities at Novorossiysk on the Russian coast of the Black
    Sea. Also in early 2008, CPC was seeking stockholder approval
    for an expansion to accommodate increased TCO volumes beginning
    in 2009. Expanded rail-car loading and rail-export facilities,
    designed to transport most of the incremental SGI/SGP production
    prior to the CPC expansion, started operation during 2007. As of
    early 2008, other alternatives were also being explored to
    increase export capacity.

Venezuela:

Chevron has a 30 percent interest in
    the Hamaca heavy oil production and upgrading project located in
    Venezuela’s Orinoco Belt, a 39 percent interest in the
    Petroboscan affiliate that operates the Boscan Field, and a
    25 percent interest in the Petroindependiente affiliate
    that operates the LL-652 Field. The company’s average net
    oil-equivalent production during 2007 from these affiliates was
    72,000 barrels per day, composed of 68,000 barrels of
    crude oil and 27 million cubic feet of natural gas.

The Hamaca project has a total design capacity for processing
    and upgrading 190,000 barrels per day of heavy crude oil
    (8.5 degrees API gravity) into 180,000 barrels of lighter,
    higher-value crude oil (26 degrees API gravity). In February
    2007, the president of Venezuela issued a decree announcing the
    government’s intention for PDVSA to increase its ownership
    in all Orinoco Heavy Oil Associations effective May 1,
    2007, including Chevron’s 30 percent-owned Hamaca
    project, to a minimum of 60 percent. In December 2007, Chevron
    executed a conversion agreement and signed a charter and by-laws
    with a PDVSA subsidiary that provided for Chevron to retain its
    30 percent interest in the Hamaca project. The new entity,
    Petropiar, commenced activities in January 2008.

The Boscan Field is located onshore western Venezuela. A 3-D
    seismic program was acquired in 2007 that is expected to guide
    future development activities in South Boscan. The
    water-injection pressure-maintenance project was expanded to
    include four wells converted to injectors in 2007, and four new
    injectors are planned to be drilled in 2008 and 2009. The LL-652
    Field is located in Lake Maracaibo.

Russia:

As of early 2008, Chevron and JSC Gazprom
    Neft continued to negotiate the final agreements for exploration
    and development activities in two licensed areas in the
    Yamal-Nenets region of western Siberia. Once the agreement is
    finalized, Chevron is expected to hold a 49 percent
    interest in the Northern Taiga Neftegaz LLC affiliate, which
    will operate in the licensed areas. Exploration and delineation
    activities are planned for 2008 on both licenses.

Sales of
    Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids

The company sells natural gas and natural gas liquids from its
    producing operations under a variety of contractual
    arrangements. Outside the United States, substantially all of
    the natural gas sales are from the company’s producing
    interests in Australia, Bangladesh, Kazakhstan, Indonesia, Latin
    America, the Philippines, Thailand and the United Kingdom.
    Substantially all of the company’s natural gas liquids
    sales are from company operations in Africa, Australia and
    Indonesia. Refer to “Selected Operating Data,” on

page FS-10

in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations, for further information on
    the company’s natural gas and natural gas liquids sales
    volumes. Refer also to “Contract Obligations” on

In the first quarter 2008, the company sold its 4 percent
    ownership interest in an affiliate that owned a refinery in
    Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire, decreasing the company’s
    share of operable capacity by about 2,000 barrels per day.

Average crude oil distillation capacity utilization during 2007
    was 86 percent, compared with 90 percent in 2006. This
    decrease generally resulted from unplanned downtime to repair
    damage resulting from fires in the crude units at the Richmond
    and Pascagoula refineries during 2007. This impact was partially
    offset by an improvement in capacity utilization at the
    Pembroke, U.K., refinery, which had unplanned downtime in 2006.
    The crude unit at the Pascagoula Refinery was back in service in
    February 2008. Despite the outage at Pascagoula, the company was
    able to maintain uninterrupted product supplies to customers
    through the use of other feedstocks in its gasoline-producing
    facilities at the refinery. At the U.S. fuel refineries,
    crude oil distillation capacity utilization averaged
    85 percent in 2007, compared with 99 percent in 2006,
    and cracking and coking capacity utilization averaged
    78 percent and 86 percent in 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. Cracking and coking units, including fluid
    catalytic cracking units, are the primary facilities used in
    fuel refineries to convert heavier products into gasoline and
    other light products.

The company’s fuel refineries in the United States, Europe,
    Canada, South Africa and Australia produce low-sulfur fuels. In
    2007, Singapore Refining Company, the company’s
    50 percent-owned affiliate, began an upgrade project at its
    290,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Singapore to produce diesel
    fuels that meet Euro IV specifications.

In 2007, the company completed modifications at its refineries
    in El Segundo, California, to enable the processing of heavier
    crude oils into gasoline, diesel and other light products, and
    in the United Kingdom to increase the capability to process
    Caspian-blend crude oils. In October 2007, the company approved
    plans to construct a $500 million Continuous Catalyst
    Regeneration unit at the Pascagoula, Mississippi, refinery,
    which is expected to increase gasoline production by
    10 percent, or 600,000 gallons per day, by mid-2010. Design
    and engineering for a project to increase the



flexibility to process lower API-gravity crude oils at the
    company’s Richmond, California, refinery continued in 2007.
    Other upgrade projects at the El Segundo Refinery were being
    evaluated in early 2008.

In late 2007, GS Caltex, the company’s
    50 percent-owned affiliate, completed commissioning of new
    facilities associated with a $1.5 billion upgrade project
    at the 680,000-barrel-per-day Yeosu refining complex in South
    Korea. This project is expected to increase the yield of
    high-value refined products by 33,000 barrels per day, add
    15,000 barrels of new lubricant base oil production and
    reduce feedstock costs through an increase in the
    refinery’s ability to process heavy oil.

Chevron owns a 5 percent interest in Reliance Petroleum
    Limited, a company formed by Reliance Industries Limited to own
    and operate a new export refinery being constructed in Jamnagar,
    India. The refinery is expected to begin operation by year-end
    2008, with a crude-oil capacity of 580,000 barrels per day.
    Chevron has future rights to increase its equity ownership to
    29 percent.

Chevron processes imported and domestic crude oil in its
    U.S. refining operations. Imported crude oil accounted for
    about 87 percent of Chevron’s U.S. refinery
    inputs in 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Gas-to-Liquids

Through the Sasol Chevron Global

50-50

Joint
    Venture, the company is pursuing gas-to-liquids (GTL)
    opportunities in several countries.

In Nigeria, Chevron and the Nigerian National Petroleum
    Corporation are developing a 34,000-barrel-per-day GTL facility
    at Escravos designed to process natural gas supplied from the
    Phase 3A expansion of the Escravos Gas Plant (EGP). As of early
    2008, approximately 90 percent of engineering and
    procurement activities had been completed. Chevron has a
    75 percent interest in the plant, which is expected to be
    operational by the end of the decade. Refer also to page 16
    for a discussion on the EGP Phase 3A expansion.

    Australia operates using the Caltex, Caltex Woolworths and Ampol
    brands.

The company continued the marketing and sale of retail fuels
    networks and individual service station sites, focusing on
    selected areas outside the United States. In 2007, the company
    sold its fuels marketing businesses in Belgium, the Netherlands
    and Luxembourg and its retail fuels business in Uruguay. The
    company also sold its interest in about 500 individual service
    station sites, primarily in the United Kingdom and Latin
    America. Since the beginning of 2003, the company has sold its
    interests in about 3,300 service station sites. The vast
    majority of these sites continue to market company-branded
    gasoline through new supply agreements.

The company also manages other marketing businesses globally.
    Chevron markets aviation fuel at more than 1,000 airports,
    representing a worldwide market share of about 11 percent,

During 2007, the company led the development of a natural gas
    gathering pipeline serving the Piceance Basin in northwest
    Colorado; participated in the successful installation of the

55-mile

Amberjack-Tahiti lateral pipeline on the seafloor of the
    U.S. Gulf of Mexico; and completed a pipeline running from
    the U.S. Gulf of Mexico subsea to the Fourchon Terminal in
    southern Louisiana. The company is also leading the expansion of
    the West Texas liquefied natural gas pipeline system that is
    expected to be operational in late 2008. In addition, the
    company continued with its project to expand capacity by about
    2 billion cubic feet at its Keystone natural gas storage
    facility, which is expected to be completed in 2009.

Chevron has a 15 percent interest in the Caspian Pipeline
    Consortium (CPC) affiliate. CPC operates a crude oil export
    pipeline from the Tengiz Field in Kazakhstan to the Russian
    Black Sea port of Novorossiysk. During 2007, CPC transported an
    average of approximately 700,000 barrels of crude oil per
    day, including 545,000 barrels per day from Kazakhstan and
    155,000 barrels per day from Russia. For information
    related to the possible expansion of the CPC pipeline, refer to
    page 24.

The company has a 9 percent interest in the
    Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) affiliate, whose pipeline transports
    Azerbaijan International Operating Company (AIOC) (owned
    10 percent by Chevron) production from Baku, Azerbaijan,
    through Georgia to deepwater port facilities in Ceyhan, Turkey.
    The BTC pipeline has a crude-oil capacity of 1 million
    barrels per day and transports the majority of the AIOC
    production. Another crude oil production export route is the
    Western Route Export Pipeline, wholly owned by AIOC, with

crude-oil

capacity to transport 145,000 barrels per day from Baku,
    Azerbaijan, to the terminal at Supsa, Georgia.

At any given time during 2007, the company
    had approximately 80 vessels chartered on a voyage basis,
    or for a period of less than one year. Additionally, all tankers
    in Chevron’s controlled seagoing fleet were utilized during
    2007. The following table summarizes cargo transported on the
    company’s controlled fleet.

Federal law requires that cargo transported between
    U.S. ports be carried in ships built and registered in the
    United States, owned and operated by U.S. entities, and
    manned by U.S. crews. In 2007, the company’s
    U.S. flag fleet was engaged primarily in transporting
    refined products between the Gulf Coast and the East Coast and
    from California refineries to terminals on the West Coast and in
    Alaska and Hawaii. Three

U.S.-flagged

product tankers, each capable of carrying 300,000 barrels
    of cargo, are scheduled for delivery from 2008 through 2010.

The foreign-flagged vessels were engaged primarily in
    transporting crude oil from the Middle East, Asia, the Black
    Sea, Mexico and West Africa to ports in the United States,
    Europe, Australia and Asia. Refined products were also
    transported by tanker worldwide. During 2007, the company took
    delivery of one new double-hulled tanker, with a total capacity
    of 500,000 barrels, and one

U.S.-flagged

product tanker capable of carrying 300,000 barrels of
    cargo. The company also returned a

1 million-barrel-capacity

crude tanker at the end of its lease.

In addition to the vessels described above, the company owns a
    one-sixth interest in each of seven liquefied natural gas (LNG)
    tankers transporting cargoes for the North West Shelf (NWS)
    Venture in Australia. The NWS project also has two LNG tankers
    under long-term time charter. In 2005, Chevron placed orders for
    two company-owned LNG tankers.

The Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 requires the phase-out by
    year-end 2010 of all single-hull tankers trading to
    U.S. ports or transferring cargo in waters within the
    U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone. This has raised the demand
    for double-hull tankers. At the end of 2007, 100 percent of
    the company’s owned and bareboat-chartered fleet was

double-hulled.

The company is a member of many oil-spill-response cooperatives
    in areas in which it operates around the world.

Chemicals

Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem) is equally owned
    with ConocoPhillips Corporation. At the end of 2007, CPChem
    owned or had joint venture interests in 30 manufacturing
    facilities and six research and technical centers in Belgium,
    China, Puerto Rico, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea
    and the United States.

In 2007, CPChem completed construction on the integrated,
    world-scale styrene facility in Al Jubail, Saudi Arabia. Jointly
    owned with the Saudi Industrial Investment Group (SIIG),
    commercial production is expected to commence in mid-2008. The
    styrene facility is located adjacent to CPChem and SIIG’s
    existing aromatics complex in Al Jubail. Also during 2007,
    CPChem secured final approval for a third petrochemical project
    in Al Jubail. Construction began in early 2008, with expected
    completion in 2011. Preliminary studies are focused on the
    construction of a world-scale olefins unit as well as related
    downstream units to produce polyethylene, polypropylene,
    1-hexene and polystyrene. In the first half of 2008, commercial
    operations are expected to begin for the Americas Styrenics
    joint venture between CPChem and Dow Chemical Company that
    combines CPChem’s styrene and polystyrene operations with
    Dow’s polystyrene operations.

CPChem continued construction during 2007 on the
    49 percent-owned Q-Chem II project in Mesaieed, Qatar.
    The project includes a 350,000-metric-ton-per-year polyethylene
    plant and a 345,000-metric-ton-per-year normal alpha olefins
    plant — each utilizing CPChem proprietary
    technology — and is located adjacent to the existing
    Q-Chem I complex. Q-Chem II also includes a separate joint
    venture to develop a 1.3 million-metric-ton-per-year
    ethylene cracker at Qatar’s Ras Laffan Industrial City, in
    which Q-Chem II owns 54 percent of the capacity
    rights. CPChem and its



partners expect to start up the plants in the first half of
    2009. Construction also began during 2007 of the
    Ryton

®

polyphenylene sulfide manufacturing facility in Texas, with
    completion scheduled for 2009.

Chevron’s Oronite brand lubricant and fuel additives
    business is a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of
    performance additives for lubricating oils and fuels. The
    company owns and operates facilities in Brazil, France, Japan,
    the Netherlands, Singapore and the United States and has equity
    interests in facilities in India and Mexico. Oronite provides
    additives for lubricating oil in most engine applications, such
    as passenger car, heavy-duty diesel, marine, locomotive and
    motorcycle engines, and additives for fuels to improve engine
    performance and extend engine life. Oronite has completed
    construction of the new carboxylate detergent unit in France.
    This facility will produce new sulfur-free detergent components
    for marine engine applications and low-sulfur components for
    automotive engine oil applications. Full commercial production
    from this facility is expected to commence early in the second
    quarter 2008.

Other
    Businesses

Mining

Chevron’s

U.S.-based

mining company produces and markets coal, molybdenum, rare earth
    minerals and calcined petroleum coke. Sales occur in both
    U.S. and international markets.

In 2007, the company’s coal mining and marketing
    subsidiary, The Pittsburg & Midway Coal Mining Co.
    (P&M), changed its name to Chevron Mining Inc.
    (CMI) and merged with Molycorp Inc., another Chevron mining
    subsidiary, to form a single Chevron mining entity. The company
    owns and operates two surface coal mines, McKinley, in New
    Mexico, and Kemmerer, in Wyoming, and one underground coal mine,
    North River, in Alabama. Sales of coal from CMI’s wholly
    owned mines were 12 million tons, down about 1 million
    tons from 2006.

At year-end 2007, CMI controlled approximately 214 million
    tons of proven and probable coal reserves in the United States,
    including reserves of environmentally desirable low-sulfur coal.
    The company is contractually committed to deliver between
    11 million and 12 million tons of coal per year
    through the end of 2009 and believes it will satisfy these
    contracts from existing coal reserves.

In addition to the coal operations, Chevron owns and operates
    the Questa molybdenum mine in New Mexico and the Mountain Pass
    rare earth mine in California. At year-end 2007, CMI controlled
    approximately 57 million pounds of proven molybdenum
    reserves at Questa and 241 million pounds of proven and
    probable rare earth reserves at Mountain Pass.

Chevron also owns a 33 percent interest in Sumikin
    Molycorp, a manufacturer of neodymium compounds, located in
    Japan, and a 50 percent interest in Youngs Creek Mining
    Company LLC, a joint venture to develop a coal mine in northern
    Wyoming. The company also owns the Chicago Carbon Company, a
    producer and marketer of calcined petroleum coke, which operates
    a 250,000-ton-per-year petroleum coke calciner facility in
    Lemont, Illinois.

Power
    Generation

Chevron’s power generation business develops and operates
    commercial power projects and owns 15 power assets located in
    the United States and Asia. The company manages the production
    of more than 2,334 megawatts of electricity at 11 facilities it
    owns through joint ventures. The company operates gas-fired
    cogeneration facilities that use waste heat recovery to produce
    additional electricity or to support industrial thermal hosts. A
    number of the facilities produce steam for use in upstream
    operations to facilitate production of heavy oil.

The company has major geothermal operations in Indonesia and the
    Philippines and is investigating several advanced solar
    technologies for use in oil field operations as part of its
    renewable energy strategy. For additional information on the
    company’s geothermal operations and renewable energy
    projects, refer to pages 19 and 20, and the Research and
    Technology section below, respectively.

Chevron
    Energy Solutions

Chevron Energy Solutions (CES) is a wholly owned subsidiary that
    provides public institutions and businesses with projects
    designed to increase energy efficiency and reliability, reduce
    energy costs, and utilize renewable and alternative power
    technologies. CES has energy-saving projects installed in more
    than a thousand buildings nationwide. Major



projects completed by CES in 2007 include energy efficiency
    installations for the state of Colorado government facilities
    and a 1.1 megawatt solar system at California’s Fresno
    State University.

Research
    and Technology

The company’s Energy Technology Company (ETC) supports
    Chevron’s upstream and downstream businesses. ETC provides
    technology and competency support in earth sciences; reservoir
    and production engineering; drilling and completions; facilities
    engineering; health, environment and safety; refining; technical
    computing; strategic planning; and organizational capability.

Technology Ventures Company manages investments and projects in
    emerging energy technologies and their integration into
    Chevron’s core businesses. Its activities are managed
    through four business units: Venture Capital, Biofuels, Hydrogen
    and Emerging Energy.

Information Technology Company integrates computing,
    telecommunications, data management, security and network
    technology to provide a standardized digital infrastructure for
    Chevron’s global operations.

During 2007, the company entered into research alliances with
    Texas A&M University, with focus on the production and
    conversion of crops for biofuels from cellulose, and the
    Colorado Center for Biorefining and Biofuel, with focus on
    conversion technologies. The company also has research alliances
    with the University of California, Davis and the Georgia
    Institute of Technology that are focused on converting
    cellulosic biomass into transportation fuels.

Chevron’s research and development expenses were
    $562 million, $468 million and $316 million for
    the years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Some of the investments the company makes in the areas described
    above are in new or unproven technologies and business
    processes, and ultimate successes are not certain. Although not
    all initiatives may prove to be economically viable, the
    company’s overall investment in this area is not
    significant to the company’s consolidated financial
    position.

Environmental
    Protection

Virtually all aspects of the company’s businesses are
    subject to various U.S. federal, state and local
    environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and to
    similar laws and regulations in other countries. These
    regulatory requirements continue to change and increase in both
    number and complexity and to govern not only the manner in which
    the company conducts its operations, but also the products it
    sells. Chevron expects more environment-related regulations in
    the countries where it has operations. Most of the costs of
    complying with the many laws and regulations pertaining to its
    operations are embedded in the normal costs of conducting
    business.

In 2007, the company’s U.S. capitalized environmental
    expenditures were approximately $350 million, representing
    approximately 5 percent of the company’s total
    consolidated U.S. capital and exploratory expenditures.
    These environmental expenditures include capital outlays to
    retrofit existing facilities as well as those associated with
    new facilities. The expenditures are predominantly in the
    upstream and downstream segments and relate mostly to air- and
    water-quality projects and activities at the company’s
    refineries, oil and gas producing facilities, and marketing
    facilities. For 2008, the company estimates U.S. capital
    expenditures for environmental control facilities will be
    approximately $580 million. The future annual capital costs
    of fulfilling this commitment are uncertain and will be governed
    by several factors, including future changes to regulatory
    requirements.

Further information on environmental matters and their impact on
    Chevron and on the company’s 2007 environmental
    expenditures, remediation provisions and year-end environmental
    reserves are contained in Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on

Item 1A.    Risk
    Factors

Chevron is a major fully integrated petroleum company with a
    diversified business portfolio, a strong balance sheet, and a
    history of generating sufficient cash to fund capital and
    exploratory expenditures and to pay dividends. Nevertheless,
    some inherent risks could materially impact the company’s
    financial results of operations or financial condition.

Chevron
    is exposed to the effects of changing commodity
    prices.

Chevron is primarily in a commodities business with a history of
    price volatility. The single largest variable that affects the
    company’s results of operations is crude-oil prices. Except
    in the ordinary course of running an integrated petroleum
    business, Chevron does not seek to hedge its exposure to price
    changes. A significant, persistent decline in crude-oil prices
    may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations
    and its capital and exploratory expenditure plans.

The
    scope of Chevron’s business will decline if the company
    does not successfully develop resources.

The company is in an extractive business; therefore, if Chevron
    is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it
    produces with good prospects for future production, the
    company’s business will decline. Creating and maintaining
    an inventory of projects depends on many factors, including
    obtaining and renewing rights to explore, develop and produce
    hydrocarbons; drilling success; ability to bring long-lead-time,
    capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and schedule;
    and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties.

The
    company’s operations could be disrupted by natural or human
    factors.

Chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes
    inhospitable regions. The company’s operations and
    facilities are therefore subject to disruption from either
    natural or human causes, including hurricanes, floods and other
    forms of severe weather, war, civil unrest and other political
    events, fires, earthquakes, and explosions, any of which could
    result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the
    natural environment.

Chevron’s
    business subjects the company to liability risks.

The company produces, transports, refines and markets materials
    with potential toxicity, and it purchases, handles and disposes
    of other potentially toxic materials in the course of the
    company’s business. Chevron operations also produce
    byproducts, which may be considered pollutants. Any of these
    activities could result in liability, either as a result of an
    accidental, unlawful discharge or as a result of new conclusions
    on the effects of the company’s operations on human health
    or the environment.

Political
    instability could harm Chevron’s business.

The company’s operations, particularly exploration and
    production, can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and
    political environments in the various countries in which it
    operates. As has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by
    governments to increase public ownership of the company’s
    partially or wholly owned businesses

and/or

to
    impose additional taxes or royalties.

In certain locations, governments have imposed restrictions,
    controls and taxes, and in others, political conditions have
    existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the
    company’s continued presence in those countries. Internal
    unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a
    government and the company or other governments may affect the
    company’s operations. Those developments have, at times,
    significantly affected the company’s related operations and
    results and are carefully considered by management when
    evaluating the level of current and future activity in such
    countries. At December 31, 2007, 26 percent of the
    company’s proved reserves were located in Kazakhstan. The
    company also has significant interests in Organization of
    Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) — member
    countries including Angola, Indonesia, Nigeria and Venezuela.
    Twenty-eight percent of the company’s net proved reserves,
    including affiliates, were located in OPEC countries at
    December 31, 2007.



Regulation
    of greenhouse gas emissions could increase Chevron’s
    operational costs and reduce demand for Chevron’s
    products.

Management believes it is reasonably likely that the scientific
    and political attention to issues concerning the existence and
    extent of climate change, and the role of human activity in it,
    will continue, with the potential for further regulation that
    affects the company’s operations. Although uncertain, these
    developments could increase costs or reduce the demand for the
    products the company sells. The company’s production and
    processing operations (e.g., the production of crude oil at
    offshore platforms and the processing of natural gas at
    liquefied natural gas facilities) typically result in emissions
    of greenhouse gases. Likewise, emissions arise from midstream
    and downstream operations, including crude oil transportation
    and refining. Finally, although beyond the control of the
    company, the use of passenger vehicle fuels and related products
    by consumers also results in greenhouse gas emissions that may
    be regulated.

International agreements, domestic legislation and regulatory
    measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions are currently in
    various phases of discussion or implementation. These include
    the Kyoto Protocol, proposed federal legislation and current
    state-level actions. Some of the countries in which Chevron
    operates have ratified the Kyoto Protocol, and the company is
    currently complying with greenhouse gas emissions limits within
    the European Union. Although resolutions supporting “cap
    and trade” systems have been introduced in the
    U.S. Congress, no bill restricting greenhouse gas emissions
    has been passed to date.

In California, the Global Warming Solutions Act became effective
    on January 1, 2007. This law caps California’s
    greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by 2020; directs the Air
    Resources Board, the responsible state agency, to determine
    certain greenhouse gas emissions in and outside California to
    adopt mandatory reporting rules for significant sources of
    greenhouse gases; delegates to the agency the authority to adopt
    compliance mechanisms (including market-based approaches); and
    permits a one-year extension of the targets under extraordinary
    circumstances. Related regulatory activity is under way within
    the California Public Utilities Commission. The Air Resources
    Board and the California Energy Commission are also in the
    process of developing a “Low Carbon Fuel Standard” for
    transportation fuels used in California, as directed by Governor
    Arnold Schwarzenegger. The company extracts crude oil and
    natural gas, operates refineries, and markets and sells
    gasoline, diesel and jet fuel in California. The extent to which
    the state and local agencies’ regulations will affect the
    company’s California operations was not known as of early
    2008.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
    and Procedures

Chevron Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of the
    company’s “disclosure controls and procedures”
    (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange
    Act”)), as of December 31, 2007, have concluded that
    as of December 31, 2007, the company’s disclosure
    controls and procedures were effective and designed to provide
    reasonable assurance that material information relating to the
    company and its consolidated subsidiaries required to be
    included in the company’s periodic filings under the
    Exchange Act would be made known to them by others within those
    entities.

(b)

Management’s Report on
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The company’s management is responsible for establishing
    and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
    reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f).

The company’s management, including the Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of
    the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on the

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the results
    of this evaluation, the company’s management concluded that
    internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
    December 31, 2007.

The effectiveness of the company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, has been
    audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
    public accounting firm, as stated in its report included on

page FS-26.

(c)

Changes in Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting

During the quarter ended December 31, 2007, there were no
    changes in the company’s internal control over financial
    reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably
    likely to materially affect, the company’s internal control
    over financial reporting.

Refer to the “Results of Operations” section beginning on page FS-6 for a detailed
discussion of financial results by major operating area for the three years ending December 31,
2007.

Business Environment and Outlook

Chevron is a global energy company with significant business activities in the following
countries: Angola, Argentina, Australia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Brazil, Cambodia, Canada, Chad,
China, Colombia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark, France, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan,
Myanmar, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Norway, the Partitioned Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait, the Philippines, Qatar, Republic of the Congo, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea,
Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, the United Kingdom, the United States, Venezuela and Vietnam.

Current and future earnings of the company depend largely on the profitability of its upstream
(exploration and production) and downstream (refining, marketing and transportation) business
segments. The single biggest factor that affects the results of operations for both segments is
movement in the price of crude oil. In the downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost
component of refined products.

The overall trend in earnings is typically less affected by results from the company’s chemicals
business and other activities and investments. Earnings for the company in any period may also be
influenced by events or transactions that are infrequent and/or unusual in nature.

Chevron and the oil and gas industry at large continue to experience an increase in certain
costs that exceeds the general trend of inflation in many areas of the world. This increase in
costs is affecting the company’s operating expenses and capital expenditures, particularly for the
upstream business. The company’s operations, especially upstream, can also be affected by changing
economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates,
including the United States. Civil unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a
government and the company or other governments may impact the company’s operations or investments.
Those developments have at times significantly affected the company’s operations and results and
are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in
such countries.

To sustain its long-term competitive position in the upstream business, the company must
develop and replenish an inventory of projects that offer adequate financial returns for the
investment required. Identifying promising areas for exploration, acquiring the necessary rights to
explore for and to produce crude oil and natural gas, drilling successfully, and handling the many
technical and operational details in a safe and cost-effective manner are all important factors in
this effort. Projects often require long lead times and large capital commitments. In the current
environment of higher commodity prices, certain governments have sought to renegotiate contracts or
impose additional costs on the company. Other governments may attempt to do so in the future. The
company will continue to monitor these developments, take them into account in evaluating future
investment opportunities, and otherwise seek to mitigate any risks to the company’s current
operations or future prospects.

The company also continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not
expected to provide sufficient long-term value, or to acquire assets or operations complementary to
its asset base to help augment the company’s growth. Asset sales during 2007 included the company’s
31 percent ownership interest in a refinery and related assets in the Netherlands; fuels marketing
businesses in Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Uruguay; and the investment in common stock
of Dynegy Inc. Other asset dispositions and restructurings may occur in future periods and could
result in significant gains or losses.

Comments related to earnings trends for the company’s major business areas are as follows:

FS-2


Upstream

Earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry price levels for
crude oil and natural gas. Crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over
which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global economic
conditions, industry inventory levels, production quotas imposed by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC), weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, and
regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that

may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. Moreover, any of these
factors could also inhibit the company’s production capacity in an affected region. The company
monitors developments closely in the countries in which it operates and holds investments, and
attempts to manage risks in operating its facilities and business.

Price levels for capital and exploratory costs and operating expenses associated with the
efficient production of crude oil and natural gas can also be subject to external factors beyond
the company’s control. External factors include not only the general level of inflation but also
prices charged by the industry’s material- and service-providers, which can be affected by the
volatility of the industry’s own supply and demand conditions for such materials and services. The
oil and gas industry worldwide has experienced significant price increases for these items since
2005, and future price increases may continue to exceed the general level of inflation. Capital and
exploratory expenditures and operating expenses also can be affected by damages to production
facilities caused by severe weather or civil unrest.

Industry price levels for crude oil increased during 2007. The spot price for West Texas
Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, a benchmark crude oil, averaged $72 per barrel in 2007, up
approximately $6 per barrel from the 2006 average price. The rise in crude oil prices was
attributed primarily to increasing demand in growing economies, the heightened level of
geopolitical uncertainty in some areas of the world and supply concerns in other key producing
regions. As of mid-February 2008, the WTI price was about $93 per barrel.

As in 2006, a wide differential in prices existed in 2007 between high-quality (i.e.,
high-gravity, low sulfur) crude oils

and those of lower quality (i.e., low-gravity, heavier types of crude). The price for the heavier
crudes has been dampened because of ample supply and lower relative demand due to the limited
number of refineries that are able to process this lower-quality feedstock into light products
(i.e., motor gasoline, jet fuel, aviation gasoline and diesel fuel). The price for
higher-quality crude oil has remained high, as the demand for light products, which can be
more easily manufactured by refineries from high-quality crude oil, has been strong worldwide.
Chevron produces or shares in the production of heavy crude oil in California, Chad,
Indonesia, the Partitioned Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, Venezuela and certain
fields in Angola, China and the United Kingdom North Sea. (Refer to
page FS-l0 for the
company’s average U.S. and international crude oil prices.)

In contrast to price movements in
the global market for crude oil, price changes for natural gas in many regional markets are
more closely aligned with supply and demand conditions in those markets. In the United States
during 2007, benchmark prices at Henry Hub averaged about $7 per thousand cubic feet (MCF),
compared with about $6.50 in 2006. As of mid-February 2008, the Henry Hub price was about $8
per MCF. Fluctuations in the price for natural gas in the United States are closely associated
with the volumes produced in North America and the inventory in underground storage relative
to customer demand. U.S. natural gas prices are also typically higher during the winter period
when demand for heating is greatest.

Certain other regions of the world in which the company operates have different supply, demand
and regulatory circumstances, typically resulting in significantly lower average sales prices for
the company’s production of natural gas. (Refer to page FS-l0 for the company’s average natural gas
prices for the U.S. and international regions.) Additionally, excess-supply conditions that exist
in certain parts of the world cannot easily serve to mitigate the relatively high-

FS-3


Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations

price conditions in the United States and other markets because of the lack of infrastructure to
transport and receive liquefied natural gas.

To help address this regional imbalance between supply and demand for natural gas, Chevron is
planning increased investments in long-term projects in areas of excess supply to install
infrastructure to produce and liquefy natural gas for transport by tanker, along with investments
and commitments to regasify the product in markets where demand is strong and supplies are not as
plentiful. Due to the significance of the overall investment in these long-term projects, the
natural gas sales prices in the areas of excess supply (before the natural gas is transferred to a
company-owned or third-party processing facility) are expected to remain well below sales prices
for natural gas that is produced much nearer to areas of high demand and can be transported in
existing natural gas pipeline networks (as in the United States).

Besides the impact of the fluctuation in price for crude oil and natural gas, the longer-term
trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the
company’s ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas, changes in
fiscal terms of contracts, changes in tax rates on income, and the cost of goods and services.

Chevron’s worldwide net oil-equivalent production in 2007, including volumes produced from oil
sands, averaged 2.62 million barrels per day, a decline of about 48,000 barrels per day from 2006,
due mainly to the effect of a conversion of operating service agreements in Venezuela to
joint-stock companies. (Refer to the table “Selected Operating
Data” on page FS-l0 for a listing of
production volumes for each of the three years ending December 31, 2007.) The company estimates
that oil-equivalent production in 2008 will average approximately 2.65 million barrels per day.
This estimate is subject to many uncertainties, including quotas that may be imposed by OPEC, the
price effect on production volumes calculated under cost-recovery and variable-royalty provisions
of certain contracts, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations,
delays in project start-ups, weather conditions that may shut in production, civil unrest, changing
geopolitics or other disruptions to operations. Future production levels also are affected by the
size and number of economic investment opportunities and, for new large-scale projects, the time
lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production. Most of Chevron’s upstream
investment is currently being made outside the United States. Investments in upstream projects
generally are made well in advance of the start of the associated crude oil and natural gas
production.

Approximately 28 percent of the company’s net oil-equivalent production in 2007 occurred in
the OPEC-member countries of Angola, Indonesia, Nigeria and Venezuela and in the Partitioned
Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. OPEC quotas did not significantly affect Chevron’s production level in 2007.

The impact of OPEC quotas on the company’s production in 2008 is
uncertain.

In October 2006, Chevron’s Boscan and LL-652 operating service agreements in Venezuela were
converted to Empresas Mixtas (i.e., joint-stock companies), with Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A.
(PDVSA) as majority shareholder. From that time, Chevron reported its equity share of the Boscan
and LL-652 production, which was approximately 85,000 barrels per day less than what the company
previously reported under the operating service agreements. The change to the Empresa Mixta
structure did not have a material effect on the company’s results of operations, consolidated
financial position or liquidity.

In February 2007, the president of Venezuela issued a decree announcing the government’s
intention for PDVSA to take over operational control of all Orinoco Heavy Oil Associations
effective May 1, 2007, and to increase its ownership in all such Associations to a minimum of 60
percent. The decree included Chevron’s 30 percent-owned Hamaca project. In April 2007, Chevron
signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with PDVSA that summarized the ongoing discussions to
transfer control of Hamaca operations in accordance with the February decree. As provided in the
MOU, a PDVSA-controlled transitory operational committee, on which Chevron had representation,
assumed responsibility for daily operations on May 1, 2007. The MOU stipulated that terms of
existing contracts were to remain in place during the transition period. In December 2007, Chevron
executed a conversion agreement and signed a charter and by-laws with a PDVSA subsidiary that
provided for Chevron to retain its 30 percent interest in the Hamaca project. The new entity,
Petropiar, commenced activities in January 2008. The conversion agreement did not have a material
effect on Chevron’s results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity.

Refer to pages FS-6 through FS-7 for additional discussion of the company’s upstream
operations.

Downstream

Earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining and
marketing of products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil and feedstocks
for chemical manufacturing. Industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the
global and regional supply-and-demand balance for refined products and by changes in the price of
crude oil used for refinery feedstock. Industry margins can also be influenced by refined-product
inventory levels, geopolitical events, refinery maintenance programs and disruptions at refineries
resulting from unplanned outages that may be due to severe weather, fires or other operational
events.

Other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and
efficiency of the company’s refining and marketing network, the effectiveness of the crude-oil and

FS-4


product-supply functions and the economic returns on invested capital.
Profitability can also be affected by the volatility of tanker charter rates for the company’s
shipping operations, which are driven by the industry’s demand for crude oil and product
tankers. Other factors beyond the company’s control include the general level of inflation and
energy costs to operate the company’s refinery and distribution network.

The company’s most significant marketing areas are the West Coast of North America, the
U.S. Gulf Coast, Latin America, Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and the United Kingdom. Chevron
operates or has ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas except Latin America. For
the industry, refined-product margins were generally higher in 2007 than in 2006. For the company,
U.S. refined-product margins during 2007 were negatively affected by planned and unplanned downtime
at its three largest U.S. refineries.

Industry margins in the future may be volatile and are influenced by changes in the price of
crude oil used for refinery feedstock and by changes in the supply and demand for crude oil and
refined products. The industry supply and demand balance can be affected by disruptions at
refineries resulting from maintenance programs and unplanned outages, including weather-related
disruptions; refined-product inventory levels; and geopolitical events.

Refer to page FS-7 through FS-8 for additional discussion of the company’s downstream
operations.

Chemicals

Earnings in the petrochemicals business are closely tied to global chemical demand,
industry inventory levels and plant capacity utilization. Feedstock and fuel costs, which tend to
follow crude oil and natural gas price movements, also influence earnings in this segment.

Refer to page FS-8 for additional discussion of chemicals earnings.

Operating Developments

Key operating developments and other events during 2007 and early 2008 included the
following:

Upstream

Angola

Discovered crude oil at the 31 percent-owned and operated Malange-1 well in offshore
Block 14. Additional drilling and geologic and engineering studies are planned to appraise the
discovery. The company and partners also made the final investment decision to construct a
liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant that will be owned 36 percent by Chevron. The plant will be
designed

with a capacity to process 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day and produce 5.2 million
metric tons a year of LNG and related gas liquids products.

Australia

Received federal and state environmental approvals for development of the 50
percent-owned and operated Gorgon LNG project located off the northwest coast. The approvals
represented a significant milestone towards the development of the company’s natural gas resources
offshore Australia.

Bangladesh

Began production at the 98 percent-owned Bibiyana natural gas field. The field’s
total production is expected to increase to a maximum of 500 million cubic feet per day by 2010.

China

Signed a 30-year production-sharing contract with China National Petroleum Corporation
to assume operatorship and hold a 49 percent interest in the development of the Chuandongbei
natural gas area in central China. Design input capacity of the proposed gas plants is expected to
be 740 million cubic feet of natural gas per day.

Indonesia

Began commercial operation of the 1l0-megawatt Darajat III geothermal power plant in

U.S.
upstream income of $4.5 billion in 2007 increased approximately $260 million from
2006. Results in 2007 benefited approximately $700 million from higher prices for crude oil and
natural gas liquids. This benefit to income was partially offset by the

effects of a decline in
oil-equivalent production and an increase in depreciation, operating and exploration expenses.

Income of $4.3 billion in 2006 increased approximately $100 million from 2005. Earnings in
2006 benefited about $850 million from higher average prices on oil-equivalent production and the
effect of seven additional months of production from the Unocal properties that were acquired in
August 2005. Substantially offsetting these benefits were increases in operating, exploration and
depreciation expenses. Included in the operating expense increases were costs associated with the
carryover effects of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico in 2005.

The company’s average realization for crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2007 was $63.16 per
barrel, compared with $56.66 in 2006 and $46.97 in 2005. The average natural gas realization was
$6.12 per thousand cubic feet in 2007, compared with $6.29 and $7.43 in 2006 and 2005,
respectively.

Net oil-equivalent production in 2007 averaged 743,000 barrels per day, down 2.6 percent from
2006 and up 2 percent from 2005, which included only five months of production from the Unocal
properties acquired in August of that year. The net liquids component of oil-equivalent production
for 2007 averaged 460,000 barrels a day, which was essentially flat compared with 2006, and an
increase of 1 percent from 2005. Net natural gas production averaged 1.7 billion cubic feet per day
in 2007, down 6 percent from 2006 and up 4 percent from 2005.

International upstream income of $10.3 billion in 2007 increased $1.4 billion from 2006.
Earnings in 2007 benefited approximately $1.6 billion from higher prices, primarily for crude oil,
and $300 million from increased liftings. Non-recurring income tax items also benefited earnings
between periods. These benefits to income were partially offset by the impact of higher operating
and depreciation expenses.

Income in 2006 of approximately $8.9 billion increased $1.3 billion from 2005. Earnings in
2006 benefited approximately $3 billion from higher prices for crude oil and natural gas and an
additional seven months of production from the former Unocal properties. About 70 percent of this
benefit was associated with the impact of higher prices. Substantially offsetting these benefits
were increases in depreciation expense, operating expense and exploration expense. Also adversely
affecting 2006 income were higher taxes related to an increase in tax rates in the U.K. and
Venezuela and settlement of tax claims and other tax items in Venezuela, Angola and Chad. Foreign
currency effects reduced earnings by $371 million in 2006, but increased income $14 million in
2005.

The company’s average realization for crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2007 was $65.01 per
barrel, compared with $57.65 in 2006 and $47.59 in 2005. The average natural gas realization was
$3.90 per thousand cubic feet in 2007, compared with $3.73 and $3.19 in 2006 and 2005,
respectively.

Net oil-equivalent production of 1.88 million barrels per day in 2007 declined about 2 percent
from 2006 and increased 5 percent from 2005. The volumes for each year included production from oil
sands in Canada and an operating service agreement in Venezuela until its conversion to a
joint-stock company in October 2006. The decline between 2006 and 2007 was associated with the
impact of this contract conversion in Venezuela and the price effects on production volumes
calculated under production-sharing agreements. Partially offsetting the decline was increased
production in Bangladesh, Angola and Azerbaijan. The increase from 2005 was due to that year having
included only five months of production from the former Unocal properties.

The net liquids component of oil-equivalent production was 1.3 million barrels per day in
2007, a decrease of approximately 4 percent from 2006 and 3 percent from 2005. Net natural gas
production of 3.3 billion cubic feet per day in 2007 was up 5.5 percent and 28 percent from 2006
and 2005, respectively.

U.S. downstream earnings of $966 million in 2007 declined nearly $1 billion from 2006 and
were essentially the same as 2005. The decline in 2007 from 2006 was associated mainly with weaker
refined-product margins due to the effects of higher crude oil prices and the negative impacts of
higher planned and unplanned downtime on refinery production volumes at the company’s three major
refineries. Operating expenses were also higher in 2007. The improvement in 2006 earnings from 2005
was primarily associated with higher average refined-product margins in 2006 and the adverse effect
of downtime in 2005 at refining, marketing and pipeline operations that was caused by hurricanes in
the Gulf of Mexico.

Sales volumes of refined products were 1.46 million barrels per day in 2007, a decrease of 3
percent and 1 percent from 2006 and 2005, respectively. The reported sales volume for 2007 was on a
different basis than 2006 and 2005 due to a change in accounting rules that became effective April
1, 2006, for certain purchase and sale (buy/sell) contracts with the same counterparty. Excluding
the impact of this accounting standard, refined-product sales in 2007 decreased 1 percent from 2006
and increased about 5 percent from 2005. Branded gasoline sales volumes of 629,000 barrels per day
in 2007 increased about 2 percent from 2006 and 6 percent from 2005, largely due to growth of the
Texaco brand.

Refer
to the “Selected Operating Data” table on page FS-l0 for a three-year comparative of
sales volumes of gasoline and other refined products and refinery-input volumes. Refer also to Note

International downstream income of $2.5 billion in 2007 increased about $500 million from
2006 and $750 million from 2005. Results for 2007 included gains of approximately $1 billion on the
sale of assets, including an interest in a refinery and marketing

assets in the Benelux region of
Europe. Margins on the sale of refined products in 2007 were up slightly from the prior year.
Operating expenses were higher, and earnings from the company’s shipping operations were lower. The
increase in earnings in 2006 compared with 2005 was associated mainly with the benefit of higher
refined-product sales margins in the Asia-Pacific area and Canada and improved results from
crude-oil and refined-product trading activities.

Refined-product sales volumes were 2.03 million barrels per day in 2007, about 5 percent and
10 percent lower than 2006 and 2005, respectively, due largely to the impact of asset sales and the
accounting-standard change for buy/sell contracts. Excluding the accounting change, sales decreased
about 4 percent and 5 percent from 2006 and 2005, respectively.

improved margins on sales of lubricants and fuel additives by Oronite was more than offset by the
effect of lower margins on the sale of commodity chemicals by CPChem. In 2006, earnings of $539
million increased about $240 million from 2005 due to higher margins for commodity chemicals at
CPChem and for fuel and lubricant additives at
Oronite.

214,091

$

204,892

$

193,641

Sales and other operating revenues in 2007 increased over 2006 due primarily to higher
prices for crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and refined products, partially offset by
lower sales volumes. The increase in 2006 from 2005 was primarily due to higher prices for refined
products. The higher revenues in 2006 were net of an impact from a change in the accounting for
buy/sell contracts, as described in Note 13 on page FS-42.

Millions of dollars




Income from equity affiliates

$

4,144

$

4,255

$

3,731

Lower income from equity affiliates in 2007 was mainly due to a decline in earnings from
CPChem, Dynegy (sold in May 2007) and downstream affiliates in the Asia-Pacific area. Partially
offsetting these declines were improved results for Tengizchevroil (TCO) and income for a full year
from Petroboscan, which was converted from an operating service agreement to a joint-stock company
in October 2006. The increase between 2005 and 2006 was primarily due to improved results for TCO
and CPChem. Refer to Note 11, beginning on page FS-40, for a discussion of Chevron’s investment in
affiliated companies.

Crude oil and product purchases in 2007 increased from 2006 due to higher prices for crude
oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and refined products. Crude oil and product purchases in 2006
increased from 2005 on higher prices for crude oil and refined products and the inclusion of
Unocal-related amounts for the full year 2006 vs. five months in 2005. The increase was mitigated

for the cost of employee payroll and contract labor. Total expenses increased in 2006 from 2005 due
mainly to the inclusion of former-Unocal expenses for the full year 2006. Besides this effect,
expenses were higher in 2006 for labor, transportation, and uninsured costs associated with the
hurricanes in 2005.

nonrecurring items, including asset sales in 2007 and the absence of 2006 charges related to a
tax-law change that increased tax rates on upstream operations in the U.K. North Sea and the
settlement of a tax claim in Venezuela. The higher tax rate in 2006 compared with 2005 also

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities

Total balances were $8.1 billion
and $11.4 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Cash provided by operating
activities in 2007 was $25.0 billion, compared with $24.3 billion in 2006 and $20.1 billion in
2005.

Cash provided by operating activities was net of contributions to employee pension plans of
$300 million, $400 million and $1.0 billion in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Cash provided by
investing activities included proceeds from asset sales of $3.3 billion in 2007, $1.0 billion in
2006 and $2.7 billion in 2005.

Cash provided by operating activities and asset sales during 2007 was sufficient to fund the
company’s $17.7 billion capital and exploratory program, pay $4.8 billion of dividends to
stockholders and repay approximately $3.7 billion of debt.

Restricted cash of $799 million associated with capital-investment projects at the company’s
Pascagoula, Mississippi, refinery and Angola liquefied natural gas project was invested in
short-term marketable securities and reclassified from cash equivalents to a long-term asset on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Dividends

The company paid dividends of approximately $4.8 billion in 2007, $4.4
billion in 2006 and $3.8 billion in 2005. In April 2007, the company increased its quarterly common
stock dividend by 11.5 percent to 58 cents per share.

Debt,
capital lease and minority interest obligations

Total debt and capital lease
balances were $7.2 billion at December 31, 2007, down from $9.8 billion at year-end 2006. The
company also had minority interest obligations of $204 million, down from $209 million at December
31, 2006.

The $2.6 billion reduction in total debt and capital lease obligations during 2007 included
the early redemption and maturity of individual debt issues. In February, $144 million of Texaco
Capital Inc. bonds matured. In the second and fourth quarters, the company redeemed approximately
$809 million and $65 million, respectively of Texaco Capital Inc.

debt and recognized an after-tax
loss of approximately $175 million. In August, $2 billion of Chevron Canada Funding Company bonds
matured. In December, the company issued a $650 million tax exempt Mississippi Gulf Opportunity
Zone bond to fund an upgrade project at the company’s refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi.
Commercial paper balances at the end of 2007 declined approximately
$450 million from $3.5 billion
at year-end 2006. In February 2008, $750 million of Chevron Canada Funding Company bonds matured.

The company’s debt and capital lease obligations due within one year, consisting primarily of
commercial paper and the current portion of long-term debt, totaled $5.5 billion at December 31,
2007, down from $6.6 billion at year-end 2006. Of these amounts, $4.4 billion and $4.5 billion were
reclassified to long-term at the end of each period, respectively. At year-end 2007, settlement of
these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital within one year, as the
company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance
them on a long-term basis.

At year-end 2007, the company had $5 billion in committed credit facilities with various major
banks, which permit the refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term basis. These
facilities support commercial paper borrowing and also can be used for general corporate purposes.
The company’s practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on
substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management believes appropriate. Any borrowings
under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on London Interbank
Offered Rate or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms
reflecting the company’s strong credit rating. No borrowings were outstanding under these
facilities at December 31, 2007.

In March 2007, the company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) an
automatic registration statement that expires in March 2010. This registration statement is for an
unspecified amount of non-convertible debt securities issued or guaranteed by the company. At the
same time, the company withdrew three shelf registration statements on file with the SEC that
permitted the issuance of up to $3.8 billion of debt securities.

At December 31, 2007, the company had outstanding public bonds issued by Chevron Corporation
Profit Sharing/Savings Plan Trust Fund, Chevron Canada Funding Company (formerly ChevronTexaco
Capital Company), Texaco Capital Inc. and Union Oil Company of California. All of these securities
are guaranteed by Chevron Corporation and are rated AA by Standard and Poor’s Corporation and Aal
by Moody’s Investors Service. The rating by Moody’s reflects an upgrade in December from Aa2. The
company’s U.S. commercial paper is rated A-l+ by Standard and Poor’s and P-1 by Moody’s. All of
these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade securities.

The company’s future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, the
capital-spending program and cash that may be generated from asset dispositions. The company
believes that it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash

requirements and that during periods of low prices for crude oil and
natural gas and narrow margins for refined products and commodity chemicals, it has the flexibility
to increase borrowings and/or modify capital-spending plans to continue paying the common stock
dividend and maintain the company’s high-quality debt ratings.

Common stock repurchase program

A $5 billion stock repurchase program initiated in
December 2006 was completed in September 2007. During 2007, about 61.5 million common shares were
acquired under this program at a total cost of $4.9 billion. Upon completion of this program, the
company authorized the acquisition of up to $15 billion of additional common shares from time to
time at prevailing prices, as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements and subject
to market conditions and other factors. The program is for a period of up to three years and may be
discontinued at any time. As of December 31, 2007, 23.5 million shares had been acquired under the new
program for $2.1 billion. Purchases through mid-February 2008 increased the total shares acquired
to 34.2 million at a cost of approximately $3.0 billion.

Capital and exploratory expenditures

Total reported expenditures for 2007 were $20 billion,
including $2.3 billion for the company’s share of affiliates’ expenditures, which did not require
cash outlays by the company. In 2006 and 2005, expenditures were $16.6 billion and $11.1 billion,
respectively, including the company’s share of affiliates’ expenditures of $1.9 billion and $1.7
billion in the corresponding periods. The 2005 amount excludes $17.3 billion for the acquisition of
Unocal Corporation.

Of the $20 billion in expenditures for 2007, about three-fourths, or $15.5 billion, related to
upstream activities. Approximately the same percentage was also expended for upstream operations in
2006 and 2005. International upstream accounted for about 70 percent of the worldwide upstream
investment in each of the three years, reflecting the company’s continuing focus on opportunities
that are available outside the United States.

In 2008, the company estimates capital and exploratory expenditures will be 15 percent higher
at $22.9 billion, including $2.6 billion of spending by affiliates. About three-fourths of the
total, or $17.5 billion, is budgeted for exploration and production activities, with $12.7 billion
of this amount outside the United States. Spending in 2008 is primarily targeted for exploratory
prospects in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and western Africa and major development projects in
Angola, Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Thailand, the deepwater Gulf of Mexico,
the Piceance Basin in Colorado and an oil sands project in Canada.

Worldwide downstream spending in 2008 is estimated at $4.1 billion, with about $2.3 billion
for projects in the United States. Capital projects include upgrades to refineries in the United
States and South Korea and construction of gas-to-liquids facilities in support of associated
upstream projects.

Investments in chemicals, technology and other corporate businesses in 2008 are budgeted at
$1.3 billion. Technology investments include projects related to unconventional hydrocarbons
technologies, oil and gas reservoir management and gas-fired and renewable power generation.

Pension Obligations

In 2007, the company’s pension plan contributions were $317 million
(approximately $78 million to the U.S. plans). The company estimates contributions in 2008
will be approximately $500 million. Actual contribution amounts are dependent upon plan-investment
results, changes in pension obligations, regulatory requirements and other economic factors.
Additional funding may be required if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in
plan obligations. Refer also to the discussion of pension accounting in “Critical Accounting
Estimates and Assumptions,” beginning on page FS-18.

The company’s guarantee of approximately $600 million is associated with certain payments
under a terminal use agreement entered into by a company affiliate. The terminal is expected to be
operational by 2012. Over the approximate 16-year term of the guarantee, the maximum guarantee
amount will reduce over time as certain fees are paid by the affiliate. There are numerous
cross-indemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of any
amounts paid under the guarantee. Chevron carries no liability for its obligation under this
guarantee.

Indemnifications

The company provided certain indemnities of contingent liabilities of Equilon
and Motiva to Shell and Saudi Refining, Inc., in connection with the February 2002 sale of the
company’s interests in those investments. The company would be required to perform if the
indemnified liabilities become actual losses. Were that to occur, the company could be required to
make future payments up to $300 million. Through the end of 2007, the company had paid $48 million
under these indemnities and continues to be obligated for possible additional indemnification
payments in the future.

The company has also provided indemnities relating to contingent environmental liabilities
related to assets originally contributed by Texaco to the Equilon and Motiva joint ventures and
environmental conditions that existed prior to the formation of Equilon and Motiva or that occurred
during the period of Texaco’s ownership interest in the joint ventures. In general, the
environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to
December 2001. Claims must be asserted no later than February 2009 for Equilon indemnities and no
later than February 2012 for Motiva indemnities. Under the terms of these indemnities, there is no
maximum limit on the amount of potential future payments. The company has not recorded any
liabilities for possible claims under these indemnities. The company posts no assets as collateral
and has made no payments under the indemnities.

The amounts payable for the indemnities described above are to be net of amounts recovered
from insurance carriers and others and net of liabilities recorded by Equilon or Motiva prior to
September 30, 2001, for any applicable incident.

In the acquisition of Unocal, the company assumed certain indemnities relating to contingent
environmental liabilities associated with assets that were sold in 1997. Under the indemnification
agreement, the company’s liability is unlimited until April 2022, when the indemnification expires.

obligation of $200 million, which had not been reached
as of December 31, 2007.

Securitization

During 2007, the company completed the sale of its U.S. proprietary consumer
credit card business and related receivables. This transaction included terminating the qualifying
Special Purpose Entity (SPE) that was used to securitize associated retail accounts receivable.

Through the use of another qualifying SPE, the company had $675 million of securitized trade
accounts receivable related to its downstream business as of
December 31, 2007. This arrangement has
the effect of accelerating Chevron’s collection of the securitized amounts. Chevron’s total
estimated financial exposure under this securitization at
December 31, 2007, was $65 million. In the
event that the SPE experiences major defaults in the collection of receivables, Chevron believes
that it would have no additional loss exposure connected with third-party investments in this
securitization.

Minority Interests

The company has commitments of $204 million related to minority interests
in subsidiary companies.

Long-Term Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments, Including Throughput and
Take-or-Pay Agreements

The company and its subsidiaries have certain other contingent liabilities
relating to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and
take-or-pay agreements, some of which relate to suppliers’ financing arrangements. The agreements
typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity, drilling rigs,
utilities, and petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the company’s
business. The aggregate approximate amounts of required payments under these various commitments
are: 2008 – $4.7 billion; 2009 – $3.3 billion; 2010 – $3.3 billion; 2011 – $1.9 billion; 2012 –
$1.3 billion; 2013 and after – $4.9 billion. A portion of these commitments may ultimately be
shared with project partners. Total payments under the agreements were approximately $3.7 billion
in 2007, $3.0 billion in 2006 and $2.1 billion in 2005.

Does not include amounts related to the company’s income tax liabilities associated with
uncertain tax positions. The company is unable to make reasonable estimates for the periods in
which these liabilities may become due. The company does not expect settlement of such
liabilities will have a material effect on its results of operations, consolidated financial
position or liquidity in any single period.


$4.4. billion of short-term debt that the company expects to refinance is included in long-term
debt. The repayment schedule above reflects the projected repayment of the entire amounts in the
2009-2011 period.


Does not include obligations to purchase the company’s share of natural gas liquids and
regasified natural gas associated with operations of the 36.4 percent-owned Angola LNG
affiliate. The LNG plant is expected to commence operations in 2012 and is designed to produce
5.2 million metric tons of liquefied natural gas and related natural gas liquids per year.
Volumes and prices associated with these purchase obligations are neither fixed nor
determinable.

Financial and Derivative Instruments

No material change in market risk occurred between 2006 and 2007 for the financial and
derivative instruments discussed below. The hypothetical variances used in this section were
selected for illustrative purposes only and do not represent the company’s estimation of market
changes. The actual impact of future market changes could differ materially due to factors
discussed elsewhere in this report, including those set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” in
Part 1, Item 1A, of the company’s 2007 Annual Report
on Form 10-K.

Commodity Derivative Instruments

Chevron is exposed to market risks related to the price
volatility of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas
and refinery feedstocks.

The company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on a portion of
its activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase, sale and
storage of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids and feedstock for company
refineries. The company also uses derivative commodity instruments for limited trading purposes.
The results of this activity were not material to the company’s financial position, net income or
cash flows in 2007.

FS-14


The company’s market exposure positions are monitored and managed on a daily basis by an
internal Risk Control group to ensure compliance with the company’s risk management policies that
have been approved by the Audit Committee of the company’s Board of Directors.

The derivative instruments used in the company’s risk management and trading activities
consist mainly of futures, options, and swap contracts traded on the NYMEX (New York Mercantile
Exchange) and on electronic platforms of ICE (Inter-Continental Exchange) and GLOBEX (Chicago
Mercantile Exchange). In addition, crude oil, natural gas and refined product swap contracts and
option contracts are entered into principally with major financial institutions and other oil and
gas companies in the “over-the-counter” markets.

Virtually all derivatives beyond those designated as normal purchase and normal sale contracts
are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with resulting gains and losses
reflected in income. Fair values are derived principally from published market quotes and other
independent third-party quotes.

Effective with 2007 year-end reporting, the company changed the model used to quantify
information about market risk for its commodity derivatives from a “sensitivity analysis” approach
to Value-at-Risk (VaR). The major reason for the change is that VaR allows estimation of a
portfolio’s aggregate market risk exposure and takes into account correlations between trading
assets. Therefore, it reflects risk reduction due to diversification or hedging activities. Most of
the company’s market positions are time and commodity spreads, and the company believes that VaR is
a more accurate tool to measure this type of exposure than the sensitivity analysis model. The
company fully developed and tested its VaR model during 2007.

VaR is the maximum loss not to be exceeded within a given probability or confidence level over
a given period of time. The company’s VaR model uses the Monte Carlo simulation method that
involves generating hypothetical scenarios from the specified probability distribution and
constructing a full distribution of a potential portfolio’s values.

The VaR model utilizes an exponentially-weighted moving average for computing historical
volatilities and correlations, a 95 percent confidence level, and one-day holding period. That is,
the company’s 95 percent, one-day VaR corresponds to the unrealized loss in portfolio value that
would not be exceeded on average more than one in every 20 trading days, if the portfolio were held
constant for one day.

The one-day holding period is based on the assumption that market-risk positions can be
liquidated or hedged within one day. For hedging and risk management, the company uses conventional
exchange-traded instruments such as futures and options, as well as non-exchange-traded swaps, most
of which can be liquidated or hedged effectively within one day. The table below presents 95
percent/one-day VaR for each of the company’s primary risk exposures in the area of commodity
derivative instruments at December 31, 2007:

Sensitivity analysis for the company’s open commodity derivative instruments at December

provided in the following table:

The same hypothetical decrease in prices of these commodities would result in
approximately the same opposite effects on the fair values of the contracts. The hypothetical
effect on these contracts was estimated by calculating the fair value of the contracts as the
difference between the hypothetical and current market prices multiplied by the contract amounts.

The change in the amounts between years in the table above for crude oil and refined products
is associated with an increase in commodity prices, volumes hedged and the use of longer-term
contracts.

Foreign Currency

The company enters into forward exchange contracts, generally with terms of
180 days or less, to manage some of its foreign currency exposures. These exposures include revenue
and anticipated purchase transactions, including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease
commitments, forecasted to occur within 180 days. The forward exchange contracts are recorded at
fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income.

The aggregate effect of a hypothetical 10 percent increase in the value of the U.S. dollar at
year-end 2007 would be a reduction in the fair value of the foreign exchange contracts of
approximately $75 million. The effect would be the opposite for a hypothetical 10 percent decrease
in the value of the U.S. dollar at year-end 2007.

Interest Rates

The company enters into interest rate swaps as part of its overall strategy to
manage the interest rate risk on its debt. Under the terms of the swaps, net cash settlements are
based on the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts calculated by
reference to agreed notional principal amounts. Interest rate swaps related to a portion of the
company’s fixed-rate debt are accounted for as fair value hedges. Interest rate swaps related to
floating-rate debt are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses
reflected in income. At year-end 2007, the company had no interest-rate swaps on floating-rate
debt. At year-end 2007, the weighted average maturity of “receive fixed” interest rate swaps was
less than one year. A hypothetical increase or decrease of 10 basis points in fixed interest rates
would have a

de minimis

impact on the fair value of the “receive fixed” swaps.

Transactions With Related Parties

Chevron enters into a number of business arrangements with related parties, principally
its equity affiliates. These arrangements include long-term supply or offtake agreements. Long-term
purchase agreements are in place with the company’s refining affiliate

in Thailand. Refer to page FS-5 for further discussion. Management
believes the foregoing agreements and others have been negotiated on terms consistent with those
that would have been negotiated with an unrelated party.

Litigation and Other Contingencies

MTBE

Chevron and many other companies in the petroleum industry have used methyl tertiary
butyl ether (MTBE) as a gasoline additive. The company is a party to 88 lawsuits and claims, the
majority of which involve numerous other petroleum marketers and refiners, related to the use of
MTBE in certain oxygenated gasolines and the alleged seepages of MTBE into groundwater. Chevron has
agreed in principle to a tentative settlement of 60 pending lawsuits and claims. The terms of this
agreement, which must be approved by a number of parties, including the court, are confidential and
not material to the company’s results of operations, liquidity or financial position.

Resolution of remaining lawsuits and claims may ultimately require the company to correct or
ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of prior release of MTBE by the company or other
parties. Additional lawsuits and claims related to the use of MTBE, including personal-injury
claims, may be filed in the future. The tentative settlement of the referenced 60 lawsuits did not
set any precedents related to standards of liability to be used to judge the merits of the claims,
corrective measures required or monetary damages to be assessed for the remaining lawsuits and
claims or future lawsuits and claims. As a result, the company’s ultimate exposure related to
pending lawsuits and claims is not currently determinable, but could be material to net income in
any one period. The company no longer uses MTBE in the manufacture of gasoline in the United States.

RFG Patent

Fourteen purported class actions were brought by consumers of reformulated gasoline
(RFG) alleging that Unocal misled the California Air Resources Board into adopting standards for
composition of RFG that overlapped with Unocal’s undisclosed and pending patents. Eleven lawsuits
were consolidated in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, where a class
action has been certified, and three were consolidated in a state court action. Unocal is alleged
to have monopolized, conspired and engaged in unfair methods of competition, resulting in injury to
consumers of RFG. Plaintiffs in both consolidated actions seek unspecified actual and punitive
damages, attorneys’ fees, and interest on behalf of an alleged class of consumers who

purchased
“summertime” RFG in California from January 1995 through August 2005. The parties have reached a
tentative agreement to resolve all of the above matters in an amount that is not material to the
company’s results of operations, liquidity or financial position. The terms of this agreement are
confidential, and subject to further negotiation and approval, including by the courts.

Environmental

The company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and
regulations that in the future may require the company to take action to correct or ameliorate the
effects on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleum substances, including MTBE,
by the company or other parties. Such contingencies may exist for various sites, including, but not
limited to, federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, refineries, crude oil
fields,

service stations, terminals, land development areas, and mining operations, whether
operating, closed or divested. These future costs are not fully determinable due to such factors as
the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective
actions that may be required, the determination of the company’s liability in proportion to other
responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties.

Although the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and
reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future costs may

be material to results of
operations in the period in which they are recognized.
The company does not expect these costs will
have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity. Also, the company does
not believe its obligations to make such expenditures have had, or will have, any significant
impact on the company’s competitive position relative to other U.S. or international petroleum or
chemical companies.

Included in the $1,539 million year-end 2007 reserve balance were remediation activities
of 240 sites for which the company had been identified as a potentially responsible party or
otherwise involved in the remediation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or other
regulatory agencies under the provisions of the federal Superfund law or analogous state laws. The
company’s remediation reserve for these sites at year-end 2007 was $123 million. The federal
Superfund law and analogous state laws provide for joint and several liability for all responsible
parties. Any future actions by the EPA or other regulatory agencies to require Chevron to assume
other potentially responsible parties’ costs at designated hazardous waste sites are not expected
to have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or liquidity.

Of
the remaining year-end 2007 environmental reserves balance of $1,416 million, $864 million
related to approximately 2,000 sites for the company’s U.S. downstream operations, including
refineries and other plants, marketing locations (i.e., service stations and terminals) and
pipelines. The remaining $552 million was associated with various sites in international
downstream ($146 million), upstream ($267 million), chemicals ($105 million) and other ($34
million). Liabilities at all sites, whether operating, closed or divested, were primarily
associated with the company’s plans and activities to remediate soil or groundwater contamination
or both. These and other activities include one or more of the following: site assessment; soil
excavation; offsite disposal of contaminants; onsite containment, remediation and/or extraction of
petroleum hydrocarbon liquid and vapor from soil; groundwater extraction and treatment; and
monitoring of the natural attenuation of the contaminants.

The company manages environmental liabilities under specific sets of regulatory requirements,
which in the United States include the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and various state or
local regulations. No single remediation site at year-end 2007 had a recorded liability that was
material to the company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

It is likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities, beyond those
recorded, for environmental remediation relating to past operations. These future costs are not
fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the
unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the
company’s liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs
are recoverable from third parties.

The company accounts for asset retirement obligations in accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards Board Statement (FASB) No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

(FAS 143).
Under FAS 143, the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is recorded when
there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of long-lived assets and the liability
can be reasonably estimated. The liability balance of approximately $8.3 billion for asset
retirement obligations at year-end 2007 related primarily to upstream and mining properties.

For the company’s other ongoing operating assets, such as refineries and chemicals facilities,
no provisions are made for exit or cleanup costs that may be required when such assets reach the
end of their useful lives unless a decision to sell or otherwise abandon the facility has been
made, as the indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the
fair value of the asset retirement obligation.

Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143

(FIN 47), and the discussion of “Environmental Matters” on page FS-18.

Income Taxes

The company calculates its income tax expense and liabilities quarterly. These
liabilities generally are subject to audit and are not finalized with the individual taxing
authorities until several years after the end of the annual period for which income taxes have been
calculated. Refer to Note 15 beginning on page FS-43 for a discussion of the periods for which tax
returns have been audited for the company’s major tax jurisdictions and a discussion for all tax
jurisdictions of the differences between the amount of tax benefits recognized in the financial
statements and the amount taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The company does not
expect settlement of income tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions will have a
material effect on its results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity.

Suspended Wells

The company suspends the costs of exploratory wells pending a final
determination of the commercial potential of the related crude oil and natural gas fields. The
ultimate disposition of these well costs is dependent on the results of future drilling activity or
development decisions or both. At December 31, 2007, the company had approximately $1.7 billion of
suspended exploratory wells included in properties, plant and equipment, an increase of $421
million from 2006 and an increase of $551 million from 2005.

The future trend of the company’s exploration expenses can be affected by amounts associated
with well write-offs, including wells that had been previously suspended pending determination as
to whether the well had found reserves that could be classified as proved. The effect on
exploration expenses in future periods of the $1.7 billion of suspended wells at year-end 2007 is
uncertain pending future activities, including normal project evaluation and additional drilling.

Refer to Note 19, beginning on page FS-47, for additional discussion of suspended wells.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Equity Redetermination

For oil and gas producing operations, ownership agreements may
provide for periodic reassessments of equity interests in estimated crude oil and natural gas
reserves. These activities, individually or together, may result in gains or losses that could be
material to earnings in any given period. One such equity redetermination process has been under
way since 1996 for Chevron’s interests in four producing zones at the Naval Petroleum Reserve at
Elk Hills, California, for the time when the remaining interests in these zones were owned by the
U.S. Department of Energy. A wide range remains for a possible net settlement amount for
the four zones. For this range of settlement, Chevron estimates its maximum possible net before-tax
liability at approximately $200 million, and the possible maximum net amount that could be owed to
Chevron is estimated at about $150 million. The timing of the settlement and the exact amount
within this range of estimates are uncertain.

Other Contingencies

Chevron receives claims from and submits claims to customers; trading
partners; U.S. federal, state and local regulatory bodies; governments; contractors;
insurers; and suppliers. The amounts of these claims, individually and in the aggregate, may be
significant and take lengthy periods to resolve.

The company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their operations and may
close, abandon, sell, exchange, acquire or restructure assets to achieve operational or strategic
benefits and to improve competitiveness and profitability. These activities, individually or
together, may result in gains or losses in future periods.

Environmental Matters

Virtually all aspects of the businesses in which the company engages are subject to various
federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These regulatory
requirements continue to increase in both number and complexity over time and govern not only the
manner in which the company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells. Most of the
costs of complying with laws and regulations pertaining to company operations and products are
embedded in the normal costs of doing business.

Accidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business. In
addition to the costs for environmental protection associated with its ongoing operations and
products, the company may incur expenses for corrective actions at various owned and previously
owned facilities and at third-party-owned waste-disposal sites used by the company. An obligation
may arise when operations are closed or sold or at non-Chevron sites where company products have
been handled or disposed of. Most of the expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to
facilities and sites where past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered
acceptable at the time but now require investigative or remedial work or both to meet current
standards.

Using definitions and guidelines established by the American Petroleum Institute, Chevron
estimated its worldwide environmental spending in 2007 at approximately $2.7 billion for its
consolidated companies. Included in these expenditures were approximately $900 million of
environmental capital expenditures and $1.8 billion of costs associated with the prevention,
control, abatement or elimination of hazardous substances and pollutants from operating, closed or
divested sites and the abandonment and restoration of sites.

For 2008, total worldwide environmental capital expenditures are estimated at $1.9 billion.
These capital costs are in addition to the ongoing costs of complying with environmental
regulations and the costs to remediate previously contaminated sites.

It is not possible to predict with certainty the amount of additional investments in new or
existing facilities or amounts of incremental operating costs to be incurred in the future to:
prevent, control, reduce or eliminate releases of hazardous materials into the environment; comply
with existing and new environmental laws or regulations; or remediate and restore areas damaged by
prior releases of hazardous materials. Although these costs may be significant to the results of
operations in any single period, the company does not expect them to have a material effect on the
company’s liquidity or financial position.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions

Management makes many estimates and assumptions in the application of generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP) that may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated
financial statements and related disclosures and on the comparability of such information over
different reporting periods. All such estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.
Estimates and assumptions are based on management’s experience and other information available
prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Materially different results can occur as
circumstances change and additional information becomes known.

The discussion in this section of “critical” accounting estimates or assumptions is according
to the disclosure guidelines of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), wherein:

1.

the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity
and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such
matters to change; and

2.

the impact of the estimates and assumptions on the company’s financial condition or
operating performance is material.

FS-18


Besides those meeting these “critical” criteria, the company makes many other accounting
estimates and assumptions in preparing its financial statements and related disclosures. Although
not associated with “highly uncertain matters,” these estimates and assumptions are also subject to
revision as circumstances warrant, and materially different results may sometimes occur.

For example, the recording of deferred tax assets requires an assessment under the accounting
rules that the future realization of the associated tax benefits be “more likely than not.” Another
example is the estimation of crude oil and natural gas reserves under SEC rules that require “...
geological and engineering data (that) demonstrate with reasonable certainty (reserves) to be
recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions,
i.e., prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made.” Refer to Table V, “Reserve Quantity
Information,” beginning on page FS-66, for the changes in these estimates for the three years
ending December 31, 2007, and to Table VII, “Changes in the Standardized Measure of Discounted
Future Net Cash Flows From Proved Reserves” on page FS-74 for estimates of proved-reserve values
for each of the three years ending December 31, 2007, which were based on year-end prices at the
time. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, beginning on page FS-32, includes a
description of the “successful efforts” method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and
production activities. The estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are important to the
timing of expense recognition for costs incurred.

The discussion of the critical accounting policy for “Impairment of Properties, Plant and
Equipment and Investments in Affiliates,” beginning on page FS-20, includes reference to conditions
under which downward revisions of proved-reserve quantities could result in impairments of oil and
gas properties. This commentary should be read in conjunction with disclosures elsewhere in this
discussion and in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements related to estimates,
uncertainties, contingencies and new accounting standards. Significant accounting policies are
discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, beginning on page FS-32. The
development and selection of accounting estimates and assumptions, including those deemed
“critical,” and the associated disclosures in this discussion have been discussed by management
with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

The areas of accounting and the associated “critical” estimates and assumptions made by the
company are as follows:

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

The determination of pension plan obligations
and expense is based on a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions are the
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan
obligations. For other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans, which provide for certain health care
and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees and which are not funded, critical
assumptions in determining OPEB obligations and expense are the discount rate and the assumed
health care cost-trend rates.

Note 20, beginning on page FS-48, includes information on the funded status of the company’s
pension and OPEB

plans at the end of 2007 and 2006, the components of pension and OPEB expense for
the three years ending December 31, 2007, and the underlying assumptions for those periods.

Pension and OPEB expense is recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Income in “Operating
expenses” or “Selling, general and administrative expenses” and applies to all business segments.
The year-end 2007 and 2006 funded status, measured as the difference between plan assets and
obligations, of each of the company’s pension and OPEB plans is recognized on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet. The funded status of overfunded pension plans is recorded as a long-term asset in
“Deferred charges and other assets.” The funded status of underfunded or unfunded pension and OPEB
plans is recorded in “Accrued liabilities” or “Reserves for employee benefit plans.” Amounts yet to
be recognized as components of pension or OPEB expense are recorded in “Accumulated other
comprehensive income.”

To estimate the long-term rate of return on pension assets, the company uses
a process that incorporates actual historical asset-class returns and an assessment of expected
future performance and takes into consideration external actuarial advice and asset-class factors.
Asset allocations are periodically updated using pension plan asset/liability studies, and the
determination of the company’s estimates of long-term rates of return are consistent with these
studies. The expected long-term rate of return on U.S. pension plan assets, which account for 67
percent of the company’s pension plan assets, has remained at 7.8 percent since 2002. For the 10
years ending December 31, 2007, actual asset returns averaged 8.7 percent for this plan.

The year-end market-related value of assets of the major U.S. pension plan used in the
determination of pension expense was based on the market value in the preceding three months, as
opposed to the maximum allowable period of five years under U.S. accounting rules. Management
considers the three-month period long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from day-to-day
market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year. For other plans, market
value of assets as of the measurement date is used in calculating the pension expense.

The discount rate assumptions used to determine U.S. and international pension and
postretirement benefit plan obligations and expense reflect the prevailing rates available on
high-quality fixed-income debt instruments. At December 31, 2007, the company selected a 6.3
percent discount rate for the major U.S. pension and postretirement plans. This rate was selected
based on a cash flow analysis that matched estimated future benefit payments to the Citigroup
Pension Discount Yield Curve as of year-end 2007. The discount rates at the end of 2006 and 2005
were 5.8 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively.

An increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets or the discount rate would reduce
pension plan expense, and vice versa. Total pension expense for 2007 was $620 million. As an
indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long-term rate of return assumption, a 1
percent increase in the expected rate of return on assets of the company’s primary U.S. pension
plan would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2007 by approximately $70

FS-19


Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations

million. A 1 percent increase in the discount rate for this same plan, which accounted for
about 60 percent of the companywide pension obligation, would have reduced total pension plan
expense for 2007 by approximately $155 million.

An increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation, thus changing the
funded status of a plan recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The total pension liability on
the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2007, for underfunded plans was approximately $1.7
billion. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate
assumption, a 0.25 percent increase in the discount rate applied to the company’s primary U.S.
pension plan would have reduced the plan obligation by approximately $250 million, which would have
increased the plan’s over-funded status from approximately $160 million to $410 million. Other
plans would be less underfunded as discount rates increase. The actual rates of return on plan
assets and discount rates may vary significantly from estimates because of unanticipated changes in
the world’s financial markets.

In 2007, the company’s pension plan contributions were $317 million (including $78 million to
the U.S. plans). In 2008, the company estimates contributions will be approximately $500 million.
Actual contribution amounts are dependent upon plan-investment results, changes in pension
obligations, regulatory requirements and other economic factors. Additional funding may be required
if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations.

For the company’s OPEB plans, expense for 2007 was $233 million and the total liability, which
reflected the underfunded status of the plans at the end of 2007, was $2.9 billion.

As an indication of discount rate sensitivity to the determination of OPEB expense in 2007, a
1 percent increase in the discount rate for the company’s primary U.S. OPEB plan, which accounted
for about 75 percent of the companywide OPEB expense, would have decreased OPEB expense by
approximately $20 million. A 0.25 percent increase in the discount rate for the same plan, which
accounted for about 87 percent of the companywide OPEB liabilities, would have decreased total OPEB
liabilities at the end of 2007 by approximately $60 million.

For the main U.S. postretirement medical plan, the annual increase to company contributions is
limited to 4 percent per year. The cap becomes effective in the year of retirement for
pre-Medicare-eligible employees retiring on or after January 1, 2005. The cap was effective as
of January 1, 2005, for pre-Medicare-eligible employees retiring before that date and all
Medicare-eligible retirees. For active employees and retirees under age 65 whose claims experiences
are combined for rating purposes, the assumed health care cost-trend rates start with 8 percent in
2008 and gradually drop to 5 percent for 2014 and beyond. As an indication of the health care
cost-trend rate sensitivity to the determination of

OPEB expense in 2007, a 1 percent increase in
the rates for the main U.S. OPEB plan, which accounted for about 87 percent of the companywide OPEB
liabilities, would have increased OPEB expense $8 million.

Differences between the various assumptions used to determine expense and the funded status of
each plan and actual experience are not included in benefit plan costs in the year the difference
occurs. Instead, the differences are included in actuarial gain/loss and unamortized amounts have
been reflected in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Refer
to Note 20, beginning on page FS-48, for information on the $3.3 billion of before-tax actuarial
losses recorded by the company as of December 31, 2007; a description of the method used to amortize
those costs; and an estimate of the costs to be recognized in expense during 2008.

Impairment
of Properties, Plant and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates

The company
assesses its properties, plant and equipment (PP&E) for possible impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable.
Such indicators include changes in the company’s business plans, changes in commodity prices and,
for crude oil and natural gas properties, significant downward revisions of estimated
proved-reserve quantities. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash
flows expected from the asset, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value of
the asset over its estimated fair value.

Determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on
highly uncertain matters such as future commodity prices, the effects of inflation and technology
improvements on operating expenses, production profiles, and the outlook for global or regional
market supply and demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas, commodity chemicals and refined
products. However, the impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are
consistent with the company’s business plans and long-term investment decisions.

No
major individual impairments of PP&E were recorded for the three years ending December 31,
2007. An estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been
used in impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not practicable, given the broad range of
the company’s PP&E and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. That is, favorable
changes to some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair any assets in these periods,
whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown number of other assets to
become impaired.

Investments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method, as
well as investments in other securities of these equity investees, are reviewed for impairment when
the

FS-20


fair value of the investment falls below the company’s carrying value. When such a decline is
deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to the income statement for the
difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value at the time. In
making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the company considers
such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial performance, and
the company’s ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient
to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment’s market value. Differing assumptions could
affect whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of the impairment and are not
subject to sensitivity analysis.

From time to time, the company performs impairment reviews and determines that no write-down
in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required. For example, when significant
downward revisions to crude oil and natural gas reserves are made for any single field or
concession, an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset
remains recoverable. Also, if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any
period has been deemed more likely than not, an impairment review is performed, and if the
estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group, no impairment charge
is required. Such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed
of. Assets that are not impaired on a held-and-used basis could possibly become impaired if a
decision is made to sell such assets. That is, the assets would be impaired if they are classified
as held-for-sale and the estimated proceeds from the sale, less costs to sell, are less than the
assets’ associated carrying values.

Business
Combinations

–

Purchase-Price Allocation

Accounting for business combinations
requires the allocation of the company’s purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of
the acquired business at their respective fair values. The company uses all available information
to make these fair value determinations, and for major acquisitions, may hire an independent
appraisal firm to assist in making fair value estimates. In some instances, assumptions with
respect to the timing and amount of future revenues and expenses associated with an asset might
have to be used in determining its fair value. Actual timing and amount of net cash flows from
revenues and expenses related to that asset over time may differ materially from those initial
estimates, and if the timing is delayed significantly or if the net cash flows decline
significantly, the asset could become impaired.

Goodwill

Goodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to amortization. As
required by FASB Statement No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,

the company tests such
goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if
an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a
reporting unit below its carrying amount.

Contingent Losses

Management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for
claims, litigation, tax matters and environmental remediation. Actual costs can frequently vary
from estimates for a variety of reasons. For example, the costs

from settlement of claims and
litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on
culpability and assessments on the amount of damages. Similarly, liabilities for environmental
remediation are subject to change because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation,
the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination, and
improvements in technology.

Under the accounting rules, a liability is generally recorded for these types of contingencies
if management determines the loss to be both probable and estimable. The company generally records
these losses as “Operating expenses” or “Selling, general and administrative expenses” on the
Consolidated Statement of Income. An exception to this handling is for income tax matters, for
which benefits are recognized only if management determines the tax position is “more likely than
not” (i.e. likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction. For
additional discussion of income tax uncertainties, refer to Note 15
beginning on page FS-43. Refer
also to the business segment discussions elsewhere in this section for the effect on earnings from
losses associated with certain litigation, and environmental remediation and tax matters for the
three years ended December 31, 2007.

An estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been
used in recording these liabilities is not practicable because of the number of contingencies that
must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible
outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss.

New Accounting Standards

FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS 157)

In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS 157, which became effective for the company on
January 1, 2008. This standard defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. FAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but applies to assets and
liabilities that are required to be recorded at fair value under other accounting standards. The
implementation of FAS 157 did not have a material effect on the company’s results of operations or
consolidated financial position.

FASB
Staff Position FAS No. 157-1, Application of FASB Statement No. 157
to FASB Statement No. 13 and Its Related Interpretive Accounting Pronouncements That Address Leasing Transactions (FSP
157-1)

In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP 157-1, which became effective for the company on
January 1, 2008. This FSP excludes FASB Statement No. 13, Accounting for Leases, and its related
interpretive accounting pronouncements from the provisions of FAS 157. Implementation of this
standard did not have a material effect on the company’s results of operations or consolidated
financial position.

FASB
Staff Position FAS No. 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157 (FSP 157-2)

In
February 2008, the FASB issued FSP 157-2, which delays the company’s January
1, 2008, effective date of FAS 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial

FS-21


Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

liabilities, except those recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
statements on a recurring basis (at least annually), until January 1, 2009. Implementation of this
standard did not have a material effect on the company’s results of operations or consolidated
financial position.

FASB Statement No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities – Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (FAS 159)

In
February 2007, the FASB issued FAS 159, which became effective for the company on January 1, 2008.
This standard permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other
items at fair value and report unrealized gains and losses in earnings. Such accounting is optional
and is generally to be applied instrument by instrument. The implementation of FAS 159 did not have
a material effect on the company’s results of operations or consolidated financial position.

FASB Statement No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (FAS 141-R)

In December
2007, the FASB issued FAS 141-R, which will become effective for business combination transactions
having an acquisition date on or after January 1, 2009. This standard requires the acquiring entity
in a business combination to recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any
noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date to be measured at their respective
fair values. The Statement requires acquisition-related costs, as well as restructuring costs the
acquirer expects to incur for

which it is not obligated at acquisition date, to be recorded against
income rather than included in purchase-price determination. It also requires recognition of
contingent arrangements at their acquisition-date fair values, with subsequent changes in fair
value generally reflected in income.

FASB Statement No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an
amendment of ARB No. 51 (FAS 160)

The FASB issued FAS 160 in December 2007, which will
become effective for the company January 1, 2009, with retroactive adoption of the Statement’s
presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests. This standard will
require ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent to be presented
within the equity section of the consolidated statement of financial position but separate from the
parent’s equity. It will also require the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the
parent and the noncontrolling interest to be clearly identified and presented on the face of the
consolidated income statement. Certain changes in a parent’s ownership interest are to be accounted
for as equity transactions and when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any noncontrolling equity
investment in the former subsidiary is to be initially measured at fair value. The company does not
anticipate the implementation of FAS 160 will significantly change the presentation of its
consolidated income statement or consolidated balance sheet.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Chevron Corporation:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated
statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Chevron Corporation and its subsidiaries at
December 31, 2007, and December 31, 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the
financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in
all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
consolidated financial statements. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on
criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible
for these financial statements and financial statement schedule; for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Controls
Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements,
on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatements and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over
financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in

the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed
in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company changed its method of accounting
for buy/sell contracts on April 1, 2006.

As discussed in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company changed its
method of accounting for uncertain income tax positions on January 1, 2007.

As discussed in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company changed its
method of accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on December 31,
2006.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Note 1

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

General

Exploration and production (upstream) operations consist of exploring for, developing and
producing crude oil and natural gas and marketing natural gas. Refining, marketing and
transportation (downstream) operations relate to refining crude oil into finished petroleum
products; marketing crude oil and the many products derived from petroleum; and transporting crude
oil, natural gas and petroleum products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car.
Chemical operations include the manufacture and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for
industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant oil additives.

The company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These require the use of estimates
and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the
financial statements, as well as amounts included in the notes thereto, including discussion and
disclosure of contingent liabilities. Although the company uses its best estimates and judgments,
actual results could differ from these estimates as future confirming events occur.

The nature of the company’s operations and the many countries in which it operates subject the
company to changing economic, regulatory and political conditions. The company does not believe it
is vulnerable to the risk of near-term severe impact as a result of any concentration of its
activities.

Subsidiary and Affiliated Companies

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of
controlled subsidiary companies more than 50 percent-owned and variable-interest entities in which
the company is the primary beneficiary. Undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures and
certain other assets are consolidated on a proportionate basis. Investments in and advances to
affiliates in which the company has a substantial ownership interest of approximately 20 percent to
50 percent or for which the company exercises significant influence but not control over policy
decisions are accounted for by the equity method. As part of that accounting, the company
recognizes gains and losses that arise from the issuance of stock by an affiliate that results in
changes in the company’s proportionate share of the dollar amount of the affiliate’s equity
currently in income.

Investments are assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value of the
investment may be below the company’s carrying value. When such a condition is deemed to be other
than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value, and the
amount of the write-down is included in net income. In making the determination as to whether a
decline is other than temporary, the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of
the decline, the investee’s financial

performance, and the company’s ability and intention to
retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in
the investment’s market value. The new cost basis of investments in these equity investees is not
changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value. Subsequent recoveries in the carrying value of
other investments are reported in “Other comprehensive income.”

Differences between the company’s
carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate
are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the company’s
analysis of the various factors giving rise to the difference. The company’s share of the
affiliate’s reported earnings is adjusted quarterly when appropriate to reflect the difference
between these allocated values and the affiliate’s historical book values.

Derivatives

The majority of the company’s activity in commodity derivative instruments is intended
to manage the financial risk posed by physical transactions. For some of this derivative activity,
generally limited to large, discrete or infrequently occurring transactions, the company may elect
to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting. For other similar derivative instruments,
generally because of the short-term nature of the contracts or their limited use, the company does
not apply hedge accounting, and changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in
current income. For the company’s commodity trading activity, gains and losses from the derivative
instruments are reported in current income. For derivative instruments relating to foreign currency
exposures, gains and losses are reported in current income. Interest rate swaps – hedging a
portion of the company’s fixed-rate debt – are accounted for as fair value hedges, whereas
interest rate swaps relating to a portion of the company’s floating-rate debt are recorded at fair
value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. Where
Chevron is a party to master netting arrangements, fair value receivable and payable amounts
recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty are offset on the balance
sheet.

Short-Term Investments

All short-term investments are classified as available for sale and are in
highly liquid debt securities. Those investments that are part of the company’s cash management
portfolio and have original maturities of three months or less are reported as “Cash equivalents.”
The balance of the short-term investments is reported as “Marketable securities” and are
marked-to-market, with any unrealized gains or losses included in “Other comprehensive income.”

Inventories

Crude oil, petroleum products and chemicals are generally stated at cost, using a
Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) method. In the aggregate, these costs are below market. “Materials,
supplies and other” inventories generally are stated at average cost.

FS-32


Note 1

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Continued

Properties, Plant and Equipment

The successful efforts method is used for crude oil and natural gas
exploration and production activities. All costs for development wells, related plant and
equipment, proved mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties, and related asset
retirement obligation (ARO) assets are capitalized. Costs of exploratory wells are capitalized
pending determination of whether the wells found proved reserves. Costs of wells that are assigned
proved reserves remain capitalized. Costs are also capitalized for exploratory wells that have
found crude oil and natural gas reserves even if the reserves cannot be classified as proved when
the drilling is completed, provided the exploratory well has found a sufficient quantity of
reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient
progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. All other
exploratory wells and costs are expensed. Refer to Note 19, beginning on page FS-47, for additional
discussion of accounting for suspended exploratory well costs.

Long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved crude oil and natural gas properties, are
assessed for possible impairment by comparing their carrying values with their associated
undiscounted future net before-tax cash flows. Events that can trigger assessments for possible
impairments include write-downs of proved reserves based on field performance, significant
decreases in the market value of an asset, significant change in the extent or manner of use of or
a physical change in an asset, and a more-likely-than-not expectation that a long-lived asset or
asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly sooner than the end of its
previously estimated useful life. Impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values,
generally their discounted future net before-tax cash flows. For proved crude oil and natural gas
properties in the United States, the company generally performs the impairment review on an
individual field basis. Outside the United States, reviews are performed on a country, concession,
development area or field basis, as appropriate. In the refining, marketing, transportation and
chemical areas, impairment reviews are generally done on the basis of a refinery, a plant, a
marketing area or marketing assets by country. Impairment amounts are recorded as incremental
“Depreciation, depletion and amortization” expense.

Long-lived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the
carrying value of the asset with its fair value less the cost to sell. If the net book value
exceeds the fair value less cost to sell, the asset is considered impaired and adjusted to the
lower value.

As required under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 143,

Accounting for
Asset Retirement Obligations

(FAS 143), the fair value of a liability for an ARO is recorded as an
asset and a liability when there is a legal

obligation associated with the retirement of a
long-lived asset and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Refer
also to Note 23, beginning on page FS-57,
relating to AROs.

Depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude oil and
natural gas producing properties, except mineral interests, are expensed using the
unit-of-production method by individual field as the proved developed reserves are produced.
Depletion expenses for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using the
unit-of-production method by individual field as the related proved reserves are produced. Periodic
valuation provisions for impairment of capitalized costs of unproved mineral interests are
expensed.

Depreciation and depletion expenses for mining assets are determined using the unit-of-production
method as the proven reserves are produced. The capitalized costs of all other plant and equipment
are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives. In general, the declining-balance
method is used to depreciate plant and equipment in the United States; the straight-line method
generally is used to depreciate international plant and equipment and to amortize all capitalized
leased assets.

Gains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties, plant and equipment
subject to composite group amortization or depreciation. Gains or losses from abnormal retirements
are recorded as expenses and from sales as “Other
income.”

Expenditures for maintenance (including
those for planned major maintenance projects), repairs and minor renewals to maintain facilities in
operating condition are generally expensed as incurred. Major replacements and renewals are
capitalized.

Goodwill

Goodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to amortization. As required
by FASB Statement No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

, the company tests such goodwill at
the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event
occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting
unit below its carrying amount.

Environmental Expenditures

Environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing operations or to
conditions caused by past operations are expensed. Expenditures that create future benefits or
contribute to future revenue generation are capitalized.

Liabilities related to future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments or
cleanups or both are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. For the company’s U.S. and
Canadian marketing facilities, the accrual is based in part on the probability that a future
remediation commitment will be required. For crude oil, natural gas and mineral producing properties,

a liability for an asset retirement obligation is made, following FAS
143. Refer to Note 23, beginning on page FS-57, for a discussion of FAS 143.

For federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, the company records a liability
for its designated share of the probable and estimable costs and probable amounts for other
potentially responsible parties when mandated by the regulatory agencies because the other parties
are not able to pay their respective shares.

The gross amount of environmental liabilities is based on the company’s best estimate of future
costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations and the company’s own
internal environmental policies. Future amounts are not discounted. Recoveries or reimbursements
are recorded as assets when receipt is reasonably assured.

Currency Translation

The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for substantially all of the
company’s consolidated operations and those of its equity affiliates. For those operations, all
gains and losses from currency translations are currently included in income. The cumulative
translation effects for those few entities, both consolidated and affiliated, using functional
currencies other than the U.S. dollar are included in the currency translation adjustment in
“Stockholders’ Equity.”

Revenue Recognition

Revenues associated with sales of crude oil, natural gas, coal, petroleum and
chemicals products, and all other sources are recorded when title passes to the customer, net of
royalties, discounts and allowances, as applicable. Revenues from natural gas production from
properties in which Chevron has an interest with other producers are generally recognized on the
basis of the company’s net working interest (entitlement method). Excise, value-added and similar
taxes assessed by a governmental authority on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and
a customer are presented on a gross basis. The associated amounts are shown as a footnote to the
Consolidated Statement of Income on page FS-27. Refer to Note 13, on page FS-42, for a discussion
of the accounting for buy/sell arrangements.

Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation

Effective July 1, 2005, the company adopted the
provisions of FASB Statement No. 123R,

Share-Based Payment

(FAS 123R), for its share-based
compensation plans. The company previously accounted for these plans under the recognition and
measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees

(APB 25), and related interpretations and disclosure requirements established
by FASB Statement No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

(FAS 123).

Refer to Note 21, beginning on page FS-53, for a description of the company’s share-based
compensation plans, information related to awards granted under those plans and additional
information on the company’s adoption of FAS 123R.

The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share as if the company

The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows does not include noncash financing and investing
activities. Refer to Note 23, starting on page FS-57, for a discussion of revisions to the
company’s asset retirement obligations that did not involve cash receipts or payments in 2007.

In accordance with the cash-flow classification requirements of FAS 123R,

Share-Based Payment

, the
“Net decrease (increase) in operating working capital” includes reductions of $96 and $94 for
excess income tax benefits associated with stock options exercised during 2007 and 2006,
respectively. These amounts are offset by “Net purchases of treasury shares.”

The 2007 “Net
purchases of other short-term investments” consist of $799 in restricted cash associated with
capital-investment projects at the company’s Pascagoula, Mississippi refinery and Angola liquefied
natural gas project that was invested in short-term marketable securities and reclassified from
cash equivalents to a long-term deferred asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In December 2007,
the company issued a $650 tax exempt Mississippi Gulf Opportunity Zone Bond as a source of funds
for the Pascagoula Refinery project.

The “Net purchases of treasury shares” represents the cost of
common shares acquired in the open market less the cost of shares issued for share-based
compensation plans. Open-market purchases totaled $7,036, $5,033 and $3,029 in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.

Summarized Financial Data – Chevron U.S.A. Inc.

Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (CUSA) is a major subsidiary of Chevron Corporation. CUSA and its subsidiaries
manage and operate most of Chevron’s U.S. businesses. Assets include those related to the
exploration and production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and those associated
with the refining, marketing, supply and distribution of products derived from petroleum, other
than natural gas liquids, excluding most of the regulated pipeline operations of Chevron. CUSA also
holds Chevron’s investment in the Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem) joint venture
which is accounted for using the equity method.

During 2007, Chevron implemented legal reorganizations in which certain Chevron subsidiaries
transferred assets to or under CUSA. The summarized financial information for CUSA and its
consolidated subsidiaries presented in the table on the following page gives retroactive effect to
the reorganizations as if they had occurred on January 1, 2005. However, the financial information
on the following page may not reflect the financial position and operating results in the periods
presented if the reorganization actually had occurred on that date.

Retained earnings at December 31, 2007 and 2006, included approximately $7,284 and $5,580,
respectively, for the company’s share of undistributed earnings of equity affiliates.

At December 31, 2007, about 120 million shares of Chevron’s common stock remained available for
issuance from the 160 million shares that were reserved for issuance under the Chevron Corporation
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). In addition,

approximately 454,000 shares remain available for
issuance from the 800,000 shares of the company’s common stock that were reserved for awards under
the Chevron Corporation Non-Employee Directors’ Equity Compensation and Deferral Plan (Non-Employee
Directors’ Plan).

Note 7

Financial and Derivative Instruments

For the financial and derivative instruments discussed below, no material change in market risk
occurred relative to the information presented in 2006.

Commodity Derivative Instruments

Chevron is exposed to market risks related to price volatility of
crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas and refinery
feedstocks.

The company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on a portion of its
activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase, sale and
storage of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, and feedstock for company
refineries. The company also uses derivative commodity instruments for limited trading purposes.

The company uses International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreements to govern derivative
contracts with certain counterparties to mitigate credit risk. Depending on the nature of the
derivative transactions, bilateral collateral arrangements may also be required. When the company
is engaged in more than one outstanding derivative transaction with the same counterparty and also
has a legally enforceable netting agreement with that counterparty, the net marked-to-market
exposure represents the netting of the positive and negative exposures with that counterparty and
is a reasonable measure of the company’s credit risk exposure. The company also uses other netting
agreements with certain counterparties with which it conducts significant transactions to mitigate
credit risk.

The fair values of the outstanding contracts are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as
“Accounts and notes receivable,” “Accounts payable,” “Long-term receivables – net” and “Deferred
credits and other noncurrent obligations.” Gains and losses on the company’s risk management
activities are reported as either “Sales and other operating revenues” or “Purchased crude oil and
products,” whereas trading gains and losses are reported as “Other income.”

Foreign Currency

The company enters into forward exchange contracts, generally with terms of 180
days or less, to manage some of its foreign currency exposures. These exposures include revenue and
anticipated purchase transactions, including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease
commitments, forecasted to occur within 180 days. The forward exchange contracts are recorded at
fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income.

FS-36


Note 7

Financial and Derivative Instruments – Continued

The fair values of the outstanding contracts are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as
“Accounts and notes receivable” or “Accounts payable,” with gains and losses reported as “Other
income.”

Interest Rates

The company enters into interest rate swaps as part of its overall strategy to
manage the interest rate risk on its debt. Under the terms of the swaps, net cash settlements are
based on the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts calculated by
reference to agreed notional principal amounts. Interest rate swaps related to a portion of the
company’s fixed-rate debt are accounted for as fair value hedges.

Fair values of the interest rate swaps are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as “Accounts
and notes receivable” or “Accounts payable.”

Fair Value

Fair values are derived from quoted market prices, other independent third-party quotes
or, if not available, the present value of the expected cash flows. The fair values reflect the
cash that would have been received or paid if the instruments were settled at year-end.

Long-term debt of $2,132 and $5,131 had estimated fair values of $2,325 and $5,621 at December 31,
2007 and 2006, respectively.

The company holds cash equivalents and marketable securities in U.S. and non-U.S. portfolios.
Eurodollar bonds, floating-rate notes, time deposits and commercial paper are the primary
instruments held. Cash equivalents and marketable securities had carrying/fair values of $5,427 and
$9,200 at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Of
these balances, $4,695 and $8,247 at the respective year-ends were classified as cash equivalents
that had average maturities under 90 days. The remainder, classified as marketable securities, had
average maturities of approximately one year. At December 31, 2007, restricted cash with a
carrying/fair value of $799 that is related to capital-investment projects at the company’s
Pascagoula, Mississippi refinery and Angola liquefied natural gas project was reclassified from
cash equivalents to a long-term deferred asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. This restricted
cash was invested in short-term marketable securities.

Fair values of other financial and derivative instruments at the end of 2007 and 2006 were not
material.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

The company’s financial instruments that are exposed to
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of its cash equivalents, marketable securities,
derivative financial instruments and trade receivables. The company’s short-term investments are
placed with a wide array of financial institutions with high credit ratings. This diversified
investment policy limits the company’s exposure both to credit risk and to concentrations of credit
risk. Similar standards of diversity and creditworthiness are applied to the company’s
counterparties in derivative instruments.

The trade receivable balances, reflecting the company’s diversified sources of revenue, are
dispersed among the

company’s broad customer base worldwide. As a consequence, the company believes
concentrations of credit risk are limited. The company routinely assesses the financial strength of
its customers. When the financial strength of a customer is not considered sufficient, requiring
Letters of Credit is a principal method used to support sales to customers.

Note 8

Operating Segments and Geographic Data

Although each subsidiary of Chevron is responsible for its own affairs, Chevron Corporation manages
its investments in these subsidiaries and their affiliates. For this purpose, the investments are
grouped as follows: upstream – exploration and production; downstream – refining, marketing and
transportation; chemicals; and all other. The first three of these groupings represent the
company’s “reportable segments” and “operating segments” as defined in Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 131,

Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information

(FAS 131).

The segments are separately managed for investment purposes under a structure that includes
“segment managers” who report to the company’s “chief operating decision maker” (CODM) (terms as
defined in FAS 131). The CODM is the company’s Executive Committee, a committee of senior officers
that includes the Chief Executive Officer and that, in turn, reports to the Board of Directors of
Chevron Corporation.

The operating segments represent components of the company as described in FAS 131 terms that
engage in activities (a) from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred; (b) whose
operating results are regularly reviewed by the CODM, which makes decisions about resources to be
allocated to the segments and to assess their performance; and (c) for which discrete financial
information is available.

Segment managers for the reportable segments are accountable directly to and maintain regular
contact with the company’s CODM to discuss the segment’s operating activities and financial
performance. The CODM approves annual capital and exploratory budgets at the reportable segment
level, as well as reviews capital and exploratory funding for major projects and approves major
changes to the annual capital and exploratory budgets. However, business-unit managers within the
operating segments are directly responsible for decisions relating to project implementation and
all other matters connected with daily operations. Company officers who are members of the
Executive Committee also have individual management responsibilities and participate in other
committees for purposes other than acting as the CODM.

“All Other” activities include the company’s interest in Dynegy (through May 2007, when Chevron
sold its interest), mining operations, power generation businesses, worldwide cash management and
debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate
activities, alternative fuels, and technology companies.

Operating Segments and Geographic Data – Continued

The company’s primary country of operation is the United States of America, its country of

United States).

Segment Earnings

The company evaluates the performance of its operating segments on an after-tax
basis, without considering the effects of debt financing interest expense or investment interest
income, both of which are managed by the company on a worldwide basis. Corporate administrative
costs and assets are not allocated to the operating segments. However, operating segments are
billed for the direct use of corporate services. Nonbillable costs remain at the corporate level in
“All Other.” After-tax segment income by major operating area is presented in the following table:

Segment Sales and Other Operating Revenues

Operating segment sales and other operating revenues,
including internal transfers, for the years 2007, 2006 and 2005 are presented in the following
table. Products are transferred between operating segments at internal product values that
approximate market prices.

Revenues for the upstream segment are derived primarily from the
production and sale of crude oil and natural gas, as well as the sale of third-party production of
natural gas. Revenues for the downstream segment are derived from the refining and marketing of
petroleum products, such as gasoline, jet fuel, gas oils, kerosene, lubricants, residual fuel oils
and other products derived from crude oil. This segment also generates revenues from the
transportation and trading of crude oil and refined products. Revenues for the chemicals segment
are derived primarily from the manufacture and sale of additives for lubricants and fuel. “All
Other” activities include revenues from mining operations of coal and other minerals, power
generation businesses, insurance operations, real estate activities, and technology companies.

Other than the United States, no single country accounted for 10 percent or more of the company’s
total sales and other operating revenues in 2007.

Lease Commitments

Certain noncancelable leases are classified as capital leases, and the leased assets are included
as part of “Properties, plant and equipment, at cost.” Such leasing arrangements involve tanker

Lease Commitments – Continued

Contingent rentals are based on factors other than the passage of time, principally sales volumes
at leased service stations. Certain leases include escalation clauses for adjusting rentals to
reflect changes in price indices, renewal options ranging up to 25 years, and options to purchase
the leased property during or at the end of the initial or renewal lease period for the fair market
value or other specified amount at that time.

At December 31, 2007, the estimated future minimum lease payments (net of noncancelable sublease

Restructuring and Reorganization Costs

In 2007, the company implemented a restructuring and reorganization program in its downstream
operations. Approximately 1,000 employees were eligible for severance payments. Most of the
associated positions are located outside the United States. The majority of the terminations are
expected to occur in 2008 and the program is expected to be complete by the end of 2009.

Shown in the table below is the activity for the company’s liability related to the downstream
reorganization. The associated charges against income were categorized as “Operating expenses” or
“Selling, general and administrative expenses” on the Consolidated Statement of Income.

Accounting for Buy/Sell Contracts

The company adopted the accounting prescribed by Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04-13,

Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty

(Issue 04-13) on a
prospective basis from April 1, 2006. Issue 04-13 requires that two or more legally separate
exchange transactions with the same counterparty, including buy/sell transactions, be combined and
considered as a single arrangement for purposes of applying the provisions of Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 29,

Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions,

when the transactions are entered
into “in contemplation” of one another. In prior

periods, the company accounted for buy/sell
transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Income as a monetary transaction – purchases were
reported as “Purchased crude oil and products”; sales were reported as “Sales and other operating
revenues.”

With the company’s adoption of Issue 04-13, buy/sell transactions beginning in the
second quarter 2006 are netted against each other on the Consolidated Statement of Income, with no
effect on net income. Amounts associated with buy/sell transactions in periods prior to the second
quarter 2006 are shown as a footnote to the Consolidated Statement of Income on page FS-27.

Litigation

MTBE

Chevron and many other companies in the petroleum industry have used methyl tertiary butyl
ether (MTBE) as a gasoline additive. The company is a party to 88 lawsuits and claims, the majority
of which involve numerous other petroleum marketers and refiners, related to the use of MTBE in
certain oxygenated gasolines and the alleged seepages of MTBE into groundwater. Chevron has agreed
in principle to a tentative settlement of 60 pending lawsuits and claims. The terms of this
agreement, which must be approved by a number of parties, including the court, are confidential and
not material to the company’s results of operations, liquidity or financial position.

Resolution of
remaining lawsuits and claims may ultimately require the company to correct or ameliorate the
alleged effects on the environment of prior release of MTBE by the company or other parties.
Additional lawsuits and claims related to the use of MTBE, including personal-injury claims, may be
filed in the future. The tentative settlement of the referenced 60 lawsuits did not set any
precedents related to standards of liability to be used to judge the merits of the claims,
corrective measures required or monetary damages to be assessed for the remaining lawsuits and
claims or future lawsuits and claims. As a result, the company’s ultimate exposure related to
pending lawsuits and claims is not currently determinable, but could be material to net income in
any one period. The company no longer uses MTBE in the manufacture of gasoline in the United
States.

RFG Patent

Fourteen purported class actions were brought by consumers of reformulated gasoline
(RFG) alleging that Unocal misled the California Air Resources Board into adopting standards for
composition of RFG that overlapped with Unocal’s undisclosed and pending patents. Eleven lawsuits
were consolidated in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, where a class
action has been certified, and three were consolidated in a state court action. Unocal is alleged
to have monopolized, conspired and engaged in unfair methods of competition, resulting in injury to
consumers of RFG. Plaintiffs in both consolidated actions seek unspecified actual and punitive
damages, attorneys’ fees, and interest on behalf of an alleged class of consumers who purchased
“summertime” RFG in California from January 1995 through August 2005. The parties have reached a
tentative agreement to resolve all of the above matters in an amount that is not material to the
company’s results of operations, liquidity or

financial position. The terms of this agreement are
confidential, and subject to further negotiation and approval, including by the courts.

$7,794, compared with before-tax income of $9,131 and $6,733 in 2006 and 2005, respectively. For
international operations, before-tax income was $24,373, $22,845 and $18,464 in 2007, 2006 and

In 2007, deferred tax liabilities increased by approximately $1,000 from the amount reported in
2006. The increase was primarily related to increased temporary differences for properties, plant
and equipment.

Deferred tax assets increased by approximately $1,900 in 2007. The increase related primarily to
additional foreign tax credits arising from earnings in high-tax-rate international jurisdictions.
This increase was substantially offset by valuation allowances.

The overall valuation allowance relates to foreign tax credit carryforwards, tax loss carryforwards
and temporary differences for which no benefit is expected to be realized. Tax loss carryforwards
exist in many international jurisdictions. Whereas some of these tax loss carryforwards do not have
an expiration date, others expire at various times from 2008 through 2029. Foreign tax credit
carryforwards of $3,138 will expire between 2008 and 2017.

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, deferred taxes were classified in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as

Income taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have been or
are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. Undistributed earnings of international consolidated
subsidiaries and affiliates for which no deferred income tax provision has been made for possible
future remittances totaled $20,557 at December 31, 2007. This amount represents earnings reinvested
as part of the company’s ongoing international business. It is not practicable to estimate the
amount of taxes that might be payable on the eventual remittance of earnings that are intended to
be reinvested indefinitely. At the end of 2007, deferred income taxes were recorded for the
undistributed earnings of certain international operations for which the company no longer intends
to indefinitely reinvest the earnings. The company does not anticipate incurring significant
additional taxes on remittances of earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested.

Uncertain Income Tax Positions

Effective January 1, 2007, the company implemented Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
– An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

(FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for income tax benefits that are uncertain in nature. This
interpretation was intended by the standard-setters to address the diversity in practice that
existed in this area of accounting for income taxes.

Under FIN 48, a company recognizes a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax
position only if management’s assessment is that the position is “more likely than not” (i.e., a
likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the
technical merits of the position. The term “tax position” in FIN 48 refers to a position in a
previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax return that is
reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual
periods. The accounting interpretation also provides guidance on measurement methodology,
derecognition thresholds, financial statement classification and disclosures, recognition of
interest and penalties, and accounting for the cumulative-effect adjustment at the date of
adoption. Upon adoption of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007, the company recorded a cumulative-effect
adjustment that reduced retained earnings by $35.

FS-44


Note

Taxes – Continued

The following table indicates the changes to the company’s unrecognized tax benefits for the year
ended December 31, 2007. The term “unrecognized tax benefits” in FIN 48 refers to the differences
between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit measured and
recognized in the financial statements in accordance with the guidelines of FIN 48. Interest and
penalties are not included.

The only individually significant change for 2007 was a reduction in an unrecognized tax benefit
for a position previously expected to be taken but subsequently not taken on a 2006 tax return.
Although unrecognized tax benefits for individual tax positions may increase or decrease during
2008, the company believes that no change will be individually significant during 2008.
Approximately 80 percent of the $2,199 of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2007, would
have an impact on the overall tax rate if subsequently recognized.

Tax positions for Chevron and
its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions
throughout the world. For the company’s major tax jurisdictions, examinations of tax returns for
certain prior tax years had not been completed as of December 31, 2007. In this regard, the company
received a final U.S. federal income tax audit report for years 2002 and 2003 in March 2007. In
early 2008, the company’s 2004 and 2005 tax returns were under examination by the Internal Revenue
Service. For other major tax jurisdictions, the latest years for which income tax examinations had
been finalized were as follows: Nigeria – 1994, Angola – 2001 and Saudi Arabia – 2003.

On the Consolidated Statement of Income, the company reports interest and penalties related to liabilities
for uncertain tax positions as “Income tax expense.” As of December 31, 2007, accruals of $198 for
anticipated interest and penalty obligations were included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For
the year 2007, income tax expense associated with interest and penalties was not material.

Redeemable long-term obligations consist primarily of tax-exempt variable-rate put bonds that are
included as current liabilities because they become redeemable at the option of the bondholders
during the year following the balance sheet date.

The company periodically enters into interest rate swaps on a portion of its short-term debt. See
Note 7, beginning on page FS-36, for information concerning the company’s debt-related derivative
activities.

At December 31, 2007, the company had $4,950 of committed credit facilities with banks worldwide,
which permit the company to refinance short-term obligations on a long-term basis. The facilities
support the company’s commercial paper borrowings. Interest on borrowings under the terms of specific agreements may be based

on the London Interbank Offered Rate or bank prime rate. No
amounts were outstanding under these credit agreements during 2007 or at year-end.

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the company classified $4,382 and $4,450, respectively, of
short-term debt as long-term. Settlement of these obligations is not expected to require the use of
working capital in 2008, as the company has both the intent and the ability to refinance this debt
on a long-term basis.

New Accounting Standards

FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS 157)

In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS
157, which became effective for the company on January 1, 2008. This standard defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. FAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but applies to assets and
liabilities that are required to be recorded at fair value under other accounting standards. The
implementation of FAS 157 did not have a material effect on the company’s results of operations or
consolidated financial position.

FASB Staff Position FAS No. 157-1, Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to FASB Statement No. 13
and Its Related Interpretive Accounting Pronouncements That Address Leasing Transactions (FSP
157-1)

In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP 157-1, which became effective for the company on
January 1, 2008. This FSP excludes FASB Statement No. 13, Accounting for Leases, and its related
interpretive accounting pronouncements from the provisions of FAS 157.
Implementation of this standard did not have a material effect on the company’s results of
operations or consolidated financial position.

FASB Staff Position FAS No. 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157 (FSP 157-2)

In February
2008, the FASB issued FSP 157-2, which delays the company’s January 1, 2008 effective date of FAS
157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those recognized or disclosed
at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually), until January
1, 2009. Implementation of this standard did not have a material effect on the company’s results of
operations or consolidated financial position.

FASB Statement No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities -
Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (FAS 159)

In February 2007, the FASB issued FAS
159, which became effective for the company on January 1, 2008. This standard permits companies to
choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and report
unrealized gains and losses in earnings. Such accounting is optional and is generally to be applied
instrument by instrument. The implementation of FAS 159 did not have a material effect on the
company’s results of operations or consolidated financial position.

FASB Statement No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (FAS 141-R)

In December 2007, the FASB
issued FAS 141-R, which will become effective for business combination transactions having an
acquisition date on or after January 1, 2009. This standard requires the acquiring entity in a
business combination to

FS-46


Note 18

New Accounting Standards – Continued

recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling
interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date to be measured at their respective fair values.
The Statement requires acquisition-related costs, as well as restructuring costs the acquirer
expects to incur for which it is not obligated at acquisition date, to be recorded against income
rather than included in purchase-price determination. It also requires recognition of contingent
arrangements at their acquisition-date fair values, with subsequent changes in fair value generally
reflected in income.

FASB Statement No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment
of ARB No. 51 (FAS 160)

The FASB issued FAS 160 in December 2007, which will become effective for
the company January 1, 2009, with retroactive adoption of the Statement’s presentation and
disclosure requirements for existing minority interests. This standard will require ownership
interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent to be presented within the equity
section of the consolidated statement of financial position but separate from the parent’s equity.
It will also require the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the
noncontrolling interest to be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated
income statement. Certain changes in a parent’s ownership interest are to be accounted for as
equity transactions and when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any noncontrolling equity investment
in the former subsidiary is to be initially measured at fair value. The company does not anticipate
the implementation of FAS 160 will significantly change the presentation of its consolidated income
statement or consolidated balance sheet.

Note 19

Accounting for Suspended Exploratory Wells

The company accounts for the cost of exploratory wells in accordance with FASB Statement No. 19,

Financial and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies

(FAS 19)

,

as amended by FASB Staff
Position (FSP) FAS 19-1,

Accounting for Suspended Well Costs

, which provides that exploratory well
costs continue to be capitalized after the completion of drilling when (a) the well has found a
sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (b) the enterprise is
making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the
project. If either condition is not met or if an enterprise obtains information that raises
substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the exploratory well
would be assumed to be impaired, and its costs, net of any salvage value, would be charged to
expense. FAS 19 provides a number of indicators that can assist an entity to demonstrate sufficient
progress is being made in assessing the reserves and economic viability of the project.

The following table indicates the changes to the company’s suspended exploratory well costs for the
three years ended December 31, 2007. No capitalized exploratory well costs were charged to expense
upon the 2005 adoption of FSP FAS 19-1.

*Certain projects have multiple wells or fields or both.

Of the $1,211 of exploratory well costs capitalized for more than one year at December 31, 2007,
$750 (32 projects) is related to projects that had drilling activities under way or firmly planned
for the near future. An additional $8 (three projects) is related to projects that had drilling
activity during 2007. The $453 balance related to 19 projects in areas requiring a major capital
expenditure before production could begin and for which additional drilling efforts were not under
way or firmly planned for the near future. Additional drilling was not deemed necessary because the
presence of hydrocarbons had already been established, and other activities were in process to
enable a future decision on project development.

The projects for the $453 referenced above had the following activities associated with assessing
the reserves and the

projects’ economic viability: (a) $99 (one project) – combined two projects into a single
development project and submitted plans to government in 2007; (b) $74 (three projects) –
continued unitization efforts on adjacent discoveries that span international boundaries; (c) $74
(one project) – finalizing field development evaluation; (d) $74 (one project) – field rework
continues to accommodate larger design capacity and finalize sales agreements; (e) $42 (one
project) – finalizing development concept; (f) $90 – miscellaneous activities for 12 projects
with smaller amounts suspended. While progress was being made on all 54 projects, the decision on
the recognition of proved reserves under SEC rules in some cases may not occur for several years
because of the complexity, scale and negotiations connected with the projects. The majority of
these decisions are expected to occur in the next three years.

The $1,211 of suspended well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year as of December
31, 2007, represents 127 exploratory wells in 54 projects. The tables below contain the aging of
these costs on a well and project basis:

Employee Benefit Plans

The company has defined-benefit pension plans for many employees. The company typically prefunds
defined-benefit plans as required by local regulations or in certain situations where prefunding
provides economic advantages. In the United States, all qualified plans are subject to the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act minimum funding standard. The company does not typically fund U.S.
nonqualified pension plans that are not subject to funding requirements under laws and regulations
because contributions to these pension plans may be less economic and investment returns may be
less attractive than the company’s other investment alternatives.

The provisions of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) became effective for the company in
2008. These provisions change, among other things, the methodology for determining the interest
rate to be used in calculating lump-sum benefits. This change in methodology increased the lump-sum
interest rate and lowered the company’s pension benefit obligations by about $300 at December 31,
2007. The effect of the interest rate change on pension plan contributions during 2008 is expected
to be

de minimis

, as the company’s funded pension plans are considered “well-funded” under PPA
provisions.

The company also sponsors other postretirement plans that provide medical and dental benefits, as
well as life insurance for some active and qualifying retired employees. The plans are unfunded,
and the company and retirees share the costs. Medical coverage for Medicare-eligible retirees in
the company’s main U.S. medical plan is secondary to Medicare (including Part D) and the increase
to the company contribution for retiree medical coverage is limited to no more than 4 percent per
year. Certain life insurance benefits are paid by the company.

Effective December 31, 2006, the company implemented the recognition and measurement provisions of
Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and
132(R)

(FAS 158), which requires the recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of each of
its defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability, with
the offset to “Accumulated other comprehensive loss.”

Net actuarial losses recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” at December 31, 2007, for
the company’s U.S. pension, international pension and other postretirement benefit plans are being
amortized on a straight-line basis over approximately 10, 13 and 10 years, respectively. These
amortization periods represent the estimated average remaining service of employees expected to
receive benefits under the plans. These losses are amortized to the extent they exceed 10 percent
of the higher of the projected benefit obligation or market-related value of plan assets. The
amount subject to amortization is determined on a plan-by-plan basis. During 2008, the company
estimates actuarial losses of $59, $80 and $39 will be amortized from “Accumulated other
comprehensive loss” for U.S. pension, international pension and other postretirement benefit plans,
respectively. In addition, the company

estimates an additional $78 will be recognized from
“Accumulated other comprehensive loss” during 2008 related to lump-sum settlement costs from U.S.
pension plans.

The weighted average amortization period for recognizing prior service costs
(credits) recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” at December 31, 2007, was
approximately nine and 11 years for U.S. and international pension plans, respectively, and six
years for other postretirement benefit plans. During 2008, the company estimates prior service
(credits) costs of $(7), $25 and $(81) will be amortized from “Accumulated other comprehensive
loss” for U.S. pension, international pension and other postretirement benefit plans, respectively.

The 2005 discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase reflect the remeasurement of the
acquired Unocal benefit plans at July 31, 2005.


The 2006 U.S. discount rate reflects remeasurement on July 1, 2006, due to plan combinations and changes, primarily several
Unocal plans into related Chevron plans.

Expected Return on Plan Assets

The company’s estimated long-term rate of return on pension assets
is driven primarily by actual historical asset-class returns, an assessment of expected future
performance, advice from external actuarial firms and the incorporation of specific asset-class
risk factors. Asset allocations are periodically updated using pension plan asset/liability
studies, and the company’s estimated long-term rates of return are consistent with these studies.

There have been no changes in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets since 2002 for
U.S. plans, which account for 67 percent of the company’s pension plan assets. At December 31,
2007, the estimated long-term rate of return on U.S. pension plan assets was 7.8 percent.

The market-related value of assets of the major U.S. pension plan used in the determination of pension
expense was based on the market values in the three months preceding the year-end measurement date,
as opposed to the maximum allowable period of five years under U.S. accounting rules. Management
considers the three-month time period long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from
day-to-day market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year. For other plans,
market value of assets as of the measurement date is used in calculating the pension expense.

Discount Rate

The discount rate assumptions used to determine U.S. and international pension and
postretirement benefit plan obligations and expense reflect the prevailing rates available on
high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments. At December 31, 2007, the company selected a 6.3
percent discount rate for the major U.S. pension and postretirement plans. This rate was based on a
cash flow analysis that matched estimated future benefit payments to the Citigroup Pension Discount
Yield Curve as of year-end 2007. The discount rates at the end of 2006 and 2005 were 5.8 percent
and 5.5 percent, respectively.

Other Benefit Assumptions

For the measurement of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at
December 31, 2007, for the main U.S. postretirement medical plan, the assumed health care
cost-trend rates start with 8 percent in 2008 and gradually decline to 5 percent for 2014 and
beyond. For this measurement at December 31, 2006, the assumed health care cost-trend rates started
with 9 percent in 2007 and gradually declined to 5 percent for 2011 and beyond. In both
measurements, the annual increase to company contributions was capped at 4 percent.

Assumed health care cost-trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for
retiree health care costs. The impact is mitigated by the 4 percent cap on the company’s medical
contributions for the primary U.S. plan. A one-percentage-point change in the assumed health care
cost-trend rates would have the following effects:

the plans’ investment performance, long-term asset allocation policy
benchmarks have been established.

For the primary U.S. pension plan, the Chevron Board of Directors
has approved the following percentage asset-allocation ranges: Equities 40–70, Fixed Income/Cash
20–60, Real Estate 0–15 and Other 0–5. The significant international pension plans also have
established maximum and minimum asset allocation ranges that vary by each plan. Actual asset
allocation within approved ranges is based on a variety of current economic and market conditions
and consideration of specific asset category risk.

Equities include investments in the company’s common stock in the amount of $36 and $17 at December
31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The “Other” asset category includes minimal investments in
private-equity limited partnerships.

Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments

In 2007, the company contributed $78 and $239 to its U.S.
and international pension plans, respectively. In 2008, the company expects contributions to be
approximately $300 and $200 to its U.S. and international pension plans, respectively. Actual
contribution amounts are dependent upon plan-investment returns, changes in pension obligations,
regulatory environments and other economic factors. Additional funding may ultimately be required
if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations.

The company anticipates paying other postretirement benefits of approximately $207 in 2008, as
compared with $150 paid in 2007.

The following benefit payments, which include estimated future service, are expected to be paid in
the next 10 years:

Employee Savings Investment Plan

Eligible employees of Chevron and certain of its subsidiaries
participate in the Chevron Employee Savings Investment Plan (ESIP).

Charges to expense for the ESIP represent the company’s contributions to the plan, which are funded
either through the purchase of shares of common stock on the open market or through the release of
common stock held in the leveraged employee stock ownership plan
(LESOP), which follows.
Total company matching contributions to employee accounts within the ESIP were $206, $169 and $145
in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. This cost was reduced by the value of shares released from
the LESOP totaling

$33, $6 and $4 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The remaining amounts,
totaling $173, $163 and $141 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, represent open market purchases.

Employee Stock Ownership Plan

Within the Chevron ESIP is an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP).
In 1989, Chevron established a LESOP as a constituent part of the ESOP. The LESOP provides partial
prefunding of the company’s future commitments to the ESIP.

As permitted by American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position
93-6,

Employers’ Accounting for Employee Stock Ownership Plans

, the company has elected to continue
its practices, which are based on AICPA Statement of Position 76-3,

Accounting Practices for
Certain Employee Stock Ownership Plans

, and subsequent consensus of the EITF of the FASB. The debt
of the LESOP is recorded as debt, and shares pledged as collateral are reported as “Deferred
compensation and benefit plan trust” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the Consolidated
Statement of Stockholders’ Equity.

The company reports compensation expense equal to LESOP debt principal repayments less dividends
received and used by the LESOP for debt service. Interest accrued on LESOP debt is recorded as
interest expense. Dividends paid on LESOP shares are reflected as a reduction of retained earnings.
All LESOP shares are considered outstanding for earnings-per-share computations.

Total (credits) expenses recorded for the LESOP were $(1), $(1) and $94 in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively, including $16, $17 and $18 of interest expense related to LESOP debt and a (credit)
charge to compensation expense of $(17), $(18) and $76.

Of the dividends paid on the LESOP shares, $8, $59 and $55 were used in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively, to service LESOP debt. The amount in 2006 included $28 of LESOP debt service that was
scheduled for payment on the first business day of January 2007 and was paid in late December 2006.
In addition, the company made contributions in 2005 of $98 to satisfy LESOP debt service in excess
of dividends received by the LESOP. No contributions were required in 2007 or 2006 as dividends
received by the LESOP were sufficient to satisfy LESOP debt service.

Shares held in the LESOP are
released and allocated to the accounts of plan participants based on debt service deemed to be paid
in the year in proportion to the total of current year and remaining debt service. LESOP shares as of
December 31, 2007 and 2006, were as follows:

Employee Benefit Plans – Continued

Benefit Plan Trusts

Texaco established a benefit plan trust for funding obligations under some of
its benefit plans. At year-end 2007, the trust contained 14.2 million shares of Chevron treasury
stock. The company intends to continue to pay its obligations under the benefit plans. The trust
will sell the shares or use the dividends from the shares to pay benefits only to the extent that
the company does not pay such benefits. The trustee will vote the shares held in the trust as
instructed by the trust’s beneficiaries. The shares held in the trust are not considered
outstanding for earnings-per-share purposes until distributed or sold by the trust in payment of
benefit obligations.

Unocal established various grantor trusts to fund obligations under some of its benefit plans,
including the deferred compensation and supplemental retirement plans. At December 31, 2007 and
2006, trust assets of $69 and $98, respectively, were invested primarily in interest-earning
accounts.

Employee Incentive Plans

Chevron has two incentive plans, the Management Incentive Plan (MIP) and
the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), for officers and other regular salaried employees of the
company and its subsidiaries who hold positions of significant responsibility. MIP is an annual
cash incentive plan that links awards to performance results of the prior year. The cash awards may
be deferred by the recipients by conversion to stock units or other investment fund alternatives.
Aggregate charges to expense for MIP were $184, $180 and $155 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Awards under LTIP consist of stock options and other share-based
compensation that are described in Note
21 below.

Through 2007 the company had a program that provided eligible employees, other than those covered
by MIP and LTIP, with an annual cash bonus if the company achieves certain financial and safety
goals. Charges for the program were $431, $329 and $324 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Effective in 2008, this program was modified to mirror the design of MIP and both were combined
into a single plan named the Chevron Incentive Plan (CIP).

Note 21

Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation

Effective July 1, 2005, the company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
Statement No. 123R,

Share-Based Payment

(FAS 123R)

,

for its share-based compensation plans. The
company previously accounted for these plans under the recognition and measurement principles of
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

, and related
interpretations and disclosure requirements established by FASB Statement No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

.

The company adopted FAS 123R using the modified prospective method and, accordingly, results for
prior periods were

not restated. Refer to Note 1, beginning on page FS-32, for the pro forma effect
on net income and earnings per share as if the company had applied the fair-value recognition
provisions of FAS 123R for the full year 2005.

For 2007, 2006 and 2005, compensation expense for stock options was $146 ($95 after tax), $125 ($81
after tax) and $65 ($42 after tax), respectively. In addition, compensation expense for stock
appreciation rights, performance units and restricted stock units was $205 ($133 after tax), $113
($73 after tax) and $59 ($39 after tax) for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. There were no
significant stock-based compensation costs that were capitalized at December 31, 2007 and 2006.

Cash received in payment for option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements for 2007,
2006 and 2005 was $445, $444 and $297, respectively. Actual tax benefits realized for the tax
deductions from option exercises were $94, $91 and $71 for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Cash paid to settle performance units and stock appreciation rights was $88, $68 and $110 for 2007,
2006 and 2005, respectively. Cash paid in 2005 included $73 for Unocal awards paid under
change-in-control plan provisions.

The company presents the tax benefits of deductions from the exercise of stock options as financing
cash inflows in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. In 2006, the company implemented the
transition method of FASB Staff Position FAS 123R-3,

Transition Election Related to Accounting for
the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards

, for calculating the beginning balance of the pool of
excess tax benefits related to employee compensation and determining the subsequent impact on the
pool of employee awards that were fully vested and outstanding upon the adoption of FAS 123R. The
company’s reported tax expense for the period subsequent to the implementation of FAS 123R was not
affected by this election. Refer to Note 3, on page FS-35, for information on excess tax
benefits reported on the company’s Statement of Cash Flows.

Chevron Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)

Awards under the LTIP may take the form of, but are not
limited to, stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights,
performance units and nonstock grants. From April 2004 through January 2014, no more than 160
million shares may be issued under the LTIP, and no more than 64 million of those shares may be in
a form other than a stock option, stock appreciation right or award requiring full payment for
shares by the award recipient.

Stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under the LTIP extend for 10 years from grant
date. Effective with options granted in June 2002, one-third of each award vests on the first,
second and third anniversaries of the date of grant. Prior to this change, options vested one year
after the date of grant.

Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation – Continued

Performance units granted under the LTIP settle in cash at the end of a
three-year performance period. Settlement amounts are based on achievement of performance targets
relative to major competitors over the period, and payments are indexed to the company’s stock
price.

Texaco Stock Incentive Plan (Texaco SIP)

On the closing of the acquisition of Texaco in October
2001, outstanding options granted under the Texaco SIP were converted to Chevron options. These
options, which have 10-year contractual lives extending into 2011, retained a provision for being
restored. This provision enables a participant who exercises a stock option to receive new options
equal to the number of shares exchanged or who has shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding
obligations to receive new options equal to the number of shares exchanged or withheld. The
restored options are fully exercisable six months after the date of grant, and the exercise price
is the market value of the common stock on the day the restored option is granted. Beginning in
2007, restored options were granted under the LTIP. No further awards may be granted under the
former Texaco plans.

Unocal Share-Based Plans (Unocal Plans)

When Chevron acquired Unocal in August 2005, outstanding
stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under various Unocal Plans were exchanged for
fully vested Chevron options and appreciation rights. These awards retained the same provisions as
the original Unocal Plans. Awards issued prior to 2004 generally may be exercised for up to three
years after termination of employment (depending upon the terms of the individual award agreements)
or the original expiration date, whichever is earlier. Awards issued since 2004 generally remained
exercisable until the end of the normal option term if termination of employment occurred prior to
August 10, 2007. Other awards issued under the Unocal Plans, including restricted stock, stock
units, restricted stock units and performance shares, became vested at the acquisition date, and
shares or cash were issued to recipients in accordance with change-in-control provisions of the
plans.

The fair market values of stock options and stock appreciation rights granted in 2007, 2006 and
2005 were measured on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, with the
following weighted-average assumptions:

period for retirement-eligible employees in accordance with vesting provisions of the company’s
share-based compensation programs for awards issued after adoption of FAS 123R. As of December 31,
2007, there was $160 of total unrecognized before-tax compensation cost related to nonvested
share-based compensation arrangements granted or restored under the plans. That cost is expected to
be recognized over a weighted-average period of two years.

At January 1, 2007, the number of LTIP performance units outstanding was equivalent to 2,110,196
shares. During 2007, 931,200 units were granted, 784,364 units vested with cash proceeds
distributed to recipients and 32,017 units were forfeited. At December 31, 2007, units outstanding
were 2,225,015, and the fair value of the liability recorded for these instruments was $205. In
addition, outstanding stock appreciation rights and other awards that were granted under various
LTIP and former Texaco and Unocal programs totaled approximately 1 million equivalent shares as of
December 31, 2007. A liability of $38 was recorded for these awards.

Broad-Based Employee Stock Options

In addition to the plans described above, Chevron granted all
eligible employees stock options or equivalents in 1998. The options vested in February 2000 and
expired in February 2008. A total of 9,641,600 options were awarded with an exercise price of
$38.16 per share.

The fair value of each option on the date of grant was estimated at $9.54 using
the Black-Scholes model for the preceding 10 years. The assumptions used in the model, based on a
10-year average, were: a risk-free interest rate of 7 percent, a dividend yield of 4.2 percent, an
expected life of seven years and a volatility of 24.7 percent.

At January 1, 2007, the number of broad-based employee stock options outstanding was 1,306,059.
During 2007, exercises of 637,044 shares and forfeitures of 16,300 shares reduced outstanding
options to 652,715. As of December 31, 2007, these instruments had an aggregate intrinsic value of
$36 and the remaining contractual term of these options was 0.1 year. The total intrinsic value of
these options exercised during 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $30, $10 and $9, respectively.

Note 22

Other Contingencies and Commitments

Income Taxes

The company calculates its income tax expense and liabilities quarterly. These
liabilities generally are subject to audit and are not finalized with the individual taxing
authorities until several years after the end of the annual period for which income taxes have been
calculated. Refer to Note 15 beginning on page FS-43 for a discussion of the periods for which tax
returns have been audited for the company’s major tax jurisdictions and a discussion for all tax
jurisdictions of the differences between the amount of tax benefits recognized in the financial
statements and the amount taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The company does not
expect

settlement of income tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions will have a
material effect on its results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity.

Guarantees

The company’s guarantee of approximately $600 is associated with certain payments under
a terminal use agreement entered into by a company affiliate. The terminal is expected to be
operational by 2012. Over the approximate 16-year term of the guarantee, the maximum guarantee
amount will reduce over time as certain fees are paid by the affiliate. There are numerous
cross-indemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of any
amounts paid under the guarantee. Chevron carries no liability for its obligation under this
guarantee.

Indemnifications

The company provided certain indemnities of contingent liabilities of Equilon and
Motiva to Shell and Saudi Refining, Inc., in connection with the February 2002 sale of the
company’s interests in those investments. The company would be required to perform if the
indemnified liabilities become actual losses. Were that to occur, the company could be required to
make future payments up to $300. Through the end of 2007, the company paid $48 under these
indemnities and continues to be obligated for possible additional indemnification payments in the
future.

The company has also provided indemnities relating to contingent environmental liabilities related
to assets originally contributed by Texaco to the Equilon and Motiva joint ventures and
environmental conditions that existed prior to the formation of Equilon and Motiva or that occurred
during the period of Texaco’s ownership interest in the joint ventures. In general, the
environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to
December 2001. Claims must be asserted no later than February 2009 for Equilon indemnities and no
later than February 2012 for Motiva indemnities. Under the terms of these indemnities, there is no
maximum limit on the amount of potential future payments. The company has not recorded any
liabilities for possible claims under these indemnities. The company posts no assets as collateral
and has made no payments under the indemnities.

The amounts payable for the indemnities described
above are to be net of amounts recovered from insurance carriers and others and net of liabilities
recorded by Equilon or Motiva prior to September 30, 2001, for any applicable incident.

In the acquisition of Unocal, the company assumed certain indemnities relating to contingent
environmental liabilities associated with assets that were sold in 1997. Under the indemnification
agreement, the company’s liability is unlimited until April 2022, when the indemnification expires.
The acquirer shares in certain environmental remediation costs up to a maximum obligation of $200,
which had not been reached as of December 31, 2007.

Other Contingencies and Commitments – Continued

Securitization

During 2007, the company completed the sale of its U.S. proprietary consumer credit
card business and related receivables. This transaction included terminating the qualifying Special
Purpose Entity (SPE) that was used to securitize associated retail accounts receivable.

Through the use of another qualifying SPE, the company had $675 of securitized trade accounts
receivable related to its downstream business as of December 31, 2007. This arrangement has the
effect of accelerating Chevron’s collection of the securitized amounts. Chevron’s total estimated
financial exposure under this securitization at December 31, 2007, was $65. In the event that the
SPE experiences major defaults in the collection of receivables, Chevron believes that it would
have no additional loss exposure connected with third-party investments in this securitization.

Long-Term Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments, Including Throughput and Take-or-Pay
Agreements

The company and its subsidiaries have certain other contingent liabilities relating to
long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay
agreements, some of which relate to suppliers’ financing arrangements. The agreements typically
provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity, drilling rigs, utilities, and
petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the company’s business. The
aggregate approximate amounts of required payments under these various commitments are: 2008 –
$4,700; 2009 – $3,300; 2010 – $3,300; 2011 – $1,900; 2012 – $1,300; 2013 and after – $4,900. A
portion of these commitments may ultimately be shared with project partners. Total payments under
the agreements were approximately $3,700 in 2007, $3,000 in 2006 and $2,100 in 2005.

Minority Interests

The company has commitments of $204 related to minority interests in subsidiary
companies.

Environmental

The company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and
regulations that in the future may require the company to take action to correct or ameliorate the
effects on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleum substances, including MTBE,
by the company or other parties. Such contingencies may exist for various sites, including, but not
limited to, federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, refineries, crude oil
fields, service stations, terminals, land development areas, and mining operations, whether
operating, closed or divested. These future costs are not fully determinable due to such factors as
the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective
actions that may be required, the determination of the company’s liability in proportion to other
responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties.

Although the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and
reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of
operations in the period in which they are recognized. The company does not expect these costs will
have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity. Also, the
company does not believe its obligations to make such expenditures have had, or will have, any
significant impact on the company’s competitive position relative to other U.S. or international
petroleum or chemical companies.

Chevron’s environmental reserve as of December 31, 2007, was $1,539. Included in this balance were
remediation activities of 240 sites for which the company had been identified as a potentially
responsible party or otherwise involved in the remediation by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) or other regulatory agencies under the provisions of the federal Superfund law or
analogous state laws. The company’s remediation reserve for these sites at year-end 2007 was $123.
The federal Superfund law and analogous state laws provide for joint and several liability for all
responsible parties. Any future actions by the EPA or other regulatory agencies to require Chevron
to assume other potentially responsible parties’ costs at designated hazardous waste sites are not
expected to have a material effect on the company’s results of operations, consolidated financial
position or liquidity.

Of the remaining year-end 2007 environmental reserves balance of $1,416,
$864 related to approximately 2,000 sites for the company’s U.S. downstream operations, including
refineries and other plants, marketing locations (i.e., service stations and terminals) and
pipelines. The remaining $552 was associated with various sites in the international downstream
($146), upstream ($267), chemicals ($105) and other ($34). Liabilities at all sites, whether
operating, closed or divested, were primarily associated with the company’s plans and activities to
remediate soil or groundwater contamination or both. These and other activities include one or more
of the following: site assessment; soil excavation; offsite disposal of contaminants; onsite
containment, remediation and/or extraction of petroleum hydrocarbon liquid and vapor from soil;
groundwater extraction and treatment; and monitoring of the natural attenuation of the
contaminants.

The company manages environmental liabilities under specific sets of regulatory requirements, which
in the United States include the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and various state or local
regulations. No single remediation site at year-end 2007 had a recorded liability that was material
to the company’s results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity.

It is likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities, beyond those recorded,
for environmental remediation relating to past operations. These future costs are not fully
determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude

Other Contingencies and Commitments – Continued

of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective
actions that may be required, the determination of the company’s liability in proportion to other
responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties.

Refer to Note 23 below for a discussion of the company’s Asset Retirement Obligations.

Equity Redetermination

For oil and gas producing operations, ownership agreements may provide for
periodic reassessments of equity interests in estimated crude oil and natural gas reserves. These
activities, individually or together, may result in gains or losses that could be material to
earnings in any given period. One such equity redetermination process has been under way since 1996
for Chevron’s interests in four producing zones at the Naval Petroleum Reserve at Elk Hills,
California, for the time when the remaining interests in these zones were owned by the U.S.
Department of Energy. A wide range remains for a possible net settlement amount for the four zones.
For this range of settlement, Chevron estimates its maximum possible net before-tax liability at
approximately $200, and the possible maximum net amount that could be owed to Chevron is estimated
at about $150. The timing of the settlement and the exact amount within this range of estimates are
uncertain.

Other Contingencies

Chevron receives claims from and submits claims to customers; trading partners;
U.S. federal, state and local regulatory bodies; governments; contractors; insurers; and suppliers.
The amounts of these claims, individually and in the aggregate, may be significant and take lengthy
periods to resolve.

The company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their operations and may close,
abandon, sell, exchange, acquire or restructure assets to achieve operational or strategic benefits
and to improve competitiveness and profitability. These activities, individually or together, may
result in gains or losses in future periods.

Note 23

Asset Retirement Obligations

The company accounts for asset retirement obligations (ARO) in accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards Board Statement (FASB) No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

(FAS 143).
This accounting standard applies to the fair value of a liability for an ARO that is recorded when
there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset and the
liability can be reasonably estimated. Obligations associated with the retirement of these assets
require recognition in certain circumstances: (1) the present value of a liability and offsetting
asset for an ARO, (2) the subsequent accretion of that liability

and depreciation of the asset, and
(3) the periodic review of the ARO liability estimates and discount rates. In 2005, the FASB issued
FASB Interpretation No. 47,

Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations – An
Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143

(FIN 47), which was effective for the company on December
31, 2005. FIN 47 clarifies that the phrase “conditional asset retirement obligation,” as used in
FAS 143, refers to a legal obligation to perform asset retirement activity for which the timing
and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the
control of the company. The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional
even though uncertainty exists about the timing and/or method of settlement. Uncertainty about the
timing and/or method of settlement of a conditional ARO should be factored into the measurement of
the liability when
sufficient information exists. FAS 143 acknowledges that in some cases, sufficient information may
not be available to reasonably estimate the fair value of an ARO. FIN 47 also clarifies when an
entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an ARO. In
adopting FIN 47, the company did not recognize any additional liabilities for conditional AROs due
to an inability to reasonably estimate the fair value of those obligations because of their
indeterminate settlement dates.

FAS 143 and FIN 47 primarily affect the company’s accounting for crude oil and natural gas
producing assets. No significant AROs associated with any legal obligations to retire refining,
marketing and transportation (downstream) and chemical long-lived assets have been recognized, as
indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of
the associated ARO. The company performs periodic reviews of its downstream and chemical long-lived
assets for any changes in facts and circumstances that might require recognition of a retirement
obligation.

The following table indicates the changes to the company’s before-tax asset retirement
obligations in 2007, 2006 and 2005:

including $1,128 in 2006 for the estimated costs to dismantle and abandon
wells and facilities damaged by 2005 hurricanes in the Gulf of
Mexico. The long-term portion of the $8,253 balance at the end of
2007 was $7,555.

Note 24

Other Financial Information

Net income in 2007 included gains of approximately $2,000 relating to the sale of nonstrategic
properties. Of this amount, approximately $1,100 related to downstream assets and $680 related to
the sale of the company’s investment in Dynegy Inc.

The excess of replacement cost over the carrying value of inventories for which the Last-In,
First-Out (LIFO) method is used was $6,958 and $6,010 at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Replacement cost is generally based on average acquisition costs for the year. LIFO profits of
$113, $82 and $34 were included in net income for the years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Note 25

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share (EPS) is based upon net income less preferred stock dividend requirements
and includes the effects of deferrals of salary and other compensation awards that are invested in
Chevron stock units by certain officers and employees of the company and the company’s share of
stock transactions of affiliates, which, under the applicable accounting rules, may be recorded
directly to the company’s retained earnings instead of net income. Diluted EPS includes the effects
of these items as well as the dilutive effects of outstanding stock options awarded under the
company’s stock option programs (refer to Note 21, “Stock Options and Other Share-Based
Compensation” beginning on page FS-53). The table below sets forth the computation of basic and
diluted EPS:

Table V – Reserve Quantity Information

Reserves Governance

The company has adopted a comprehensive reserves and resource
classification system modeled after a system developed and approved by the Society of Petroleum
Engineers, the World Petroleum Congress and the American Association of Petroleum Geologists. The
system classifies recoverable hydrocarbons into six categories based on their status at the time of
reporting – three deemed commercial and three noncommercial. Within the commercial classification
are proved reserves and two categories of unproved: probable and possible. The noncommercial
categories are also referred to as contingent resources. For reserves estimates to be classified as
proved, they must meet all SEC and company standards.

Proved reserves are the estimated quantities that geologic and engineering data demonstrate
with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing
economic and operating conditions. Net proved reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by
others and reflect contractual arrangements and royalty obligations in effect at the time of the
estimate.

Proved reserves are classified as either developed or undeveloped. Proved developed reserves
are the quantities expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and
operating methods.

Due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, estimates of
reserves are subject to change as additional information becomes available.

Proved reserves are estimated by company asset teams composed of earth scientists and
engineers. As part of the internal control process related to reserves estimation, the company
maintains a Reserves Advisory Committee (RAC) that is chaired by the corporate reserves manager,
who is a member of a corporate department that reports directly to the executive vice president
responsible for the company’s worldwide exploration and production activities. All of the RAC
members are knowledgeable in SEC guidelines for proved reserves classification. The RAC coordinates
its activities through two operating company-level reserves managers. These two reserves managers
are not members of the RAC so as to preserve the corporate-level independence.

The RAC has the following primary responsibilities: provide independent reviews of the
business units’ recommended reserve changes; confirm that proved reserves are recognized in
accordance with SEC guidelines; determine that reserve volumes are calculated using consistent and
appropriate standards, procedures and technology; and maintain the

Corporate Reserves Manual,

which
provides standardized procedures used corporatewide for classifying and reporting hydrocarbon
reserves.

FS-66


Table
V

Reserve Quantity Information –
Continued

During the year, the RAC is represented in meetings with each of the company’s upstream
business units to review and discuss reserve changes recommended by the various asset teams. Major
changes are also reviewed with the company’s Strategy and Planning Committee and the Executive
Committee, whose members include the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. The
company’s annual reserve activity is also reviewed with the Board of Directors. If major changes to
reserves were to occur between the annual reviews, those matters would also be discussed with the
Board.

RAC subteams also conduct in-depth reviews during the year of many of the fields that have the
largest proved reserves quantities. These reviews include an examination of the proved-reserve
records and documentation of their alignment with the

Corporate Reserves Manual.

Reserve Quantities

At December 31, 2007, oil-equivalent reserves for the company’s
consolidated operations were 7.9 billion barrels. (Refer to the
term “Reserves” on page E-24 for
the definition of oil-equivalent reserves.) Approximately 28 percent of the total reserves were in
the United States. For the company’s interests in equity affiliates, oil-equivalent reserves were
2.9 billion barrels, 84 percent of which were associated with the company’s 50 percent ownership in
TCO.

Aside from the TCO operations, no single property accounted for more than 5 percent of the
company’s total oil-equivalent proved reserves. Fewer than 20 other individual properties in the
company’s portfolio of assets each contained between 1 percent and 5 percent of the company’s
oil-equivalent proved reserves, which in the aggregate accounted for about 37 percent of the
company’s proved reserves total. These properties were geographically dispersed, located in the
United States, South America, West Africa and the Asia-Pacific region.

In the United States, total oil-equivalent reserves at year-end 2007 were 2.2 billion barrels.
Of this amount, 41 percent, 21 percent and 38 percent were located in California, the Gulf of
Mexico and other U.S. areas, respectively.

In California, liquids reserves represented 94 percent of the total, with most classified as
heavy oil. Because of heavy oil’s high viscosity and the need to employ enhanced recovery methods,
the producing operations are capital intensive in nature. Most of the company’s heavy-oil fields in
California employ a continuous steamflooding process.

In the Gulf of Mexico region, liquids represented approximately 66 percent of total
oil-equivalent reserves. Production operations are mostly offshore and, as a result, are also
capital intensive. Costs include investments in wells, production platforms and other facilities,
such as gathering lines and storage facilities.

In other U.S. areas, the reserves were split about equally between liquids and natural gas.
For production of crude oil, some fields utilize enhanced recovery methods, including waterflood

The pattern of net reserve changes shown in the following tables, for the three years ending
December 31, 2007, is not necessarily indicative of future trends. Apart from acquisitions, the
company’s ability to add proved reserves is affected by, among other things, events and
circumstances that are outside the company’s control, such as delays in government permitting,
partner approvals of development plans, changes in oil and gas prices, OPEC constraints,
geopolitical uncertainties, and civil unrest.

The company’s estimated net proved oil and natural gas reserves and changes thereto for the
years 2005, 2006 and 2007 are shown in the tables on pages FS-68 and FS-70.

Includes reserves acquired through nonmonetary transactions.


Includes reserves disposed of through nonmonetary transactions.


Included are year-end reserve quantities related to production-sharing contracts (PSC)
(refer to page E-23 for the definition of a PSC). PSC-related reserve quantities are 26
percent, 30 percent and 29 percent for consolidated
companies for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.


Net reserve changes (excluding production) in 2007 consist of 97 million barrels of
developed reserves and (162) million barrels of undeveloped reserves for consolidated companies and
299 million barrels of developed reserves and (312) million barrels of undeveloped reserves for
affiliated companies.


During 2007, the percentages of undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2006, transferred
to developed reserves were 8 percent and 24 percent for consolidated companies and affiliated
companies, respectively.

Information on Canadian Oil Sands Net Proved Reserves Not Included Above:

In addition to conventional liquids and natural gas proved reserves, Chevron has significant
interests in proved oil sands reserves in Canada associated with the Athabasca project. For
internal management purposes, Chevron views these reserves and their development as an integral
part of total upstream operations. However, SEC regulations define these reserves as mining-related
and not a part of conventional oil and gas reserves. Net proved oil sands reserves were 436 million
barrels as of December 31, 2007. The oil sands reserves are not considered in the standardized
measure of discounted future net cash flows for conventional oil and gas reserves, which is found
on page FS-73.

Noteworthy amounts in the categories of liquids proved-reserve changes for 2005 through
2007 are discussed below:

Revisions

In 2005, net revisions reduced reserves by 239 million
and 24 million barrels for worldwide consolidated companies and equity affiliates, respectively.
For consolidated companies, the net decrease was 199 million barrels in the international areas and
40 million barrels in the United States. The largest downward net revisions internationally were
108 million barrels in Indonesia and

53 million barrels in Kazakhstan, due primarily to the effect of higher year-end prices on the calculation of reserves
associated with production-sharing and variable-royalty contracts. In the United States, the 40
million-barrel reduction was across many fields in each of the geographic sections. Most of the
downward revision for affiliated companies was a 19 million-barrel reduction in Hamaca,
attributable to revised government royalty provisions. For TCO, the downward effect of higher
year-end prices was partially offset by increased reservoir performance.

FS-68

In 2006, net revisions increased reserves by 39 million and 84 million barrels for
worldwide consolidated companies and equity affiliates, respectively. International consolidated
companies accounted for the net increase of 39 million barrels. The largest upward net revisions
were 61 million barrels in Indonesia and 27 million barrels in Thailand. In Indonesia, the increase
was the result of infill drilling and improved steamflood performance. The upward revision in
Thailand reflected additional drilling and development activity during the year. These upward
revisions were partially offset by reductions in reservoir performance in Nigeria and the United
Kingdom, which decreased reserves by 43 million barrels and by 32 million barrels, respectively.
Most of the upward revision for affiliated companies was related to a 60 million-barrel increase in
TCO as a result of improved reservoir performance.

In 2007, net revisions decreased reserves by 146 million barrels for worldwide consolidated
companies and increased reserves by 103 million barrels for equity affiliates. For consolidated
companies, the largest downward net revisions were 89 million barrels in Africa and 66 million
barrels in Indonesia. In Africa, the decrease was mainly based on field performance data for fields
in Nigeria and the effect of higher year-end prices in Angola and the Republic of the Congo. In
Indonesia, the decline also reflected the impact of higher year-end prices. Higher prices also
resulted in downward revisions in Karachaganak and Azerbaijan. For equity affiliates, most of the
upward revision was related to a 92 million-barrel increase for the Tengiz Field in TCO and an 11
million-barrel increase for Petroboscan in Venezuela, both as a result of improved reservoir
performance. At TCO, the upward revision was tempered by the negative impact of higher year-end
prices.

Improved Recovery

In 2005, improved recovery increased liquids
volumes worldwide by 203 million barrels for consolidated companies. International areas accounted
for 142 million barrels of the increase. Indonesia added 42 million barrels due to improved
performance. Reserve additions of 67 million barrels in Africa occurred primarily in Angola and
resulted from infill drilling, wells workovers and secondary recovery from gas injection. Additions
of 29 million barrels in the “Other” international area were mainly attributable to improved
waterflood performance offshore eastern Canada. An increase of 61 million barrels occurred in the
United States, primarily in California due to improved performance on a large heavy oil field under
thermal recovery.

In 2006, improved recovery increased liquids volumes worldwide by 83 million barrels for
consolidated companies. Reserves in the United States increased 52 million barrels, with California
representing 49 million barrels of the total increase due to steamflood expansion and revised
modeling activities. Internationally, improved recovery increased reserves by 31 million barrels,
with no single country accounting for an increase of more than 10 million barrels.

In 2007, improved recovery increased liquids volumes by 20 million barrels worldwide. No
addition was individually significant.

Extensions and Discoveries

In 2005, extensions and discoveries
increased liquids volumes worldwide by 184 million barrels for consolidated companies. The largest
increase was 49 million barrels in Nigeria, reflecting new development drilling, including in the
Agbami Field, among others. New field developments in Brazil contributed another 41 million barrels
of discoveries. In the United States, the 44 million-barrel addition was associated mainly with the
initial booking of reserves for the Blind Faith Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.

In 2006, extensions and discoveries increased liquids volumes worldwide by 107 million barrels
for consolidated companies. Reserves in Nigeria increased by 27 million barrels due in part to the
initial booking of reserves for the Aparo Field. Additional drilling activities contributed 19
million barrels in the United Kingdom and 14 million barrels in Argentina. In the United States,
the Gulf of Mexico added 25 million barrels, mainly the result of the initial booking of the Great
White Field in the deepwater Perdido Fold Belt area.

In 2007, extensions and discoveries increased liquids volumes by 60 million barrels worldwide.
The largest additions were 25 million barrels in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, mainly for the deepwater
Tahiti and Mad Dog fields.

Purchases

In 2005, the acquisition of 572 million barrels of
liquids related solely to the acquisition of Unocal in August. About three-fourths of the 376
million barrels acquired in the international areas were represented by volumes in Azerbaijan and
Thailand. Most volumes acquired in the United States were in Texas and Alaska.

In 2006, acquisitions increased liquids volumes worldwide by 21 million barrels for
consolidated companies and 119 million barrels for equity affiliates. For consolidated companies,
the amount was mainly the result of new agreements in Nigeria, which added 13 million barrels of
reserves. The other-equity-affiliates quantity reflects the result of the conversion of Boscan and
LL-652 operations to joint stock companies in Venezuela.

In 2007, acquisitions of 316 million barrels for equity affiliates related to the formation of
a new Hamaca equity affiliate in Venezuela.

Sales

In 2005, sales of 58 million barrels in the “Other”
international area related to the disposition of the former Unocal operations onshore in Canada.

In 2006, sales decreased reserves by 15 million barrels due to the conversion of the LL-652
risked service agreement to a joint stock company in Venezuela.

In 2007, affiliated company sales of 432 million barrels related to the dissolution of a
Hamaca equity affiliate in Venezuela.

47 percent and 44 percent for consolidated companies for 2007, 2006 and
2005, respectively.


Net reserve changes (excluding production) in 2007 consist of 1,548 billion cubic feet
of developed reserves and (569) billion cubic feet of undeveloped reserves for consolidated
companies and 403 billion cubic feet of developed reserves and (294) billion cubic feet of
undeveloped reserves for affiliated companies.


During 2007, the percentages of undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2006, transferred
to developed reserves were 10 percent and 27 percent for consolidated companies and affiliated
companies, respectively.

Noteworthy amounts in the categories of natural gas proved-reserve changes for 2005
through 2007 are discussed below:

Revisions

In 2005, reserves were revised downward by 14 billion
cubic feet (BCF) for consolidated companies and 498 BCF for equity affiliates. For consolidated
companies, negative revisions were 428 BCF in the Asia-Pacific region. Most of the decrease was
attributable to one field in Kazakhstan, due mainly to the effects of higher year-end prices on
variable-royalty provisions of the production-sharing contract. Reserves additions for consolidated
companies totaled 211 BCF and 243 BCF in Africa and “Other,”

respectively. The majority of the African region changes were in Angola, due to a revised forecast of fuel gas usage,
and in Nigeria, from improved reservoir performance. The availability of third-party compression in
Colombia accounted for most of the increase in the “Other” region. Revisions in the United States
decreased reserves by 9 BCF, as nominal increases in the San Joaquin Valley were more than offset
by decreases in the Gulf of Mexico and “Other” region. For the TCO affiliate in Kazakhstan, a
reduction of 547 BCF reflects the updated forecast of future royalties payable and year-end price
effects, partially offset by volumes added as a result of an updated assessment of reservoir
performance.

FS-70


Table

Reserve Quantity Information –
Continued

In 2006, revisions accounted for a net increase of 481 BCF for consolidated companies and
26 BCF for affiliates. For consolidated companies, net increases of 511 BCF internationally were
partially offset by a 30 BCF downward revision in the United States. Drilling and development
activities added 337 BCF of reserves in Thailand, while Kazakhstan added 200 BCF, largely due to
development activity. Trinidad and Tobago increased 185 BCF, attributable to improved reservoir
performance and a new contract for sales of natural gas. These additions were partially offset by
downward revisions of 224 BCF in the United Kingdom and 130 BCF in Australia due to drilling
results and reservoir performance. U.S. “Other” had a downward revision of 102 BCF due to reservoir
performance, which was partially offset by upward revisions of 72 BCF in the Gulf of Mexico and
California related to reservoir performance and development drilling. TCO had an upward revision of
26 BCF associated with additional development activity and updated reservoir performance.

In 2007, revisions increased reserves for consolidated companies by a net 395 BCF and
increased reserves for affiliated companies by a net 73 BCF. For consolidated companies, net
increases were 209 BCF in the United States and 186 BCF internationally. Improved reservoir
performance for many fields in the United States contributed 130 BCF in the “Other” region, 40 BCF
in California and 39 BCF in the Gulf of Mexico. Drilling activities added 360 BCF in Thailand and
improved reservoir performance added 188 BCF in Trinidad and Tobago. These additions were partially
offset by downward revisions of 185 BCF in Australia due to drilling results and 136 BCF in Nigeria
due to field performance. Negative revisions due to the impact of higher prices were recorded in
Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. TCO had an upward revision of 75 BCF associated with improved reservoir
performance and development activities. This upward revision was net of a negative impact due to
higher year-end prices.

Extensions and Discoveries

In 2005, consolidated companies
increased reserves by 370 BCF, including 167 BCF in the United States and 118 BCF in the
Asia-Pacific region. In the United States, 99 BCF was added in the “Other” region and 68 BCF in the
Gulf of Mexico, primarily due to drilling activities. The addition in Asia-Pacific resulted
primarily from increased drilling in Kazakhstan.

In 2006, extensions and discoveries accounted for an increase of 799 BCF for consolidated
companies, reflecting a 531 BCF increase outside the United States
and a U.S. increase of 268 BCF.
Bangladesh added 451 BCF, the result of development activity and field extensions, and Thailand
added 59 BCF, the result of drilling activities. U.S. “Other” contributed 157 BCF, approximately
half of which was related to South Texas and the Piceance Basin, and
the Gulf of Mexico added 111
BCF, partly due to the initial booking of reserves at the Great White Field in the deepwater
Perdido Fold Belt area.

In 2007, extensions and discoveries accounted for an increase of 518 BCF worldwide. The
largest addition was 330 BCF in Bangladesh, the result of drilling activities. Other additions were
not individually significant.

Purchases

In 2005, all except 7 BCF of the 5,656 BCF total
purchases were associated with the Unocal acquisition. International reserve acquisitions were
4,488 BCF, with Thailand accounting for about half the volumes. Other significant volumes were
added in Bangladesh and Myanmar.

In 2006, purchases of natural gas reserves were 35 BCF for consolidated companies, about
evenly divided between the company’s United States and international operations. Affiliated
companies added 54 BCF of reserves, the result of conversion of an operating service agreement to a
joint stock company in Venezuela.

In 2007, purchases of natural gas reserves were 141 BCF for consolidated companies, which
included the acquisition of an additional interest in the Bibiyana Field in Bangladesh. Affiliated
company purchases of 211 BCF related to the formation of a new Hamaca equity affiliate in Venezuela
and an initial booking related to the Angola LNG project.

Sales

In 2005, sales of 248 BCF in the “Other” international
region related to the disposition of former-Unocal’s onshore properties in Canada.

In 2006, sales for consolidated companies totaled 149 BCF, mostly associated with the
conversion of a risked service agreement to a joint stock company in Venezuela.

In 2007, sales were 76 BCF and 175 BCF for consolidated companies and equity affiliates,
respectively. The affiliated company sales related to the dissolution of a Hamaca equity affiliate
in Venezuela.

Table VI

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Related to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves

The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, related to the preceding
proved oil and gas reserves, is calculated in accordance with the requirements of FAS 69. Estimated
future cash inflows from production are computed by applying year-end prices for oil and gas to
year-end quantities of estimated net proved reserves. Future price changes are limited to those
provided by contractual arrangements in existence at the end of each reporting year. Future
development and production costs are those estimated future expenditures necessary to develop and
produce year-end estimated proved reserves based on year-end cost indices, assuming continuation of
year-end economic conditions, and include estimated costs for asset retirement obligations.
Estimated future income taxes are calculated by applying appropriate year-end statutory tax rates.
These rates reflect allowable deductions and tax credits and are applied to estimated future pretax
net cash flows, less the tax basis of related assets. Discounted future net cash flows are
calculated

using 10 percent midperiod discount factors. Discounting requires a year-by-year estimate of when
future expenditures will be incurred and when reserves will be produced.

The information provided does not represent management’s estimate of the company’s expected
future cash flows or value of proved oil and gas reserves. Estimates of proved-reserve quantities
are imprecise and change over time as new information becomes available. Moreover, probable and
possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, are excluded from the calculations. The
arbitrary valuation prescribed under FAS 69 requires assumptions as to the timing and amount of
future development and production costs. The calculations are made as of December 31 each year and
should not be relied upon as an indication of the company’s future cash flows or value of its oil
and gas reserves. In the following table, “Standardized Measure Net Cash Flows” refers to the
standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows.
