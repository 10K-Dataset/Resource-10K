FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) encourages companies to disclose forward-looking information so that investors can better understand a company’s future prospects and make informed investment decisions. Forward-looking statements are usually identified by the use of words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “intend,” “likely,” “may,” “plan,” “position,” “possible,” “potential,” “probable,” “project,” “projection,” “should,” “strategy,” “will,” or similar expressions. These statements are based upon assessments and assumptions of management in light of historical results and trends, current conditions and potential future developments that often involve judgment, estimates, assumptions and projections. Forward-looking statements reflect current views about our plans, strategies and prospects, which are based on information currently available as of the date of this report. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside our control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on those statements. We intend for any forward-looking statements to be covered by, and we claim the protection under, the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.



PART I

Item 1.

Business.

Unless the context otherwise requires, “Advance,” “we,” “us,” “our,” and similar terms refer to Advance Auto Parts, Inc., its subsidiaries and their respective operations. Our fiscal year consists of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to December 31

st

of each year. Our


,


and


fiscal years included 52 weeks of operations.

Overview

We are a leading automotive aftermarket parts provider in North America, serving both professional installers (“Professional”), and “do-it-yourself” (“DIY”), customers as well as independently owned operators. Our stores and branches offer a broad selection of brand name, original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) and private label automotive replacement parts, accessories, batteries and maintenance items for domestic and imported cars, vans, sport utility vehicles and light and heavy duty trucks. As of

December 30, 2017

, the end of our


fiscal year (“


”), we operated

5,054

total stores and


branches primarily under the trade names “Advance Auto Parts”, “Autopart International”, “Carquest” and “Worldpac”.

We were founded in 1929 as Advance Stores Company, Incorporated and operated as a retailer of general merchandise until the 1980s. During the 1980s, we began targeting the sale of automotive parts and accessories to DIY customers. We began our Professional delivery program in 1996 and have steadily increased our sales to Professional customers since 2000. We have grown significantly as a result of comparable store sales growth, new store openings and strategic acquisitions. Advance Auto Parts, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was incorporated in 2001 in conjunction with the acquisition of Discount Auto Parts, Inc. In 2014, we acquired General Parts International, Inc. (“GPI”), a privately held company that was a leading distributor and supplier of original equipment and aftermarket automotive replacement products for Professional markets operating under the Carquest and Worldpac names.

Segment and Related Information

During


and 2016 we aggregated our operating segments into a single reportable segment comprised of our store and branch operations. A discussion of our segment structure is available in Note 2,

Significant Accounting Policies,

of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.

Stores and Branches

Through our integrated operating approach, we serve our Professional and DIY customers through a variety of channels ranging from traditional “brick and mortar” store locations to self-service e-commerce sites. We believe we are better able to meet our customers’ needs by operating under several store names, which are as follows:

Advance Auto Parts

- Consists of

4,432

stores as of

December 30, 2017

generally located in freestanding buildings with a heavy focus on both Professional and DIY customers. The average size of an Advance Auto Parts store is approximately

7,500

square feet with the size of our typical new stores ranging from approximately

6,200

to

15,000

square feet. These stores carry a wide variety of products serving aftermarket auto part needs for both domestic and import vehicles. Our Advance Auto Parts stores carry a product offering of approximately

22,000

stock keeping units (“SKUs”), generally consisting of a custom mix of product based on each store’s respective market. Supplementing the inventory on-hand at our stores, additional less common SKUs are available in many of our larger stores (known as “HUB” stores). These additional SKUs are available on a same-day or next-day basis.

Autopart International

(“AI”)

- Consists of


stores as of

December 30, 2017

operating primarily in the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States focusing on the Professional customer. These stores specialize in imported aftermarket and private label branded auto parts. The AI stores offer approximately

41,000

SKUs through routine replenishment from their supply chain.

Carquest

- Consists of


stores as of

December 30, 2017

, including


stores in Canada. Our Carquest stores are generally located in freestanding buildings with a heavy focus on Professional customers, but also serving DIY customers. The average size of a Carquest store is approximately

7,600

square feet. These stores carry a wide variety of products serving the aftermarket auto part needs for both domestic and import vehicles with a product offering of approximately

23,000

SKUs. We continue to convert or consolidate the U.S. Carquest stores with our Advance Auto Parts stores as part of our multi-year integration plan. As of

December 30, 2017

, Carquest also served

1,218

independently owned stores that operate under the Carquest name.



Worldpac

- Consists of


branches as of

December 30, 2017

that principally serve Professional customers utilizing an efficient and sophisticated on-line ordering and fulfillment system. The Worldpac branches are generally larger than our other store locations averaging approximately

28,000

square feet in size. Worldpac specializes in imported, OEM parts. Worldpac’s complete product offering includes over

120,000

SKUs for over 40 import and domestic vehicle carlines.

Our Products

The following table shows some of the types of products that we sell by major category of items:

We provide our customers quality products, which many are offered at a good, better or best recommendation differentiated by price and quality.

Our Customers

Our Professional customers consist primarily of customers for whom we deliver product from our store or branch locations to their places of business, including garages, service stations and auto dealers. Our Professional sales represented approximately

58%

,

58%

and

57%

of our sales in 2017, 2016 and 2015. We also serve

1,218

independently owned Carquest stores with shipments directly from our distribution centers. Our DIY customers are primarily served through our stores and can also order online to pick up merchandise at a conveniently located store or have their purchases shipped directly to them. Except where prohibited, we also provide a variety of services at our stores free of charge to our customers, including:

•

Battery and wiper installation;

•

Battery charging;

•

Check engine light reading;

•

Electrical system testing, including batteries, starters, alternators and sensors;

•

“How-To” video clinics;

•

Oil and battery recycling; and

•

Loaner tool programs.

We also serve our customers online at www.AdvanceAutoParts.com. Our Professional customers can conveniently place their orders electronically, over the phone or in-store and we deliver product from our store or branch locations to their places of business. Our online websites also allow our DIY customers to pick up merchandise at a conveniently located store or have their purchases shipped directly to them.



Store Development

Key factors in selecting sites and market locations in which we operate include population, demographics, traffic count, vehicle profile, number and strength of competitors’ stores and the cost of real estate. Our

5,183

stores and branches were located in the following states, territories and international locations as of

December 30, 2017

:

We serve our Advance Auto Parts and Carquest stores primarily from our store support centers in Roanoke, VA and Raleigh, NC. We also maintain a store support center in Newark, CA to support our Worldpac and e-commerce operations and in Norton, MA to support our Autopart International stores.

Supply Chain

Our supply chain consists of a network of distribution centers, HUBs, stores and branches that enable us to provide same-day or next-day availability to our customers. As of

December 30, 2017

, we operated


distribution centers, ranging in size from approximately

51,000

to

943,000

square feet with total square footage of approximately

12.0 million

. Currently, our smaller distribution centers primarily service our Carquest stores, including those that have converted to the Advance Auto Parts format, while our larger distribution centers primarily service Advance Auto Parts, Autopart International and Worldpac locations. In


, we opened new distribution centers in Houston, TX and in the greater Nashville, TN area.



Merchandise, Marketing and Advertising

In


, we purchased merchandise from over


vendors, with no single vendor accounting for more than

9%

of purchases. Our purchasing strategy involves negotiating agreements with most of our vendors to purchase merchandise over a specified period of time along with other provisions, including pricing, volume and payment terms.

Our merchandising strategy is to carry a broad selection of high quality and reputable brand name automotive parts and accessories that we believe will appeal to our Professional customers and also generate DIY customer traffic. Some of our brands include Bosch

®

, Castrol

®

, Dayco

®

, Denso

®

, Gates

®

, Moog

®

, Monroe

®

, NGK

®

, Prestone

®

, Purolator

®

, Trico

®

and Wagner

®

. In addition to these branded products, we stock a wide selection of high quality private label products that appeal to value-conscious customers. These lines of merchandise include chemicals, interior automotive accessories, batteries and parts under various private label names such as Autocraft

®

, Autopart International

®

, Driveworks

®

, Tough One

®

and Wearever

®

as well as the Carquest

®

brand.

Our marketing and advertising program is designed to drive brand awareness, consideration and omni-channel traffic by positioning Advance Auto Parts as the leader in parts availability, in-store parts and project expertise within the aftermarket auto parts category. We strive to exceed our customers’ expectations end-to-end through a comprehensive online and pick up in-store experience, extensive parts assortment, experienced parts professionals, Professional programs that are designed to build loyalty with our customers and our DIY customer loyalty program, Speed Perks. Our DIY campaign was developed around a multi-channel communications plan that brings together radio, television, direct marketing, social media, sponsorships, store events and Speed Perks.

Seasonality

Our business is somewhat seasonal in nature, with the highest sales usually occurring in the spring and summer months. In addition, our business can be affected by weather conditions. While unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as elective maintenance is deferred during such periods, extremely hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail at an accelerated rate. Our fourth quarter is generally our most volatile as weather and spending trade-offs typically influence our Professional and DIY sales.

Team Members

As of

December 30, 2017

, we employed approximately

40,000

full-time Team Members and approximately

31,000

part-time Team Members. Our workforce consisted of

86%

of our Team Members employed in store-level operations,

10%

employed in distribution and

4%

employed in our corporate offices. As of

December 30, 2017

, less than 1% of our Team Members were represented by labor unions. We have never experienced any labor disruption.

Intellectual Property

We own a number of trade names, service marks and trademarks, including “Advance Auto Parts”, “Autopart International”, “Carquest”, “CARQUEST Technical Institute”, “DriverSide”, “MotoLogic”, “MotoShop”, “Worldpac”, “speedDIAL” and “TECH-NET Professional Auto Service” for use in connection with the automotive parts business. In addition, we own and have registered a number of trademarks for our private label brands. We believe that these trade names, service marks and trademarks are important to our merchandising strategy. We do not know of any infringing uses that would materially affect the use of these trade names and marks and we actively defend and enforce them.

Competition

We operate in both the Professional and DIY markets of the automotive aftermarket industry. Our primary competitors are (i) both national and regional chains of automotive parts stores, including AutoZone, Inc., NAPA, O’Reilly Automotive, Inc., The Pep Boys-Manny, Moe & Jack and Auto Plus (formerly Uni-Select USA, Inc.), (ii) discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products, (iii) wholesalers or jobber stores, including those associated with national parts distributors or associations, (iv) independently owned stores, (v) automobile dealers that supply parts and (vi) internet-based retailers. We believe that chains of automotive parts stores that, like us, have multiple locations in one or more markets, have competitive advantages in customer service, marketing, inventory selection, purchasing and distribution as compared to independent retailers and jobbers that are not part of a chain or associated with other retailers or jobbers. The principal methods of competition in our business include customer service, product offerings, availability, quality, price and store location.



Environmental Matters

We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business, including those governing collection, transportation and recycling of automotive lead-acid batteries, used automotive oil and other recyclable items, and ownership and operation of real property. We sell products containing hazardous materials as part of our business. In addition, our customers may bring automotive lead-acid batteries, used automotive oil or other recyclable items onto our properties. We currently provide collection and recycling programs for used lead-acid batteries, used oil and other recyclable items at a majority of our stores as a service to our customers. Pursuant to agreements with third party vendors, lead-acid batteries, used oil and other recyclable items are collected by our Team Members, deposited onto pallets or into vendor supplied containers and stored by us until collected by the third party vendors for recycling or proper disposal. The terms of our contracts with third party vendors require that they are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Our third party vendors who arrange for the removal, disposal, treatment or other handling of hazardous or toxic substances may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation at any affected disposal, treatment or other site affected by such substances. Based on our experience, we do not believe that there are any material environmental costs associated with the current business practice of accepting lead-acid batteries, used oil and other recyclable items as these costs are borne by the respective third party vendors.

We own and lease real property. Under various environmental laws and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in such property. These laws often impose joint and several liability and may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release of such hazardous or toxic substances. Other environmental laws and common law principles also could be used to impose liability for releases of hazardous materials into the environment or work place, and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances. From time to time, we receive notices from the Environmental Protection Agency and state environmental authorities indicating that there may be contamination on properties we own, lease or operate or may have owned, leased or operated in the past or on adjacent properties for which we may be responsible. Compliance with these laws and regulations and clean-up of released hazardous substances have not had a material impact on our operations to date.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Our business is subject to a variety of risks. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted by the following risk factors. These risks are not the only risks that may impact our business.

If overall demand for the products we sell slows or declines, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will suffer. Decreased demand could also negatively impact our stock price.

Overall demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may slow or decrease due to any number of reasons, including:

•

a decrease in the number of vehicles or in the number of annual miles driven or significant increase in the use of mobile services

, because fewer vehicles means less maintenance and repairs, and lower vehicle mileage, which decreases the need for maintenance and repair;

•

the economy

, because during periods of declining economic conditions, consumers may reduce their discretionary spending by deferring vehicle maintenance or repair and new car purchases, which may impact the number of cars requiring repair in the future;

•

the weather,

because milder weather conditions may lower the failure rates of automobile parts while extended periods of rain and winter precipitation may cause our customers to defer elective maintenance and repair of their vehicles;



•

the average duration of vehicle manufacturer warranties and average age of vehicles being driven,

because newer cars typically require fewer repairs and will be repaired by the manufacturers’ dealer networks using dealer parts pursuant to warranties (which have gradually increased in duration and/or mileage expiration over the recent past), while vehicles that are seven years old and older are generally no longer covered under manufacturers’ warranties and tend to need more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles;

•

an increase in internet-based retailers

, because potentially favorable prices and ease of use of purchasing parts via the internet may decrease the need for customers to visit and purchase their aftermarket parts from our physical stores;

•

technological advances, such as battery electric vehicles, and the increase in quality of vehicles manufactured

, because vehicles that need less frequent maintenance and have low part failure rates will require less frequent repairs using aftermarket parts; and

•

the refusal of vehicle manufacturers to make available diagnostic, repair and maintenance information

to

the automotive aftermarket industry that our Professional and DIY customers require to diagnose, repair and maintain their vehicles

, because this may force consumers to have a majority of diagnostic work, repairs and maintenance performed by the vehicle manufacturers’ dealer networks.

If we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry we may lose customers, our revenues may decline, and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable.

The sale of automotive parts, accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many ways, including name recognition, location, price, quality, product availability and customer service. We compete in both the Professional and DIY categories of the automotive aftermarket industry, primarily with: (i) national and regional chains of automotive parts stores, (ii) discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products, (iii) wholesalers or jobbers stores, including those associated with national parts distributors or associations (iv) independently owned stores, (v) automobile dealers that supply parts and (vi) internet-based retailers. These competitors and the level of competition vary by market. Some of our competitors may possess advantages over us in certain markets we share, including with respect to the level of marketing activities, number of stores, store locations, store layouts, operating histories, name recognition, established customer bases, vendor relationships, prices and product warranties. Internet-based retailers may possess cost advantages over us due to less overhead costs, time and travel savings and ability to price competitively. Consolidation among our competitors could enhance their market share and financial position, provide them with the ability to achieve better purchasing terms and allow them to provide more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete.

In addition, our reputation is critical to our continued success. If we fail to maintain high standards for, or receive negative publicity (whether through social media or traditional media channels) relating to, product safety and quality or our integrity and reputation, we could lose customers to our competition. The product we sell is branded both in brands of our vendors and in our own private label brands. If the perceived quality or value of the brands we sell declines in the eyes of our customers, our results of operations could be negatively affected.

Competition may require us to reduce our prices below our normal selling prices or increase our promotional spending, which could lower our revenue and profitability. Competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines, require us to discontinue current product offerings, or change some of our current operating strategies. If we do not have the resources, expertise and consistent execution, or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies, to address these potential competitive disadvantages, we may lose customers, our revenues and profit margins may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable.

If we are unable to successfully implement our business strategy, including increasing sales to Professional and DIY customers, expanding our margins and increasing our return on invested capital, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.

We have identified numerous initiatives as part of our business strategy to increase sales to both Professional and DIY customers and expand our margins in order to increase our earnings and cash flows. If we are unable to implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively, or if these initiatives are unsuccessful, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. Successful implementation of our business strategy also depends on factors specific to the automotive aftermarket industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control.



Our inventory and ability to meet customer expectations may be adversely impacted by factors out or our control.

For that portion of our inventory manufactured and/or sourced outside the United States, geopolitical changes, changes in trade regulations, currency fluctuations, shipping related issues, natural disasters, pandemics and other factors beyond our control may increase the cost of items we purchase or create shortages that could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. In addition, unanticipated changes in consumer preferences and/or any unforeseen hurdles to meeting our customers’ needs for automotive products (particularly parts availability) in a timely manner could undermine our business strategy.

If we are unable to successfully implement our growth strategy, keep existing store locations or open new locations in desirable places on favorable terms, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We intend to continue to expand the markets we serve as part of our growth strategy, which may include opening new stores or branches, as well as expansion of our online business. We may also grow our business through strategic acquisitions. We do not know whether the implementation of our growth strategy will be successful. As we expand our market presence through various means, it becomes more critical that we have consistent and effective execution across our entire Company’s locations and brands. We are unsure whether we will be able to open and operate new locations on a timely or sufficiently profitable basis, or that opening new locations in markets we already serve will not harm the profitability or comparable store sales of existing locations. The newly opened and existing locations’ profitability will depend on the competition we face as well as our ability to properly stock, market and price the products desired by customers in these markets. The actual number and format of any new locations to be opened and the success of our growth strategy will depend on a number of factors, including, among other things:

•

the availability of desirable locations;

•

the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations;

•

the availability of financial resources, including access to capital at cost-effective interest rates;

•

our ability to expand our on-line offerings and sales; and

•

our ability to manage the expansion and to hire, train and retain qualified Team Members.

We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores. Local land use and zoning regulations, environmental regulations and other regulatory requirements may impact our ability to find suitable locations and influence the cost of constructing, renovating and operating our stores. In addition, real estate, zoning, construction and other delays may adversely affect store openings and renovations and increase our costs. Further, changing local demographics at existing store locations may adversely affect revenue and profitability levels at those stores. The termination or expiration of leases at existing store locations may adversely affect us if the renewal terms of those leases are unacceptable to us and we are forced to close or relocate stores. If we determine to close or relocate a store subject to a lease, we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for the balance of the lease term.

We also expect to continue to make strategic acquisitions an element of our growth strategy. Acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our growth and profitability to differ from our expectations. The success of our acquisitions depends on a number of factors, including among other things:

•

our ability to continue to identify and acquire suitable targets or to acquire additional companies at favorable prices and on other favorable terms;

•

our ability to obtain the full benefits envisioned by strategic relationships;

•

the risk that management’s attention may be distracted;

•

our ability to retain key personnel from acquired businesses;

•

our ability to successfully integrate the operations and systems of the acquired companies and achieve the strategic, operational, financial or other anticipated synergies of the acquisition;

•

we may incur significant transaction and integration costs in connection with acquisitions that may not be offset by the synergies achieved from the acquisition in the near term, or at all; and

•

we may assume or become subject to loss contingencies, known or unknown, of the acquired companies, which could relate to past, present or future facts, events, circumstances or occurrences.



If we are unable to maintain adequate supply chain capacity and improve supply chain efficiency, we will not be able to expand our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our store inventories are primarily replenished by shipments from our network of distribution centers, warehouses and HUB stores. As we expand our market presence, we will need to increase the efficiency and maintain adequate capacity of our supply chain network in order to achieve the business goal of reducing inventory costs while improving availability and movement of goods throughout our supply chain to meet consumer product needs and channel preferences. We continue to streamline and optimize our supply chain network and systems and cannot be assured of our ability to increase the productivity and efficiency of our overall supply chain network to desired levels. If we fail to effectively utilize our existing supply chain or if our investments in our supply chain do not provide the anticipated benefits, we could experience sub-optimal inventory levels or increases in our costs, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We are dependent on our suppliers to supply us with products that comply with safety and quality standards at competitive prices.

We are dependent on our vendors continuing to supply us quality products on terms that are favorable to us. If our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers’ expectations regarding safety and quality, we could experience lost sales, increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk. All of our suppliers must comply with applicable product safety laws, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards. Events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action and/or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities. To the extent our suppliers are subject to additional government regulation of their product design and/or manufacturing processes, the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise. In addition, negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs, resulting in lost sales. In those circumstances, it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our customers.

We depend on the services of many qualified executives and other Team Members, whom we may not be able to attract, develop and retain.

Our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our executives and other Team Members. We may not be able to retain our current executives and other key Team Members or attract and retain additional qualified executives and Team Members who may be needed in the future. We must also continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals. Our ability to maintain an adequate number of executive and other qualified Team Members is highly dependent on an attractive and competitive compensation and benefits package. In addition, less than one percent of our team members are represented by unions. If these team members were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown, or if the terms and conditions in labor agreements were renegotiated, we could experience a disruption in our operations and higher ongoing labor costs. If we fail or are unable to maintain competitive compensation, our customer service and execution levels could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation.

The stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions. Downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline. The market price of our stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts’ expectations. Failure to meet such expectations, even slightly, could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such a company. If similar litigation were instituted against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our attention and resources, which could have an adverse effect on our business.



Our level of indebtedness, a downgrade in our credit ratings or a deterioration in global credit markets could limit the cash flow available for operations and could adversely affect our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing.

Our level of indebtedness could restrict our operations and make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations. For example, our level of indebtedness could, among other things:

•

affect our liquidity by limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital;

•

limit our ability to obtain financing for capital expenditures and acquisitions or make any available financing more costly;

•

require us to dedicate all or a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt, which would reduce funds available for other business purposes, such as capital expenditures, dividends or acquisitions;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in the markets in which we compete;

•

place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors who may have less indebtedness;

•

render us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and

•

make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations.

The indenture governing our notes and credit agreement governing our credit facilities contain financial and other restrictive covenants. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt, including such notes.

In addition, our overall credit rating may be negatively impacted by deteriorating and uncertain credit markets or other factors that may or may not be within our control. The interest rates on our publicly issued debt and revolving credit facility are linked directly to our credit ratings. Accordingly, any negative impact on our credit ratings would likely result in higher interest rates and interest expense on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility or future issuances of public debt and less favorable terms on other operating and financing arrangements. In addition, it could reduce the attractiveness of certain vendor payment programs whereby third-party institutions finance arrangements to our vendors based on our credit rating, which could result in increased working capital requirements.

Conditions and events in the global credit market could have a material adverse effect on our access to short and long-term borrowings to finance our operations and the terms and cost of that debt. It is possible that one or more of the banks that provide us with financing under our revolving credit facility may fail to honor the terms of our existing credit facility or be financially unable to provide the unused credit as a result of significant deterioration in such bank’s financial condition. An inability to obtain sufficient financing at cost-effective rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Deterioration of general macro-economic conditions, including unemployment, inflation or deflation, consumer debt levels, high fuel and energy costs, could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows due to impacts on our suppliers, customers and operating costs.

Our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers’ ability and willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms. Many factors outside our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms. Such factors include a general decline in the economy and economic conditions and prolonged recessionary conditions. These events could negatively affect our suppliers’ operations and make it difficult for them to obtain the credit lines or loans necessary to finance their operations in the short-term or long-term and meet our product requirements. Financial or operational difficulties that some of our suppliers may face could also increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them. We might not be able to pass our increased costs onto our customers. If our suppliers fail to develop new products we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and our results of operations could be negatively affected.

In addition, the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the off-shoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers, and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices. We could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience bankruptcies, work stoppages, labor strikes, changes in foreign or domestic trade policies, or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them.



Deterioration in macro-economic conditions or an increase in fuel costs may have a negative impact on our customers’ net worth, financial resources and disposable income. This impact could reduce our customers’ willingness or ability to pay for accessories, maintenance or repair for their vehicles, which results in lower sales in our stores. An increase in fuel costs may also reduce the overall number of miles driven by our customers resulting in fewer parts failures and a reduced need for elective maintenance.

Rising energy prices could directly impact our operating and product costs, including our store, supply chain, Professional delivery, utility and product acquisition costs.

Because we are involved in litigation from time to time, and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations, we could incur substantial judgments, fines, legal fees and other costs.

We are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation, which may include class action litigation from customers, Team Members or others for various actions. From time to time, we are involved in litigation involving claims related to, among other things, breach of contract, tortious conduct, employment, labor discrimination, breach of laws or regulations (including The Americans With Disabilities Act), payment of wages, exposure to asbestos or potentially hazardous product, real estate and product defects. The damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial. Although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims, if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to, among other things, environmental protection, product quality and safety standards, building and zoning requirements, labor and employment, discrimination and income taxes. Compliance with existing and future laws and regulations could increase the cost of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations. If we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions, while incurring substantial legal fees and costs, as well as reputational risk. In addition, our capital and operating expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations.

We work diligently to maintain the privacy and security of our customer, supplier, Team Member and business information and the functioning of our computer systems, website and other on-line offerings. In the event of a security breach or other cyber security incident, we could experience adverse operational effects or interruptions and/or become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings, any of which could lead to damage to our reputation in the marketplace and substantial costs.

The nature of our business requires us to receive, retain and transmit certain personally identifiable information about our customers, suppliers and Team Members, some of which is entrusted to third-party service providers. While we have taken and continue to undertake significant steps to protect such personally identifiable information and other confidential information and to protect the functioning of our computer systems, website and other online offerings, a compromise of our data security systems or those of businesses we interact with could result in information related to our customers, suppliers, Team Members or business being obtained by unauthorized persons or adverse operational effects or interruptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We develop, maintain and update processes and systems in an effort to try to prevent this from occurring, but these actions are costly and require constant, ongoing attention as technologies change, privacy and information security regulations change, and efforts to overcome security measures by bad actors continue to become ever more sophisticated.

Despite our efforts, our security measures may be breached in the future due to a cyber-attack, computer malware and/or viruses, exploitation of hardware and software vulnerabilities, Team Member error, malfeasance, fraudulent inducement (including so-called “social engineering” attacks and “phishing” scams) or other acts. Unauthorized parties may in the future obtain access to our data or the data of our customers, suppliers or Team Members or may otherwise cause damage to or interfere with our equipment and/or network. Any breach, damage to or interference with our equipment or network, or unauthorized access in the future could result in significant legal and financial exposure and damage to our reputation that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. While we also seek to obtain assurances that others we interact with will protect confidential information, there is always the risk that the confidentiality or accessibility of data held or utilized by others may be compromised. If a compromise of our data security or function of our computer systems or website were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and possibly subject us to additional legal, regulatory and operating costs and damage our reputation in the marketplace.



Business interruptions may negatively impact our store hours, operability of our computer systems and the availability and cost of merchandise, which may adversely impact our sales and profitability.

Hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes or other natural disasters, war or acts of terrorism, or the threat of any of these calamities or others, may have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise to sell in our stores, result in certain of our stores being closed for an extended period of time, negatively affect the lives of our customers or Team Members, or otherwise negatively impact our operations. Some of our merchandise is imported from other countries. If imported goods become difficult or impossible to import into the United States due to business interruption (including regulation of exporting or importing), and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs and without an adverse delay, our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected.

In the event that commercial transportation, including the global shipping industry, is curtailed or substantially delayed, our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty receiving merchandise from our suppliers and/or transporting it to our stores.

Terrorist attacks, war in the Middle East, or insurrection involving any oil producing country could result in an abrupt increase in the price of crude oil, gasoline and diesel fuel. Such price increases would increase the cost of doing business for us and our suppliers, and also negatively impact our customers’ disposable income, causing an adverse impact on our business, sales, profit margins and results of operations.

We rely extensively on our computer systems and the systems of our business partners to manage inventory, process transactions and report results. These systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunication failures, computer viruses, security breaches and catastrophic events or occasional system breakdowns related to ordinary use or wear and tear. If our computer systems or those of our business partners fail we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to process transactions and manage inventory. Any such failure, including plans for disaster recovery, if widespread or extended, could adversely affect the operation of our business and our results of operations.

We may be affected by global climate change or by legal, regulatory, or market responses to such change.

The concern over climate change has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions (“GHG”). For example, proposals that would impose mandatory requirements related to GHG continue to be considered by policy makers in the United States and elsewhere. Laws enacted to reduce GHG that directly or indirectly affect our suppliers (through an increase in their cost of production) or our business (through an impact on our inventory availability, cost of sales, operations or demand for the products we sell) could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Changes in automotive technology and compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing laws, could require additional expenditures by us or our suppliers all of which could adversely impact the demand for our products and our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated historical financial statements and the notes to those statements that appear elsewhere in this report. Our discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth under the section entitled “Risk Factors” elsewhere in this report.

Management Overview

We generated diluted earnings per share (“diluted EPS”) of

$6.42

during


compared to

$6.20

for


. Comparable store sales were

down

2.0%

in


. The lower than expected sales performance was driven by the following factors:

•

Short-term disruptions resulting from our transformation actions taken in 2017;

•

Macroeconomic pressures on the automotive aftermarket industry; and

•

Weather-related impacts in our Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest and North Central markets.

The softness in the industry over the last year resulted from higher gas prices and a significantly lower number of new cars sold during 2008 and 2009 resulting in an abnormal trough of vehicles of that age and their typical parts, maintenance items and accessories needs. Our analysis shows that short-term volatility is not unusual in the industry. We have completed a number of transformation actions in 2017, including the restructuring and reduction in the number of Advance Auto Parts (“AAP”) and Carquest US (“CQUS”) store regions, implementation of improved pricing discipline in our stores and reduction in inventory. While we believe these actions are needed for the long term, there were some short-term disruption impacts during the third and fourth quarters of 2017. Despite stronger performance in our Western and Southern markets, we experienced softness in our cooling parts and chemicals category sales across many of our other markets as a result of the milder summer weather. Partially offsetting the softness in our AAP/CQUS business was the performance of certain aspects of our Professional and Canadian businesses, which grew their sales during the year, as well as an increased demand in the fourth quarter of 2017 resulting from more favorable winter weather.

Our operating profit margin reflects deliberate choices to invest in our business and improve productivity over the long term despite the sales softness. We believe these investments are necessary as we build a foundation for sustainable, long-term performance improvement.

When adjusted for the following non-operational items, our adjusted diluted earnings per share (“Adjusted EPS”) in

Business Update

We continue to make progress on the various elements of our strategic business plan, which is focused on improving the customer experience and driving consistent execution for both Professional and DIY customers. To achieve these improvements, we have undertaken planned transformation actions to help build a foundation for long-term success across the entire company. These transformation actions initiated during


include:

•

A continued roll-out of our common catalog across all four banners - Advance Auto Parts, Carquest, Worldpac and Autopart International. This expanded catalog leverages our enterprise-wide assortment to all of our customers and will be fully enabled through each banner’s point-of-sale system. This capability also provides the customer more flexibility in originating orders across banners.

•

Development of a demand-driven assortment, leveraging purchase history and look-ups from the common catalog, versus our existing push-down supply approach. This technology is a first step in moving from a supply-driven to a demand-driven assortment.

•

Progression in the early development of a more efficient end-to-end supply chain to deliver our broad assortment.

•

Expanded use of Telematics, a fleet management and tracking platform, that is critical for real-time fleet management and accurate measurement and management of customer order and delivery commitments.

•

Creation of new DIY omni-channel capabilities to reach our customers in the manner that is most desirable for them, including the launch of our enhanced website during the third quarter and eventual launch of a mobile app.

•

Entered into a strategic partnership with Interstate Batteries where Advance Auto Parts and Carquest stores will be the only retailer in the nation to carry a complete range of Interstate Batteries in store and online.

•

Acceleration of Worldpac branch openings to drive Professional growth while investing in online and digital to drive DIY improvements.

Industry Update

Operating within the automotive aftermarket industry, we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors, many of which are similar to those affecting the overall retail industry. These factors include, but are not limited to:

•

Fuel costs

•

Unemployment rates

•

Consumer confidence

•

Competition

•

Reduction in new car sales in 2008 and 2009

•

Miles driven

•

Vehicle manufacturer warranties

•

Increasing number of vehicles 11 years and older

•

Economic and political uncertainty

•

Deferral of elective automotive maintenance and improvements in new car quality

While these factors tend to fluctuate, we remain confident in the long-term growth prospects for the automotive parts industry.



Results of Operations

The following table sets forth certain of our operating data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated.


Compared to


Net Sales

Net sales for


were

$9,373.8 million

,

a decline

of

$193.9

million, or

2.0%

, from net sales in


. This

decrease

was primarily due to our comparable store sales

decline

of

2.0%

. During


, we consolidated


stores and closed


stores, which was partially offset by the opening of


new stores. Our

decline

in comparable store sales was driven by a decrease in overall transactions in


and mild summer weather conditions, which was partially offset by an increase in the average transaction value and favorable weather in the fourth quarter of the year that drove a stronger demand across the business.

Gross Profit

Gross profit for


was

$4,085.0

million, or

43.6%

of net sales, as compared to

$4,255.9

million, or

44.5%

of net sales, in


,

a decrease

of


basis points. The

decrease

in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of higher supply chain costs driven by unfavorable commodity prices and the negative impact related to the continued inventory optimization efforts, partially offset by continued material cost improvement.

SG&A

SG&A for


were

$3,514.8

million, or

37.5%

of net sales, as compared to

$3,468.3

million, or

36.3%

of net sales, for


,

an increase

of


basis points. This

increase

as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to costs incurred in connection with the continued transformation plan and higher customer facing costs including store labor and incentives and higher medical costs. Partially offsetting these costs were lower GPI integration, store closure and consolidation costs and expenses in


compared to the prior year and continued focus on expense management throughout the year.

Interest Expense

Interest expense for


was

$58.8

million, as compared to

$59.9

million in


. The

decrease

in interest expense was due to lower outstanding balances of our credit facilities during


, as compared to


.

Income Taxes

Income tax expense for


was

$44.8

million, as compared to

$279.2

million for


. Our effective income tax rate was

8.6%

and

37.8%

for


and


. The

decrease

in our effective tax rate for


compared to


is primarily due to a net

$143.8 million

benefit related to the Act. Refer to discussion in Note 12,

Income Taxes

, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further information relating to impact of the Act in


.




Compared to


Net Sales

Net sales for


were

$9,567.7 million

,

a decline

of

$169.3 million

, or

1.7%

, over net sales for


. This

decrease

was primarily due to our comparable store sales

decline

of

1.4%

and the portion of sales that did not transfer from stores that were consolidated. During


, we consolidated 159 stores and closed 23 stores, which was partially offset by the opening of 78 new stores. Our

decline

in comparable store sales was driven by a decline in overall transactions, partially offset by an increase in the average transaction value. While the number of comparable store transactions decreased from the comparable period in all four quarters of 2016, we saw improving trends in the second half of the year.

Our comparable store sales for the year were negatively impacted by challenges with product availability and service levels, particularly in our Northeast and Great Lakes markets. On a quarterly basis our comparable store sales decreased 1.9%, 4.1% and 1.0% in the first, second and third quarters of 2016 and increased 3.1% in the fourth quarter of 2016. We attribute the improvement in our comparable store sales in the last half of the year to our efforts to improve our focus on the customer, including sustained investments in availability, customer service and incentives for front line employees, as well as improved levels of execution throughout our supply chain. We also benefited in the fourth quarter of 2016 from the timing of the Christmas and New Years holidays.

Gross Profit

Gross profit for


was

$4,255.9 million

, or

44.5%

of net sales, as compared to

$4,422.8 million

, or

45.4%

of net sales, in


,

a decrease

of


basis points. The

decrease

in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of higher supply chain costs driven by significantly higher inventory levels in the first half of 2016 and disruption in our distributions centers located in our Northeast and Great Lakes markets resulting from changes in delivery frequency.

SG&A

SG&A for


was

$3,468.3

million, or

36.3%

of net sales, as compared to

$3,597.0

million, or

36.9%

of net sales, for


,

a decrease

of


basis points. This

decrease

as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to lower GPI integration, store closure and consolidation and support center restructuring costs in


compared to the prior year. Excluding these costs, SG&A

decrease

d


basis points as a percentage of sales compared to the prior year driven by lower administrative costs partially offset by higher customer facing costs, including store labor and incentives and inventory availability support costs.

Operating Income

Operating income for


was

$787.6 million

, representing

8.2%

of net sales, as compared to

$825.8 million

, or

8.5%

of net sales, for


,

a decrease

of


basis points. This

decrease

was due to a lower gross profit rate, partially offset by a decrease in our SG&A rate. These changes on a rate basis were due to the gross profit and SG&A drivers previously discussed.

Interest Expense

Interest expense for


was

$59.9 million

, as compared to

$65.4 million

in


. The

decrease

in interest expense was due to repayments made on our credit facility over the last year.

Income Taxes

Income tax expense for


was

$279.2 million

, as compared to

$279.5 million

for


. Our effective income tax rate was

37.8%

and

37.1%

for


and


. Our income tax rate in both


and


reflect favorable income tax settlements and statute of limitation expirations. The

increase

in our effective tax rate for


compared to


is primarily due to $7.8 million of settlements recorded in 2016 related to income tax audits of GPI for time periods prior to our acquisition of GPI. These settlements were largely recoverable under the escrow for indemnification claims in our purchase agreement with GPI and therefore recorded corresponding income of $7.3 million in Other Income, net.



Net Income

Net income was

$459.6 million

, or

$6.20

per diluted share, for


as compared to

$473.4 million

, or

$6.40

per diluted share, for


. As a percentage of net sales, net income for


was

4.8%

, as compared to

4.9%

for


. The

decrease

in diluted EPS was driven primarily by the decrease in net income.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”

includes certain financial measures not derived in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Non-GAAP financial measures should not be used as a substitute for GAAP financial measures, or considered in isolation, for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance, financial position or cash flows. We have presented these non-GAAP financial measures as we believe that the presentation of our financial results that exclude (1) non-operational expenses associated with the integration of GPI and store closure and consolidation costs; (2) non-cash charges related to the acquired GPI intangibles; (3) transformation expenses under our strategic business plan; and (4) nonrecurring impact of the Act, is useful and indicative of our base operations because the expenses vary from period to period in terms of size, nature and significance and/or relate to the integration of GPI and store closure and consolidation activity in excess of historical levels. These measures assist in comparing our current operating results with past periods and with the operational performance of other companies in our industry. The disclosure of these measures allows investors to evaluate our performance using the same measures management uses in developing internal budgets and forecasts and in evaluating management’s compensation. Included below is a description of the expenses we have determined are not normal, recurring cash operating expenses necessary to operate our business and the rationale for why providing these measures is useful to investors as a supplement to the GAAP measures.

GPI Integration Expenses

—We acquired GPI for $2.08 billion in 2014 and are in the midst of a multi-year plan to integrate the operations of GPI with AAP. This includes the integration of product brands and assortments, supply chain and information technology. The integration is being completed in phases and the nature and timing of expenses will vary from quarter to quarter over several years. The integration of product brands and assortments was primarily completed in 2015, which our focus then shifted to integrating the supply chain and information technology systems. Due to the size of the acquisition, we consider these expenses to be outside of our base business. Therefore, we believe providing additional information in the form of non-GAAP measures that exclude these costs is beneficial to the users of our financial statements in evaluating the operating performance of our base business and our sustainability once the integration is complete.

Store Closure and Consolidation Expenses

—Store closure and consolidation expenses consist of expenses associated with our plans to convert and consolidate the Carquest stores acquired from GPI. The conversion and consolidation of the Carquest stores is a multi-year process that began in 2014. As of December 30, 2017,


Carquest stores acquired from GPI had been consolidated into existing AAP stores and


stores had been converted to the AAP format. While periodic store closures are common, these closures represent a major program outside of our typical market evaluation process. We believe it is useful to provide additional non-GAAP measures that exclude these costs to provide investors greater comparability of our base business and core operating performance. We also continue to have store closures that occur as part of our normal market evaluation process and have not excluded the expenses associated with these store closures in computing our non-GAAP measures.

Transformation Expenses

—We expect to recognize a significant amount of transformation expenses over the next several years as we transition from integration of our AAP/CQUS businesses to a plan that involves a more holistic and integrated transformation of the entire Company across all four banners, including Worldpac and AI. These expenses will include, but not be limited to, restructuring costs, third-party professional services and other significant costs to integrate and streamline our operating structure across the enterprise. We focused our initial transformation efforts on our AAP/CQUS field structure in the second quarter and are reviewing other areas throughout the Company, such as supply chain and information technology.

U.S. Tax Reform

—On December 22, 2017, the Act was signed into law. The Act amends the Internal Revenue Code by, among other things, permanently lowering the corporate tax rate to 21% from the existing maximum rate of 35%, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a one-time repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. As a result of the reduction to the corporate tax rate, which is effective on January 1, 2018, the Company is required to re-value deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the reporting period of enactment. The Company also recorded an estimated charge to income tax expense for the nonrecurring repatriation tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and it is the Company’s intention to bring back the accumulated foreign earnings held as cash in the near term.



We have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the following table.

(1)

The adjustment to Other income for


relates to income recognized from an indemnification agreement associated with the acquisition of GPI.

(2)

The income tax impact of non-GAAP adjustments is calculated using the estimated tax rate in effect for the respective non-GAAP adjustments.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Overview

Our primary cash requirements necessary to maintain our current operations include payroll and benefits, inventory purchases, contractual obligations, capital expenditures, payment of income taxes and funding of initiatives under our strategic business plan. In addition, we may use available funds for acquisitions, to repay borrowings under our credit agreement, to periodically repurchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs and for the payment of quarterly cash dividends. Historically, we have funded these requirements primarily through cash generated from operations, supplemented by borrowings under our credit facilities and notes offerings as needed. We believe funds generated from our expected results of operations, available cash and cash equivalents, and available borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our primary obligations for the next year.

Capital Expenditures

Our primary capital requirements have been the funding of our new store development (leased and owned locations), maintenance of existing stores, and investments in supply chain and information technology. We lease approximately

84%

of our stores. Our capital expenditures were

$189.8

million in


,

a decrease

of

$69.8 million

from


. This

decrease

in capital expenditures was due to disciplined capital spending by the Company to focus on priority projects in an effort to optimize cash flow for 2017.

Our future capital requirements will depend in large part on the number and timing of new store development (leased and owned locations) within a given year and the investments we make in existing stores, information technology and supply chain network. In


, we anticipate that our capital expenditures related to such investments will be up to

$250

million, but may vary with business conditions.

. This net

decrease

in operating cash flow was primarily driven by a decrease in accounts payable, lower net income and the timing of payments within working capital, partially offset by the timing of income tax deductions. Our inventory balance as of

December 31, 2016

increased $151.1 million, or 3.6%, over the prior year driven mainly by the build-up of transitional inventory associated with our Carquest product and store integration and the opening of new locations, including a new Worldpac distribution center.

Long-Term Debt

For detailed information refer to Note 7,

Long-term Debt and Fair Value of Financial Instruments

, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.

As of

December 30, 2017

, we had a credit rating from Standard & Poor’s of BBB- and from Moody’s Investor Service of Baa2. The current outlooks by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s are both stable. The current pricing grid used to determine our borrowing rate under our revolving credit facility is based on our credit ratings. If these credit ratings decline, our interest rate on outstanding balances may increase and our access to additional financing on favorable terms may become more limited. In addition, it could reduce the attractiveness of certain vendor payment programs whereby third-party institutions finance arrangements to our vendors based on our credit rating, which could result in increased working capital requirements. Conversely, if these credit ratings improve, our interest rate may decrease.



Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements

As of

December 30, 2017

, other than as disclosed in Note 7,

Long-term Debt and Fair Value of Financial Instruments

, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, we had no other off-balance-sheet arrangements. We include other off-balance-sheet arrangements in our Contractual Obligations table including operating lease payments and interest payments on our Notes, revolving credit facility and letters of credit outstanding.

Contractual Obligations

In addition to our Notes and revolving credit facility, we utilize operating leases as another source of financing. The amounts payable under these operating leases are included in our Contractual Obligations table. Our future contractual obligations related to long-term debt, operating leases and other contractual obligations as of

December 30, 2017

were as follows:

(1)

Long-term debt represents the principal amount of our 2020 Notes, 2022 Notes and 2023 Notes, which become due in 2020, 2022 and 2023.

(2)

We lease certain store locations, distribution centers, office space, equipment and vehicles. Our property leases generally contain renewal and escalation clauses and other concessions. These provisions are considered in our calculation of our minimum lease payments that are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the applicable lease term. Any lease payments that are based upon an existing index or rate are included in our minimum lease payment calculations.

(3)

Includes the long-term portion of deferred income taxes and other liabilities, including self-insurance reserves for which no contractual payment schedule exists. As we expect the payments to occur beyond 12 months from

December 30, 2017

, the related balances have not been reflected in the “Payments Due by Period” section of the table.

(4)

Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Included in the table above is the lesser of the remaining obligation or the cancellation penalty under the agreement.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management. Our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information, historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.

The preparation of our financial statements included the following significant estimates and exercise of judgment.



Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

We evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment annually as of the first day of our fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible asset may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. Effective in the third quarter of 2017, the Company realigned its three geographic divisions, which included the operations of the stores operating under the Advance Auto Parts, Carquest and Autopart International trade names, into two U.S. geographic divisions. As a result of this realignment and change in the operating structure of its Carquest Independent and Carquest Canada businesses, the Company has increased its number of operating segments from four to five. As each operating segment represents a reporting unit, goodwill was reassigned to the affected reporting units using a relative fair value approach.

Our detailed impairment testing involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If a reporting unit’s fair value has historically significantly exceeded its carrying value, then a risk-based market approach of determining the reporting unit’s fair value is utilized. The Company uses a valuation specialist to determine the fair value for the remaining reporting units. If the fair value exceeds carrying value, we conclude that no goodwill impairment has occurred. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a second step is required to measure possible goodwill impairment loss.

Our indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of the Carquest and Worldpac brands acquired in the acquisition of GPI in 2014 and are tested for impairment at the asset group level. Indefinite-lived intangibles are evaluated by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. If the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows exceeds the carrying value, we conclude that no intangible asset impairment has occurred. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds the fair value, we recognize an impairment loss.

We complete our impairment evaluations by combining information from our internal valuation analyses, considering other publicly available market information and using an independent valuation firm. We determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. These types of analyses require management to make assumptions as a marketplace participant would and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies of our Company and our reporting units. These assumptions and estimates are a major component of the derived fair value of our reporting units. Critical assumptions include projected sales growth, gross profit rates, SG&A rates, working capital fluctuations, capital expenditures, discount rates, royalty rates and terminal growth rates. If actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material.

Inventory Reserves

Our inventory consists primarily of parts, batteries, accessories and other products used on vehicles that have reasonably long shelf lives. Although the risk of obsolescence is minimal, we consider whether we may have excess inventory based on our current approach for managing slower moving inventory. We establish reserves when the expected net proceeds are less than carrying value.

Future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory, changes in our inventory management approach for excess and obsolete inventory or failure by us to effectively manage the life cycle of our inventory could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves and result in a negative impact on our consolidated statement of operations. A 10% difference in actual inventory reserves at

December 30, 2017

would result in a change in expense of approximately $11.1 million for


.

Self-Insurance Reserves

Our self-insurance reserves consist of the estimated exposure for claims filed, claims incurred but not yet reported and projected future claims, and are established using actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry and our historical claims experience. Specific factors include, but are not limited to, assumptions about health care costs, the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness and the average size of claims. Generally, claims for automobile and general liability and workers’ compensation take several years to settle. We classify the portion of our self-insurance reserves that is not expected to be settled within one year in long-term liabilities.



While we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates, our self-insurance reserves and corresponding SG&A could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions. A 10% change in our self-insurance liabilities at

December 30, 2017

would result in a change in expense of approximately $15.3 million for


.

Vendor Incentives

We receive incentives in the form of reductions to amounts owed and/or payments from vendors related to volume rebates and other promotional considerations. Many of these incentives are under agreements with terms in excess of one year, while others are negotiated on an annual basis or less. Volume rebates and vendor promotional allowances not offsetting in SG&A are earned based on inventory purchases and initially recorded as a reduction to inventory. These deferred amounts are included as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventory is sold.

Vendor promotional allowances provided as a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote a vendor’s products are included as an offset to SG&A when the cost is incurred if the fair value of that benefit can be reasonably estimated. Certain of our vendor agreements contain purchase volume incentives that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met. Amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes.

Similarly, we recognize other promotional incentives earned under long-term agreements as a reduction to cost of sales. However, these incentives are recognized based on the cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated net purchases over the life of the agreement. Short-term incentives with terms less than one year are generally recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the duration of the agreements.

Amounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred revenue. Management’s estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within one year of the balance sheet date is included in Other current liabilities. Earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in Receivables, net except for that portion expected to be received after one year, which is included in Other assets, net. We regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure they are able to meet their obligations. Historically, the change in our reserve for receivables related to vendor funding has not been significant. A 10% difference in our vendor incentives deferred in inventory at

December 30, 2017

would result in a change in deferred incentives of approximately $17.9 million for


.

New Accounting Pronouncements

For a description of recently adopted and issued accounting standards, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements, see “

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements”

in Note 2,

Significant Accounting Policies,

of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks.

We are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our revolving credit facility as it is based, at our option, on adjusted LIBOR, plus a margin, or an alternate base rate, plus a margin. As of

December 30, 2017

and

December 31, 2016

, we had

no

borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility.

Our financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable and vendor receivables. We are exposed to normal credit risk from customers. Our concentration of credit risk is limited because our customer base consists of a large number of customers with relatively small balances, which allows the credit risk to be spread across a broad base. We have not historically had significant credit losses.

We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for the portion of the Company’s inventory purchases denominated in foreign currencies. We believe that the price volatility relating to foreign currency exchange rates is partially mitigated by our ability to adjust selling prices. During


and


, foreign currency transactions did not significantly impact net income.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Disclosure controls and procedures are our controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Internal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the override of controls. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only “reasonable assurance” with respect to the reliability of financial reporting and financial statement preparation and presentation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness may vary over time.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of

December 30, 2017

in accordance with Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13(a) - 15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, and effected by the Company’s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide “reasonable assurance” regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide “reasonable assurance” regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

As of

December 30, 2017

, management, including the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management has determined that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 30, 2017

is effective.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Advance and its wholly owned subsidiaries prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain amounts in the prior years’ Consolidated Balance Sheets and Statements of Changes in Stockholders’ Equity have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

Significant Accounting Policies:

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in banks and money market funds with original maturities of three months or less. Also included in cash equivalents are credit card and debit card receivables from banks, which generally settle in less than four business days.

Inventory

The Company’s inventory consists primarily of parts, batteries, accessories and other products used on vehicles that have reasonably long shelf lives and is stated at the lower of cost or market. The cost of the Company’s merchandise inventory is primarily determined using the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method. Under the LIFO method, the Company’s cost of sales reflects the costs of the most recently purchased inventories, while the inventory carrying balance represents the costs relating to prices paid in


and prior years. The Company regularly reviews inventory quantities on-hand, considers whether it may have excess inventory based on the Company’s current approach for managing slower moving inventory and adjusts the carrying value as necessary.

Vendor Incentives

The Company receives incentives in the form of reductions to amounts owed to and/or payments from vendors related to volume rebates and other promotional considerations. Many of these incentives are under long-term agreements in excess of one year, while others are negotiated on an annual basis or shorter. Advertising allowances provided as a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote a vendor’s products are included as an offset to selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) when the cost is incurred. Volume rebates and allowances that do not meet the requirements for offsetting in SG&A are recorded as a reduction to inventory as they are earned based on inventory purchases. Total deferred vendor incentives included as a reduction of Inventory were

$179.2 million

and

$211.1 million

as of

December 30, 2017

and

December 31, 2016

.

The Company recognizes other promotional incentives earned under long-term agreements not specifically related to volume of purchases as a reduction to cost of sales. However, these incentives are not deferred as a reduction of inventory and are recognized based on the cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated net purchases over the life of the agreement. Short-term incentives with terms less than one year are generally recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the duration of the agreements. Amounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged directly to expense when incurred; major improvements are capitalized. When items are sold or retired, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the account balances, with any gain or loss reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.

Depreciation of land improvements, buildings, furniture, fixtures and equipment, and vehicles is provided over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets using the straight-line method. Depreciation of building and leasehold improvements is provided over the shorter of the original useful lives of the respective assets or the term of the lease using the straight-line method.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

The Company performs its evaluation for the impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for its reporting units annually as of the first day of the fourth quarter, or when indications of potential impairment exist. These indicators would include a significant change in operating performance, the business climate, legal factors, competition, or a planned sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business, among other factors. The Company assesses qualitative factors such as current company performance and overall economic factors to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that the goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the step one quantitative goodwill impairment test. In the quantitative goodwill test, the Company compares the carrying value of a reporting unit to its fair value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value, a second step is performed, which compares the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value, to determine the amount of impairment. The Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at the asset group level. Indefinite-lived intangibles are evaluated by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. If the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows exceeds the carrying value, we conclude that no intangible asset impairment has occurred. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds the fair value, we recognize an impairment loss.

Effective in the third quarter of 2017, the Company realigned its three geographic divisions, which included the operations of the stores operating under the Advance Auto Parts, Carquest and Autopart International trade names, into two U.S. geographic divisions. As a result of this realignment and change in the operating structure of its Carquest Independent and Carquest Canada businesses, the Company has increased its number of operating segments from four to five, and defined them as “Northern Division,” “Southern Division,” “Carquest Canada,” “Independents” and “Worldpac.” As each operating segment represents a reporting unit, goodwill was reassigned to the affected reporting units using a relative fair value approach.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets

The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable and exceeds its fair value. When such an event occurs, the Company estimates the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the long-lived asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. These impairment evaluations involve estimates of asset useful lives and future cash flows. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset and the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. When an impairment loss is recognized, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its estimated fair value based on quoted market prices or other valuation techniques (e.g., discounted cash flow analysis).

Self-Insurance

The Company is self-insured for general and automobile liability, workers’ compensation and health care claims of its employees, or Team Members, while maintaining stop-loss coverage with third-party insurers to limit its total liability exposure. Expenses associated with these liabilities are calculated for (i) claims filed, (ii) claims incurred but not yet reported and (iii) projected future claims using actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry as well as the Company’s historical claims experience. The Company includes the current and long-term portions of its self-insurance reserves in Accrued expenses and Other long-term liabilities.

Warranty Liabilities

The warranty obligation on the majority of merchandise sold by the Company with a manufacturer’s warranty is the responsibility of the Company’s vendors. However, the Company has an obligation to provide customers replacement of certain merchandise at no cost or merchandise at a prorated cost if under a warranty and not covered by the manufacturer. Merchandise sold with warranty coverage by the Company primarily includes batteries, but may also include other parts such as brakes and shocks. The Company estimates its warranty obligation at the time of sale based on the historical return experience, sales level and cost of the respective product sold. To the extent vendors provide upfront allowances in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims and the allowance is in excess of the related warranty expense, the excess is recorded as a reduction to cost of sales.

Leases

The Company leases certain store locations, distribution centers, office spaces, equipment and vehicles. The total amount of minimum rent is expensed on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the lease unless external economic factors exist such that renewals are reasonably assured. In those instances, the renewal period would be included in the lease term for purposes of establishing an amortization period and determining if such lease qualified as a capital or operating lease. Differences between the calculated rent expense and cash payments are recorded as a liability within the Accrued expenses and Other long-term liabilities captions in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, based on the terms of the lease. Most leases require the Company pay taxes, maintenance, insurance and certain other expenses applicable to the leased premises. Management expects that in the normal course of business leases that expire will be renewed or replaced by other leases.

Fair Value Measurements

A three-level valuation hierarchy, based upon observable and unobservable inputs, is used for fair value measurements. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions based on the best evidence available. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy: Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations whose significant inputs are observable; and Level 3 - Instruments whose significant inputs are unobservable. Financial instruments are transferred in and/or out of Level 1, 2 or 3 at the beginning of the accounting period in which there is a change in the valuation inputs.

Closed Facility Liabilities and Exit Activities

The Company continually reviews the operating performance of its existing store locations and closes or relocates certain stores identified as underperforming. In addition, the Company is consolidating certain locations as part of its planned integration of General Parts International, Inc. (“GPI”). Expenses accrued pertaining to closed facility exit activities are included in the Company’s closed facility liabilities, within Accrued expenses and Other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and recognized in SG&A in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations at the time of facility closure. Closed facility liabilities include the present value of the remaining lease obligations and management’s estimate of future costs of insurance, property tax and common area maintenance expenses, reduced by the present value of estimated revenues from subleases and lease buyouts.

Employees receiving severance benefits as the result of a store closing or other restructuring activity are required to render service until they are terminated in order to receive benefits. Severance benefits are recognized over the related service period. Other restructuring costs, including costs to relocate employees, are recognized in the period in which the liability is incurred.

Share-Based Payments

The Company provides share-based compensation to its eligible Team Members and Board of Directors. The Company is required to exercise judgment and make estimates when determining the (i) fair value of each award granted and (ii) projected number of awards expected to vest. The Company calculates the fair value of all share-based awards at the date of grant and uses the straight-line method to amortize this fair value as compensation cost over the requisite service period.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue at the time the sale is made, at which time the Company’s walk-in customers take immediate possession of the merchandise or same-day delivery is made to the Company’s Professional delivery customers, which include certain independently owned store locations. For e-commerce sales, revenue is recognized either at the time of pick-up at one of the Company’s store locations or at the time of shipment depending on the customer’s order designation. Sales are recorded net of discounts, sales incentives and rebates, sales taxes and estimated returns and allowances. The Company estimates the reduction to sales and cost of sales for returns based on current sales levels and the Company’s historical return experience.

The following table summarizes financial information for each of the Company’s product groups.

Receivables, net consist primarily of receivables from Professional customers. The Company grants credit to certain Professional customers who meet the Company’s pre-established credit requirements. Accounts receivable is stated at net realizable value. The Company regularly reviews accounts receivable balances and maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company considers the following factors when determining if collection is reasonably assured: customer creditworthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic and industry trends and changes in customer payment terms. The Company controls credit risk through credit approvals, credit limits and accounts receivable and credit monitoring procedures.

Foreign Currency Translation

The assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates, and revenues, expenses and cash flows are translated at average exchange rates for the year. Resulting translation adjustments are reflected as a separate component in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Losses from foreign currency transactions, which are included in Other income, net, were

$4.0 million

during


and

$7.4 million

during


. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions were not significant in 2016.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income taxes reflect the net income tax effect of temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and for income tax reporting purposes. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period of the enactment date.

The Company recognizes tax benefits and/or tax liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires the Company to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as the Company must determine the probability of various possible outcomes.

The Company reevaluates these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis or when new information becomes available to management. The reevaluations are based on many factors, including but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, successfully settled issues under audit, expirations due to statutes of limitations and new federal or state audit activity. Any change in either the Company’s recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an increase to the tax accrual.

Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per share of common stock has been computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, which is reduced by stock held in treasury and shares of nonvested restricted stock units. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by including the effect of dilutive securities. Diluted earnings per share of common stock reflects the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding, outstanding deferred stock units and the impact of outstanding stock options and stock appreciation rights (collectively “share-based awards”). Share-based awards containing performance conditions are included in the dilution impact as those conditions are met.

Segment Information

Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. The Company’s CODM, the Chief Executive Officer, reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis, accompanied by information about the Company’s five operating segments, for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance.

For 2017 and 2016, the Company has one reportable segment as the five operating segments are aggregated due primarily to the economic and operational similarities of each operating segment as the stores and branches have similar characteristics, including the nature of the products and services, customer base and the methods used to distribute products and provide service to its customers.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2017-04, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment” to simplify the accounting for goodwill impairment. The guidance removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which required a hypothetical purchase price allocation. A goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted after January 1, 2017. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2017-04 in 2017 and applied the new guidance in completion of its annual goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2017.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, “Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting” aimed at simplifying certain aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions. The areas for simplification include the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The Company adopted ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of 2017 and recorded a cumulative net increase in stockholders’ equity of

$0.3 million

related to the Company’s election to record forfeitures as they occur. In addition, the Company elected to retrospectively adopt the provision regarding the presentation of excess tax benefits in the statement of cash flows, which resulted in an increase in our net cash provided by operating activities and a decrease in our net cash provided by financing activities of

$22.4 million

and

$13.0 million

for 2016 and 2015. The provision requiring the inclusion of excess tax benefits (deficits) as a component of the Provision for income taxes in the consolidated results of operations is being applied prospectively. The Company recorded excess tax benefits of

$2.3 million

as a reduction in Provision for income taxes during 2017.

Advance Auto Parts, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).” This ASU is a comprehensive new leases standard that amends various aspects of existing guidance for leases and requires additional disclosures about leasing arrangements. It will require lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for most leases, including those leases previously classified as operating leases under current GAAP. Topic 842 retains a distinction between finance leases and operating leases. The classification criteria for distinguishing between finance leases and operating leases are substantially similar to the classification criteria for distinguishing between capital leases and operating leases in the previous leases guidance. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those years; earlier adoption is permitted. The FASB issued an exposure draft to amend Topic 842 to provide entities with an additional transition method with which to adopt Topic 842. The proposed transition method would enable entities to apply the transition requirements in Topic 842 at the effective date of that Topic (rather than at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented as currently required) with the effects of initially applying Topic 842 recognized as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings in the period of adoption. Consequently, an entity’s reporting for the comparative periods presented in the year of adoption would continue to be in accordance with Topic 840, including the disclosure requirements of that Topic. Practical expedients are available for election as a package and if applied consistently to all leases.

The Company has selected its leasing software solution and is in the process of identifying changes to its business processes, systems and controls to support adoption of the new standard in 2019. The Company is evaluating the impact that the new standard will have on the consolidated financial statements. While the Company is unable to quantify the impact at this time, it expects the adoption of the new standard to result in a material increase in the assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements. At this time, the Company does not expect adoption of ASU 2016-02 to have a material impact on its consolidated statements of operations as the majority of its leases will remain operating in nature. As such, the expense recognition will be similar to previously required straight-line expense treatment.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” as modified by subsequently issued ASUs 2015-14, 2016-08, 2016-10, 2016-12 and 2016-20 (collectively, “Topic 606”). Topic 606 superseded existing revenue recognition standards with a single model. The revenue recognition principle in Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company plans to adopt Topic 606 in the first quarter of 2018 by applying the modified retrospective approach. Results for reporting periods beginning after December 30, 2017 will be presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for the prior period. Generally the Company’s performance obligations are satisfied the same day contracts with customers are initiated. As such, the adoption of the new standard will not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, business process, controls or systems. Additionally, we expect the impact of the adoption of the new standard to be immaterial to our net income on an ongoing basis.

2017 Store and Supply Chain Rationalization

During the fourth quarter 2017, the Board of Directors approved a plan to close certain underperforming stores and begin to rationalize the Company's supply chain costs as part of the Company’s strategy to transform the enterprise. The Company expects these actions will result in estimated charges of up to

$70 million

in 2018. These charges consist of

$35 million

related to the early termination of lease obligations,

$15 million

of inventory and supply chain asset impairment charges,

$15 million

Long-term Debt and Fair Value of Financial Instruments:

Long-term debt consists of the following:

Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities

The fair value of the Company’s senior unsecured notes was determined using Level 2 inputs based on quoted market prices. The Company believes the carrying value of its other long-term debt approximates fair value. The carrying amounts of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair values due to the relatively short-term nature of these instruments.

Bank Debt

On January 31, 2017, the Company entered into a new credit agreement that provides a

$1.0 billion

unsecured revolving credit facility (the “2017 Credit Agreement”) with Advance Stores, as Borrower, the lenders party thereto, and Bank of America, N.A., as the administrative agent and replaces a prior credit agreement entered into in 2013. The 2017 Credit Agreement provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit of

$200.0

million. The Company may request that the total revolving commitment be increased by an amount not exceeding

$250.0

million during the term of the 2017 Credit Agreement. Voluntary prepayments and voluntary reductions of the revolving loan balance, if any, are permitted in whole or in part, at the Company’s option, in minimum principal amounts as specified in the 2017 Credit Agreement. The 2017 Credit Agreement terminates in January 2022; however, the Company may request one or two one-year extensions of the termination date prior to the first or second anniversary of the closing date.

As of

December 30, 2017

, the Company had

no

outstanding borrowings under the revolver and borrowing availability was

$517.6

million based on the Company’s leverage ratio. As of

December 30, 2017

, the Company had letters of credit outstanding of

$111.7

million, which generally have a term of one year or less and primarily serve as collateral for the Company’s self-insurance policies.

Interest on any borrowings on the revolver will be based, at the Company’s option, on an adjusted LIBOR, plus a margin, or an alternate base rate, plus a margin. After an initial interest period, the Company may elect to convert a particular borrowing to a different type. The initial margins per annum for the revolving loan are

1.10%

for the adjusted LIBOR and

0.10%

for alternate base rate borrowings. A facility fee of

0.15%

per annum is charged on the total revolving facility commitment, payable quarterly in arrears. Under the terms of the 2017 Credit Agreement, the interest rate spread and facility fee are based on the Company’s credit rating. The interest rate spread ranges from

0.91%

to

1.50%

for adjusted LIBOR borrowings and

0.00%

to

0.50%

for alternate base rate borrowings.

The 2017 Credit Agreement contains customary covenants restricting the ability of: (a) Advance Stores and its subsidiaries to, among other things, (i) create, incur or assume additional debt (only with respect to subsidiaries of Advance Stores), (ii) incur liens, (iii) guarantee obligations, and (iv) change the nature of its business conducted by itself and its subsidiaries; (b) Advance, Advance Stores and their subsidiaries to, among other things (i) enter into certain hedging arrangements, (ii) enter into restrictive agreements limiting their ability to incur liens on any of their property or assets, pay distributions, repay loans, or guarantee indebtedness of their subsidiaries; and (c) Advance, among other things, to change the holding company status of Advance. Advance Stores is required to comply with financial covenants with respect to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum coverage ratio. The 2017 Credit Agreement also provides for customary events of default, including non-payment defaults, covenant defaults and cross-defaults of Advance Stores’ other material indebtedness. The Company was in compliance with its financial covenants with respect to the 2017 Credit Agreement as of

December 30, 2017

.

On January 31, 2018, the Company, entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Agreement dated as of January 31, 2017 (the “Amendment”), among Advance Stores, as Borrower, the lenders party thereto, and Bank of America, N.A., Administrative Agent. The Amendment: (i) provided for LIBOR replacement rates in the event that LIBOR is unavailable in the future; (ii) modified the definitions of the financial covenants (and the testing level relating thereto) with respect to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum coverage ratio that the Company is required to comply with; and (iii) extended the termination date of the 2017 Credit Agreement from January 31, 2022 until January 31, 2023. The Company has the option to make one additional written request of the lenders to extend the termination date then in effect for one additional year.

of the principal amount of

$300.0 million

and are due May 1, 2020 (the “2020 Notes” or collectively with the 2023 Notes and the 2022 Notes, “the Notes”). The 2020 Notes bear interest at a rate of

5.75%

per year payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year. Advance served as the issuer of the Notes with certain of Advance’s domestic subsidiaries currently serving as subsidiary guarantors. The terms of the Notes are governed by an indenture (as amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified, the “Indenture”) among the Company, the subsidiary guarantors from time to time party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee.

The Company may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time or from time to time, at the redemption price described in the Indenture. In addition, in the event of a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined in the Indenture for the Notes), the Company will be required to offer to repurchase the Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date. The Notes are currently fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on an unsubordinated and unsecured basis by each of the subsidiary guarantors. The Company will be permitted to release guarantees without the consent of holders of the Notes under the circumstances described in the Indenture: (i) upon the release of the guarantee of the Company’s other debt that resulted in the affected subsidiary becoming a guarantor of this debt; (ii) upon the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the stock or assets of the subsidiary guarantor; or (iii) upon the Company’s exercise of its legal or covenant defeasance option.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

The Indenture contains customary provisions for events of default including for: (i) failure to pay principal or interest when due and payable; (ii) failure to comply with covenants or agreements in the Indenture or the Notes and failure to cure or obtain a waiver of such default upon notice; (iii) a default under any debt for money borrowed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries that results in acceleration of the maturity of such debt, or failure to pay any such debt within any applicable grace period after final stated maturity, in an aggregate amount greater than

$25.0

million without such debt having been discharged or acceleration having been rescinded or annulled within 10 days after receipt by the Company of notice of the default by the Trustee or holders of not less than

25%

in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding; and (iv) events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization affecting the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. In the case of an event of default, the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest may be accelerated. The Indenture also contains covenants limiting the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur debt secured by liens and to enter into sale and lease-back transactions.

Income Taxes:

U.S. Tax Reform

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) was signed into law. The Act amends the Internal Revenue Code by, among other things, permanently lowering the corporate tax rate to

21%

from the existing maximum rate of

35%

, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Company is required to remeasure deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the reporting period of enactment. The remeasurement of the Company’s net deferred income tax liability resulted in a

$155.1 million

income tax benefit in 2017.

The Company recorded an estimated charge of

$11.3 million

to income tax expense primarily for the nonrecurring repatriation tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and it is the Company’s intention to bring back the accumulated foreign earnings held as cash in the near term. Prospectively, any future foreign earnings will be utilized to grow and support the Company’s foreign operations and will be treated as being indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. The estimated charge and the benefit from the remeasurement of the net deferred tax liability were recorded based on the Company's initial evaluation of the impact of the Act and are subject to change in 2018 as the Company continues to refine, analyze and update the underlying data, computations and assumptions used to prepare these provisional amounts during the measurement period.

$3.8

million and

$2.4

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

The Company’s Western Auto subsidiary, together with other defendants (including the Company and other of its subsidiaries), has been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging injury as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing products. The plaintiffs have alleged that certain products contained asbestos and were manufactured, distributed and/or sold by the various defendants. Many of the cases pending against the Company are in the early stages of litigation. While the damages claimed against the defendants in some of these proceedings are substantial, the Company believes many of these claims are at least partially covered by insurance and historically asbestos claims against the Company have been inconsistent in fact patterns alleged and immaterial. The Company does not believe the cases currently pending will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Benefit Plans:

401(k) Plan

The Company maintains a defined contribution benefit plan, which covers substantially all Team Members after one year of service and who have attained the age of 21.

Share-Based Compensation:

Overview

The Company grants share-based compensation awards to its Team Members and members of its Board of Directors as provided for under the Company’s 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“2014 LTIP”), which was approved by the Company’s shareholders on May 14, 2014. The Company currently grants share-based compensation in the form of stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and deferred stock units (“DSUs”). All remaining restricted shares, which were granted prior to the transition to RSUs in 2012, vested during 2015. The Company’s grants, which have three methods of measuring fair value, generally include a time-based service portion, a performance-based portion and a market-based portion, which collectively represent the target award.

At

December 30, 2017

, there were

5.0 million

shares of common stock available for future issuance under the 2014 LTIP based on management’s current estimate of the probable vesting outcome for performance-based awards. The Company issues new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options and SARs. Shares forfeited and shares withheld for payment of taxes due become available for reissuance and are included in availability. Availability also includes shares that became available for reissuance in connection with the exercise of SARs.

The fair value of each SAR granted was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:

(1)

The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturity interest rate having term consistent with the expected life of the award.

(2)

Expected volatility is determined using a blend of historical and implied volatility.

F-24


Advance Auto Parts, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

(3)

The expected life of the Company’s awards represents the estimated period of time until exercise and is based on historical experience of previously granted awards.

As no SARs were granted in 2017, the Black-Scholes model was not utilized and no assumptions were created.

For time-based and performance-based RSUs, the fair value of each award was determined based on the market price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant adjusted for expected dividends during the vesting period, as applicable.

The fair value of each market-based RSU was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The model uses multiple input variables that determined the probability of satisfying the market condition requirements as follows:

(1)

The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturity interest rate having term consistent with the vesting period of the award.

(2)

Expected volatility is determined based on historical volatility over a matching look-back period and is consistent with the correlation coefficients between the stock prices of the Company and its peer group.

Additionally, the Company estimated a liquidity discount of

9.29%

using the Chaffe Protective Put Method to adjust the fair value for the post-vest restrictions.

Time-Based Awards

The Company’s outstanding time-vested awards consist of SARs and RSUs. The SARs generally vest over a three-year period in equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date. The SARs granted are non-qualified, terminate on the seventh anniversary of the grant date and contain no post-vesting restrictions other than normal trading black-out periods prescribed by the Company’s corporate governance policies. The RSUs generally vest over a three-year period in equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date. During the vesting period, holders of RSUs are entitled to receive dividend equivalents, but are not entitled to voting rights.

The following table summarizes activity for time-vested SARs and RSUs in


:

. The fair value of time-based RSUs reflected in the table above and performance-based RSUs reflected in the table below is determined based on the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant.

The following table summarizes certain information concerning activity for time-vested SARs, RSUs and restricted shares:

There were no time-vested SARs granted in 2017 or 2015.

Performance-Based Awards

The Company’s outstanding performance-based awards consist of SARs and RSUs. Performance awards generally may vest following a three-year period subject to the Company’s achievement of certain financial goals as specified in the grant agreements. Depending on the Company’s results during the three-year performance period, the actual number of awards vesting at the end of the period generally ranges from 0% to 200% of the performance award. The performance RSUs generally do not have dividend equivalent rights and do not have voting rights until the shares are earned and issued following the applicable performance period. During 2016, the Company also granted broad-based incentive awards to store and field team members that will vest over a one-year service period based on the achievement of performance goals during 2016.

The number of performance-based awards outstanding is reflected in the following tables based on the number of awards that the Company believed were probable of vesting at

December 30, 2017

. Performance-based SARs and performance-based RSU’s granted during


are presented as grants in the table at their respective target levels. The change in units based on performance represents the change in the number of granted awards expected to vest based on the Company’s updated probability assessment as of

Market-Based Awards

The Company’s outstanding market-based awards consist of RSUs. Market-based RSU’s vesting depends on the Company’s relative total shareholder return among a designated group of peer companies during a three-year period and will be subject to a one-year holding period after vesting.

At the beginning of

Other Considerations

Total income tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense for


,


and


was

$15.3 million

,

$7.5 million

and

$13.6 million

.

As of

December 30, 2017

, there was

$44.3

million of unrecognized compensation expense related to all share-based awards that was expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of

1.8

years.

The Company modified selected awards for certain terminated employees during 2015 such that the employees would vest in awards that would have otherwise been forfeited, which resulted in incremental expense recognized in 2015 of

$6.6 million

. As four of these modified awards were cash settled in March 2016, they were accounted for as liability awards as of January 2, 2016. The value of the liability awards was insignificant as of January 2, 2016. No such modification occurred in 2017 or 2016.

Deferred Stock Units

The Company grants share-based awards annually to its Board of Directors in connection with its annual meeting of stockholders. These awards are granted in the form of DSUs as provided for in the Advance Auto Parts, Inc. Deferred Stock Unit Plan for Non-Employee Directors and Selected Executives (“DSU Plan”). Each DSU is equivalent to one share of common stock of the Company and will be distributed in common shares after the director’s service on the Board ends. DSUs granted in 2017 and 2016 vest over a one year service period, while DSUs granted in


were fully vested on the grant date. Additionally, the DSU Plan provides for the deferral of compensation earned in the form of (i) an annual retainer for directors, and (ii) wages for certain highly compensated Team Members of the Company. These DSUs are settled in common stock with the participants at a future date, or over a specified time period, as elected by the participants in accordance with the DSU Plan.

The Company granted


thousand DSUs in


. The weighted average fair value of DSUs granted during


,


and

$1.5 million

,

$0.9 million

and

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Company also offers an employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”). Under the ESPP, eligible Team Members may elect salary deferrals to purchase the Company’s common stock at a discount of 10% from its fair market value on the date of purchase. There are annual limitations on the amounts a Team Member may elect of either $25 thousand per Team Member or 10% of compensation, whichever is less. As of

December 30, 2017

, there were

1.0 million

shares available to be issued under the ESPP.
