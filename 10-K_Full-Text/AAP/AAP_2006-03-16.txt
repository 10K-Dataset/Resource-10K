FORWARD-LOOKING
            STATEMENTS

Certain
            statements in this report are "forward-looking statements" within the
            meaning of
            Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities
            Exchange Act of 1934, which are usually identified by the use of words
            such as
            "will," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "expects," "projects,"
            "forecasts," "plans," "intends," "should" or similar expressions. We
            intend
            those forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions
            for
            forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation
            Reform
            Act of 1995 and are included in this statement for purposes of complying
            with
            these safe harbor provisions.

These
            forward-looking statements reflect current views about our plans, strategies
            and
            prospects, which are based on the information currently available and
            on current
            assumptions.

Although
            we believe that our plans, intentions and expectations as reflected in
            or
            suggested by those forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can
            give no
            assurance that the plans, intentions or expectations will be achieved.
            Listed
            below and discussed elsewhere in this report are some important risks,
            uncertainties and contingencies which could cause our actual results,
            performance or achievements to be materially different from the forward-looking
            statements made in this report. These risks, uncertainties and contingencies
            include, but are not limited to, the following:

·

the implementation
                    of our business
                    strategies and goals;

                    our
                    business;

·

a decrease in demand
                    for our
                    products;

·

the occurrence of
                    natural
                    disasters and/or extended periods of inclement weather;

·

deterioration in
                    general economic
                    conditions;

·

our ability to attract
                    and retain
                    qualified team members;

·

integration
                      of acquisitions;

·

our relationships
                    with our
                    vendors;

·

our
                      involvement as a defendant in litigation or incurrence of judgments,
                      fines
                      or legal costs;

·

adherence to the
                    restrictions and
                    covenants imposed under our credit facility;

·

acts
                      of terrorism; and

·

other statements
                    that are not of
                    historical fact made throughout this report, including in the
                    sections
                    entitled “Business,” "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
                    Condition and Results of Operations" and "Risk
                    Factors."

We
            assume
            no obligations to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether
            as a
            result of new information, future events or otherwise. In evaluating
            forward-looking statements, you should consider these risks and uncertainties,
            together with the other risks described from time to time in our other
            reports
            and documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and
            you should
            not place undue reliance on those statements.

Business.

Unless
            the context otherwise requires, “Advance,” “we,” “us,” “our,” and similar terms
            refer to Advance Auto Parts, Inc., its predecessor, its subsidiaries
            and their
            respective operations. Our fiscal year consists of 52 or 53 weeks ending
            on the
            Saturday closest to December 31 of each year. Fiscal 2003 included 53
            weeks of
            operations. All other fiscal years presented included 52 weeks of
            operations.

Overview

We
            primarily operate within the United States automotive aftermarket industry,
            which includes replacement parts (excluding tires), accessories, maintenance
            items, batteries and automotive chemicals for cars and light trucks (pickup
            trucks, vans, minivans and sport utility vehicles).

We
            currently are the second largest specialty retailer of automotive parts,
            accessories and maintenance items to "do-it-yourself," or DIY, and
“do-it-for-me”, or DIFM, customers in the United States, based on store count
            and sales. Currently, we operate in one reportable segment.

We
            were
            formed in 1929 and operated as a retailer of general merchandise until
            the
            1980s. During the 1980s, we sharpened our focus to target sales of automotive
            parts and accessories to DIY customers. From the 1980s to the present,
            we have
            grown significantly as a result of strong comparable store sales growth,
            new
            store openings and strategic acquisitions, including our 1998 Western Auto
            Supply Company acquisition and our 2001 acquisition of Discount Auto
            Parts, or
            Discount. More recently in 2005, we acquired Autopart International,
            Inc., or
            AI, and substantially all the assets of Lappen Auto Supply.

In
            addition to our DIY business we also serve

DIFM

customers
            via sales to commercial accounts through our retail stores. Since

1996, we
            have aggressively expanded our sales to DIFM customers through our commercial
            delivery program.

Sales
            to
            DIFM customers represented approximately 22% of our sales in 2005 and
            consisted
            of sales to both walk-in commercial customers and sales delivered to
            our
            commercial customers’ places of business, including independent garages, service
            stations and auto dealers. At December 31, 2005, we had 2,254 stores
            with
            commercial delivery programs.

At
            December 31, 2005, we operated 2,810 stores within the United States,
            Puerto
            Rico and the Virgin Islands. We operated 2,774 stores throughout 40 states
            in
            the Northeastern, Southeastern and Midwestern regions of the United States.
            These stores operated under the “Advance Auto Parts” trade name except for
            certain stores in the state of Florida, which operated under the “Advance
            Discount Auto Parts” trade name, collectively referred to herein as AAP. Our
            stores offer a broad selection of brand name and proprietary automotive
            replacement parts, accessories and maintenance items for domestic and
            imported
            cars and light trucks, with no significant concentration in any specific
            area.
            In addition, we operated 36 stores under the “Western Auto” and “Advance Auto
            Parts” trade names, located primarily in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
            We
            also operated 62 stores operating under the “Autopart International” trade name,
            or AI stores, at December 31, 2005.

We
            also
            provide our customers online shopping and access to over 1 million stock
            keeping
            units, or SKUs. Our online site allows our customers to pick up merchandise
            at a
            conveniently located store or have their purchase shipped directly to
            their home
            or business.

Our
            Internet address is

            We make
            available free of charge through our Internet website our annual reports
            on Form
            10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and
            amendments
            to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to the Securities Act of
            1934 as

Competitive
            Strengths

We
            believe our competitive strengths include the following:

Leading
            Market Position.

We
            compete in both the DIY and DIFM categories of the automotive
            aftermarket

                of Contents

industry.
            Our primary competitors include national and regional retail automotive
            parts
            chains, wholesalers or jobber stores, independent operators, automobile
            dealers
            that supply parts, discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry
            automotive
            products. Although the number of competitors and level of competition
            vary by
            market, both the DIY and DIFM categories are highly fragmented and generally
            very competitive. We believe we have strong brand recognition and customer
            traffic in our stores as a result of our significant marketing activities.
            In
            addition, we have purchasing, distribution, marketing and advertising
            efficiencies due to our economies of scale.

Industry
            Leading Selection of Quality Products.

As
            the number of automotive replacement parts has proliferated, we believe
            our
            broad inventory selection allows us to meet our DIY customers' demands.
            We
            believe this has created a strong competitive advantage for specialty
            automotive
            parts retailers that, like us, have the distribution capacity, sophisticated
            information systems and knowledgeable sales staff needed to offer a broad
            inventory selection to DIY customers. We offer one of the largest selections
            of
            brand name and proprietary automotive parts, accessories and maintenance
            items
            in the automotive aftermarket industry. Our Advance Auto Parts stores,
            or AAP
            stores, carry between 16,000 and 28,000 in-store SKUs. We also offer
            approximately 100,000 additional SKUs that are available on a same-day
            or
            overnight basis through our PDQ

®

and
            our
            Master PDQ

®

distribution systems, including harder-to-find replacement parts.

Superior
            Customer Service

.
            We
            believe our customers place significant value on our well-trained store
            teams,
            who offer knowledgeable assistance in product selection and installation,
            and
            this differentiates us from mass merchandisers. We invest substantial
            resources
            in the recruiting and training of our employees, who we refer to as team
            members. Such resources include formal classroom workshops, online seminars,
            Automotive Service Excellence(TM) certification and an increased focus

            bilingual language skills to build technical, managerial and customer
            service
            skills. In addition, we have a performance management process that aligns
            each

Experienced
            Management Team with Proven Track Record.

The
            20 members of our senior management team have an average of nine years
            of
            experience with us and 13 years in the automotive aftermarket industry,
            and have
            successfully grown our Company to become the second largest specialty
            retailer
            of automotive products in the United States. Our management team has
            accomplished this using a disciplined strategy of growing comparable
            store
            sales, opening new stores, increasing the penetration of our commercial
            delivery
            program and making acquisitions.

Growth
            Strategy

Our
            growth strategies consist of the following:

Increase
            Our Average Sales per Store

.
            Our
            average sales per AAP store rose to more than $1.5 million during 2005,
            which is
            one of the highest among our major competitors. We continue to be among
            the
            industry leaders in comparable store sales growth, averaging 5.9% annually
            over
            the last five years. We plan to increase our average sales per store
            by, among
            other things: (1) improving store execution towards “best in class” in
            automotive aftermarket retail; (2) execution of our category management
            program;
            (3) continued maturation of our sales initiatives for our DIY customers
            including local purchase ordering, factory direct ordering, salvage body
            parts
            and our custom mix (store specific merchandise assortment); (4) the
            implementation of our 2010 store remodeling program, with now more than
            50% of
            our chain remodeled and targeting a total of 200 to 225 AAP stores to
            be
            remodeled annually; (5) consistent growth and execution of our commercial
            plans;
            (6) enhanced national advertising and (7) focus on making our supply
            chain more
            responsive and improving our in-stock position.

Continue
            to Expand Our Operating Margins.

In
            addition to driving operating margin expansion through increased average
            sales
            per store and continued strong comparable store sales growth, we will
            continue
            to focus on increasing margins by: (1) improving our purchasing
            efficiencies with vendors; (2) utilizing our supply chain infrastructure
            and
            existing distribution network to optimize our inventory mix and maximize
            distribution capacity; (3) leveraging our overall scale to reduce other
            operating expenses as a percentage of sales and (4) continuing to


Table
                of Contents

implement
            our category management and custom mix initiatives, including the expansion
            of
            our private label and proprietary brands in our AAP stores.

Generate
            Strong Free Cash Flow.

We
            have
            generated strong free cash flow over the last five years. Our strategy
            is to
            invest back into our business through our key initiatives for increasing
            sales
            per store and operating margins. We look to deploy additional cash in
            the most
            optimal way to increase shareholder value, which has included stock repurchases
            and  acquisitions and as recently announced, the opportunity for cash
            dividends.

Increase
            Return on Invested Capital.

We
            believe we can successfully continue to increase our return on invested
            capital
            by generating strong comparable store sales growth and increasing our
            margins.
            We believe we can also increase our return on invested capital by leveraging
            our
            supply chain initiatives to increase sales faster than inventory growth
            and
            selectively expanding our store base primarily in existing markets. Based
            on our
            experience, such in-market openings provide higher returns on our invested
            capital by enabling us to leverage our distribution infrastructure, marketing
            expenditures and local management resources. We intend to open at least
            170 to
            180 AAP stores primarily in existing markets in 2006.

Industry

The
            United States automotive aftermarket industry is generally grouped into
            two
            major categories: DIY and DIFM. According to the Automotive Aftermarket
            Industry
            Association, or AAIA

®

,
            Aftermarket Factbook, from 2000 to 2004, the DIY category grew at a 4.5%
            compound annual growth rate from $28.9 billion to $34.5 billion. This
            category represents sales to consumers who maintain and repair vehicles
            themselves. We believe this category is characterized by stable, more
            recession-resistant demand than most retailers because of the need-based
            characteristics of the DIY category. Additionally, in difficult economic
            times,
            we believe people tend to drive more and use air travel less. We also
            believe
            difficult economic times result in people retaining their vehicles longer,
            which
            moves these vehicles in the range of years in age when more repairs are
            needed.
            Alternatively, in an improving economy, we believe the need-based
            characteristics of our DIY customers still exist, and they are more inclined
            to
            complete preventative maintenance than to defer these activities. From
            2000 to
            2004, the DIFM category grew at a 5% compound annual growth rate, from
            $62.2
            billion to $75.5 billion according to the AAIA Aftermarket Factbook. This
            category represents sales to professional installers, such as independent
            garages, service stations and auto dealers. DIFM parts and services are
            typically offered to vehicle owners who are less inclined to repair their
            own
            vehicles.

We
            believe the United States automotive aftermarket industry will continue
            to
            benefit from several favorable trends, including the:

·

increasing number
                    and age of
                    vehicles in the United States, increasing number of miles driven
                    annually,
                    and increasing number of cars coming off of warranty, particularly
                    previously leased vehicles;

·

higher cost of replacement
                    parts
                    as a result of technological changes in recent models of vehicles
                    and
                    increasing number of light trucks and sport utility vehicles
                    that require
                    more expensive parts, resulting in higher average sales per
                    customer;

·

continued consolidation
                    of
                    automotive aftermarket retailers;

·

move
                      to higher priced premium parts, which offer enhanced features,
                      benefits
                      and/or warranties; and

·

market
                      share growth opportunities for specialty retailers relative
                      to other
                      channels selling similar
                      merchandise.

We
            believe these trends will continue to support strong comparable store
            sales
            growth in the industry.

Autopart
            International

We
            completed the acquisition of AI in September 2005. The acquisition, which
            included 61 stores throughout New England and New York, a distribution
            center
            and AI’s wholesale distribution business, will complement our growing presence
            in the DIFM market in the Northeast. In 2005, AI generated annual sales
            of
            approximately $102 million, of which we have reflected $30.3 million
            in our
            consolidated revenues subsequent to the acquisition.

Our
            retail stores are 100% company operated and are divided into geographic
            areas. A
            senior vice president, who is supported by four to five regional vice
            presidents, manages each area of retail stores. Division managers report
            to the
            regional vice presidents and have direct responsibility for store operations
            in
            a specific division, which typically consists of 10 to 15 stores. Depending
            on
            store size and sales volume, each store is staffed by 10 to 20 team members
            under the leadership of a store manager. Our stores generally are open
            from 7:30

            store level operations with our management planning and training and
            customer
            contact systems from our centralized store support center. These systems
            are
            integrated tightly and together provide real-time, comprehensive information
            to
            store and merchandising personnel, resulting in improved customer service
            levels, team member productivity and in-stock availability.

Point-of-Sale

.
            Our POS
            system, or APAL, is in all of our stores operating under the “Advance Auto
            Parts”, "Advance Discount Auto Parts” and “Western Auto” trade names. APAL is
            used to formulate pricing, marketing and merchandising strategies and
            to
            replenish inventory accurately and rapidly. APAL is designed to improve
            customer
            checkout time and decrease the time required to train newly hired team
            members.
            In addition, APAL provides additional customer purchase history, which
            may be
            used for customer demographic analysis.

Electronic
            Parts Catalog

.
            Our
            enhanced EPC system, which is fully integrated with APAL, is a software
            system
            that enables our store team members to identify over 33 million application
            uses
            for automotive parts and accessories. The EPC system enables store team
            members
            to assist our customers in their parts selection and ordering based on
            year,
            make, model and engine type of their vehicles. Our centrally based EPC
            data
            management system enables us to reduce the time needed to exchange data
            with our
            vendors and ultimately catalog and deliver updated, accurate product
            information. If a hard-to-find part or accessory is not available at
            one of our
            stores, the EPC system can determine whether the part is carried and
            in-stock
            through our PDQ® system. Available parts and accessories are then ordered
            electronically with immediate confirmation of price, availability and
            estimated
            delivery time.

Our
            EPC
            system also contains enhanced search engines and more user-friendly navigation
            tools that enhance our team members’ ability to look up any needed parts as well
            as additional products the customer needs to complete their automotive
            repair
            project. While we believe this generally leads to an increase in average
            sales
            per transaction, we believe these components will enhance our customers’
shopping experience with us and help them accurately complete the repair
            job the
            first time, saving them time and money. Additionally, information about
            a
            customer's automobile can be entered into a permanent customer database
            that can
            be accessed immediately whenever the customer visits or telephones one
            of our
            stores.

Store
            Level Inventory Management System

.
            Our
            store-level inventory management system provides real-time inventory
            tracking at
            the store level. With the store-level system, store team members can
            check the
            quantity of on-hand inventory for any SKU, adjust stock levels for select
            items
            for store specific events, automatically process returns and defective
            merchandise, designate SKU’s for cycle counts and track merchandise transfers.
            Our

stores
            use radio frequency hand-held devices to help ensure the accuracy of
            our
            inventory.

Store
            Intranet.

Our
            STORENET system delivers product information, electronic manuals, forms,
            store
            operating results, in-store training opportunities and internal communications
            to all store team members.

Commercial
            Sales

In
            addition to the customer service provided by our store operations team,
            we also
            maintain a commercial sales team dedicated to the development of our
            commercial
            business and the support of our DIFM customers. A vice president of commercial
            support leads a team dedicated to supporting the commercial sales team
            in the
            field. Each of our four area senior vice presidents has a director of
            commercial
            sales that concentrates solely on strategic and tactical commercial sales
            growth
            opportunities. Each director leads four to five regional commercial sales
            mangers. Division commercial sales managers report directly to our regional
            commercial sales managers and, similar to our retail division managers,
            they are
            directly responsible for commercial operations in each division. We target
            the
            DIFM customer through our commercial marketing efforts in all our retail
            stores,
            including those that do not offer a delivery service.

Merchandising

Virtually
            all of our merchandise is selected and purchased for our stores by personnel
            at
            our corporate offices, or store support center, in Roanoke, Virginia.
            In 2005,
            we purchased merchandise from over 400 vendors, with no single vendor
            accounting
            for more than 6% of purchases. Our purchasing strategy involves negotiating
            multi-year agreements with certain vendors, which allows us to achieve
            more
            favorable terms and pricing.

Our
            merchandising team is currently led by a group of seven senior professionals,
            who have an average of 17 years of automotive purchasing experience and
            over 24
            years in retail. The merchandising team is skilled in sourcing products
            globally
            and maintaining high quality levels. The merchandising team has developed
            strong
            vendor relationships in the industry and, in a collaborative effort with
            our
            vendor partners, utilizes a highly effective category management process.
            We
            believe this process, which develops a customer focused business plan
            for each
            merchandise category, improves comparable store sales, gross margin and
            inventory turns.

Our
            merchandising strategy is to carry a broad selection of high quality
            brand name
            automotive parts and accessories such as Castrol

®

,
            STP

®

,
            Monroe

®

,
            Bendix

®

,
            Purolator

®

and
            Trico

®

,
            which
            generates DIY customer traffic and also appeals to commercial customers.
            In
            addition to these branded products, we stock a wide selection of high
            quality
            proprietary products that appeal to value conscious customers. Sales
            of
            replacement parts account for a majority of our net sales and typically
            generate
            higher gross margins than maintenance items or general accessories. We
            customize
            our replacement part mix based on a merchandising program designed to
            optimize
            inventory mix at each individual store. The custom assortment is based
            on that
            store's historical and projected sales mix coupled with regionally specific
            customer needs.

Supply
            Chain

Our
            supply chain consists of centralized inventory management and transportation
            functions which support a logistics network of distribution centers,
            PDQ

®

warehouses and stores. Our inventory management team utilizes a replenishment
            system, E-3 Trim, to monitor the distribution center, PDQ

®

warehouse and store inventory levels and order additional product when
            appropriate while streamlining costs associated with the handling of
            that
            product. The system provides inventory movement forecasting based upon
            history,
            sales trends by SKU, seasonality and demographic shifts in demand. E-3
            Trim
            combines these factors with service level goals, vendor lead times and
            cost of
            inventory assumptions to determine the timing and size of purchase orders.
            A
            significant portion of our purchase orders are sent via electronic data
            interchange, with the remainder being sent by computer generated e-mail
            or
            facsimile.

                of Contents

Our
            transportation team utilizes a transportation management system for efficiently
            managing incoming shipments to the distribution centers and stores. Benefits
            from this system include reduced vendor to distribution center freight
            costs,
            visibility of purchase orders and shipments for the entire supply chain,
            a
            reduction in distribution center inventory, or safety stock, due to consistent
            transit times, decreased third party freight and billing service costs,
            decreased distribution center to store freight costs and higher store
            in-stock
            position.

We
            currently operate eight distribution centers. Our most recently opened
            Pennsylvania facility began servicing our expanding store base in the
            Northeast
            in April 2005. All of these distribution centers are equipped with our
            distribution management system, or DCMS. Our DCMS provides real-time
            inventory
            tracking through the processes of receiving, picking, shipping and replenishing
            at our distribution centers. The DCMS, integrated with technologically
            advanced
            material handling equipment, significantly reduces warehouse and distribution
            costs, while improving efficiency. This equipment includes carousels,
“pick-to
            light” systems, robotic picking, radio frequency technology and automated
            sorting systems. Through the continued implementation of our supply chain
            initiatives we expect to further increase the efficient utilization of
            our
            distribution capacity. We believe our current capacity will allow us
            to support
            in excess of 3,800 stores.

We
            currently offer over 40,000 SKUs to substantially support all of our
            retail
            stores via our 16 stand-alone PDQ® warehouses and/or our eight distribution
            centers (all of which stock PDQ

®

items).
            Stores have visibility to inventory in their respective facilities and
            can place
            orders to these facilities, or as an alternative, through an online ordering
            system to virtually any of the other facilities. Ordered parts are delivered
            to
            substantially all stores on a same day or next day basis through our
            dedicated
            PDQ

®

trucking
            fleet and partner carriers. In addition, we operate a PDQ

®

warehouse that stocks approximately 60,000 SKUs of harder to find automotive
            parts and accessories. This facility is known as the "Master PDQ

®

"
            warehouse and utilizes existing PDQ

®

distribution infrastructure and/or third party arrangements to provide
            next day
            service to substantially all of our stores.

Advertising

We
            have
            an extensive advertising program designed to communicate our merchandise
            offerings, product assortment, competitive prices, free services (battery
            testing and installation, electrical system testing, wiper replacement
            and oil
            recycling) and commitment to customer service. The program is focused
            on
            establishing Advance Auto Parts as the solution for a customer's automotive
            needs. We utilize a mix of media that reinforces our brand image, including
            television, radio, print, promotional signage and outdoor media, plus
            our
            proprietary in-store television network and internet site.

Our
            advertising plan is a brand-building program built around television
            and radio
            advertising. The plan is supported by print and in-store signage. Our
            television
            advertising is a combination of national and regional media in both sports
            and
            entertainment programming. Radio advertising, which is used as a supplementary
            medium, generally airs during peak drive times. We also sponsor sporting
            events,
            racing teams and other events at all levels in a grass-roots effort to
            positively impact individual communities, including Hispanic and other
            ethnic
            communities, to create awareness and drive traffic for our stores.

Since
            early 2003, we supported our new advertising campaign, “We’re ready in Advance”
throughout all of our media. We believe this advertising campaign differentiates
            Advance Auto Parts in the customer’s mind by positioning us as both a source for
            brand name auto parts at low prices and as a resource for expert advice
            and
            useful tips to help customers keep their vehicles running smoothly. The
            campaign
            includes creative and compelling television and radio commercials designed
            to
            drive sales and build an enduring, positive image of Advance Auto Parts
            as a
            special place to shop.

Since
            2004, we have built upon the campaign through an integrated consumer
            education
            program. This program is intended to build our image as not only the
            source for
            product, but also the best resource for vehicle maintenance information.
            Our
            free brochure kiosk displaying "We're ready with answers" and our free
            monthly
            video clinic broadcasts on Advance TV, our exclusive in-store how-to
            network,
            are just two elements of this growing program. We believe we will differentiate
            our stores from our competitors' by providing our customers valuable
            information
            regarding "why-to" and "how-to" perform regular maintenance on their
            vehicles,
            in order to enhance their vehicles' performance, reliability, safety
            and
            appearance. Our goal with this initiative is to continue our long-term
            brand
            building success, increase customer loyalty and expand our customer
            base.

Team
            Members

At
            March
            6, 2006, we employed 24,109 full-time team members and 18,318 part-time
            team
            members. Our workforce consisted of 86.2% team members employed in store-level
            operations, 9.6% employed in distribution and 4.2% employed in our corporate
            offices in Roanoke, Virginia. We have never experienced any labor disruption
            and
            are not party to any collective bargaining agreements. We believe that
            our team
            member relations are good.

We
            allocate substantial resources to the recruiting, training and retention
            of team
            members. Our performance management process allows us to align each team
            member’s goals with our corporate strategic goals. We believe this program
            provides us with a well-trained, productive workforce that is committed
            to high
            levels of customer service and assures a qualified team to support future
            growth.

Trade
            Names, Service Marks and Trademarks

We
            own a
            number of trade names and own and have federally registered several service
            marks and trademarks, including “Advance Auto Parts,” “Western Auto,” “Parts
            America,” “Autopart International” and “PDQ” for use in connection with the
            automotive parts retailing business. In addition, we own and have registered
            a
            number of trademarks for our proprietary products. We believe that these
            trade
            names, service marks and trademarks are important to our merchandising
            strategy.
            We do not know of any infringing uses that would materially affect the
            use of
            these trade names and marks, and we actively defend and enforce
            them.

Competition

Our
            primary competitors are both national and regional retail chains of automotive
            parts stores, including AutoZone, Inc., O'Reilly Automotive, Inc., CSK
            Auto
            Corporation and The Pep Boys-Manny, Moe & Jack, wholesalers or jobber
            stores, including those associated with national parts distributors or
            associations, such as NAPA and Carquest, independent operators, automobile
            dealers that supply parts, discount stores and mass merchandisers that
            carry
            automotive products. We believe that chains of automotive parts stores
            that,
            like us, have multiple locations in one or more markets, have competitive
            advantages in customer service, marketing, inventory selection, purchasing
            and
            distribution as compared to independent retailers and jobbers that are
            not part
            of a chain or associated with other retailers or jobbers. The principal
            competitive factors that affect our business include availability, store
            location, customer service and product offerings, quality and price.

Environmental
            Matters

We
            are
            subject to various federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations
            relating to the operation of our business, including those governing
            recycling
            of batteries and used lubricants, and regarding ownership and operation
            of real
            property. We handle hazardous materials as part of our operations, and
            our
            customers may also use hazardous materials on our properties or bring
            hazardous
            materials or used oil onto our properties. We currently provide collection
            and
            recycling programs for used automotive batteries and used lubricants
            at all of
            our stores as a service to our customers under agreements with third
            party
            vendors. Pursuant to these agreements, used batteries and lubricants
            are
            collected by our team members, deposited into vendor supplied containers
            or
            pallets and stored by us until collected by the third party vendors for
            recycling or proper disposal. Persons who arrange for the disposal, treatment
            or
            other handling of hazardous or toxic substances may be liable for the
            costs of
            removal or remediation at any affected disposal, treatment or other site
            affected by such substances.

We
            own
            and lease real property. Under various environmental laws and regulations,
            a
            current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable
            for the
            cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under
            or in
            such property. These laws often impose joint and several liability and
            may be
            imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was
            responsible for, the release of such hazardous or toxic substances. Other
            environmental laws and common law principles also could be used to impose
            liability for releases of hazardous materials into the environment or
            work
            place, and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of
            real
            properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure
            to
            released hazardous substances. From time to time, we receive notices
            from the
            Environmental Protection Agency and state environmental authorities indicating
            that there may be contamination on properties we own, lease or operate
            or
            may

            adjacent properties for which we may be responsible. Compliance with
            these laws
            and regulations has not had a material impact on our operations to date.

Item
            1A. Risk Factors.

Risks
            Relating to Our Business

We
            may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy, including
            increasing comparable store sales, enhancing our margins and increasing
            our
            return on invested capital, which could adversely affect our business,
            financial
            condition and results of operations.

We
            have
            implemented numerous initiatives to increase comparable store sales,
            enhance our
            margins and increase our return on invested capital in order to increase
            our
            earnings and cash flow. If these initiatives are unsuccessful, or if
            we are
            unable to implement the initiatives efficiently and effectively, our
            business,
            financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Successful
            implementation of our business strategy also depends on factors specific
            to the
            retail automotive parts industry and numerous other factors that may
            be beyond
            our control. Adverse changes in the following factors could undermine
            our
            business strategy:

·

general economic
                      conditions and
                      conditions in our local markets, which could reduce our
                      sales;

·

the competitive
                      environment in the
                      automotive aftermarket parts and accessories retail sector
                      that may force
                      us to reduce prices or increase spending;

·

the
                        automotive aftermarket parts manufacturing industry, such
                        as
                        consolidation, which may disrupt or sever one or more of
                        our vendor
                        relationships;

·

our ability to
                      anticipate and meet
                      changes in consumer preferences for automotive products, accessories
                      and
                      services in a timely manner; and

·

our continued ability
                      to hire and
                      retain qualified personnel, which depends in part on the types
                      of
                      recruiting, training and benefit programs we adopt or
                      maintain.

We
            will not be able to expand our business if our growth strategy is not
            successful.

We
            have
            increased our store count significantly from 1,567 stores at the end
            of 1998 to
            2,872 stores at December 31, 2005. We intend to continue to expand our
            base of
            stores as part of our growth strategy, primarily by opening new stores.
            There
            can be no assurance that the implementation of this strategy will be
            successful.
            The actual number of new stores to be opened and their success will depend
            on a
            number of factors, including, among other things:

·

our
                          ability to manage the expansion and hire, train and retain
                          qualified sales
                          associates;

·

the availability
                        of potential
                        store locations in highly visible, well-trafficked areas;
                        and

·

the
                          negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new
                          locations.

There
            can
            be no assurance that we will be able to open and operate new stores on
            a timely
            or sufficiently profitable basis or that opening new stores in markets
            we
            already serve will not harm existing store profitability or comparable
            store
            sales. The newly opened and existing stores' profitability will depend
            on our
            ability to properly merchandise, market and price the products required
            in their
            respective markets.

Furthermore,
            we may acquire stores or businesses from, make investments in, or enter
            into
            strategic alliances with, companies that have stores or distribution
            networks in
            our current markets or in areas into which we intend to expand our presence.
            Any
            future acquisitions, investments, strategic alliances or related efforts
            will be
            accompanied by risks, including:

·

the difficulty
                        of identifying
                        appropriate strategic partners or acquisition
                        candidates;

·

the difficulty
                        of assimilating and
                        integrating the operations of the respective entities;

·

the potential
                        disruption to our
                        ongoing business and diversion of our management's
                        attention;


Table
                    of Contents

·

the inability
                              to maintain uniform
                              standards, controls, procedures and policies; and

·

the impairment
                              of relationships
                              with team members and customers as a result of changes
                              in
                              management.

We
              cannot
              assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or
              any other
              problems encountered with these acquisitions, investments, strategic
              alliances
              or related efforts.

If
            overall demand for products sold by our stores slows, our business, financial
            condition and results of operations will suffer.

Overall
            demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may
            slow for
            a number of reasons, including:

·

the
                              weather, as vehicle maintenance may be deferred during
                              periods of
                              inclement weather;

·

the
                              economy, as during periods of good economic conditions,
                              more of our DIY
                              customers may pay others to repair and maintain their
                              cars instead of
                              working on their own cars. In periods of declining
                              economic conditions,
                              both DIY and DIFM customers may defer vehicle maintenance
                              or repair;
                              and

·

the
                              decline of the average age of vehicles, miles driven
                              or number of cars on
                              the road may result in a reduction in the demand for
                              our product
                              offerings.

If
            any of
            these factors cause overall demand for the products we sell to decline,
            our
            business, financial condition and results of operations will suffer.

We
            depend on the services of many qualified team members and may not be
            able to
            attract and retain such qualified team members.

Our
            success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and
            experience
            of our many team members. At March 6, 2006, we employed 42,427 team members.
            We
            cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our current qualified
            team
            members as well as attract and retain additional qualified team members
            that may
            be needed in the future. Our ability to maintain an adequate number of
            qualified
            team members is highly dependent on an attractive and competitive compensation
            and benefits package. If we fail to maintain such an adequate compensation
            and
            benefits package, our customer service and execution levels could suffer
            by
            reason of a declining quality of our workforce, which could adversely
            affect our
            financial condition and results of operations.

If
            we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the
            automotive
            aftermarket industry, we could lose customers and our revenues may decline.

The
            sale
            of automotive parts, accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive
            in
            many ways, including price, name recognition, customer service and location.
            We
            compete in both the DIY and DIFM categories of the automotive aftermarket
            industry, and primarily with national and regional retail automotive
            parts
            chains, wholesalers or jobber stores, independent operators, automobile
            dealers
            that supply parts, discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry
            automotive
            products. These competitors and the level of competition vary by market.
            Some of
            our competitors may possess advantages over us in certain markets we
            share,
            including a greater amount of marketing activities, a larger number of
            stores,
            longer operating histories, greater name recognition or larger and more
            established customer bases. Our response to these competitive disadvantages
            may
            require us to reduce our prices or increase our spending, which would
            lower
            revenue and profitability. Competitive disadvantages may also prevent
            us from
            introducing new product lines or require us to discontinue current product
            offerings or change some of our current operating strategies. If we do
            not have
            the resources or expertise or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies
            to
            address these competitive disadvantages, we could lose customers and
            our
            revenues may decline.

Disruptions
            in our relationships with vendors or in our vendors' operations could
            increase
            our cost of goods sold.

Our
            business depends on developing and maintaining close
            relationships with our vendors and upon the vendors' ability or willingness
            to
            sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms. Many factors
            outside
            of


Table
                of Contents

our
            control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of
            these
            vendors to sell us products on favorable terms. For example, financial
            or
            operational difficulties that some of our vendors may face may increase
            the cost
            of the products we purchase from them. In addition, the trend towards
            consolidation among automotive parts suppliers may disrupt or end our
            relationship with some vendors, and could lead to less competition and,
            consequently, higher prices.

Because
            we are involved in litigation from time to time, and are subject to numerous
            laws and governmental regulations, we could incur substantial judgments,
            fines,
            legal fees and other costs.

We
            are
            sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers, employees
            or
            other third parties for various actions. In particular, we are currently
            involved in litigation involving claims related to, among other things,
            breach
            of contract, tortious conduct, employment discrimination, asbestos exposure
            and
            product defects. The damages sought against us in some of these litigation
            proceedings are substantial. Although we maintain liability insurance
            for some
            litigation claims, if one or more of the claims greatly exceeds our coverage
            limits or our insurance policies do not cover a claim, it could have
            a material
            adverse affect on our business and operating results.

Additionally,
            we are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and governmental
            regulations relating to employment matters, environmental protection
            and
            building and zoning requirements. If we fail to comply with existing
            or future
            laws or regulations, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines
            or
            sanctions. In addition, our capital expenses could increase due to remediation
            measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with
            any
            existing or future laws or regulations.

Risks
            Relating to Our Financial Condition

The
            covenants governing our senior credit facility impose significant restrictions
            on us.

The
            terms
            of our senior credit facility impose significant operating and financial
            restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and require us to meet certain
            financial
            tests. These restrictions may also have a negative impact on our business,
            financial condition and results of operations by significantly limiting
            or
            prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions, including:

·

incurring
                                or guaranteeing additional indebtedness;

·

paying
                                dividends or making distributions or certain other
                                restricted
                                payments;

·

making
                                capital expenditures and other investments;

·

creating
                              liens on our
                              assets;

·

issuing
                              or selling capital stock
                              of our subsidiaries;

·

transferring
                              or selling assets
                              currently held by us;

·

repurchasing
                              stock and certain
                              indebtedness;

·

engaging
                              in transactions with
                              affiliates;

·

entering
                              into any agreements that
                              restrict dividends from our subsidiaries; and

·

engaging
                              in mergers or
                              consolidations.

The
            failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under
            our
            senior credit facility. Furthermore, our senior credit facility contains
            certain
            financial covenants, including establishing a maximum leverage ratio
            and
            requiring us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and a funded
            senior
            debt to current assets ratio, which, if not maintained by us, will cause
            us to
            be in default under our senior credit facility. Any of these defaults,
            if not
            waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt, in which
            case the
            debt would become immediately due and payable. If this occurs, we may
            not be
            able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even
            if new
            financing were available, it may be on terms that are less favorable
            or
            otherwise not acceptable to us.

Our
            ability to service our debt will require a significant amount of cash
            and our
            operations may not generate the amount of cash we need.

We
            will need a significant amount of cash to service our
            debt. Our ability to generate cash depends on our


Table
                of Contents

successful
            financial and operating performance. We cannot assure you that we will
            generate
            sufficient cash flow from operations or that we will be able to obtain
            sufficient funding to satisfy all of our obligations. Our financial and
            operational performance also depends upon a number of other factors,
            many of
            which are beyond our control. These factors include:

·

economic
                                  and competitive conditions in the automotive aftermarket
                                  industry;
                                  and

·

operating
                                  difficulties, operating costs or pricing pressures
                                  we may
                                  experience.

If
            we are
            unable to service our debt, we will be required to pursue one or more
            alternative strategies, such as selling assets, refinancing or restructuring
            our
            debt or raising additional equity capital. However, we cannot assure
            you that
            any alternative strategies will be feasible or prove adequate. Also,
            some
            alternative strategies would require the consent of at least a majority
            in
            interest of the lenders under our senior credit facility, and we can
            provide no
            assurances that we would be able to obtain this consent. If we are unable
            to
            meet our debt service obligations and alternative strategies are unsuccessful

Legal
            Proceedings.

We
            currently and from time to time are involved in litigation incidental
            to the
            conduct of our business, including litigation arising from claims of
            employment
            discrimination or other types of employment matters as a result of claims
            by
            current and former employees. Although we diligently defend against these
            claims, we may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these and
            other
            lawsuits, and may enter into settlement agreements, if we believe settlement
            is
            in the best interests of our shareholders. The damages claimed against
            us in
            some of these proceedings are substantial. Although the amount of liability
            that
            may result from these matters cannot be ascertained, we do not currently
            believe
            that, in the aggregate, they will result in liabilities material to our
            consolidated financial condition, future results of operations or cash
            flow.

Our
            Western Auto subsidiary, together with other defendants including automobile
            manufacturers, automotive parts manufacturers and other retailers, has
            been
            named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging injury as a result of exposure
            to
            asbestos-containing products. We and some of our other subsidiaries also
            have
            been named as defendants in many of these lawsuits. The plaintiffs have
            alleged
            that these products were manufactured, distributed and/or sold by the
            various
            defendants. To date, these products have included brake and clutch parts
            and
            roofing materials. Many of the cases pending against us or our subsidiaries
            are
            in the early stages of litigation. The damages claimed against the defendants
            in
            some of these proceedings are substantial. Additionally, some of the
            automotive
            parts manufacturers named as defendants in these lawsuits have declared
            bankruptcy, which will limit plaintiffs’ ability to recover monetary damages
            from those defendants. Although we diligently defend against these claims,
            we
            may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these and other lawsuits,
            and
            may enter into settlement agreements, if we believe settlement is in
            the best
            interests of our shareholders. We also believe that most of these claims
            are at
            least partially covered by insurance. Based on discovery to date, we
            do not
            believe the cases currently pending will have a material adverse effect
            on us.
            However, if we were to incur an adverse verdict in one or more of these
            claims
            and were ordered to pay damages that were not covered by insurance, these
            claims
            could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial
            position and liquidity. If the number of claims filed against us or any
            of our
            subsidiaries alleging injury as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing
            products increases substantially, the costs associated with concluding
            these
            claims, including damages resulting from any adverse verdicts, could
            have a
            material adverse effect on our operating results, financial position
            and
            liquidity in future periods.

The
            closing price of our common stock on March 13, 2006 was $41.19. The table
            gives
            effect to our three-for-two stock split effectuated in the form of a
            50% stock
            dividend distributed on September 23, 2005, as trading began on a post-split
            basis on September 26, 2005. At March 13, 2006, there were 424 holders
            of record
            of our common stock.

We
            have
            not declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock in the last two
            years.
            On February 15, 2006, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash
            dividend,
            the first in our history. We plan to pay the first quarterly dividend
            of $0.06
            per share on April 7, 2006 to stockholders of record as of March 24,
            2006. Our
            amended senior credit facility contains restrictions on the amount of
            cash
            dividends or other distributions we may declare and pay on our capital
            stock.
            Such restrictions will not have a material impact on our ability to pay
            this
            dividend for the foreseeable future. Any payments of dividends in the
            future
            will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon
            our
            results of operations, earnings, capital requirements, contractual restrictions
            contained in our amended senior credit facility, or other agreements,
            and other
            factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.

                      result of our
                      new vendor financing program, we aggregate financed vendor
                      accounts
                      payable with accounts payable to calculate our accounts payable to
                      inventory ratio.

Net
                      working capital is calculated by subtracting current liabilities
                      from
                      current assets.

Capital
                      expenditures for 2001 exclude $34.1 million for our November
                      2001 purchase
                      of Discount’s Gallman, Mississippi distribution facility from the lessor
                      in connection with the Discount acquisition.

Net
                      debt includes total debt and bank overdrafts, less cash and
                      cash
                      equivalents.

(17)

Comparable
                      store sales is calculated based on the change in net sales
                      starting once a
                      store has been open for 13 complete accounting periods (each
                      period
                      represents four weeks). Relocations are included in comparable
                      store sales
                      from the original date of opening. Stores acquired in the Discount
                      acquisition are included in the comparable sales calculation
                      beginning in
                      December 2002, which was 13 complete accounting periods after
                      the
                      acquisition date of November 28, 2001. We do not include net
                      sales from
                      the 36 Western Auto retail stores in our comparable store calculation
                      as a
                      result of their unique product offerings, including automotive
                      service and
                      tires. In 2003, the comparable store sales calculation included
                      sales from
                      our 53

rd

week compared to our first week of operation in 2003 (the comparable
                      calendar week). In 2004, as a result of the 53

rd

week in 2003, the comparable store sales calculation excludes
                      week one of
                      sales from 2003.

(18)

Closed
                      stores in 2002 include 133 Discount and Advance stores closed
                      as part of
                      the integration of Discount.

(19)

Total
                      store square footage excludes the square footage of the AI
                      stores.

(20)

Average
                      net sales per store is calculated as net sales divided by the
                      average of
                      beginning and ending number of stores for the respective period.
                      The
                      fiscal 2005 calculation excludes the effect of the AI stores.
                      The fiscal
                      2003 net sales exclude the effect of the 53

rd

week in the amount of $63.0 million. The fiscal 2001 amounts
                      were
                      calculated by reducing the number of Discount stores by one-thirteenth
                      to
                      reflect our ownership of Discount from December 2, 2001 (the
                      acquisition
                      date) through December 29, 2001.

(21)

Average
                      net sales per square foot is calculated as net sales divided
                      by the
                      average of the beginning and ending total store square footage
                      for the
                      respective period. The fiscal 2005 calculation excludes the
                      effect of the
                      AI stores. The fiscal 2003 net sales exclude the effect of
                      the

rd

week in the amount of $63.0 million. The fiscal 2001 amounts
                      were
                      calculated by reducing the number of Discount stores by one-thirteenth
                      to
                      reflect our ownership of Discount from December 2, 2001 (the
                      acquisition
                      date) through December 29, 2001.

Introduction

We
            primarily operate within the United States automotive aftermarket industry,
            which includes replacement parts (excluding tires), accessories, maintenance
            items, batteries and automotive chemicals for cars and light trucks (pickup
            trucks, vans, minivans and sport utility vehicles). We currently are
            the second
            largest specialty retailer of automotive parts, accessories and maintenance
            items to “do-it-yourself,” or DIY, customers in the United States, based on
            store count and sales. Our operations are conducted in one reportable
            segment.

                of Contents

At
            December 31, 2005, we operated 2,774 stores throughout 40 states in the
            Northeastern, Southeastern and Midwestern regions of the United States.
            These
            stores operated under the “Advance Auto Parts” trade name except for certain
            stores in the state of Florida, which operated under the “Advance Discount Auto
            Parts” trade name. These stores offer automotive replacement parts, accessories
            and maintenance items, with no significant concentration in any specific
            product
            area. In addition, we operated 36 stores under the “Western Auto” and “Advance
            Auto Parts” trade names, located primarily in Puerto Rico and the Virgin
            Islands. The Western Auto stores offer automotive tires and service in
            addition
            to automotive parts, accessories and maintenance items. At December 31,
            2005, we
            also operated 62 stores under the “Autopart International” trade name throughout
            the Northeastern region of the United States.

The
            following table sets forth the total number of new, closed and relocated
            stores
            and stores with commercial delivery programs during fiscal 2005, 2004

            anticipate adding approximately 170 to 180 new AAP stores during 2006,

Management
            Overview

In
            2005,
            we produced solid earnings primarily reflective of our continued sales
            momentum
            and gross margin improvements. These results helped us generate strong
            cash flow
            and drive a higher return on our invested capital. Our strong sales were
            primarily driven by an 8.7% increase in comparable store net sales for
            the year,
            our highest comparative sales increase as a public company. Additionally,
            our
            average net sales per store rose to more than $1.5 million, which is
            one of the
            highest among our major competitors.

We
            remain
            focused on the following four goals:

1. 
Rasing
            average sales per store;

2. 
Expancing
            operating margins;

3. 
Generating
            strong free cash flow;
            and

4. 
Increasing
            return on invested
            capital.

We
            believe our 2005 results also reflect the progress made on the following
            key
            initiatives that focus specifically on driving higher sales per store
            and
            leveraging our fixed expenses:

·

Improving
                                    store execution towards “best in class” in automotive aftermarket
                                    retail;

·

Continued
                                    execution of our category management
                                    program;

·

Continued
                                    implementation of our 2010 store remodeling program,
                                    now resulting in more
                                    than 50% of our chain remodeled;

·

Our
                                  focus on making our supply chain more responsive
                                  and improving our
                                  in-stock position;

·

Consistent
                                  growth and execution of our commercial
                                  program;


Table
                  of Contents

·

Our
                                  focus on recruiting, training
                                  and retaining high-performing team member, especially
                                  those who are ASE
                                  certified and/or bilingual; and

Enhanced
                                  national
                                  advertising.

Beyond
            the implementation of our key business initiatives, various conditions
            that
            impact our industry continue to remain strong. The number of registered
            vehicles
            on the road is at an all time high and continues to increase. The average
            age of
            vehicles also continues to increase and is now over nine years old.
            Additionally, technological changes in newer models and the shift from
            cars to
            light trucks and sport utility vehicles have resulted in more expensive
            replacement parts for these vehicles. We believe the combination of our
            execution on key business initiatives and favorable industry dynamics
            will
            continue to drive our earnings per share growth into the foreseeable
            future.

            following table highlights certain operating results and key metrics

            September 14, 2005, we completed the acquisition of Autopart International,
            Inc., or AI. The acquisition, which included 61 stores throughout New
            England
            and New York, a distribution center and AI’s wholesale distribution business,
            will complement our growing presence in the Northeast. AI’s business serves the
            growing commercial market in addition to warehouse distributors and jobbers.
            The
            acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.
            Accordingly, AI’s results of operations have been included in our consolidated
            statement of operations since the acquisition date. The purchase price
            of $87.4
            million, inclusive of contingent consideration of $12.5 million payable
            no later
            than April 1, 2006 based upon AI satisfying certain earnings before interest,
            taxes, depreciation and amortization targets met through December 31,
            2005, has
            been allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based
            on the
            fair values at the date of acquisition. This allocation resulted in the
            recognition of $50.4 million in goodwill and identifiable intangible
            assets.
            Furthermore, an additional $12.5 million is contingently payable based
            upon the
            achievement of certain synergies, as defined in the Purchase Agreement,
            through
            fiscal 2008, which will be reflected in the statement of operations when
            earned.
            In July 2005, we also completed the acquisition of substantially all
            the assets
            of Lappen Auto Supply, including 19 stores in the greater Boston metro
            area.

Stock
            Repurchase Program

During
            the third quarter of fiscal 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a
            new stock
            repurchase program of up to $300 million of our common stock plus related
            expenses. The program, which became effective August 15, 2005, replaced
            the
            remaining portion of a $200 million stock repurchase program that had
            been
            authorized by our Board of Directors during third quarter of fiscal 2004.
            The
            program allows us to repurchase our common stock on the open market or
            in
            privately negotiated transactions from time to time in accordance with
            the
            requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Stock
            Split

On
            August
            10, 2005, our Board of Directors declared a three-for-two stock split
            of our
            common stock, effected as a 50% stock dividend. The dividend was distributed
            on
            September 23, 2005 to holders of record as of September 9, 2005, and
            our stock
            began trading on a post-split basis on September 26, 2005. Our results
            reflect
            the effect of the stock split for all years represented.

Hurricane
            and Fire Impact

During
            the second half of fiscal 2005, Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma impacted
            our
            operations throughout the states of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi
            and
            Texas. At the time these storms hit, we operated approximately 750 stores
            throughout these states. Over 70% of these locations experienced some
            kind of
            physical damage and even more suffered sales disruptions. Additionally,
            we
            believe we experienced sales disruptions resulting from the economic
            impact of
            increased fuel prices on our customer base throughout all of our markets
            immediately following these hurricanes. We also incurred and recognized
            incremental expenses associated with compensating our team members for
            scheduled
            work hours for which stores were closed and food and supplies provided
            to our
            team members and their families. While these sales disruptions and related
            incremental expenses are not recoverable from our insurance carrier,
            the
            insurance coverage provides for the recovery of physical damage at cost,
            damaged
            merchandise at retail values and damaged capital assets at replacement
            cost.
            Additionally, during fiscal 2005 we lost two store locations due to fire.

For
            the
            year ended December 31, 2005, we estimated and reflected in earnings
            the fixed
            costs of all damage offset by the realizable insurance recoveries, net
            of
            deductibles. Accordingly, earnings for 2005 reflect the recovery of
            substantially all of these fixed costs. A portion of these recoveries
            includes
            the settlement with our insurance carrier for the retail value of certain
            damaged inventory. Moreover, we may receive additional recoveries beyond
            our
            recorded receivable as we settle additional claims for damaged inventory
            at
            retail value and for damaged capital assets at replacement value.

Commercial
            Program

As
            indicated in the operating results table above, our commercial program
            produced
            strong revenues during fiscal 2005. We attribute this performance to
            the
            execution of our commercial plan, which consists of:

·

Targeting
                                  commercial customers with a hard parts focus;

·

Targeting
                                  commercial customers who need access to a wide
                                  selection of
                                  inventory;

·

Moving
                                  inventory closer to our commercial customers to
                                  ensure quicker
                                  deliveries;

·

Growing
                                our market share of the
                                commercial market through internal growth and selected
                                acquisitions;

·

Providing
                                trained parts experts to
                                assist commercial customers' merchandise selections;
                                and

·

Providing
                                credit solutions to our
                                commercial customers through our commercial credit
                                program.

Commercial
            sales represented approximately 22% of our consolidated total sales for
            the
            fiscal year compared to almost 18% in fiscal 2004. At December 31, 2005,
            we
            operated commercial programs in 78% of our stores, including the 62 AI
            stores,
            up from approximately 73% at the end of the prior fiscal year. We anticipate
            growing our number of commercial programs to approximately 85% of our
            total
            store base over time. We believe we have the potential to grow profitably
            our
            share of the commercial business in each of our markets.

We
            believe the continued execution of our commercial plan and growth in
            our
            commercial programs will result in double-digit comparable store net
            sales
            growth in our commercial business for the foreseeable future. We believe
            the
            acquisition of AI will supplement our commercial growth due to AI’s established
            delivery programs and knowledge of the commercial industry, particularly
            for
            foreign makes and models of vehicles.

Discontinued
            Operations

Prior
            to
            2004, we operated a wholesale distribution segment under the trade name
“Western
            Auto.” On December 19, 2003, we discontinued the supplying of merchandise to
            our
            wholesale distribution network. The wholesale distribution network, or
            Wholesale, consisted of independently owned and operated dealer locations,
            for
            which we supplied merchandise inventory and certain services. Due to
            the wide
            variety of products supplied to the dealers and the reduced concentration
            of
            stores spread over a wide geographic area, it had become difficult to
            serve
            these dealers effectively. This component of our business operated in
            the
            wholesale segment and excluding certain allocated and team member benefit
            expenses of $2.4 million for fiscal year 2003, represented the entire
            results of
            operations previously reported in that segment. We have classified these
            operating results as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated
            statements of operations for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2004 to
            reflect
            this decision. For the fiscal year ended January 1, 2005, the operating
            results
            related to the discontinued wholesale business were minimal as a result
            of
            recognizing an estimate of exit costs in fiscal 2003.

Critical
            Accounting Policies

Our
            financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
            policies
            generally accepted in the United States of America. Our discussion and
            analysis
            of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these
            financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires
            the
            application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and
            judgments by our management. Our estimates and judgments are based on
            currently
            available information, historical results and other assumptions we believe
            are
            reasonable. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

The
            preparation of our financial statements included the following significant
            estimates.

Vendor
            Incentives

We
            receive incentives in the form of reductions to amounts owed and/or payments
            from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances, volume rebates
            and
            other promotional considerations. We account for vendor incentives in
            accordance
            with Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, No. 02-16, “Accounting by a Customer
            (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor.” Many
            of the incentives are under long-term agreements (terms in excess of
            one year),
            while others are negotiated on an annual basis. Certain vendors require
            us to
            use cooperative advertising allowances exclusively for advertising. We
            define
            these allowances as


Table
                of Contents

restricted
            cooperative advertising allowances and recognize them as a reduction
            to selling,
            general and administrative expenses as incremental advertising expenditures
            are
            incurred. The remaining cooperative advertising allowances not restricted
            by our
            vendors and volume rebates are earned based on inventory purchases and
            recorded
            as a reduction to inventory and recognized through cost of sales as the
            inventory is sold.

We
            recognize other promotional incentives earned under long-term agreements
            as a
            reduction to cost of sales. These incentives are recognized based on
            the
            cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated net purchases
            over
            the life of the agreement. Our margins could be impacted positively or
            negatively if actual purchases or results from any one year differ from
            our
            estimates; however, the impact over the life of the agreement would be
            the same.
            Short-term incentives (terms less than one year) are recognized as a
            reduction
            to cost of sales over the course of the agreements.

Amounts
            received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected
            as
            deferred revenue. Management's estimate of the portion of deferred revenue
            that
            will be realized within one year of the balance sheet date is included
            in other
            current liabilities. Earned amounts that are receivable from vendors
            are
            included in receivables except for that portion expected to be received
            after
            one year, which is included in other assets.

Inventory
            Reserves

We
            establish reserves for inventory shrink, as an increase to our cost of
            sales,
            for our stores and distribution centers based on our extensive and frequent
            cycle counting program. Our estimates of these shrink reserves depend
            on the
            accuracy of the program, which is dependent on compliance rates of our
            facilities and the execution of the required procedures. We evaluate
            the
            accuracy of this program on an ongoing basis and believe it provides
            reasonable
            assurance for the established reserves.

We
            have
            recorded reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories based
            on
            current inventory levels of discontinued product and historical analysis
            of the
            liquidation of discontinued inventory below cost. The nature of our inventory
            is
            such that the risk of obsolescence is minimal and excess inventory has
            historically been returned to our vendors for credit. We provide reserves
            where
            less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we
            anticipate
            that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded
            cost. We
            develop these estimates based on the determination of return privileges
            with
            vendors, the level of credit provided by the vendor and management’s estimate of
            the discounts to recorded cost, if any, required by market conditions.
            Future
            changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns
            of excess
            inventory could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves
            for
            excess and obsolete inventory and result in a negative impact on our
            consolidated statement of operations.

Warranty
            Reserves

Our
            vendors are primarily responsible for warranty claims. We are responsible
            for
            merchandise and services sold under warranty which are not covered by
            vendor
            warranties (primarily batteries). We record a reserve for future warranty
            claims
            as an increase in our cost of sales based on current sales of the warranted
            products and historical claim experience. If claims experience differs
            from
            historical levels, revisions in our estimates may be required, which
            could have
            an impact on our consolidated statement of operations.

Self-Insured
            Reserves

We
            are
            self-insured for general and automobile liability, workers' compensation
            and the
            health care claims of our team members, although we maintain stop-loss
            coverage
            with third-party insurers to limit our total liability exposure. A reserve
            for
            liabilities associated with these losses is established for claims filed
            and
            claims incurred but not yet reported based upon our estimate of ultimate
            cost,
            which we calculate using analyses of historical data, demographic and
            severity
            factors and valuations provided by third-party actuaries. Management
            monitors
            new claims and claim development as well as negative trends related to
            the
            claims incurred but not reported in order to assess the adequacy of our
            insurance reserves. While we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid
            to differ
            significantly from our estimates, our self-insurance reserves and corresponding
            selling, general and administrative expenses could be affected if future
            claim
            experience differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial
            assumptions.

Leases
            and Leasehold Improvements

We
            lease
            certain store locations, distribution centers, office space, equipment
            and
            vehicles. We account for our leases under the provisions of SFAS No.
            13,
“Accounting for Leases,” and subsequent amendments which require that leases be
            evaluated and classified as operating leases or capital leases for financial
            reporting purposes. Certain leases contain rent escalation clauses, which
            are
            recorded on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the lease
            with the
            difference between the rent paid and the straight-line rent recorded
            as a
            deferred rent liability. Lease incentive payments received from landlords
            are
            recorded as deferred rent liabilities and are amortized on a straight-line
            basis
            over the lease term as a reduction in rent. In addition, leasehold improvements
            associated with these operating leases are amortized over the shorter
            of their
            economic lives or the respective lease terms. The term of each lease
            is
            generally the initial term of the lease unless external economic factors
            were to
            exist such that renewals potentially provided for in the lease are reasonably
            assured to be exercised. In those instances the renewal period would
            be included
            in the lease term for purposes of establishing an amortization period
            and
            determining if such lease qualified as a capital or operating lease.

Closed
            Store Liabilities

We
            recognize a reserve for future obligations at the time we close a leased
            store
            location. The reserve includes the present value of the remaining lease
            obligations and management’s estimate of future costs for common area
            maintenance and taxes, offset by the present value of management’s estimate of
            potential subleases and lease buyouts. These estimates are based on current
            market conditions and our experience of obtaining subleases or buyouts
            on
            similar properties. However, our inability to enter into subleases or
            obtain buyouts due to a change in the economy or prevailing real estate
            markets
            for these properties within the estimated timeframe may result in increases
            or
            decreases to these reserves and could impact our selling, general and
            administrative expenses, as well as our consolidated statement of operations
            and
            cash flows.

Impairment
            of Long-Lived Assets

We
            primarily invest in property and equipment in connection with the opening
            and
            remodeling of stores and in computer software and hardware. We periodically
            review our store locations and estimate the recoverability of our assets,
            recording an impairment charge, if necessary, when we decide to close
            the store
            or otherwise determine that future undiscounted cash flows associated
            with those
            assets will not be sufficient to recover the carrying value. This determination
            is based on a number of factors, including the store’s historical operating
            results and cash flows, estimated future sales growth, real estate development
            in the area and perceived local market conditions that can be difficult
            to
            predict and may be subject to change. In addition, we regularly evaluate
            our
            computer-related and other long-lived assets and may accelerate depreciation
            over the revised useful life if the asset is expected to be replaced
            or has
            limited future value. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of,
            the cost
            and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from
            the
            accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income for that
            period.

Tax
            Reserves

The
            determination of our income tax liabilities is based upon the code, regulations,
            pronouncements and applicable case law of the taxing jurisdictions in
            which we
            do business.  Applying these complex rules requires significant
            judgment.  We believe our tax positions are fully supportable, but we
            establish reserves for certain positions which may be successfully
            challenged.  These reserves are adjusted, on a facts and circumstances
            basis, as challenges are resolved or the relevant tax guidance
            evolves.

Net
            Sales

Net
            sales
            consist primarily of comparable store sales and new store net sales.
            We
            calculate comparable store sales based on the change in net sales starting
            once
            a store has been opened for 13 complete accounting periods. We


Table
                of Contents

include
            relocations in comparable store sales from the original date of opening.
            We
            exclude net sales from the 36 Western Auto retail stores from our comparable
            store sales as a result of their unique product offerings. We also plan
            to
            exclude the net sales from the AI stores from our comparable store
            sales.

Our
            fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to December 31 and consists
            of 52 or 53
            weeks. Our 2004 fiscal year began on January 4, 2004 and consisted of
            52 weeks,
            while our 2003 fiscal year began on December 29, 2002 and consisted of
            53 weeks.
            The extra week of operations in fiscal 2003 resulted in our fiscal 2004
            consisting of non-comparable calendar weeks to fiscal 2003. To create
            a
            meaningful comparable store sales measure for fiscal 2004, we have compared
            the
            calendar weeks of 2004 to the corresponding calendar weeks of fiscal
            2003.
            Accordingly, our calculation of comparable stores sales for fiscal 2004
            excludes
            week one of operations from fiscal 2003.

Cost
            of Sales

Our
            cost
            of sales consists of merchandise costs, net of incentives under vendor
            programs,
            inventory shrinkage and warehouse and distribution expenses. Gross profit
            as a
            percentage of net sales may be affected by variations in our product
            mix, price
            changes in response to competitive factors and fluctuations in merchandise
            costs
            and vendor programs. We seek to avoid fluctuation in merchandise costs
            and
            instability of supply by entering into long-term purchasing agreements
            with
            vendors when we believe it is advantageous.

Selling,
            General and Administrative Expenses

Selling,
            general and administrative expenses consist of store payroll, store occupancy
            (including rent), advertising expenses, other store expenses and general
            and
            administrative expenses, including salaries and related benefits of store
            support center team members, store support center administrative office
            expenses, data processing, professional expenses and other related
            expenses.

Results
            of Operations

The
            following table sets forth certain of our operating data expressed as
            a
            percentage of net sales for the periods indicated.

Fiscal
            2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004

Net
            sales
            for 2005 were $4,265.0 million, an increase of $494.7 million, or 13.1%,
            over
            net sales for 2004. The net sales increase was due to an increase in
            comparable
            store sales of 8.7%, contributions from the 151 new stores opened within
            the
            last year and sales from acquired operations. The comparable store sales
            increase was driven by an increase in average ticket sales and a slight
            increase
            in customer traffic. We believe these results reflect the


Table
                of Contents

execution
            of the key business initiatives discussed previously in the Management
            Overview.
            In addition, we believe our DIFM sales have increased as a result of
            the
            continued execution of our commercial plan as discussed previously in
            the
            Commercial Program.

Gross
            profit for 2005 was $2,014.5 million, or 47.2% of net sales, as compared
            to
            $1,753.4 million, or 46.5% of net sales, in 2004. The increase in gross
            profit
            as a percentage of sales reflects continued benefits realized from our
            category
            management program in the form of better margins on key product categories
            and
            increased incentives under our vendor programs and supply chain
            efficiencies.

Selling,
            general and administrative expenses were $1,606.0 million, or 37.6% of
            net sales
            for 2005, as compared to $1,424.6 million, or 37.8% of net sales for
            2004. For
            fiscal 2005, we experienced a decrease in selling, general and administrative
            expenses as a percentage of net sales resulting from our ability to leverage
            our
            strong comparable store sales and lower self-insurance expense partially
            offset
            by higher fuel and energy costs.

Interest
            expense for 2005 was $32.4 million, or 0.7% of net sales, as compared
            to $20.1
            million, or 0.5% of net sales, in 2004. The increase in interest expense
            is a
            result of both higher average outstanding debt levels and borrowing rates
            as
            compared to fiscal 2004.

Income
            tax expense for 2005 was $144.2 million, as compared to $117.7 million for
            2004. This increase in income tax expense primarily reflects our higher
            earnings. Our effective income tax rate was 38.1% and 38.5% for 2005
            and 2004,
            respectively.

We
            recorded net income of $234.7 million, or $2.13 per diluted share for 2005,
            as compared to $188.0 million, or $1.66 per diluted share for 2004. As
            a
            percentage of sales, net income for 2005 was 5.5%, as compared to 5.0%
            for 2004.
            The earnings per share results reflect the effect of a three-for-two
            stock split
            of our common stock distributed on September 23, 2005.

Fiscal
            2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003

Net
            sales
            for 2004 were $3,770.3 million, an increase of $276.6 million, or 7.9%,
            over net
            sales for 2003. Excluding the effect of the 53

rd

week for
            2003 our net sales increased $339.6 million, or 9.9%, over net sales
            for 2003.
            The net sales increase was due to an increase in comparable store sales of
            6.1% and contributions from our 125 new stores opened during fiscal 2004.
            The
            comparable store sales increase was primarily the result of increases
            in both
            customer traffic and average ticket sales. Overall, we believe our 2010
            store
            format, category management and enhanced nationwide advertising program
            drove
            our growth in net sales. In addition, we believe our DIFM sales have
            increased
            as a result of the continued execution of our commercial delivery programs
            in
            our existing markets and our continued focus on a high level of service
            to our
            DIFM customers.

Gross
            profit for 2004 was $1,753.4 million, or 46.5% of net sales, as compared
            to
            $1,604.5 million, or 45.9% of net sales, in 2003. The increase in gross
            profit
            as a percentage of sales reflect continued benefits realized from our
            category
            management initiatives and reduced inventory shrinkage.

Selling,
            general and administrative expenses increased to $1,424.6 million, or
            37.8% of
            net sales for 2004, from $1,316.3 million, or 37.6% of net sales for
            2003. The
            increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage
            of net
            sales in 2004 was primarily a result of increased expenses associated
            with our
            self-insurance programs, including the increased costs required to close
            claims
            below our stop-loss limits and increased medical costs for covered team
            members
            due to inflation in the health care sector. Selling, general and administrative
            expenses for 2003 included $10.4 million in merger and integration expenses
            related to the integration of Discount. These integration expenses were
            related
            to, among other things, overlapping administrative functions and store
            conversion expenses. Excluding the merger and integration expenses from
            2003,
            selling, general and administrative expenses were 37.3% of net
            sales.

Interest
            expense for 2004 was $20.1 million, or 0.5% of net sales, as compared
            to $37.6
            million, or 1.1% of net sales, in 2003. The decrease in interest expense
            is a
            result of lower overall interest rates due primarily to our redemption of
            our outstanding senior subordinated notes and senior discount debentures
            in the
            first quarter of fiscal 2003. Additionally, the decrease resulted from
            lower
            average outstanding debt levels on our senior credit facility

throughout
            fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003.

Income
            tax expense for 2004 was $117.7 million, as compared to $78.4 million for
            2003. This increase in income tax expense primarily reflected our higher
            earnings. Our effective income tax rate was 38.5% for both 2004 and
            2003.

We
            recorded net income of $188.0 million, or $1.66 per diluted share for
            2004, as
            compared to $124.9 million, or $1.11 per diluted share for 2003. As a
            percentage
            of sales, net income for 2004 was 5.0%, as compared to 3.6% for 2003.
            Our net
            income for 2003 included the effect of expenses associated with merger
            and
            integration and loss on extinguishment of debt of $35.5 million, or $0.31
            per
            diluted share. These per share amounts reflect the three-for-two stock
            split
            declared in 2005.

                        distributed on September 23, 2005.

Liquidity
            and Capital Resources

Overview
            of Liquidity

Our
            primary cash requirements include the purchase of inventory, capital
            expenditures and contractual obligations. In addition, we have used available
            funds to repurchase shares under our stock repurchase program. We have
            funded
            these requirements primarily through cash generated from operations supplemented
            by borrowings under our senior credit facility as needed.

At
            December 31, 2005, our cash balance was $40.8 million, a decrease of
            $15.5
            million compared to fiscal year-end 2004. Our cash balance decreased
            primarily
            due to cash invested in business acquisitions during 2005, partially
            offset by
            cash generated from our increased earnings during 2005 as compared to
            2004.

At
            December 31, 2005, we had outstanding indebtedness consisting primarily
            of
            borrowings of $438.3 million under our senior credit facility, a decrease
            of
            $31.2 million from 2004. Additionally, we had $54.6 million in letters
            of credit
            outstanding, which reduced our cash availability under the revolving
            credit
            facility to $145.4 million.

Capital
            Expenditures

Our
            primary capital requirements have been the funding of our continued store
            expansion program, including new store openings and store acquisitions,
            store
            relocations and remodels, inventory requirements, the construction and
            upgrading
            of distribution centers, the development and implementation of proprietary
            information systems and our  acquisitions.

Our
            capital expenditures were $216.2 million in 2005. These amounts included
            costs
            related to new store openings, the upgrade of our information systems,
            remodels
            and relocations of existing stores, including the completion of our physical
            conversion of stores acquired in the Discount acquisition to our Advance
            Auto
            Parts store format. In 2006, we anticipate that our capital expenditures
            will be
            approximately $260.0 million to $280.0 million.


Table
                of Contents

Our
            new
            stores, if leased, require capital expenditures of approximately $170,000
            per
            store and an inventory investment of approximately $170,000 per store,
            net of
            vendor payables. A portion of the inventory investment is held at a distribution
            facility. Pre-opening expenses, consisting primarily of store set-up
            costs and
            training of new store team members, average approximately $20,000 per
            store and
            are expensed when incurred.

Our
            future capital requirements will depend in large part on the number of
            and
            timing for new stores we open or acquire within a given year and the
            number of
            stores we relocate or remodel. During fiscal 2005, we opened 231 stores,
            including 80 stores acquired as part of the acquisitions of AI and Lappen
            Auto
            Supply.

We
            anticipate adding at least 170 to 180 new stores during fiscal

,
            excluding any acquisitions.

Vendor
            Financing Program

Historically,
            we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers that help finance
            inventory growth, and we believe that we will be able to continue financing
            much
            of our inventory growth through such extended payment terms. In fiscal
            2004, we
            entered into a short-term financing program with a bank for certain merchandise
            purchases. In substance, the program allows us to borrow money from the
            bank to
            finance purchases from our vendors. This program allows us to reduce
            further our
            working capital invested in current inventory levels and finance future
            inventory growth. Our capacity under this program increased $50 million
            to $150
            million during fiscal 2005. At December 31, 2005, $119.4 million was
            payable to
            the bank by us under this program.

Stock
            Repurchase Program

During
            the third quarter of fiscal 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a
            program to
            repurchase up to $300 million of our common stock plus related expenses.
            The
            program, which became effective August 15, 2005, replaced the remaining
            portion
            of a $200 million stock repurchase program authorized by our Board of
            Directors
            in fiscal 2004. The program allows us to repurchase our common stock
            on the open
            market or in privately negotiated transactions form time to time in accordance
            with the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission. As of
            December
            31, 2005, we had repurchased a total of 1.5 million shares of common
            stock under
            the new program, at an aggregate cost of $59.5 million, or an average
            price of
            $38.84 per share, excluding related expenses. Under our previous stock
            repurchase program, we repurchased 7.0 million shares of common stock
            at an
            aggregate cost of $189.2 million, or an average price $26.91 per share,
            excluding related expenses. At December 31, 2005, $0.9 million of stock
            repurchases remained unsettled.

During
            the third quarter of fiscal 2005, we also retired 7.1 million shares
            of common
            stock, of which 0.1 million shares were repurchased under the $300 million
            stock
            repurchase plan, and 7.0 million shares were repurchased under our previous
            $200
            million stock repurchase program.

At
            December 31, 2005, we had $240.5 million, excluding related expenses,
            available
            for future stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program. As of
            March 13,
            2006, we had repurchased an additional 0.4 million shares of common stock
            at an
            aggregate cost of $18.7 million.

Deferred
            Compensation and Postretirement Plans

We
            maintain a non-qualified deferred compensation plan established for certain
            of
            our key team members. This plan provides for a minimum and maximum deferral
            percentage of the team member base salary and bonus, as determined by
            our
            Retirement Plan Committee. We fund the plan liability by remitting the
            team
            members’ deferrals to a Rabbi Trust where these deferrals are invested in
            certain life insurance contracts. Accordingly, the cash surrender value
            on these
            contracts is held in the Rabbi Trust to fund the deferred compensation
            liability. At December 31, 2005, the liability related to this plan was
            $2.7
            million, all of which is current.

We
            provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible
            retired
            team members through our postretirement plan. At December 31, 2005, our
            accrued
            benefit cost related to this plan was $16.3 million. The plan has no
            assets and
            is funded on a cash basis as benefits are paid/incurred. The discount
            rate that
            we utilize for determining our postretirement benefit obligation is actuarially
            determined. The discount rate utilized at December 31, 2005 and January
            1, 2005
            was 5.5% and 5.75%, respectively. We reserve the right to change or terminate
            the

benefits
            or contributions at any time. We also continue to evaluate ways in which
            we can
            better manage these benefits and control costs. Any changes in the plan
            or
            revisions to assumptions that affect the amount of expected future benefits
            may
            have a significant impact on the amount of the reported obligation and
            annual
            expense. Effective second quarter of 2004, we amended the Plan to exclude
            outpatient prescription drug benefits to Medicare eligible retirees effective
            January 1, 2006. Due to this negative plan amendment, our accumulated
            postretirement benefit obligation was reduced by $7.6 million, resulting
            in an
            unrecognized negative prior service cost in the same amount. The unrecognized
            negative prior service cost is being amortized over the 13-year estimated
            remaining life expectancy of the plan participants.

                                    trade receivables upon the sale of our private
                                    label credit card

            million
            to $52.1 million, primarily due to a cash outflow of $406.4 million during
            fiscal 2003 for the early redemption of our senior discount debentures
            and
            senior subordinated notes. Cash used for financing activities in fiscal
            consisted primarily of:

·

$146.4
                                    million used to repurchase shares of our common
                                    stock under our stock

                                    result of $105.0 million in
                                    principal prepayments on our previous senior
                                    credit facility prior to
                                    scheduled maturity, offset by borrowings from
                                    our amended senior credit
                                    facility; and

                          short periods of
                          time. We currently do not have minimum purchase commitments
                          under our
                          vendor supply agreements nor are our open purchase orders
                          for goods and
                          services binding agreements. Accordingly, we have excluded
                          open purchase
                          orders from this table. The purchase obligations consist
                          of the amount of

                          These
                          agreements expire in May 2006 and March 2008,
                          respectively.

Long
            Term Debt

Senior
            Credit Facility.

Our
            senior credit facility provides for a tranche A term loan and a tranche
            B term
            loan. During fiscal 2004, we used proceeds from these term loans to refinance
            our tranche D and E term loans and revolver under our previous facility.

Additionally,
            this new senior credit facility provides for a $100 million delayed draw
            term
            loan, which was available exclusively for stock buybacks under our stock
            repurchase program, and a $200.0 million revolving facility, or the revolver
            (which provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sub limit
            of $70.0
            million).

In
            conjunction with the fiscal 2004 refinancing, we wrote off deferred financing
            costs related to the previous term loans in accordance with EITF Issue
            No.
            96-19, "Debtor's Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of Debt Instruments".
            The write-off of these costs combined with additional costs required
            to
            establish the new facility resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt
            of $2.8
            million in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for
            the year
            ended January 1, 2005. Earlier during fiscal 2004, we made $105.0 million
            of
            repayments on our previous senior credit facility prior to their scheduled
            maturity. In conjunction with these partial repayments, we wrote-off
            $0.4
            million, which is also classified as a loss on extinguishment of debt
            in the
            accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended
            January 1,
            2005.

At
            December 31, 2005, our senior credit facility consisted of (1) a tranche
            A term
            loan facility with a balance of $170.0 million, a tranche B term loan
            facility with a balance of $168.3 million, a delayed draw term loan with
            a
            balance of $100.0 million and (2) a $200.0 million revolving credit facility
            (including a letter of credit sub facility) (of which $145.4 million
            was
            available as a result of $54.6 million in letters of credit outstanding).
            The
            senior credit facility is jointly and severally guaranteed by all of
            our
            domestic subsidiaries and is secured by all of our assets and the assets
            of our
            existing and future domestic subsidiaries.

The
            tranche A term loan currently requires scheduled repayments of $7.5 million
            on
            March 31, 2006 and quarterly thereafter through December 31, 2006, $10.0
            million
            on March 31, 2007 and quarterly thereafter through December 31, 2007,
            $12.5
            million on March 31, 2008 and quarterly thereafter through June 30, 2009
            and
            $25.0 million due at maturity on September 30, 2009. The tranche B term
            loan
            currently requires scheduled repayments of $0.4 million on March 31,
            2006 and
            quarterly thereafter, with a final payment of $160.7 million due at maturity
            on
            September 30, 2010. The delayed draw term loan currently requires scheduled
            repayments of 0.25% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding on
            March 31,
            2006 and quarterly thereafter, with a final payment due at maturity on
            September
            30, 2010. The revolver expires on September 30, 2009.

The
            interest rates on the tranche A and B term loans, the delayed draw term
            loan and
            the revolver are based, at our option, on an adjusted LIBOR rate, plus
            a margin,
            or an alternate base rate, plus a margin. The current margin for the
            tranche A
            term loan and revolver is 1.25% and 0.25% per annum for the adjusted
            LIBOR and
            alternate base rate borrowings, respectively. The initial margin for
            the tranche
            B term loan and the delayed draw term loan is 1.50% and 0.50% per annum
            for the
            adjusted LIBOR and alternate base rate borrowings, respectively. Additionally,
            a
            commitment fee of 0.250% per annum is charged on the unused portion of
            the
            revolver, payable in arrears.

In
            March
            2005 we entered into three interest rate swap agreements on an aggregate
            of $175
            million of debt


Table
                of Contents

under
            our senior credit facility. Through the first swap
            we fixed our LIBOR rate at 4.153% on $50 million of debt for a term of
            months, expiring March 2009. Through the second swap we fixed our LIBOR
            rate at
            4.255% on $75 million of debt for a term of 60 months, expiring February
            2010.
            In March 2006, the third swap will fix our LIBOR rate at 4.6125% on $50
            million
            of debt for a term of 54 months, expiring in September 2010.

Additionally,
            we had entered into two additional interest rate swap agreements in March
            to limit our cash flow risk on variable rate debt. The first swap allows
            the
            Company to fix its LIBOR rate at 2.269% on $75 million of debt for a
            term of 36
            months, expiring in March 2006. The second swap, which fixed our LIBOR
            rate at
            1.79% on $50 million of debt, expired in March 2005.

The
            senior credit facility is secured by a first priority lien on substantially
            all,
            subject to certain exceptions, of our assets and the assets of our existing
            domestic subsidiaries and will be secured by the properties and assets
            of our
            future domestic subsidiaries. The senior credit facility contains covenants
            restricting the ability of us and our subsidiaries to, among other things,
            (1)
            declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock, (2) prepay,
            redeem or
            purchase debt, (3) incur liens or engage in sale-leaseback transactions,
            (4)
            make loans and investments, (5) incur additional debt (including hedging
            arrangements), (6) engage in certain mergers, acquisitions and asset sales,
            (7) engage in transactions with affiliates, (8) change the nature of
            our
            business and the business conducted by our subsidiaries and (9) change
            our
            passive holding company status. We also are required to comply with
            financial covenants with respect to a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum
            interest
            coverage ratio, a minimum current assets to funded senior debt ratio,
            a maximum
            senior leverage ratio and limits on capital expenditures. We were in
            compliance
            with the above covenants at December 31, 2005.

Credit
            Ratings

At
            December 31, 2005, we had a credit rating on our senior credit facility
            from
            Standard & Poor’s of BB+ and a credit rating of Ba1 from Moody’s Investor
            Service. The current pricing grid used to determine our borrowing rates
            under
            our senior credit facility is based on such credit ratings. If these
            credit
            ratings decline, our interest expense may increase. Conversely, if these
            credit
            ratings increase, our interest expense may decrease.

Seasonality

Our
            business is somewhat seasonal in nature, with the highest sales occurring
            in the
            spring and summer months. In addition, our business can be affected by
            weather
            conditions. While unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales
            as
            elective maintenance is deferred during such periods, extremely hot or
            cold
            weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail at
            an
            accelerated rate.

Recent
            Accounting Pronouncements

In
            November 2004 the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costs." The new
            statement
            amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4, "Inventory Pricing,"
            to
            clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense,
            freight,
            handling costs and wasted material. This statement requires that those
            items be
            recognized as current-period charges and requires that allocation of
            fixed
            production overheads to the cost of conversion be based on the normal
            capacity
            of the production facilities. This statement is effective for fiscal
            years
            beginning after June 15, 2005. We do not expect the adoption of this
            statement
            to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations
            or
            cash flows.

In
            December 2004 the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based
            Payment," or SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R replaces SFAS No. 123 and supersedes
            APB Opinion No. 25 and subsequently issued stock option related guidance.
            SFAS
            No. 123R establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in
            which an
            entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, primarily
            on
            accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services
            in
            share-based payment transactions. It also addresses transactions in which
            an
            entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are
            based on
            the fair value of the entity’s equity instruments or that may be settled by the
            issuance of those equity instruments. Entities will be required to measure
            the
            cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity
            instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited
            exceptions). That cost will be recognized over the period during which
            an
            employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (usually
            the
            vesting period). The grant-date fair value of employee


Table
                of Contents

share
            options and similar instruments will be estimated using option-pricing
            models.
            If an equity award is modified after the grant date, incremental compensation
            cost will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the fair
            value of
            the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately
            before
            the modification.

We
              are
              required to apply SFAS No. 123R to all stock or stock-based awards
              outstanding
              and subsequently

granted,
              modified or settled as of January 1, 2006. SFAS No. 123R requires us
              to use
              either the modified-prospective method or modified-retrospective method.
              Under
              the modified-prospective method, we must recognize compensation cost
              for all
              awards subsequent to adopting the standard and for the unvested portion
              of
              previously granted awards outstanding upon adoption. Under the
              modified-retrospective method, we must restate our previously issued
              financial
              statements to recognize the amounts we previously calculated and reported
              on a
              pro forma basis, as if the prior standard had been adopted. Under both
              methods,
              SFAS No. 123R permits the use of either the straight line or an accelerated
              method to amortize the cost as an expense for awards with graded
              vesting.

We
            have
            completed our analysis of the impact of SFAS No. 123R. We have decided
            to use
            the modified-prospective method of implementation as of January 1, 2006.
            We plan
            to use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value all options and
            straight-line method to amortize this fair value as compensation cost
            over the
            required service period. We expect the implementation of SFAS No. 123R
            will
            decrease diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.12 for fiscal
            2006.

In
            May
            2005 the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.”
This statement replaces APB Opinion No. 20, “Accounting Changes,” and FASB
            Statement No. 3 “Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements.”
This Statement requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial
            statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable
            to
            determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect
            of the
            change. We do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material
            impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash
            flows.

In
            March
            2005 the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional
            Asset Retirement Obligations - an interpretation of FASB Statement No.
            143,” or
            FIN 47. FIN 47 clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation
            used
            in FASB No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations", as a legal
            obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing
            and (or)
            method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may
            not be
            within the control of the entity. FIN 47 requires an entity to recognize
            a
            liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation if sufficient
            information exists to reasonably estimate fair value of the obligation.
            FIN 47
            also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably
            estimate the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation.
            FIN 47 was
            effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. We adopted
            FIN 47 in
            the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 with no impact to our financial condition,
            results of operations or cash flows.

In
            February 2006 the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, “Accounting for Certain Hybrid
            Financial Instruments - an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140.” This
            statement simplifies accounting for certain hybrid instruments currently
            governed by SFAS No. 133

,
            “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” or SFAS No.
            133,

by allowing fair value remeasurement of hybrid instruments that
            contain an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation.
            This
            statement also eliminates the guidance in SFAS No. 133 Implementation
            Issue No.
            D1, “Application of Statement 133 to Beneficial Interests in Securitized
            Financial Assets,” which provides such beneficial interests are not subject to
            SFAS No. 133. This statement amends SFAS No. 140, “

Accounting
            for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
            Liabilities - a Replacement of FASB Statement No. 125,”

by
            eliminating the restriction on passive derivative instruments that a
            qualifying
            special-purpose entity may hold. This statement is effective for financial
            instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of our fiscal year
            2007. We
            do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact
            on our
            financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Quantitative
              and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks.

We
              are
              exposed to cash flow risk due to changes in interest rates with respect
              to our
              long-term debt. Our long-term debt currently consists of borrowings under a
              senior credit facility and is primarily vulnerable to movements in
              the LIBOR
              rate. While we cannot predict the impact interest rate movements will
              have on
              our debt, exposure to rate changes is managed through the use of hedging
              activities. At December 31, 2005 approximately

$200
              million of our bank debt was fixed in accordance with the interest
              rate swaps
              described below.

Our
            future exposure to interest rate risk decreased during fiscal 2005 as
            a result
            of entering into three new interest rate swap agreements in March 2005
            on an
            aggregate of $175 million of debt under our senior credit facility. The
            first
            swap fixed our LIBOR rate at 4.153% on $50 million of debt for a term
            of 48
            months, expiring in March 2009. The second swap fixed our LIBOR rate
            at 4.255%
            on $75 million of debt for a term of 60 months, expiring February 2010.
            Beginning in March 2006, the third swap will fix our LIBOR rate at 4.6125%
            on
            $50 million of debt for a term of 54 months, expiring September
            2010.

In
            March
            2003 we entered into two interest rate swap agreements on an aggregate
            of $125
            million of our debt under our credit facility. The first swap allows
            us to fix
            our LIBOR rate at 2.269% on $75.0 million of variable rate debt for a
            term of 36
            months, expiring in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The second swap,
            which
            fixed our LIBOR rate at 1.79% on $50.0 million of variable rate debt,
            expired in
            March 2005.

The
            table
            below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest
            rates
            on our long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2005, by expected maturity
            dates. Additionally, the table includes the notional amounts of our debt
            hedged
            and the impact of the anticipated average pay and receive rates of our
            interest
            rate swaps through their maturity dates. Expected maturity dates approximate
            contract terms. Weighted average variable rates are based on implied
            forward
            rates in the yield curve at December 31, 2005. Implied forward rates
            should not
            be considered a predictor of actual future interest rates.

            limitation,
            controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required
            to be
            disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Securities

            as
            appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
            Our
            management has evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive
            officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure
            controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report
            in

            evaluation,

            disclosure controls and procedures for the period covered by this report.
            Autopart International’s results of operations and financial position for the
            fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 were insignificant to our consolidated

MANAGEMENT’S
            REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL
            REPORTING

Management
            of Advance Auto Parts, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) is responsible
            for
            establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
            reporting.
            The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
            under the supervision of the Company’s principal executive officer and principal
            financial officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
            of
            financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s financial statements
            for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally
            accepted in the United States of America.

Our
            internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures
            that
            (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
            accurately
            and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
            the
            Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
            as
            necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
            with
            generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
            of
            the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
            management
            and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
            prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
            of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
            statements.

As
            of
            December 31, 2005, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
            internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established
            in

Internal
            Control - Integrated Framework

issued
            by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
            (COSO).
            Management excluded from their assessment the internal control over financial
            reporting at Autopart International, Inc., which was acquired on September
            14,
            2005 and whose financial statements reflect total assets and revenues
            constituting four and one percent, respectively, of the related consolidated
            financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31,
            2005.
            Based on this assessment, management has determined that the Company’s internal
            control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 is effective.
            Because
            of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting,
            including the possibility of collusion or improper management override
            of
            controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented
            or
            detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
            effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future
            periods
            are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because
            of
            changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
            or
            procedures may deteriorate.

Deloitte
            & Touche LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm
            who audited the Company’s consolidated financial statements, has issued a report
            on management’s assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial
            reporting as of December 31, 2005 which is included on page F-3 herein.

REPORT
            OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
            the
            Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Advance
            Auto Parts, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Roanoke,
            Virginia

We
            have
            audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Advance Auto
            Parts, Inc.
            and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2005 and January 1,
            2005, and
            the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders’
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
            December
            31, 2005. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
            management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial
            statements based on our audits.

We
            conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
            Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
            we plan
            and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
            financial
            statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
            on a
            test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
            statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
            used and
            significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
            financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide
            a
            reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
            our
            opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
            material
            respects, the financial position of Advance Auto Parts, Inc. and subsidiaries
            as
            of December 31, 2005 and January 1, 2005, and the results of their operations
            and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
            December
            31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
            in the
            United States of America.

We
            have
            also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
            Accounting
            Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
            control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the
            criteria
            established in

Internal
            Control—Integrated Framework

issued
            by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
            and our
            report dated March 14, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s

REPORT
            OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
            the
            Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Advance
            Auto Parts, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Roanoke,
            Virginia

We
            have
            audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management's
            Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Advance Auto
            Parts,
            Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained effective internal control
            over
            financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established
            in

Internal
            Control—Integrated Framework

issued
            by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
            As
            described in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting,
            management excluded from their assessment the internal control over financial
            reporting at Autopart International, Inc., which was acquired on September
            14,
            2005 and whose financial statements reflect total assets and revenues
            constituting four and one percent, respectively, of the related consolidated
            financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31,
            2005.
            Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial
            reporting at Autopart International, Inc. The Company’s management is
            responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
            reporting
            and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
            financial
            reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s
            assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
            over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
            conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
            Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
            we plan
            and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
            internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
            respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
            over
            financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating
            the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
            such
            other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
            believe
            that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A
            company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by,
            or
            under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal
            financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
            by the
            company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide
            reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
            and the
            preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
            with
            generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
            financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
            to
            the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
            fairly
            reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
            (2)
            provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
            to
            permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
            accepted
            accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
            are
            being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
            of
            the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
            or timely
            detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
            assets that could have a material effect on the financial
            statements.

Because
            of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting,
            including the possibility of collusion or improper management override
            of
            controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented
            or
            detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
            effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future
            periods
            are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because
            of
            changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
            or
            procedures may deteriorate.

In
            our
            opinion, management’s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal
            control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated,
            in
            all material respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal
            Control—Integrated Framework

issued
            by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
            Also in
            our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
            internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based
            on the
            criteria established in

            and
            the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders’
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
            December
            31, 2005 and our report dated March 14, 2006 expressed an unqualified
            opinion on
            those financial statements.

2.
            Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:

Accounting
            Period

The
            Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of December,
            which
            results in an extra week every six years. Accordingly, fiscal 2003 includes
            weeks of operations. All other fiscal years presented include 52 weeks
            of
            operations.

Principles
            of Consolidation

The
            consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
            and its
            wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and
            transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use
            of Estimates

The
            preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
            generally accepted in the United States of America requires management
            to make
            estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
            and
            liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
            the date
            of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
            expenses
            during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash,
            Cash Equivalents and Bank Overdrafts

Cash
            and
            cash equivalents consist of cash in banks and money market funds with
            original
            maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts consist of net outstanding
            checks not yet presented to a bank for settlement.

Vendor
            Incentives

The
            Company receives incentives in the form of reductions to amounts owed
            and/or
            payments from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances,
            volume
            rebates and other promotional considerations. The Company accounts for
            vendor
            incentives in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, No.
            02-16,
“Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration
            Received from a Vendor.” Many of the incentives are under long-term agreements
            (terms in excess of one year), while others are negotiated on an annual
            basis.
            Certain vendors require the Company to use cooperative advertising allowances
            exclusively for advertising. The Company defines these allowances as
            restricted
            cooperative advertising allowances and recognizes them as a reduction
            to
            selling, general and administrative expenses as incremental advertising
            expenditures are incurred. The remaining cooperative advertising allowances
            not
            restricted by the Company’s vendors and volume rebates are earned based on
            inventory purchases and recorded as a reduction to inventory and recognized
            through cost of sales as the inventory is sold.

(in
                    thousands, except per share data)

The
            Company recognizes other promotional incentives earned under long-term
            agreements as a reduction to cost of sales. These incentives are recognized
            based on the cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated
            net
            purchases over the life of the agreement. The Company's margins could
            be
            impacted positively or negatively if actual purchases or results from
            any one
            year differ from its estimates; however, the impact over the life of
            the
            agreement would be the same. Short-term incentives (terms less than one
            year)
            are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the course of the
            agreements.

Amounts
            received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected
            as
            deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Management's
            estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within
            one
            year of the balance sheet date has been included in other current liabilities
            in
            the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Total deferred revenue
            is $12,529
            and $17,000 at December 31, 2005 and January 1, 2005, respectively. Earned
            amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in receivables,
            net on the
            accompanying consolidated balance sheets, except for that portion expected
            to be
            received after one year, which is included in other assets, net on the
            accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Preopening
            Expenses

Preopening
            expenses, which consist primarily of payroll and occupancy costs, are
            expensed
            as incurred.

Advertising
            Costs

The
            Company expenses advertising costs as incurred in accordance with the
            American
            Institute of Certified Public Accountant’s Statement of Position, or SOP, 93-7,
“Reporting on Advertising Costs.” Gross advertising expense incurred was
            approximately $95,702, $86,821 and $75,870 in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003,
            respectively.

Merger
            and Integration Costs

As
            a
            result of the acquisition of Discount Auto Parts (“Discount”) in 2001, the
            Company incurred costs related to, among other things, overlapping
            administrative functions and store conversions, all of which have been
            expensed
            as incurred. These costs are presented as expenses associated with the
            merger
            and integration in the accompanying statements of operations.

For
            the
            fiscal year ended January 3, 2004, the Company incurred $10,417 of merger
            and
            integration and merger-related restructuring expenses and none for the
            years
            ended December 31, 2005 and January 1, 2005, respectively.

Sales
            Returns and Allowances

The
            Company’s accounting policy for sales returns and allowances consists of
            establishing reserves for anticipated returns at the time of sale. The
            Company
            anticipated returns based on current sales levels and the Company’s historical
            return experience on a specific product basis.

Warranty
            Costs

The
            Company's vendors are primarily responsible for warranty claims. Warranty
            costs
            relating to merchandise (primarily batteries) and services sold under
            warranty,
            which are not covered by vendors' warranties, are estimated based on
            the
            Company's historical experience and are recorded in the period the product
            is
            sold. The Company has applied the disclosure requirements of Financial
            Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's
            Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including the
            Indirect
            Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" as they relate to warranties. The

            reserves.

Reserves
                      at the beginning of fiscal 2004 included $1,656 of reserves
                      established
                      for the transition of the discontinued operations of the wholesale
                      dealer
                      network. Substantially all these reserves were utilized during
                      fiscal
                      2004.

Revenue
            Recognition and Trade Receivables

The
            Company recognizes merchandise revenue at the point of sale to customers.
            The
            Company establishes reserves for returns and allowances at the time of
            sale
            based on current sales levels and historical return rates. The majority
            of sales
            are made for cash; however, the Company extends credit to certain commercial
            customers through a third-party provider of private label credit cards.
            In
            August 2005, the Company began using a new third party to process its
            private
            label credit card transactions subsequent to the sale of its existing
            credit
            card portfolio. Under the new arrangement, receivables under the private
            label
            credit card program are generally transferred to a new third-party provider
            with
            no recourse. The Company will continue to transfer a limited amount of
            receivables with recourse. The Company provides an allowance for doubtful
            accounts on receivables sold with recourse based upon factors related
            to credit
            risk of specific customers, historical trends and other information.
            Receivables
            sold with recourse are accounted for as a secured borrowing. Receivables
            and the
            related secured borrowings under the private label credit card were $587
            and
            $26,898 at December 31, 2005 and January 1, 2005, respectively, and are
            included
            in accounts receivable and other current liabilities, respectively, in
            the
            accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Earnings
            Per Share of Common Stock

Basic
            earnings per share of common stock has been computed based on the
            weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
            Diluted
            earnings per share of common stock reflects the increase in the weighted-average
            number of common shares outstanding assuming the exercise of outstanding
            stock
            options, calculated on the treasury stock method. There were 517, 510
            and 89
            antidilutive options for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2005, January
            1,
            2005 and January 3, 2004, respectively.

Stock
            Split

On
            August
            10, 2005, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a three-for-two stock split
            of the Company’s common stock, effected as a 50% stock dividend. The dividend
            was distributed on September 23, 2005 to holders of record as of September
            9,
            2005 and the Company’s stock began trading on a post-split basis on September
            26, 2005. All share and per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated
            financial statements have been restated to reflect the effects of the
            stock
            split.

Accounting
            for Stock-Based Compensation

The
            Company has stock-based compensation plans including fixed stock option
            plans,
            deferred stock units and an employee stock purchase plan. As permitted
            under
            Statement of Financial Accounting Standard, or SFAS, No. 123, “Accounting for
            Stock-Based Compensation,” the Company accounts for its stock options using the
            intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board, or
            APB,
            Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”, or APB No. 25. Under
            APB No. 25, compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess,

any,
            of
            the market price of the Company’s common stock at the measurement date over the
            exercise price. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized compensation
            expense
            on the issuance of its fixed options as the exercise price equaled the
            fair
            market value of the underlying stock on the grant date. In addition,
            the Company
            has not recognized compensation expense under APB No. 25 for its employee
            stock
            purchase plan since it is a plan that qualifies under Section 423 of
            the
            Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The issuance of deferred stock
            units
            results in compensation expense as discussed in the Stock-Based Compensation
            footnote (Note 20).

As
            required by SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition
            and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123,” the following table
            reflects the impact on net income and earnings per share as if the Company
            had
            adopted the fair value method of recognizing stock-based compensation
            costs as
            prescribed by SFAS No. 123.

            $5.07 per share, respectively.

Goodwill
            and Other Intangible Assets

In
            accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” the
            Company tests goodwill for impairment at least on an annual basis. Testing
            for
            impairment is a two-step process as prescribed in SFAS No. 142. The first
            step
            is a review for potential impairment, while the second step measures
            the amount
            of impairment, if any. Under the guidelines of SFAS No. 142, the Company
            is
            required to perform an impairment test at least on an annual basis at
            any time
            during the fiscal year provided the test is performed at the same time
            every
            year. The Company has elected to complete its annual impairment test
            as of the
            end of its third quarter. An impairment loss would be recognized when
            the
            assets’ fair value is below their carrying value.

Valuation
                of Long-Lived Assets

The
            Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets under the
            provisions of SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
            Long-Lived Assets.” SFAS No. 144 requires the review for impairment of
            long-lived assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
            that the
            carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable and exceeds its
            fair
            value.

Significant
            factors, which would trigger an impairment review, include the
            following:

·

Significant
                                      negative industry trends;

·

Significant
                                      changes in technology;

·

Significant
                                      underutilization of assets; and

·

Significant
                                    changes in how assets are used or are planned
                                    to be
                                    used.

When
            such
            an event occurs, the Company estimates the future cash flows expected
            to result
            from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. These impairment
            evaluations involve estimates of asset useful lives and future cash flows.
            If
            the undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying
            amount of
            the asset and the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value,
            an
            impairment loss is recognized. Management utilizes an expected present
            value
            technique, which uses a risk-free rate and multiple cash flow scenarios
            reflecting the range of possible outcomes, to estimate fair value of
            the asset.
            Actual useful lives and cash flows could differ from those estimated
            by
            management using these techniques, which could have a material affect
            on our
            results of operations, financial position or liquidity. There were no
            reductions
            to the carrying amounts currently assigned to the Company’s long-lived assets
            during fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Financed
            Vendor Accounts Payable

In
            fiscal
            2004, the Company entered a short-term financing program with a bank
            allowing it
            to extend its payment terms on certain merchandise purchases. The substance
            of
            the program is for the Company to borrow money from the bank to finance
            purchases from vendors. The Company records any discount given by the
            vendor to
            the value of its inventory and accretes this discount to the resulting
            short-term payable to the bank through interest expense over the extended
            term.
            At December 31, 2005 and January 1, 2005, $119,351 and $56,896, respectively,
            was payable to the bank by the Company under this program and is included
            in the
            accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as Financed Vendor
            Accounts
            Payable.

Lease
            Accounting

The
            Company leases certain store locations, distribution centers, office
            space,
            equipment and vehicles, some of which are with related parties. Initial
            terms
            for facility leases are typically 10 to 15 years, followed by additional
            terms
            containing renewal options at 5 year intervals, and may include rent
            escalation
            clauses. The total amount of the minimum rent is expensed on a straight-line
            basis over the initial term of the lease unless external economic factors
            exist
            such that renewals are reasonably assured, in which case the Company
            would
            include the renewal period in its amortization period.

In
            those
            instances the renewal period would be included in the lease term for
            purposes of
            establishing an amortization period and determining if such lease qualified
            as a
            capital or operating lease.

In
            addition to minimum fixed rentals, some leases provide for contingent
            facility
            rentals. Contingent facility rentals are determined on the basis of a
            percentage
            of sales in excess of stipulated minimums for certain store facilities
            as
            defined in the individual lease agreements. Most of the leases provide
            that the
            Company pay taxes, maintenance, insurance and certain other expenses
            applicable
            to the leased premises and include options to renew. Management expects
            that, in
            the normal course of business, leases that expire will be renewed or
            replaced by
            other leases.

Hedge
            Activities

The
            Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to limit its cash
            flow
            risk on its variable rate debt. In March 2005, the Company entered into
            three
            interest rate swap agreements on an aggregate of $175,000 of debt under
            its
            senior credit facility. The detail for the individual swaps is as
            follows:

·

The
                                      first swap fixed the Company’s LIBOR rate at 4.153% on $50,000 of debt for
                                      a term of 48 months, expiring in March
                                      2009.

·

The
                                      second swap fixed the Company’s LIBOR rate at 4.255% on $75,000 of debt
                                      for a term of 60 months, expiring in February
                                      2010.

·

Beginning
                                      in March 2006, the third swap will fix the
                                      Company’s LIBOR rate at 4.6125%
                                      on $50,000 of debt for a term of 54 months,
                                      expiring in September
                                      2010.

Additionally,
            the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements in March 2003
            to
            limit its cash flow risk on an aggregate of $125,000 of its variable
            rate debt.
            The first swap allows the Company to fix its LIBOR rate at 2.269% on
            $75,000 of
            debt for a term of 36 months, expiring in March 2006. The second swap,
            which
            fixed the Company’s LIBOR rate at 1.79% on $50,000 of variable rate debt,
            expired in March 2005.

In
            accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
            Activities,” or SFAS No. 133 the fair value of these hedges is recorded as
            an asset or liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
            at
            December 31, 2005 and January 1, 2005, respectively. The Company uses
            the
“matched terms” accounting method as provided by Derivative Implementation Group
            Issue No. G9, “Assuming No Ineffectiveness When Critical Terms of the Hedging
            Instrument and the Hedge Transaction Match in a Cash Flow Hedge” for the
            interest rate swaps. Accordingly, the Company has matched the critical
            terms of
            each hedge instrument to the hedged debt. Therefore, the Company has
            recorded
            all adjustments to the fair value of the hedge instruments in accumulated
            other
            comprehensive income through the maturity date of the applicable hedge
            arrangement. The fair value at December 31, 2005 was an unrecognized
            gain of
            $3,090 on the swaps. Any amounts received or paid under these hedges
            will be
            recorded in the statement of operations as earned or incurred. Comprehensive
            income for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2005, January 1, 2005
            and January
            3, 2004 is as follows:

            products, services, major customers and geographic areas. Subsequent
            to the
            disposal of the Company’s Wholesale Distribution Network (Note 5) and prior to
            the acquisition of Autopart International, or AI, in September 2005, the
            Company operated in one business segment as defined by the provisions
            of SFAS
            No. 131. AI’s results of operations and financial position for the year ended
            December 31, 2005 were insignificant to our consolidated operations due
            to the
            timing of the acquisition. In addition, the Company is evaluating the
            nature of
            the AI operations as it relates to the Company’s consolidated operations and
            related segment disclosure requirements, if any.

Recent
                Accounting Pronouncements

In
            November 2004 the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costs". The statement
            amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4, "Inventory Pricing,"
            to
            clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense,
            freight,
            handling costs and wasted material. This statement requires that those
            items be
            recognized as current-period charges and requires that allocation of
            fixed
            production overheads to the cost of conversion be based on the normal
            capacity
            of the production facilities. This statement is effective for fiscal
            years
            beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company does not expect the adoption
            of this
            statement to have a material impact on its financial condition, results
            of
            operations or cash flows.

In
            December 2004 the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based
            Payment", or SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R replaces SFAS No. 123 and supersedes
            APB Opinion No. 25 and subsequently issued stock option related guidance.
            SFAS
            No. 123R establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in
            which an
            entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, primarily
            on
            accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services
            in
            share-based payment transactions. It also addresses transactions in which
            an
            entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are
            based on
            the fair value of the entity’s equity instruments or that may be settled by the
            issuance of those equity instruments. Entities will be required to measure
            the
            cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity
            instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited
            exceptions). That cost will be recognized over the period during which
            an
            employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (usually
            the
            vesting period). The grant-date fair value of employee share options
            and similar
            instruments will be estimated using option-pricing models. If an equity
            award is
            modified after the grant date, incremental compensation cost will be
            recognized
            in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award
            over
            the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification.

The
            Company is required to apply SFAS No. 123R to all stock or stock-based
            awards
            outstanding and subsequently granted, modified or settled as of January
            1, 2006.
            SFAS No. 123R requires the Company to use either the modified-prospective
            method
            or modified-retrospective method. Under the modified-prospective method,
            the
            Company must recognize compensation cost for all awards subsequent to
            adopting
            the standard and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards
            outstanding upon adoption. Under the modified-retrospective method, the
            Company
            must restate its previously issued financial statements to recognize
            the amounts
            the Company previously calculated and reported on a pro forma basis,
            as if the
            prior standard had been adopted. Under both methods, SFAS No. 123R permits
            the
            use of either the straight line or an accelerated method to amortize
            the cost as
            an expense for awards with graded vesting.

The
            Company has completed its analysis of the impact of SFAS No. 123R. It
            has
            decided to use the modified-prospective method of implementation as of
            January
            1, 2006. The Company plans to use the Black-Scholes option pricing model
            to
            value all options and straight-line method to amortize this fair value
            as
            compensation cost over the required service period. The Company expects
            the
            implementation of SFAS No. 123R will decrease diluted earnings per share
            by
            approximately $0.12 for fiscal 2006.

In
            May
            2005 the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.”
This statement replaces APB Opinion No. 20, “Accounting Changes,” and FASB
            Statement No. 3 “Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements.”
This Statement requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial
            statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable
            to
            determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect
            of the
            change. The Company does not expect the adoption of this statement to
            have a
            material impact on its financial condition, results of operations or
            cash
            flows.

In
            March
            2005 the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional
            Asset Retirement Obligations - an interpretation of FASB Statement No.
            143”, or
            FIN 47. FIN 47 clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation
            used
            in FASB No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations", as a legal
            obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing
            and (or)
            method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may
            not be
            within the control of the entity. FIN 47 requires an entity to recognize
            a
            liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation if sufficient
            information exists to reasonably estimate fair value of the obligation.
            FIN 47
            also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably
            estimate the fair

            years
            ending after December 15, 2005. The Company adopted FIN 47 in the fourth
            quarter
            of fiscal 2005 with no impact to its financial condition, results of
            operations
            or cash flows.

In
            February 2006 the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, “Accounting for Certain Hybrid
            Financial Instruments - an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140.” This
            statement simplifies accounting for certain hybrid instruments currently
            governed by SFAS No. 133 by allowing fair value remeasurement of hybrid
            instruments that contain an embedded derivative that otherwise would
            require
            bifurcation. This statement also eliminates the guidance in SFAS No.

            Interests in Securitized Financial Assets,” which provides such beneficial

            Acquisitions:

On
            September 14, 2005, the Company completed its acquisition of Autopart
            International, Inc. The acquisition, which included 61 stores throughout
            New
            England and New York, a distribution center and AI’s wholesale distribution
            business, will complement the Company’s growing presence in the Northeast. AI’s
            business serves the growing commercial market in addition to warehouse
            distributors and jobbers.

The
            acquisition has been accounted for under the provisions of SFAS No. 141,
            “Business Combinations”, or SFAS No. 141, and, accordingly, AI’s results of
            operations have been included in the Company’s consolidated statement of
            operations from the acquisition date to December 31, 2005. The total
            purchase
            price of AI consists of $87,440, of which $74,940 was paid upon closing
            with an
            additional $12,500 of contingent consideration payable no later than
            April 1,
            2006 based upon AI satisfying certain earnings before interest, taxes,
            depreciation and amortization targets through December 31, 2005. Furthermore,
            an
            additional $12,500 is payable upon the achievement of certain synergies,
            as
            defined in the Purchase Agreement, through fiscal 2008. In accordance
            with SFAS
            No. 141, this additional payment does not represent contingent consideration
            and
            will be reflected in the statement of operations when earned. Due to
            the timing
            of this acquisition, the purchase price has preliminarily been allocated
            to the
            assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based upon estimates of fair
            values
            at the date of acquisition. This preliminary allocation resulted in the
            recognition of $50,439 in goodwill, all of which is deductible for tax
            purposes,
            and is subject to the finalization of the valuation of certain identifiable
            intangibles. The following table summarizes the amounts assigned to assets
            acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition:

            including 19 stores in the greater Boston area.

            Catastrophic Losses and Insurance Recoveries:

During
            the second half of fiscal 2005, the Company suffered losses resulting
            from
            Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma as well as two stores damaged by fire.
            The
            Company has estimated and recognized the fixed costs of these events
            including
            the write-off of damaged merchandise at cost, damaged capital assets
            at net book
            value and required repair costs. Moreover, these hurricanes caused significant
            sales disruptions primarily from store closures, stores operating on
            limited
            hours and lower sales trends due to evacuations. The Company also incurred
            and
            recognized incremental expenses associated with compensating team members
            for
            scheduled work hours for which stores were closed and food and supplies
            provided
            to team members and their families. While these costs and sales disruptions
            are
            not recoverable from the Company’s insurance carrier, the Company does maintain
            property insurance against the fixed costs of the related physical damage
            including the recovery of damaged merchandise at retail values and damaged
            capital assets at replacement cost. Prior to December 31, 2005, the Company
            and
            the insurance carrier settled in full a claim for the retail value of
            certain
            merchandise inventory damaged by Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma. The Company
            has
            evaluated and recognized a receivable for the recovery of these fixed
            costs, net
            of deductibles. The following table represents the net impact of certain
            insured
            fixed costs less recoveries as reflected in the selling, general and
            administrative line of the accompanying condensed consolidated statement
            of
            operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005. At December 31,
            2005,
            seven stores remain closed as a result of these events.

            the
            remaining retail value of damaged merchandise and the replacement value
            of
            damaged capital assets not previously settled.

5.
            Discontinued Operations:

On
            December 19, 2003, the Company discontinued the supply of merchandise
            to its
            Wholesale Distribution Network, or Wholesale. Wholesale consisted of
            independently owned and operated dealer locations, for which the Company
            supplied merchandise inventory. This component of the Company’s business
            operated in the Company’s previously reported wholesale segment. The Company has
            accounted for the discontinuance of the wholesale segment in accordance
            with
            SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.”
The Company has classified these operating results as discontinued operations
            in
            the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal
            year ended
            January 3, 2004. For the fiscal year ended January 3, 2004, the Wholesale
            Distribution Network had revenues of $52,486. For the fiscal year ended
            January
            1, 2005, the operating results related to the discontinued wholesale
            business
            were minimal as a result of recognizing an estimate of exit costs in
            fiscal
            2003.

The
            discontinued wholesale segment, excluding certain allocated and team
            member
            benefit expenses, represented the entire results of operations previously
            reported in that segment. These excluded expenses represented $2,361
            of
            allocated and team member benefit expenses for fiscal 2003, which remain
            a
            component of income from continuing operations and have therefore been
            excluded
            from discontinued operations. The Company has allocated corporate interest
            expenses incurred under the Company’s senior credit facility and subordinated
            notes. The allocated interest complies with the provisions of Emerging
            Issue
            Task Force No. 87-24, “Allocation of Interest to Discontinued Operations,” and
            is reported in discontinued operations on the accompanying statement
            of
            operations. This amount was $484 for fiscal 2003. The loss on the discontinued
            operations of Wholesale for fiscal 2003 included $2,693 of exit costs
            as
            follows:

            Closed Store and Restructuring Liabilities:

The
            Company continually reviews the operating performance of its existing
            store
            locations and closes certain locations identified as under performing.
            Closing
            an under performing location has not resulted in the elimination of the
            operations and associated cash flows from the Company’s ongoing operations as
            the Company transfers those operations to another location in the local
            market.

            provisions established for closed store liabilities include the present
            value of
            the remaining lease obligations and management’s estimate of future costs of
            insurance, property tax and common area maintenance reduced by the present
            value
            of estimated revenues from subleases and lease buyouts and are established
            by a
            charge to selling, general and administrative costs in the accompanying
            consolidated statements of operations at the time the facilities actually
            close.
            The Company currently uses discount rates ranging from 4.5% to 7.8% for
            estimating these liabilities.

From
            time
            to time these estimates require revisions that affect the amount of the
            recorded
            liability. The above change in estimates relate primarily to changes
            in
            assumptions associated with the revenue from subleases. The effect of
            changes in
            estimates for the closed store liabilities is netted with new provisions
            and
            included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying
            consolidated statements of operations.

In
            August
            2005, the Company began using a new third party provider to process its
            private
            label credit card transactions related to its commercial business. In
            conjunction with this transition, the Company sold the credit card portfolio
            for
            proceeds totaling $33,904. Accordingly, the Company’s previously recorded
            receivable balance recognized under SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and
            Servicing of Financial Assets”, of $34,684 and the corresponding allowance for
            doubtful accounts of $2,580 were reduced to zero. Additionally, the Company
            repaid its borrowings previously secured by these trade receivables;
            the overall
            impact was a benefit of $1,800 recorded as a reduction of bad debt
            expense.

8.
            Inventories, net

Inventories
            are stated at the lower of cost or market, cost being determined using
            the
            last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method for approximately 93% and 92% of inventories
            at December 31, 2005 and January 1, 2005, respectively. Under the LIFO
            method,
            the Company’s cost of sales reflects the costs of the most currently purchased
            inventories while the inventory carrying balance represents the costs
            relating
            to prices paid in prior years. The Company’s costs to acquire inventory have
            been generally decreasing in recent years as a result of its significant
            growth.
            Accordingly, the cost to replace inventory is less than the LIFO balances
            carried for similar product. The Company recorded an increase in cost
            of sales
            of $526 for fiscal year ended 2005 and reductions to cost of sales of
            $11,212
            and $2,156 for fiscal years ended 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The
            remaining inventories are comprised of product cores, which consist of
            the
            non-consumable portion of certain parts and batteries and are valued
            under the
            first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method. Core values are included as part
            of our
            merchandise costs and are either passed on to the customer or returned
            to the
            vendor. Additionally, these products are not subject to the frequent
            cost
            changes like our other merchandise inventory, thus, there is no material
            difference from applying either the LIFO or FIFO valuation methods.

The
            Company capitalizes certain purchasing and warehousing costs into inventory.
            Purchasing and warehousing costs included in inventory, at FIFO, at December
            31,
            2005 and January 1, 2005, were $92,833 and $81,458, respectively. Inventories
            consist of the following:

Inventory
            quantities are tracked through a perpetual inventory system. The Company
            uses a
            cycle counting program in all distribution centers, Parts Delivered Quickly
            warehouses, or PDQs, Local Area Warehouses, or LAWs, and retail stores
            to ensure
            the accuracy of the perpetual inventory quantities of both merchandise
            and core
            inventory. The Company establishes reserves for estimated shrink based
            on
            historical accuracy and effectiveness of the cycle counting program.
            The Company
            also establishes reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories
            based
            on current inventory levels of discontinued product and the historical
            analysis
            of the liquidation of discontinued inventory below cost. The nature of
            the
            Company’s inventory is such that the risk of obsolescence is minimal and excess
            inventory has historically been returned to the Company’s vendors for credit.
            The Company provides reserves when less than full credit is expected
            from a
            vendor or when liquidating product will result in retail prices below
            recorded
            costs. The Company’s reserves against inventory for these matters were $22,825
            and $21,929 at December 31, 2005 and January 1, 2005, respectively.

            Property and Equipment:

Property
            and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and
            amortization. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged directly
            to
            expense when incurred; major improvements are capitalized. When items
            are sold
            or retired, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed
            from the
            accounts, with any gain or loss reflected in the consolidated statements
            of
            operations.

Depreciation
            of land improvements, buildings, furniture, fixtures and equipment, and
            vehicles
            is provided over the estimated useful lives, which range from 2 to 40
            years, of
            the respective assets using the straight-line method. Amortization of
            building
            and leasehold improvements is provided over the shorter of the original
            useful
            lives of the respective assets or the term of the lease using the straight-line
            method. The term of the lease is generally the initial term of the lease
            unless
            external economic factors exist such that renewals are reasonably assured
            in
            which case, the renewal period would be included in the lease term for
            purposes
            of establishing an amortization period. Depreciation and amortization
            expense
            was $119,938, $104,877 and $100,737 for the fiscal years ended 2005,
            2004 and
            2003, respectively.

The

            Long-Lived Assets,” which requires that long-lived assets and certain
            identifiable intangible assets to be disposed of be reported at the lower
            of the
            carrying amount or the fair market value less selling costs. At December

            Long-term Debt:

Long-term
            debt consists of the following:

On
              November 3, 2004, the Company entered into a new amended and restated
              $670,000
              senior credit facility. This new senior credit facility initially provided
              for a
              $200,000 tranche A term loan and a $170,000 tranche B term loan. Proceeds
              from
              these term loans were used to refinance the Company's previously existing
              tranche D and E term loans and revolver under the Company's previous
              senior
              credit facility.

Additionally,
              the new senior credit facility initially provided for a $100,000 delayed
              draw
              term loan, which was available exclusively for stock buybacks under
              the
              Company's stock repurchase program, and a $200,000 revolving facility,
              or the
              revolver (which provides for the issuance of letters of credit with
              a sub limit
              of $70,000).

In
            conjunction with this refinancing, the Company wrote-off existing deferred
            financing costs related to the Company's tranche D and E term loans in
            accordance with EITF Issue No. 96-19, "Debtor's Accounting for a Modification
            or
            Exchange of Debt Instruments". The write-off of these costs combined
            with the
            related refinancing costs incurred to set up the new credit facility
            resulted in
            a loss on extinguishment of debt of $2,818 in the accompanying consolidated
            statements of operations for the year ended January 1, 2005. During fiscal
            2004,
            prior to the refinancing of its credit facility, the Company repaid $105,000
            in
            debt prior to its scheduled maturity. In conjunction with these partial
            repayments, the Company wrote-off deferred financing costs in the amount
            of
            $412, which is classified as a loss on extinguishment of debt in the
            accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended
            January 1,
            2005.

At
            December 31, 2005, the senior credit facility provided for (1) $438,300
            in term
            loans (as detailed above) and (2) $200,000 under a revolving credit facility
            (which provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sub limit
            of
            $70,000).

As
            of
            December 31, 2005, the Company had $54,579 in letters of credit outstanding,
            which reduced availability under the credit facility to $145,421. In
            addition to
            the letters of credit, the Company maintains approximately $1,607 in
            surety
            bonds issued by its insurance provider primarily to utility providers
            and the
            departments of revenue for certain states. These letters of credit and
            surety
            bonds generally have a term of one year or less.

(in
                          thousands, except per share data)

The
            tranche A term loan currently requires scheduled repayments of $7,500
            on March
            31, 2006 and quarterly thereafter through December 31, 2006, $10,000
            on March
            31, 2007 and quarterly thereafter through December 31, 2007, $12,500
            on March
            31, 2008 and quarterly thereafter through June 30, 2009 and $25,000 due
            at
            maturity on September 30, 2009. The tranche B term loan currently requires
            scheduled repayments of $425 on March 31, 2006 and quarterly thereafter,
            with a
            final payment of $160,650 due at maturity on September 30, 2010. The
            delayed
            draw term loan currently requires scheduled repayments of 0.25% of the
            aggregate
            principal amount outstanding on March 31, 2006 and quarterly thereafter,
            with a
            final payment due at maturity on September 30, 2010. The revolver expires
            on
            September 30, 2009. In addition, the Pennsylvania Department of Community
            and
            Economic Development machinery and equipment loan fund, or MELF, loan
            currently
            requires nominal monthly principal repayments ranging from $5 to $7 until
            maturity on January 1, 2010.

The
            interest rates on the tranche A and B term loans, the delayed term loan
            and the
            revolver are based, at the Company’s option, on an adjusted LIBOR rate, plus a
            margin, or an alternate base rate, plus a margin. The current margin
            for the
            tranche A term loan and revolver is 1.25% and 0.25% per annum for the
            adjusted
            LIBOR and alternate base rate borrowings, respectively. The current margin
            for
            the tranche B loan and the delayed draw term loan is 1.50% and 0.50%
            per annum
            for the adjusted LIBOR and alternative base rate borrowings, respectively.
            Additionally, a commitment fee of 0.25% per annum will be charged on
            the unused
            portion of the revolver, payable in arrears. The effective interest rate
            on the
            MELF loan is 2.75%.

Borrowings
            under the senior credit facility are required to be prepaid, subject
            to certain
            exceptions, with (1) 50% of the Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the senior
            credit facility) unless the Company’s Senior Leverage Ratio (as defined in the
            senior credit facility) at the end of any fiscal year is less than or
            equal to
            1.00, in which case 25% of Excess Cash Flow for such fiscal year will
            be
            required to be repaid, (2) 100% of the net cash proceeds of all asset
            sales or
            other dispositions of property by the Company and its subsidiaries, subject
            to
            certain exceptions (including exceptions for reinvestment of certain
            asset sale
            proceeds within 270 days of such sale and certain sale-leaseback transactions),
            and (3) 100% of the net proceeds of certain issuances of debt or equity
            by the
            Company and its subsidiaries.

Voluntary
            prepayments and voluntary reductions of the unutilized portion of the
            revolver
            are permitted in whole or in part, at the Company’s option, in minimum principal
            amounts specified in the senior credit facility, without premium or penalty,
            subject to reimbursement of the lenders’ redeployment costs in the case of a
            prepayment of adjusted LIBOR borrowings other than on the last day of
            the
            relevant interest period. Voluntary prepayments will (1) generally be
            allocated among the facilities on a pro rata basis (based on the then
            outstanding principal amount of the loans under each facility) and (2)
            within
            each such facility, be applied to the installments under the amortization
            schedule within the following 12 months under such facility until eliminated.
            All remaining amounts of prepayments will be applied pro rata to the
            remaining
            amortization payments under such facility. The senior credit facility
            also
            provides for customary events of default, including non-payment defaults,
            covenant defaults and cross-defaults to the Company's other material
            indebtedness.

The
            senior credit facility is guaranteed by the Company and by each of its
            existing
            domestic subsidiaries and will be guaranteed by all future domestic
            subsidiaries. The facility is secured by a first priority lien on substantially
            all, subject to certain exceptions, of the Advance Stores’ properties and assets
            and the properties and assets of its existing domestic subsidiaries and
            will be
            secured by the properties and assets of its future domestic subsidiaries.
            The
            senior credit facility contains covenants restricting the ability of
            the Company
            and its subsidiaries to, among other things, (1) declare dividends or
            redeem or
            repurchase capital stock, (2) prepay, redeem or purchase debt, (3) incur
            liens
            or engage in sale-leaseback transactions, (4) make loans and investments,
            (5)
            incur additional debt (including hedging arrangements), (6) engage in
            certain mergers, acquisitions and asset sales, (7) engage in transactions
            with
            affiliates, (8) change the nature of the Company’s business and the business
            conducted by its subsidiaries and (9) change the holding company status
            of the
            Company. The Company is required to comply with financial covenants with
            respect
            to a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum interest coverage ratio, a minimum
            current assets to funded senior debt ratio, a maximum senior leverage
            ratio and
            maximum limits on capital expenditures.

During
            fiscal 2003, the Company completed the redemption of its outstanding
            senior
            subordinated notes and senior discount debentures. Incremental facilities
            were
            added to fund the redemption in the form of a tranche A-1 term loan facility
            of
            $75,000 and tranche C-1 term loan facility of $275,000. In conjunction
            with this
            redemption and overall partial repayment of $54,433,

the
            Company wrote-off deferred financing costs. The write-off of these costs
            combined with the accretion of the discounts and related premiums paid
            on the
            repurchase of the senior subordinated notes and senior discount debentures
            resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt

of
            $46,887 in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for
            the year
            ended January 3, 2004.

During
            the remainder of fiscal 2003, the Company repaid $236,089 of its terms
            loans
            under the senior credit facility. In conjunction with this partial repayment,
            the Company wrote-off additional deferred financing costs in the amount
            of $401,
            which is classified as a loss on extinguishment of debt in the accompanying
            consolidated statements of operations for the year ended January 3, 2004.

Additionally
            in December 2003, the Company refinanced the remaining portion of its
            tranche A,
            A-1, C and C-1 term loan facilities under the previous senior credit
            facility by
            amending and restating the credit facility to add a new $100,000 tranche
            D term
            loan facility and $340,000 tranche E term loan facility. The borrowings
            under
            the tranche D term loan facility and tranche E term loan facility were
            used to
            replace the tranche A, A-1, C and C-1 term loan facilities.

As
            of
            December 31, 2005, the Company was in compliance with the covenants of
            the
            senior credit facility. Substantially all of the net assets of the Company’s
            subsidiaries are restricted at December 31, 2005.

At
            December 31, 2005, the aggregate future annual maturities of long-term

            Stock Repurchase Program:

During
            the third quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company's Board of Directors authorized
            a
            stock repurchase program of up to $300,000 of the Company's common stock
            plus
            related expenses. The program, which became effective August 15, 2005,
            replaced
            the remaining portion of a $200,000 stock repurchase program authorized
            by the
            Company’s Board of Directors during fiscal 2004. The program allows the Company
            to repurchase its common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated
            transactions from time to time in accordance with the requirements of
            the
            Securities and Exchange Commission. During fiscal 2005, the Company repurchased
            a total of 1,530,675 shares of common stock under the new program, at
            an
            aggregate cost of $59,452, or an average price of $38.84 per share, excluding
            related expenses. At December 31, 2005, 20,800 shares remained unsettled
            representing $889. During the prior repurchase program, the Company repurchased
            7,029,900 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $189,160, or
            an average
            price of $26.91 per share, excluding related expenses.

During
            the third quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company also retired 7,121,850
            shares of
            common stock, of which 91,950 shares were repurchased under the $300,000
            stock
            repurchase plan and 7,029,900 shares were repurchased under the prior
            $200,000
            stock repurchase program.

During

            a loss from
            operations of the discontinued Wholesale Dealer Network of $63 and $572,
            respectively. The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $24 and $220
            related
            to these discontinued operations for the years ended January 1, 2005
            and January
            3, 2004, respectively.

Deferred
            income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years
            of
            differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their
            financial
            reporting amounts at each period-end, based on enacted tax laws and statutory
            income tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are
            expected
            to affect taxable income. Deferred income taxes reflect the net income
            tax
            effect of temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities
            for
            financial reporting purposes and for income tax reporting purposes. Net
            deferred
            income tax balances are comprised of the following:

At
            December 31, 2005 and January 1, 2005, the Company has cumulative net
            deferred
            income tax liabilities of $72,087 and $69,297, respectively. The gross
            deferred
            income tax assets also include state net operating loss carryforwards,
            or NOLs,
            of approximately $1,579 and $3,720, respectively. These NOLs may be used
            to
            reduce future taxable income and expire periodically through fiscal year
            2024.
            The Company believes it will realize these tax benefits through a combination
            of
            the reversal of temporary differences, projected future taxable income
            during
            the NOL carryforward periods and available tax planning strategies. Due
            to
            uncertainties related to the realization of certain deferred tax assets
            for NOLs
            in various jurisdictions, the Company recorded a valuation allowance
            of $1,104
            as of December 31, 2005 and $1,029 as of January 1, 2005. The amount
            of deferred
            income tax assets realizable, however, could change in the near future
            if
            estimates of future taxable income are changed.

Temporary
            differences which give rise to significant deferred income tax assets
            (liabilities) are as follows:

The
            Company currently has certain years that are open to audit by the Internal
            Revenue Service. In addition, the Company has certain years that are
            open for
            audit by various state and foreign jurisdictions for income taxes and
            sales, use
            and excise taxes. In management's opinion, any amounts assessed will
            not have a

            or
            liquidity.

16.
            Lease Commitments:

The
            Company leases certain store locations, distribution centers, office
            space,
            equipment and vehicles, some of which are with related parties. Initial
            terms
            for facility leases are typically 10 to 15 years, followed by additional
            terms
            containing renewal options at 5 year intervals, and may include rent
            escalation
            clauses. The total amount of the minimum rent is expensed on a straight-line
            basis over the initial term of the lease unless external economic factors
            exist
            such that renewals are reasonably assured, in which case the Company
            would
            include the renewal

period
            in
            its amortization period. In addition to minimum fixed rentals, some leases
            provide for contingent facility rentals. Contingent facility rentals
            are
            determined on the basis of a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated
            minimums for certain store facilities as defined in the individual lease
            agreements. Most of the leases provide that the Company pays taxes, maintenance,
            insurance and certain other expenses applicable to the leased premises
            and
            include options to renew. Management expects that, in the normal course
            of
            business, leases that expire will be renewed or replaced by other leases.

At
            December 31, 2005, future minimum lease payments due under non-cancelable
            operating leases with lease terms ranging from one year through the year
            are as follows:

18.
            Contingencies:

In
            the
            case of all known contingencies, the Company accrues for an obligation,
            including estimated legal costs, when it is probable and the amount is
            reasonably estimable. As facts concerning contingencies become known
            to the
            Company, the Company reassesses its position with respect to accrued
            liabilities
            and other potential exposures. Estimates that are particularly sensitive
            to
            future change include tax and legal matters, which are subject to change
            as
            events evolve, and as additional information becomes available during
            the
            administrative and litigation process.

The
            Company’s Western Auto subsidiary, together with other defendants including
            automobile manufacturers, automotive parts manufacturers and other retailers,
            has been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging injury as a result
            of
            exposure to asbestos-containing products. The Company and some of its
            subsidiaries also have been named as defendants in many of these lawsuits.
            The
            plaintiffs have alleged that these products were manufactured, distributed
            and/or sold by the various defendants. To date, these products have included
            brake and clutch parts and roofing materials. Many of the cases pending
            against
            the Company or its subsidiaries are in the early stages of litigation.
            The
            damages claimed against the defendants in some of these proceedings are
            substantial. Additionally, some of the automotive parts manufacturers
            named as
            defendants in these lawsuits have declared bankruptcy, which will limit
            plaintiffs’ ability to recover monetary damages from those defendants. Although
            the Company diligently defends against these claims, the Company may
            enter into
            discussions regarding settlement of these and other lawsuits, and may
            enter into
            settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interests
            of the
            Company’s shareholders. The Company believes that most of these claims are at
            least partially covered by insurance. Based on discovery to date, the
            Company
            does not believe the cases currently pending will have a material adverse
            effect
            on the Company’s operating results, financial position or liquidity. However, if
            the Company was to incur an adverse verdict in one or more of these claims
            and
            was ordered to pay damages that were not covered by insurance, these
            claims
            could have a material adverse affect on its operating results, financial
            position and liquidity. If the number of claims filed against the Company
            or any
            of its subsidiaries alleging injury as a result of exposure to
            asbestos-containing products increases substantially, the costs associated
            with
            concluding these claims, including damages resulting from any adverse
            verdicts,
            could have a material adverse effect on its operating results, financial
            position or liquidity in future periods.

The
            Company is involved in various types of legal proceedings arising from
            claims of
            employment discrimination or other types of employment matters as a result
            of
            claims by current and former employees. The damages claimed against the
            Company
            in some of these proceedings are substantial; however, because of the
            uncertainty of the outcome of such legal proceedings and because the
            Company’s
            liability, if any, arising from such legal matters, including the size
            of any
            damages awarded if plaintiffs are successful in litigation or any negotiated
            settlement, could vary widely, the Company cannot reasonably estimate
            the
            possible loss or range of loss which may arise. The Company is also involved
            in
            various other claims and legal proceedings arising in the normal course
            of
            business. Although the final outcome of these legal matters cannot be
            determined, based on the facts presently known, it is management’s opinion that
            the final outcome of such claims and lawsuits will not have a material
            adverse
            effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or
            liquidity.

The
            Company is self-insured for general and automobile liability, workers'
            compensation and the health care claims of its team members although
            the Company
            maintains stop-loss coverage with third-party insurers to limit its total
            liability exposure. Liabilities associated with these losses are calculated
            for
            claims filed and claims incurred but not yet reported at the Company's
            estimate
            of their ultimate cost based upon analyses of historical data, demographic
            and
            severity factors and periodic valuations provided by third-party actuaries.
            Management monitors new claims and claim development as well as negative
            trends
            related to the claims incurred but not reported in order to assess the
            adequacy
            of the Company’s insurance reserves. While the Company does not expect the
            amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from its estimates, the
            self-insurance reserves could be affected if future claim experience
            differs
            significantly from the historical trends and the actuarial
            assumptions.

The
            Company accrues for tax contingencies when it is probable that a liability
            to a
            taxing authority has been incurred and the amount of the contingency
            can be
            reasonably estimated, based on past experience. The Company’s tax contingency
            reserve is adjusted for changes in circumstances and additional uncertainties,
            such as significant amendments to existing tax law, both legislated and
            concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems. The Company had
            a tax contingency reserve of $7,588 and $7,576 at December 31, 2005 and
            January
            1, 2005,

respectively.
            It is the opinion of the Company’s management that the possibility is remote
            that costs in excess of those reserved for will have a material adverse
            impact
            on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or
            liquidity.

The
              Company has entered into employment agreements with certain team members
              that
              provide severance pay benefits under certain circumstances after a
              change in
              control of the Company or upon termination of the team member by the
              Company.
              The maximum contingent liability under these employment agreements
              is
              approximately $1,617 and $2,491 at December 31, 2005 and January 1,
              2005,
              respectively, of which nothing has been accrued.

19.
            Benefit Plans:

401(k)
            Plan

The
            Company maintains a defined contribution team member benefit plan, which
            covers
            substantially all team members after one year of service and have attained
            the
            age of twenty-one. The plan allows for team member salary deferrals,
            which are
            matched at the Company’s discretion. Company contributions were $6,779, $6,752
            and $6,398 in fiscal 2005, fiscal 2004, and fiscal 2003, respectively.

The
            Company also maintains a profit sharing plan covering Western team members
            that
            was frozen prior to the Western Merger on November 2, 1998. This plan
            covered
            all full-time team members who had completed one year of service and
            had
            attained the age of twenty-one.

Deferred
            Compensation

During
            third quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company established an unqualified
            deferred
            compensation plan for certain team members. The Company has accounted
            for the
            unqualified deferred compensation plan in accordance with EITF 97-14,
            “Accounting for Deferred Compensation Arrangements Where Amounts Earned
            Are Held
            in a Rabbi Trust and Invested.” The liability related to the former Discount
            deferred compensation plan, which was terminated in May 2002, was merged
            into
            the new plan. This plan provides for a minimum and maximum deferral percentage
            of the team member base salary and bonus, as determined by the Retirement
            Plan
            Committee. The Company establishes and maintains a deferred compensation
            liability for this plan. The Company funds this liability by remitting
            the team
            member’s deferrals to a Rabbi Trust where these deferrals are invested in
            certain life insurance contracts. Accordingly, any change in the cash
            surrender
            value on these contracts, which is held in the Rabbi Trust to fund the
            deferred
            compensation liability, is recognized in the Company’s consolidated statement of
            operations. At December 31, 2005 and January 1, 2005 these liabilities
            were
            $2,693 and $1,840, respectively.

The
            Company maintains an unfunded deferred compensation plan established
            for certain
            key team members of Western prior to the fiscal 1998 Western merger.
            The Company
            assumed the plan liability of $15,253 through the Western merger. The
            plan was
            frozen at the date of the Western merger. As of December 31, 2005 and
            January 1,
            2005, $1,321 and $1,598, respectively, was accrued for these plans with
            the
            current portion included in accrued expenses and the long-term portion
            in other
            long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Postretirement
            Plan

The
            Company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for
            eligible
            retired team members through a postretirement plan, or the Plan. These
            benefits
            are subject to deductibles, co-payment provisions and other limitations.
            The
            Plan has no assets and is funded on a cash basis as benefits are paid.
            During
            the second quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company amended the Plan to exclude
            outpatient prescription drug benefits to Medicare eligible retirees effective
            January 1, 2006. Due to this negative plan amendment, the Company's accumulated
            postretirement benefit obligation was reduced by $7,557, resulting in
            an
            unrecognized negative prior service cost in the same amount. The unrecognized
            negative prior service cost is being amortized over the 13-year estimated
            remaining life

expectancy of the plan participants as allowed
            under SFAS No. 106, “Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
            Pensions.”

The
            health care cost trend rate was assumed to be 12.5% for 2006, 11.5% for
            2007,
            10.0% for 2008, 9.5% for 2009, 8.5% for 2010, 8.0% for 2011 and 5.0%
            to 7.0% for
            2012 and thereafter. If the health care cost were increased 1% for all
            future
            years the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation would have increased
            by
            $472 as of December 31, 2005. The effect of this change on the combined
            service
            and interest cost would have been an increase of $72 for 2005. If the
            health
            care cost were decreased 1% for all future years the accumulated postretirement
            benefit obligation would have decreased by $450 as of December 31, 2005.
            The
            effect of this change on the combined service and interest cost would
            have been
            a decrease of $76 for 2005.

The

            discount rates as determined by the Company’s actuaries for each applicable
            year:

The

            at any time. The Company also continues to evaluate ways in which it
            can better
            manage these benefits and control costs. Any changes in the plan or revisions
            to
            assumptions that affect the amount of expected future benefits may have
            a
            significant impact on the amount of the reported obligation, annual expense
            and
            projected benefit payments.

20.
            Stock-Based Compensation:

During
            fiscal 2004, the Company established the Advance Auto Parts, Inc. 2004
            Long-Term
            Incentive Plan, or the LTIP. The LTIP was created to enable the Company
            to
            continue to attract and retain team members of exceptional managerial
            talent
            upon whom, in large measure, its sustained progress, growth and profitability
            depends. The LTIP replaces the Company’s previous senior executive stock option
            plan and executive stock option plan. The stock options that remained
            available
            for future grant under these predecessor plans became available under
            the LTIP
            and thus, no stock options will be available for grant under those plans.
            The
            stock options authorized to be granted are non-qualified stock options
            and
            terminate on the seventh anniversary of the grant date. Additionally,
            the stock
            options vest over a three-year period in equal installments beginning
            on the
            first anniversary grant date.

In
              addition to stock options, the Company also has the ability to offer
              additional
              types of equity incentives as allowed under the LTIP. Accordingly,
              during fiscal
              2004, the Company created the Advance Auto Parts, Inc. Deferred Stock
              Unit Plan
              for Non-Employee Directors and Selected Executives, or the DSU Plan.
              The DSU
              Plan provides for the annual grant of deferred stock units, or DSUs,
              to the
              Company’s Board of Directors as allowed under the LTIP. Each DSU is equivalent
              to one share of common stock of the Company. The DSUs are immediately
              vested
              upon issuance but are held on behalf of the director until he or she
              ceases to
              be a director. The DSUs are then distributed to the director following his
              or her last date of service.

The
            Company granted six and nine DSUs in fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively
            at
            a weighted average fair value of $39.65 and $27.71, respectively. For
            fiscal
            years 2005 and 2004, respectively, the Company recognized a total of
            $237 and
            $494, on a pre-tax basis, in compensation expense related to these DSU
            grants.
            Additionally, the DSU Plan provides for the deferral of compensation
            as earned
            in the form of an annual retainer for board members and wages for certain
            highly
            compensated employees of the Company. These deferred stock units are
            payable to
            the participants at a future date or over a specified time period as
            elected by
            the participants in accordance with the DSU Plan.

Shares
            authorized for grant under the LTIP are 8,620 at December 31, 2005 and
            January
            1, 2005. Subsequent to December 31, 2005, the Company granted 2,049 stock
            options at an exercise price of $40.45.

As
            permitted under SFAS No. 123, the Company accounts for its stock options
            using
            the intrinsic value method prescribed in APB Opinion No. 25. Under APB
            Opinion
            No. 25, compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess,
            if any,
            of the market price of the Company’s common stock at the measurement date over
            the exercise price. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized compensation
            expense on the issuance of its stock options because the exercise price
            equaled
            the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date. No compensation
            expense was required for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2005, January
            1,
            2005 and January 3, 2004.

The
            Company maintains an employee stock purchase plan, which qualifies as
            a
            non-compensatory plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code
            of 1986, as
            amended. In May 2002, the Company registered 2,100 shares with the Securities
            and Exchange Commission to be issued under the plan. Through 2005 all
            eligible
            team members could elect to have a portion of compensation paid in the
            form of
            Company stock in lieu of cash calculated at 85% of fair market value
            at the
            beginning or end of the quarterly purchase period. As a result of the
            non-compensatory nature of this plan, the Company has not recognized
            compensation expense under APB No. 25. However, the Company has recognized
            the
            value of its stock issued under the plan as non-cash compensation in
            selling,

            acquired 110, 177 and 220 shares in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003,
            respectively. At December 31, 2005, there were 1,551 shares available
            to be
            issued under the plan. Effective January 1, 2006, the plan was amended
            such that
            eligible team members may purchase common stock at 95% of fair market
            value.

            Fair Value of Financial Instruments:

The
            carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, bank overdrafts,
            accounts payable, borrowings secured by receivables and current portion
            of
            long-term debt approximates fair value because of the short maturity
            of those
            instruments. The carrying amount for variable rate long-term debt approximates
            fair value for similar issues available to the Company. The Company’s interest
            rate swaps are presented at fair value as stated in its accounting policy
            on
            hedge activities (Note 2).

                      2005.

We
            have
            audited the consolidated financial statements of Advance Auto Parts,
            Inc. and
            subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2005 and January 1, 2005,
            and for
            each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005, management’s
            assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
            reporting as of December 31, 2005, and the effectiveness of the Company’s
            internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, and
            have
            issued our reports thereon dated March 14, 2006; such consolidated financial
            statements and reports are included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Our
            audits also
            included the consolidated financial statement schedules of the Company,
            listed
            in Item 15 (a) (2). These consolidated financial statement schedules
            are the
            responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
            opinion based on our audits. In our opinion, such consolidated financial
            statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
            financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material
            respects,
            the information set forth therein.

1.
              Presentation

These
            condensed financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules
            and
            regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information
            and
            note disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared
            in
            accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
            States of
            America have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations,
            although management believes that the disclosures made are adequate to
            make the
            information presented not misleading.

2.
            Organization

Advance
            Auto Parts, Inc. (“the Company”) is a holding company, which was the 100%
            shareholder of Advance Stores Company, Incorporated and its subsidiaries
            ("Stores") during the periods presented. The parent/subsidiary relationship
            between the Company and Stores includes certain related party transactions.
            These transactions consist primarily of interest on intercompany advances,
            dividends, capital contributions and allocations of certain costs. Deferred
            income taxes have not been provided for financial reporting and tax basis
            differences on the undistributed earnings of the subsidiaries.

3.
            Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Accounting
            Period

The
            Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of December,
            which
            results in an extra week every six years. Accordingly, fiscal 2003 includes
            weeks of operations. All other fiscal years presented include 52 weeks
            of
            operations.

Recent
            Accounting Pronouncements

In
            May
            2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.”
This statement replaces APB Opinion No. 20, “Accounting Changes,” and FASB
            Statement No. 3 “Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements.”
This Statement requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial
            statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable
            to
            determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect
            of the
            change. We do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material
            impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

Stock
            Split

On
            August
            10, 2005, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a three-for-two stock split
            of the Company’s common stock, effected as a 50% stock dividend. The dividend
            was distributed on September 23, 2005 to holders of record as of September
            9,
            2005 and the Company’s stock began trading on a post-split basis on September
            26, 2005. All share and per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated
            financial statements have been restated to reflect the effects of the
            stock
            split.
