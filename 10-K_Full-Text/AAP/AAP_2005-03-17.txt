PART I

Item 1.    Business.

Unless
the context otherwise requires, “Advance,” “we,” “us,”
“our,” and similar terms refer to Advance Auto Parts, Inc., its predecessor, its
subsidiaries and their respective operations. Our fiscal year consists of 52 or 53 weeks
ending on the Saturday closest to December 31 of each year. Fiscal 2003 included 53 weeks
of operations. All other fiscal years presented included 52 weeks of operations.

Overview

We
primarily operate within the United States automotive aftermarket industry, which includes
replacement parts (excluding tires), accessories, maintenance items, batteries and
automotive chemicals for cars and light trucks (pickup trucks, vans, minivans and sport
utility vehicles). We currently are the second largest specialty retailer of automotive
parts, accessories and maintenance items to “do-it-yourself,” or DIY, customers
in the United States, based on store count and sales. Our combined operations are
conducted in one operating segment subsequent to the discontinuation of our wholesale
distribution network in 2003.

We
were formed in 1929 and operated as a retailer of general merchandise until the 1980s.
During the 1980s, we sharpened our focus to target sales of automotive parts and
accessories to DIY customers. From the 1980s to the present, we have grown significantly
as a result of strong comparable store sales growth, new store openings and strategic
acquisitions, including our 1998 Western Auto Supply Company acquisition and our 2001
acquisition of Discount Auto Parts, or Discount. Additionally, in 1996, we began to
aggressively expand our sales to “do-it-for-me,” or DIFM, customers by
implementing a commercial delivery program.

At
January 1, 2005, we operated 2,652 stores within the United States, Puerto Rico and the
Virgin Islands. We operated 2,617 stores throughout 39 states in the Northeastern,
Southeastern and Midwestern regions of the United States. These stores operated under the
“Advance Auto Parts” trade name except for certain stores in the state of
Florida, which operated under “Advance Discount Auto Parts” or “Discount
Auto Parts” trade names. Our stores offer a broad selection of brand name and
proprietary automotive replacement parts, accessories and maintenance items for domestic
and imported cars and light trucks, with no significant concentration in any specific
area. In addition, we operated 35 stores under the “Western Auto” trade name,
located primarily in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, which offer automotive tires and
service in addition to automotive parts, accessories and maintenance items.

In
addition to our DIY business, we serve DIFM customers via sales to commercial accounts.
Sales to DIFM customers represented approximately 18% of our retail sales in 2004 and
consisted of sales to both walk-in commercial customers and sales delivered to our
commercial customers’ places of business, including independent garages, service
stations and auto dealers. At January 1, 2005, we had 1,945 stores with commercial
delivery programs.

We
also provide our customers online shopping and access to over 1 million stock keeping
units, or SKUs. Our online site allows our customers to pick up merchandise at a
conveniently located store or have their purchase shipped directly to their home or
business.

Our
Internet address is

www.advanceautoparts.com

. We make available free of charge
through our Internet website our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form
10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished
pursuant to the Securities Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after we
electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.

Discontinued Operations

Prior
to 2004, we operated a wholesale distribution network that we reported as a separate
segment. On December 19, 2003, we discontinued the supplying of merchandise to our
wholesale distribution network. The wholesale distribution network consisted of
independently owned and operated dealer locations, for which we


supplied merchandise
inventory and certain services. Due to the wide variety of products supplied to the
dealers and the reduced concentration of stores spread over a wide geographic area, it had
become difficult to serve these dealers effectively. This component of our business
operated in the previously reported wholesale segment and, excluding certain allocated and
team member benefit expenses of $2.4 million and $3.3 million for fiscal years 2003 and
2002, represented the entire results of operations previously reported in that segment. We
have classified these operating results as discontinued operations in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2005, January
3, 2004 and December 28, 2002. Our operating results related to the discontinued wholesale
business were minimal for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2005 as a result of recognizing
an estimate of exit costs in fiscal 2003.

Competitive Strengths

We
believe our competitive strengths include the following:

Leading
Market Position.

We compete in both the DIY and DIFM categories of the
automotive aftermarket industry. Our primary competitors include national and regional
retail automotive parts chains, wholesalers or jobber stores, independent operators,
automobile dealers that supply parts, discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry
automotive products. Although the number of competitors and level of competition vary by
market, both the DIY and DIFM categories are highly fragmented and generally very
competitive. We believe we enjoy significant advantages over most of our competitors. We
believe we have strong brand recognition and customer traffic in our stores based on our
significant marketing activities. In addition, we have purchasing, distribution, marketing
and advertising efficiencies due to our economies of scale.

Industry
Leading Selection of Quality Products.

As the number of automotive
replacement parts has proliferated, we believe our broad inventory selection allows us to
meet our DIY customers’ demand. We believe this has created a strong competitive
advantage for specialty automotive parts retailers, like us, that have the distribution
capacity, sophisticated information systems and knowledgeable sales staff needed to offer
a broad inventory selection to DIY customers. We offer one of the largest selections of
brand name and proprietary automotive parts, accessories and maintenance items in the
automotive aftermarket industry. Our stores carry between 16,000 and 26,000 in-store SKUs.
We also offer approximately 100,000 additional SKUs that are available on a same-day or
overnight basis through our PDQ

®

and our Master PDQ

®

distribution systems, including harder-to-find replacement parts.

Superior
Customer Service

. We believe our customers place significant value on our well-trained
store teams, who offer knowledgeable assistance in product selection and installation, and
this differentiates us from mass merchandisers. We invest substantial resources in the
recruiting and training of our employees, who we refer to as team members, and provide
formal classroom workshops, online seminars and Automotive Service Excellence(TM)
certification to build technical, managerial and customer service skills. In addition, we
have a performance management process which aligns each team member’s goals with our
strategic corporate goals. This process has enabled us to improve our retention of highly
qualified team members, which we believe leads to increased customer satisfaction and
higher sales. Additionally, we strive to reach our customers’ needs through our
Consumer Education Program designed to improve the customers’ knowledge on performing
DIY projects and by providing programs viewed over our proprietary in-store television
network.

Experienced
Management Team with Proven Track Record.

The 17 members of our senior
management team have an average of 10 years of experience with us and 14 years in the
industry, and have successfully grown our Company to become the second largest specialty
retailer of automotive products in the United States. Our management team has accomplished
this using a disciplined strategy of growing comparable store sales, opening new stores,
increasing the penetration of our commercial delivery program and making selective
acquisitions.

Growth Strategy

Our growth strategies consist of the
following:

Increase
Our Comparable Store Sales

. We have been among the industry leaders in comparable
store sales growth over the last five years, averaging 5.1% annually. We plan to increase
our comparable store sales in both the


DIY and DIFM categories by, among other things: (1)
implementing merchandising and marketing initiatives, (2) investing in store-level systems
to enhance our ability to recommend complementary products in order to increase sales per
customer, (3) refining our store selection and in-stock availability through customized
assortments and other supply chain initiatives, (4) continuing to increase customer
service through store staffing and retention initiatives, (5) increasing our commercial
delivery sales by focusing on key customers to grow average sales per program and adding
programs to markets with commercial opportunities using our database of potential
customers and (6) ongoing implementation of our 2010 store remodeling program.

Continue
to Enhance Our Margins.

In addition to driving operating margin expansion via
continued strong comparable store sales growth, we will continue to focus on increasing
margins by: (1) improving our purchasing efficiencies with vendors; (2) utilizing our
supply chain infrastructure and existing distribution network to optimize our inventory
mix and maximize distribution capacity; (3) leveraging our overall scale to reduce other
operating expenses as a percentage of sales and (4) continuing to implement our category
management and custom mix initiatives, including the expansion of our private label and
proprietary brands.

Increase
Return on Invested Capital.

We believe we can continue to successfully
increase our return on invested capital by generating strong comparable store sales growth
and increasing our margins. We believe we can also increase our return on invested capital
by leveraging our supply chain initiatives to increase sales faster than inventory growth
and selectively expanding our store base primarily in existing markets. Based on our
experience, such in-market openings provide higher returns on our invested capital by
enabling us to leverage our distribution infrastructure, marketing expenditures and local
management resources. We intend to open approximately 150 to 175 stores primarily in
existing markets in 2005.

Industry

The
United States automotive aftermarket industry is generally grouped into two major
categories DIY and DIFM. According to the Automotive Aftermarket Industry Association, or
AAIA, Aftermarket Factbook, from 1999 to 2003, the DIY category grew at a 4.4% compound
annual growth rate from approximately $29 billion to $34 billion. This category
represents sales to consumers who maintain and repair vehicles themselves. We believe this
category is characterized by stable, more recession-resistant demand than most retailers
because of the need-based characteristics of the DIY category. Additionally, in difficult
economic times, we believe people tend to drive more and use air travel less. We also
believe difficult economic times result in people retaining their vehicles longer, which
moves these vehicles in the range of years in age when more repairs are needed.
Alternatively in an improving economy, we believe the need-based characteristics of our
DIY customers still exist and they are more inclined to complete preventative maintenance
than to defer these activities. From 1999 to 2003, the DIFM category grew at a 4.6%
compound annual growth rate, from approximately $60 billion to $72 billion according
to the AAIA Aftermarket Factbook. This category represents sales to professional
installers, such as independent garages, service stations and auto dealers. DIFM parts and
services are typically offered to vehicle owners who are less inclined to repair their own
vehicles.

We
believe the United States automotive aftermarket industry will continue to benefit from
several favorable trends, including the:

•

increasing number and age of vehicles in the United States, increasing number of miles
driven annually, and increasing number of cars coming off of warranty, particularly
previously leased vehicles;

•

higher cost of replacement parts as a result of technological changes in recent models of
vehicles and increasing number of light trucks and sport utility vehicles that require
more expensive parts, resulting in higher average sales per customer; and

•

continued consolidation of automotive aftermarket retailers, resulting in a reduction in
the number of stores in the marketplace.

We
believe these trends will continue to support strong comparable store sales growth in the
industry.


Store Operations

Our
well-merchandised retail stores are where our customers judge and value our service. While
completing over 210 million customer interactions per year, our focus is to execute our
promise;

“With Low Prices on Quality Parts our Dedicated Team Will Serve you
Better”

, one customer at a time.

Our
stores generally are located in freestanding buildings in areas with high vehicle traffic
counts, good visibility and easy access to major roadways. Our stores typically range in
size from 5,000 to 10,000 square feet with an average of approximately 7,500 square feet
and offer approximately 16,000 items/SKU’s in our standard store. In addition, we
provide a customized product assortment in our hub and undercar stores, which provide an
additional 600 to 2,000 SKU’s of merchandise specifically identified based on the
demand within an individual market. Our hub and undercar stores provide a centralized
market location for this assortment, which benefits all our DIY and DIFM customers within
the market. Our local area warehouse concept utilizes existing space in selected stores to
ensure the availability of an additional customized assortment of 8,000 to 10,000 SKUs on
a same day basis, in addition to our hub and undercar store product assortments. At
January 1, 2005, we operated 49 local area warehouses.

To
ensure our stores have the right product at the right time, we also utilize a network of
Parts Delivered Quickly, or PDQ®, facilities and one Master PDQ® facility. Our
PDQ® and Master PDQ® network of facilities provide our customers an additional
assortment of 100,000 additional harder to find parts and accessories on a same day or
overnight basis.

In
addition, our proprietary electronic parts catalog, or EPC system, enables our team
members to identify and suggest the appropriate, quality and price options for the
SKU’s that we carry, as well as the related products, tools or advice that is
required by our customer to complete their automotive repair projects properly and safely.
Replacement parts sold at our stores include an extensive number of applications of
automotive filters, radiators, brake pads, fan belts, radiator hoses, starters,
alternators, batteries, shock absorbers, struts, CV shafts, spark plugs, transmission
parts, clutches, electronic ignition components, suspension parts, engines and
transmissions.

Our
retail stores are 100% company operated and are divided into geographic areas. A senior
vice president, who is supported by four to five regional vice presidents, manages each
area of retail stores. Division managers report to the regional vice presidents and have
direct responsibility for store operations in a specific division, which typically
consists of 10 to 15 stores. Depending on store size and sales volume, each store is
staffed by 10 to 20 team members under the leadership of a store manager. Our stores
generally are open from 7:30 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. six days a week and 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.
on Sundays and most holidays to meet the needs of our DIY and DIFM customers.

Commercial Sales

In
addition to the customer service provided by our store operations team, we also maintain a
commercial sales team dedicated to the development of our commercial business and the
support of our DIFM customers. A vice president of commercial support leads a team
dedicated to supporting the commercial sales team in the field. Each of our four area
senior vice presidents has a director of commercial sales that concentrates solely on
strategic and tactical commercial sales growth opportunities. Each director leads four to five
regional commercial sales mangers. Division commercial sales managers report directly to
our regional commercial sales managers and, similar to our retail division managers, they
are directly responsible for commercial operations in each division. We target the DIFM
customer through our commercial marketing efforts in all our retail stores, including
those that do not offer a delivery service.

Merchandising and
Replenishment

Virtually
all of our merchandise is selected and purchased for our stores by personnel at our
corporate offices in Roanoke, Virginia. In 2004, we purchased merchandise from over 400
vendors, with no single vendor accounting for more than 7% of purchases. Our purchasing
strategy involves negotiating multi-year agreements with certain vendors, which allows us
to achieve more favorable terms and pricing.

Our
merchandising and replenishment teams are currently led by a group of seven senior
professionals, who have an average of 16 years of automotive purchasing experience and
over 23 years in retail. The replenishment team is skilled in sourcing products globally
and maintaining high quality levels, while streamlining costs associated with the handling
of merchandise through the supply chain. The merchandising team has developed strong
vendor relationships in the industry and, in a collaborative effort with our vendor
partners, utilizes a highly effective category management process. We believe this
process, which develops a customer focused business plan for each merchandise category,
improves comparable store sales, gross margin and inventory turns.


Our
merchandising strategy is to carry a broad selection of high quality brand name automotive
parts and accessories such as Monroe, Bendix, Purolator and Trico, which generates DIY
customer traffic and also appeals to commercial customers. In addition to these branded
products, we stock a wide selection of high quality proprietary products that appeal to
value conscious customers. Sales of replacement parts account for a majority of our net
sales and typically generate higher gross margins than maintenance items or general
accessories. We are currently in the process of customizing our replacement part mix based
on a merchandising program designed to optimize inventory mix at each individual store.
The custom assortment is based on that store’s historical and projected sales mix
coupled with regionally specific customer needs.

Supply Chain

Our
supply chain consists of centralized inventory management and transportation functions
which support a logistics network of distribution centers, or DCs, and PDQ warehouses. Our
inventory management team utilizes replenishment systems to monitor the distribution
center and PDQ warehouse inventory levels and order additional product when appropriate.
In addition, the replenishment system tracks sales trends by SKU, allowing us to adjust
future orders to support seasonal and demographic shifts in demand. Our transportation
team utilizes a transportation management system for efficiently managing incoming
shipments to the distribution centers. Benefits from this system include reduced vendor to
distribution center freight costs, visibility of purchase orders and shipments for the
entire supply chain, a reduction in distribution center inventory, or safety stock, due to
consistent transit times and decreased third party freight and billing service costs.

We
currently operate eight distribution centers including our new Lehigh facility
which will begin servicing our expanding store base in the Northeast in April 2005. All of
these distribution centers are equipped with our distribution management system, or DCMS.
Our DCMS provides real-time inventory tracking through the processes of receiving,
picking, shipping and replenishing at our distribution centers. The DCMS, integrated with
technologically advanced material handling equipment, significantly reduces warehouse and
distribution costs, while improving efficiency. This equipment includes carousels,
“pick-to light” systems, robotic picking, radio frequency technology and
automated sorting systems. Through the continued implementation of our supply chain
initiatives we expect to further increase the efficient utilization of our distribution
capacity, which will provide us the capacity to service over 3,800 stores, including the
benefit we expect to realize from our Northeast DC.

We
currently offer over 40,000 SKUs to substantially support all of our retail stores via our
16 stand-alone PDQ® warehouses and/or our distribution centers, which also stock
PDQ® items. Stores have visibility to inventory in their respective facilities and can
place orders to these facilities, or as an alternative, through an online ordering system.
Ordered parts are delivered to substantially all stores on a same day or next day basis
through our dedicated PDQ® trucking fleet. In addition, we operate a PDQ®
warehouse that stocks approximately 61,000 SKUs of harder to find automotive parts and
accessories. This facility is known as the “Master PDQ®” warehouse and
utilizes existing PDQ® distribution infrastructure to provide next day service to
substantially all of our stores.

Advertising

We
have an extensive advertising program designed to communicate our merchandise offerings,
product assortment, competitive prices, free services (battery testing and installation,
electrical system testing, wiper replacement and oil recycling) and commitment to customer
service. The program is focused on establishing Advance Auto Parts as the solution for a
customer’s automotive needs. We utilize a mix of media that reinforces our brand
image, including television, radio, print, promotional signage and outdoor media, plus our
proprietary in-store television network and internet site.

Our
advertising plan is a brand-building program built around television and radio
advertising. The plan is supported by print and in-store signage. Our television
advertising is a combination of national and regional media in both sports and
entertainment programming. Radio advertising, which is used as a supplementary medium,
generally airs during peak drive times. We also sponsor sporting events, racing teams and
other events at all levels in a grass-roots effort to positively impact individual
communities, including Hispanic and other ethnic communities, to create awareness and
drive traffic for our stores.


Since
early 2003, we’ve supported our new advertising campaign, “We’re ready in
Advance” throughout all of our media. We believe this advertising campaign
differentiates Advance Auto Parts in the customer’s mind by positioning us as both a
source for brand name auto parts at low prices and as a resource for expert advice and
useful tips to help customers keep their vehicles running smoothly. The campaign includes
creative and compelling television and radio commercials designed to drive sales and build
an enduring, positive image of Advance Auto Parts as a special place to shop.

In
2004, we built upon the campaign by initiating a consumer education program. This program
is intended to build our image as not only the source for product, but also the best
resource for vehicle maintenance information. Our free brochure kiosk displaying
“We’re ready with answers” and our free monthly video clinic broadcasts on
Advance TV, our exclusive in-store how-to network, are just two elements of this growing
program. We believe we will differentiate our stores from our competitors’ by
providing our customers valuable information regarding “why-to” and
“how-to” perform regular maintenance on their vehicles, in order to enhance
their vehicles’ performance, reliability, safety and appearance. Our goal with this
initiative is to continue our long-term brand building success, increase customer loyalty
and expand our customer base.

Management Information
Systems

We
have developed a flexible technology infrastructure that supports our growth strategy. Our
information technology infrastructure is comprised of software and hardware designed to
integrate store, distribution and vendor services into a seamless network. All stores,
corporate and regional offices, and distribution centers are linked via a communications
network, which is based on frame relay technology. Our stores in Puerto Rico are linked to
the communications network via satellite. Electronic documents transferred between us and
our vendors expedite the ordering, receiving and merchandise payment processes.

Enterprise Information
System

Our
management team has online access to certain financial information via Hyperion Analyzer,
a web-enabled front-end tool, which retrieves information from a centralized database.
This system, which is tightly integrated to our “best in class” PeopleSoft
Financial and Human Resource systems, helps ensure that accurate, consistent, and timely
financial information, including our sales, margin, payroll and other key metrics, is
available to all levels of management. This system assists the management team in planning
and responding to our business and industry trends quickly and cost-effectively. This
system contains analysis tools that provide our management the ability to rank and rate
their operations and identify “best practices” opportunities for business
improvement.

Store Based Information
Systems

Our
store based information systems, which are designed to improve the efficiency of our
operations and enhance customer service, are comprised of point-of-sale, or POS,
electronic parts catalog, or EPC, store-level inventory management and store intranet, or
STORENET, systems. Additionally, we support store level operations with our management
planning and training and customer contact systems. These systems are integrated tightly
and together provide real time, comprehensive information to store and merchandising
personnel, resulting in improved customer service levels, team member productivity and
in-stock availability.

Point-of-Sale

.
          Our POS system is used to formulate pricing, marketing and merchandising
          strategies and to replenish inventory accurately and rapidly. We completed the
          implementation of our new POS system, or APAL, in all of our stores operating
          under the “Advance Auto Parts”, “Advance Discount Auto
          Parts” and “Discount Auto Parts” trade names during 2004. APAL is
          designed to improve customer checkout time and decrease the time required to
          train newly hired team members. In addition, APAL provides additional customer
          purchase history, which may be used for customer demographic analysis.

Electronic
Parts Catalog

. Our EPC system is a software system that enables our store team members
to identify over 40 million application uses for automotive parts and accessories. The EPC
system enables store team members to assist our customers in their parts selection and
ordering based on year, make, model and engine type of their vehicle. If a hard-to-find
part or accessory is not available at one of our stores, the EPC system can determine
whether the part is carried and in-stock through our PDQ® system. The EPC system also
enables our store team


members to identify additional parts that are required by our
customers to complete their automotive repair projects. This generally leads to an
increase in average sales per transaction. The integration of this system with our POS
system improves customer service by reducing time spent at the cash register and fully
automating the sales process between the parts counter and our POS register. This system
enables store team members to order parts and accessories electronically through our
PDQ® system, with immediate confirmation of price, availability and estimated delivery
time. Additionally, information about a customer’s automobile can be entered into a
permanent customer database that can be accessed immediately whenever the customer visits
or telephones one of our stores.

In
conjunction with the rollout of APAL, we also enhanced our EPC system in our stores. The
enhanced EPC system, which is fully integrated with APAL, provides the capability of
cataloging non-application specific parts and additional product information, such as
technical service bulletins, installation instructions, images of parts, and related
diagrams of automotive systems. The enhanced EPC system contains enhanced search engines
and more user-friendly navigation tools that enhance our store team members’ ability
to look-up any needed parts as well as additional products the customer needs to complete
their automotive repair project. We believe these components will enhance our
customers’ shopping experience with us and help them accurately complete the repair
job the first time, saving them time and money.

To
ensure ongoing improvement of EPC information in all stores, we have developed a centrally
based EPC data management system that enables us to reduce the time needed to exchange
data with our vendors and ultimately catalogue and deliver updated, accurate product
information to our stores. Additionally, we are enhancing the EPC system to provide
additional methods of parts look-up while reducing keystrokes and allowing our store team
members to more efficiently serve our customers.

Store
Level Inventory Management System

. Our store-level inventory management system
provides real-time inventory tracking at the store level. With the store-level system,
store team members can check the quantity of on-hand inventory for any SKU, adjust stock
levels for select items for store specific events, automatically process returns and
defective merchandise, designate SKU’s for cycle counts and track merchandise
transfers. As our stores converted to APAL, we implemented radio frequency hand held
devices, which helps ensure the accuracy of our inventory.

Store
Intranet.

Our STORENET system delivers product information, electronic manuals, forms,
store operating results, in-store training opportunities and internal communications to
all store team members. In addition STORENET provides online tools that enhance the
productivity of our team members as follows:

•

our online learning center delivers online training programs to all team members. A
tracking and reporting function provides human resources and management with an overview
of training schedules and results by team member;

•

our online

budgeting site allows stores more direct input to the budgeting process,
significantly reduces telecommunications usage by store management and results in
efficiencies in the overall corporate budgeting process;

•

our online inventory cycle count

accuracy report facilitates maintaining more
accurate stock levels and reduce out of stock and overstock conditions; and

•

our online telecommunications audit reports application provides managers access to
detailed information regarding company telecommunications expenses, promoting targeted
efforts to reduce ineffective expenses.

Management
Planning and Training (MPT).

MPT is our proprietary system designed to maximize the
effectiveness of our store labor management and training processes. MPT gives our store
managers the information they need to plan for peak customer traffic to ensure we have
knowledgeable and friendly sales people in our stores, well-stocked shelves and clean
stores to meet our customers’ needs. After a thorough review of all our store
processes, we believe MPT improves our results of operations through improved labor
productivity on all store level activities, including sales, team member development,
administrative, cleaning, and unloading and stocking of weekly product deliveries.

Customer
Contact Center

. Our customer contact center utilizes call routing software and
customer service software and functions as a centralized support center. The customer
contact center has resulted in a substantial


improvement in the average speed in which a
call is answered, a reduction in calls to voice mail and a reduction in the number of
outbound calls required to respond to voice mail. We believe these improvements allow us
to better support each of our stores, therefore, increasing customer service.

Team Members

At
March 9, 2005, we employed 22,093 full-time team members and 15,702 part-time team
members. Our workforce consisted of 86.3% team members employed in store-level operations,
9.3% employed in distribution and 4.4% employed in our corporate offices in Roanoke,
Virginia. We have never experienced any labor disruption and are not party to any
collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our team member relations are good.

We
allocate substantial resources to the recruiting, training and retention of team members.
Our performance management process allows us to align each team member’s goals with
our corporate strategic goals. We believe this program provides us with a well-trained,
productive workforce that is committed to high levels of customer service and assures a
qualified team to support future growth.

Trade Names, Service
Marks and Trademarks

We
own and have registrations for the trade names “Advance Auto Parts,”
“Western Auto” and “Parts America” and the trademark
“PDQ®” with the United States Patent and Trademark Office for use in
connection with the automotive parts retailing business. In addition, we own and have
registered a number of trademarks with respect to our proprietary products, and we also
acquired from Discount various registered trademarks, service marks and copyrights. We
believe that these trade names, service marks and trademarks are important to our
merchandising strategy. We do not know of any infringing uses that would materially affect
the use of these marks and actively defend and enforce them.

Competition

Our
primary competitors are both national and regional retail chains of automotive parts
stores, including AutoZone, Inc., O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. and The Pep
Boys–Manny, Moe & Jack, wholesalers or jobber stores, including those associated
with national parts distributors or associations, such as NAPA, independent operators,
automobile dealers that supply parts, discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry
automotive products, including Wal-Mart, Target and K-Mart. We believe that chains of
automotive parts stores, like us, with multiple locations in one or more markets, have
competitive advantages in customer service, marketing, inventory selection, purchasing and
distribution as compared to independent retailers and jobbers that are not part of a chain
or associated with other retailers or jobbers. The principal competitive factors that
affect our business include price, store location, customer service and product offerings,
quality and availability.

Environmental Matters

We
are subject to various federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations relating
to the operation of our business, including those governing recycling of batteries and
used lubricants, and regarding ownership and operation of real property. We handle
hazardous materials as part of our operations, and our customers may also use hazardous
materials on our properties or bring hazardous materials or used oil onto our properties.
We currently provide collection and recycling programs for used automotive batteries and
used lubricants at all of our stores as a service to our customers under agreements with
third party vendors. Pursuant to these agreements, used batteries and lubricants are
collected by our team members, deposited into vendor supplied containers or pallets and
stored by us until collected by the third party vendors for recycling or proper disposal.
Persons who arrange for the disposal, treatment or other handling of hazardous or toxic
substances may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation at any affected disposal,
treatment or other site affected by such substances.

We
own and lease real property. Under various environmental laws and regulations, a current
or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or
remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in such property. These laws
often impose joint and several liability and may be imposed without regard to whether the
owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release of such hazardous or toxic
substances. Other environmental laws and common law principles also could be used to
impose liability for releases of


hazardous materials into the environment or work place,
and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for
personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous
substances. From time to time, we receive notices from the Environmental Protection Agency
and state environmental authorities indicating that there may be contamination on
properties we own or operate or on adjacent properties for which we may be responsible.
Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our operations
to date. We believe that we are currently in material compliance with these laws and
regulations.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

We
currently and from time to time are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of
our business. The damages claimed against us in some of these proceedings are substantial.
Although the amount of liability that may result from these matters cannot be ascertained,
we do not currently believe that, in the aggregate, they will result in liabilities
material to our consolidated financial condition, future results of operations or cash
flow.

Our
Western Auto subsidiary, together with other defendants including automobile
manufacturers, automotive parts manufacturers and other retailers, has been named as a
defendant in lawsuits alleging injury as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing
products. We and some of our other subsidiaries also have been named as defendants in many
of these lawsuits. The plaintiffs have alleged that these products were manufactured,
distributed and/or sold by the various defendants. To date, these products have included
brake and clutch parts and roofing materials. Many of the cases pending against us or our
subsidiaries are in the early stages of litigation. The damages claimed against the
defendants in some of these proceedings are substantial. Additionally, some of the
automotive parts manufacturers named as defendants in these lawsuits have declared
bankruptcy, which will limit plaintiffs’ ability to recover monetary damages from
those defendants. We believe that we have valid defenses against these claims. We also
believe that most of these claims are at least partially covered by insurance. Based on
discovery to date, we do not believe the cases currently pending will have a material
adverse effect on us. However, if we were to incur an adverse verdict in one or more of
these claims and were ordered to pay damages that were not covered by insurance, these
claims could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial position
and liquidity. If the number of claims filed against us or any of our subsidiaries
alleging injury as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing products increases
substantially, the costs associated with concluding these claims, including damages
resulting from any adverse verdicts, could have a material adverse effect on our operating
results, financial position and liquidity in future periods.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a

The
closing price of our common stock on March 9, 2005 was $50.57. The table gives effect to
our two-for-one stock split effectuated in the form of a 100% stock dividend distributed
on January 2, 2004, as trading began on a post-split basis on January 5, 2004. At March 9,
2005, there were 439 holders of record of our common stock.

We
have not declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock in the last two years. We
anticipate that we will retain all of our earnings in the foreseeable future to finance
the expansion of our business and, therefore, do not anticipate paying any dividends on
our common stock. In addition, our amended senior credit facility contains restrictions on
the amount of cash dividends or other distributions we may declare and pay on our capital
stock. Any payments of dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of
directors and will depend upon our results of operations, earnings, capital requirements,
contractual restrictions contained in our amended senior credit facility, or other
agreements, and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.

(8)

Represents certain expenses related to, among other things, overlapping administrative functions and store conversions as a result of the Discount acquisition.

(9)

(10)

Shares  outstanding for each of the years  presented gives effect to a 2 for 1 stock split  effectuated by us in the form of a 100% stock dividend distributed on January 2, 2004.

(11)

Inventory  turnover  is  calculated  as cost of sales  divided  by the  average  of  beginning  and ending inventories.  The  fiscal  2003 cost of sales  excludes  the  effect of the 53

rd

week in the  amount of $34.3 million.  The fiscal 2001
amounts were  calculated  by reducing the Discount inventory balances by one-thirteenth to reflect our ownership of that inventory from December 2, 2001 (the acquisition date) through December 29, 2001.


(12)

Inventory per store  calculated as ending inventory  divided by ending store count.  Ending inventory used in this  calculation  excludes  certain  inventory  related to the  wholesale  segment with the  exception of fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004.

(13)

Accounts  payable  to  inventory  ratio is  calculated  as  ending  accounts  payable  divided  by  ending inventory. Beginning in fiscal 2004, as a result of our new vendor financing program, we aggregate fincanced vendor accounts payable with ending accounts payable to calculate our accounts payable to inventory ratio.

(14)

Net working capital is calculated by subtracting current liabilities from current assets.

(15)

Capital  expenditures  for 2001  exclude  $34.1  million for our  November  2001  purchase  of  Discount's Gallman, Mississippi distribution facility from the lessor in connection with the Discount acquisition.

(16)

Net debt includes total debt and bank overdrafts, less cash and cash equivalents.

(17)

Comparable  store  sales is  calculated  based on the change in net sales  starting  once a store has been open for 13 complete  accounting  periods (each period  represents  four weeks).  Relocations are included in comparable  store sales from the original date of opening.  Stores  acquired in the Discount  acquisition are included in the comparable sales  calculation  beginning in December 2002,  which was 13 complete  accounting periods  after the  acquisition  date of November 28,  2001.  We do not include net sales from the 35 Western Auto retail  stores in our  comparable  store  calculation  as a result of their  unique  product  offerings, including automotive service and tires. In 2003, the comparable store sales calculation  included sales from our 53

rd

week compared to our first week of operation in 2003 (the comparable calendar week).
In 2004, as a result of the 53

rd

week in 2003, the comparable store sales calculation exludes week one of sales from 2003.

(18)

Closed  stores in 2002  include 133  Discount  and Advance  stores  closed as part of the  integration  of Discount.

(19)

Item 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The
following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should
be read in conjunction with “Selected Financial Data,” our consolidated
historical financial statements and the notes to those statements that appear elsewhere in
this report. Our discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current
expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives,
expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ
materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a
number of factors, including those set forth under “Forward Looking Statements”
and “Risk Factors” elsewhere in this report.

Our
fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest December 31 of each year. Our first quarter
consists of 16 weeks, and the other three quarters consist of 12 weeks, with the exception
of the fourth quarter fiscal 2003 which consisted of 13 weeks due to our 53- week fiscal
year in 2003.

Introduction

We
primarily operate within the United States automotive aftermarket industry, which includes
replacement parts (excluding tires), accessories, maintenance items, batteries and
automotive chemicals for cars and light trucks (pickup trucks, vans, minivans and sport
utility vehicles). We currently are the second largest specialty retailer of automotive
parts, accessories and maintenance items to “do-it-yourself,” or DIY, customers
in United States, based on store count and sales. Our operations are conducted in one
operating segment.

At
January 1, 2005, we operated 2,617 stores throughout 39 states in the Northeastern,
Southeastern and Midwestern regions of the United States. These stores operated under the
“Advance Auto Parts” trade name except


for certain stores in the state of
Florida, which operated under “Advance Discount Auto Parts” or “Discount
Auto Parts” trade names. These stores offered automotive replacement parts,
accessories and maintenance items, with no significant concentration in any specific
product area. In addition, we operated 35 stores under the “Western Auto” trade
name, located primarily in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, which offer automotive
tires and service in addition to automotive parts, accessories and maintenance items.

The
following table sets forth the number of new, closed and relocated stores and stores with
commercial delivery programs during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002. We lease approximately 80%
of our stores.

We anticipate adding approximately
150 to 175 new stores during 2005 primarily through new store openings and selective
acquisitions.

Management Overview

In
2004, we produced solid growth in our sales and earnings and ended the year with strong
sales momentum during the fourth quarter. We believe this momentum confirms that our
initiatives are working and further makes us believe we are very well positioned for 2005
and beyond. In addition, our industry dynamics continue to become more positive each year.
The average age of vehicles continues to increase and is now over nine years old.
Currently,
over 60% of actively driven vehicles are at least six years old and are beginning to enter
the period when parts begin to fail. The replacement parts for these vehicles are higher
due to the technological changes in recent models and the shift from cars to light trucks
and sport utility vehicles. Beyond the positive fundamentals of our industry, the implementation of our
initiatives remains on schedule. Our specific focus is to drive higher sales per store and
thereby leverage our fixed expenses. The initiatives for driving this sales
growth include:

•

Continued execution of our category management program;

•

Ongoing implementation of our 2010 store remodeling program;

•

Consistent growth and execution of our commercial delivery program;

•

Enhanced advertising and focus on serving the customer;

•

Training and development of our team members; and

•

Investing in technology and innovative store systems.

In
addition, we are focused on optimizing our overall expenses at all levels of the
organization as well as continuing to execute our supply chain initiatives to better
optimize our distribution costs and make our logistics network operate more efficiently
and more productively.

Key 2004 Events

The
following key events occurred during 2004 and reflect opportunities that will support our
strategic initiatives discussed above:

•

Our board of directors authorized a $200 million stock repurchase program during the third
quarter of 2004. This program allows us to repurchase outstanding shares of our common
stock at prices that we believe are attractive with confidence of our ability to produce
strong operating results in the future. As of January 1, 2005, we had repurchased a total
of 3.7 million shares at an aggregate cost of $146.2 million.

•

We entered into a vendor financing program during the first quarter of 2004 allowing us to
extend our payment terms on certain merchandise purchases. This program will allow us to
leverage our working capital and utilize existing cash flow to fund our strategic
initiatives and capital requirements.

•

During 2004, we purchased a new Northeast distribution center in Pennsylvania. This
facility is planned to begin servicing our expanding store base in the Northeast region of
the United States during the first quarter of 2005.

•

We completed the refinancing of our senior credit facility during the fourth quarter of
2004. Our amended senior credit facility provided for an additional $100 million for stock
buybacks under our stock repurchase program.

Discontinued Operations

Prior
to 2004, we operated a second segment for our wholesale business. On December 19, 2003, we
discontinued the supplying of merchandise to our wholesale distribution network. The
wholesale distribution network, or Wholesale, consisted of independently owned and
operated dealer locations, for which we supplied merchandise inventory and certain
services. Due to the wide variety of products supplied to the dealers and the reduced
concentration of stores spread over a wide geographic area, it had become difficult to
serve these dealers effectively. This component of our business operated in the wholesale
segment and excluding certain allocated and team member benefit expenses of $2.4 million
and $3.3 million for fiscal years 2003 and 2002, represented the


entire results of
operations previously reported in that segment. We have classified these operating results
as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for
the fiscal year ended January 3, 2004 and December 28, 2002 to reflect this decision. For
the fiscal year ended January 1, 2005, the operating results related to the discontinued
wholesale business were minimal as a result of recognizing an estimate of exit
costs in fiscal 2003.

Critical Accounting
Policies

Our
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally
accepted in the United States of America. Our discussion and analysis of the financial
condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements. The
preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies
in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management. Our estimates and
judgments are based on currently available information, historical results and other
assumptions we believe are reasonable. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

The
preparation of our financial statements included the following significant estimates.

Vendor
Incentives

We
receive incentives in the form of reductions to amounts owed and/or payments from vendors
related to cooperative advertising allowances, volume rebates and other promotional
consideration. We account for vendor incentives in accordance with Emerging Issues Task
Force, or EITF, No. 02-16, “Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for
Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor.” Many of the incentives are provided
under long-term agreements (terms in excess of one year), while others are negotiated on
an annual basis. Certain vendors require us to use cooperative advertising allowances
exclusively for advertising. We define these allowances as restricted cooperative
advertising allowances and recognize them as a reduction to selling, general and
administrative expenses as incremental advertising expenditures are incurred. The
remaining cooperative advertising allowances not restricted by our vendors and volume
rebates are earned based on inventory purchases and recorded as a reduction to inventory
and recognized through cost of sales as the inventory is sold.

We
recognize certain other promotional incentives earned under long-term supply agreements as
a reduction to cost of sales. These incentives are recognized based on the cumulative
purchases as a percentage of total estimated purchases over the life of the agreement. The
estimate of total purchases are highly sensitive to market demand for that product and
could positively or negatively impact our cost of sales if actual purchases or results
from any year differ from our estimates, however, incentives earned over the life of the
agreement would be the same. Incentives associated with short-term agreements are
recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the course of the annual agreements.

Amounts
received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred
revenue. Management’s estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be
realized within one year of the balance sheet date is included in other current
liabilities. Earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in accounts
receivable except for that portion expected to be received after one year, which is
included in other assets.

Inventory
Reserves

We
establish reserves for inventory shrink, as an increase to our cost of sales, for our
stores and distribution centers based on our extensive and frequent cycle counting
program. Our estimates of these shrink reserves depend on the accuracy of the program,
which is dependent on compliance rates of our facilities and the execution of the required
procedures. We evaluate the accuracy of this program on an on-going basis and believe it
provides reasonable assurance for the established reserves.

Reserves
for potentially excess and obsolete inventories are recorded as well based on current
inventory levels of discontinued product and historical analysis of the liquidation of
discontinued inventory below cost. The nature of our inventory is such that the risk of
obsolescence is minimal and excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors
for credit. We provide reserves where less than full credit will be received for such
returns and where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less
than recorded cost. We develop these estimates


based on the determination of return
privileges with vendors, the level of credit provided by the vendor and management’s
estimate of the discounts to recorded cost, if any, required by market conditions. Future
changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory
could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves for excess and obsolete
inventory and result in a negative impact on our consolidated statement of operations.

Warranty
Reserves

Our
vendors are primarily responsible for warranty claims. We are responsible for merchandise
and services sold under warranty which are not covered by vendor warranties (primarily
batteries and roadside assistance). We record a reserve for future warranty claims as an
increase in our cost of sales based on current sales of the warranted products and
historical claim experience. If claims experience differs from historical levels,
revisions in our estimates may be required, which could have an impact on our consolidated
statement of operations.

Self-Insured
Reserves

We
are self-insured for general and automobile liability, workers’ compensation and the
health care claims of our team members, although we maintain stop-loss coverage with
third-party insurers to limit our total liability exposure. A reserve for liabilities
associated with these losses is established for claims filed and claims incurred but not
yet reported based upon our estimate of ultimate cost, which we calculate using analyses
of historical data, demographic and severity factors and valuations provided by
third-party actuaries. Management monitors new claims and claim development as well as
negative trends related to the claims incurred but not reported in order to assess the
adequacy of our insurance reserves. On a periodic basis, we also review our assumptions
with our third-party actuaries. While we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to
differ significantly from our estimates, our self-insurance reserves and corresponding
selling, general and administrative expenses could be affected if future claim experience
differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions.

Leases
and Leasehold Improvements

We
lease certain store locations, distribution centers, office space, equipment and vehicles.
We account for our leases under the provisions of SFAS No. 13 “Accounting for
Leases” and subsequent amendments which require that leases be evaluated and
classified as operating leases or capital leases for financial reporting purposes. Certain
leases contain rent escalation clauses, which are recorded on a straight-line basis over
the initial term of the lease with the difference between the rent paid and the
straight-line rent recorded as a deferred rent liability. Lease incentive payments
received from landlords are recorded as deferred rent liabilities and are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the lease term as a reduction in rent. In addition, leasehold
improvements associated with these operating leases are amortized over the shorter of
their economic lives or the respective lease terms. The term of each lease is generally
the initial term of the lease unless external economic factors were to exist such that
renewals potentially provided for in the lease are reasonably assured to be exercised. In
those instances the renewal period would be included in the lease term for purposes of
establishing an amortization period and determining if such lease qualified as a capital
or operating lease.

Closed
Store Liabilities

We
recognize a reserve for future obligations at the time we close a leased store location.
The reserve includes the present value of the remaining lease obligations and
management’s estimate of future costs for common area maintenance and taxes, offset
by the present value of management’s estimate of potential subleases and lease
buyouts. These estimates are based on current market conditions and our experience of
obtaining subleases or buyouts on similar properties. However, our inability to enter into
the subleases or obtain buyouts due to a change in the economy or prevailing real estate
markets for these properties within the estimated timeframe may result in increases or
decreases to these reserves and could impact our selling, general and administrative
expenses, as well as our consolidated statement of operations and cash flows.


Components of Statement
of Operations

Net Sales

Net
sales consist primarily of comparable store sales, new store net sales, service sales
(offered only in the Western Auto retail locations) and finance charges on installment
sales. We calculate comparable store sales based on the change in net sales starting once
a store has been opened for 13 complete accounting periods. We include relocations in
comparable store sales from the original date of opening. We exclude net sales from the 35
Western Auto retail stores from our comparable store sales as a result of their unique
product offerings, including automotive service and tires.

Our
fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to December 31 and consists of 52 or 53 weeks.
Our 2004 fiscal year began on January 4, 2004 and consisted of 52 weeks, while our 2003
fiscal year began on December 29, 2002 and consisted of 53 weeks. The extra week of
operations in fiscal 2003 results in our fiscal 2004 consisting of non-comparable calendar
weeks to fiscal 2003. To create a meaningful comparable store sales measure for fiscal
2004, we have compared the calendar weeks of 2004 to the corresponding calendar weeks of
fiscal 2003. Accordingly, our calculation of comparable stores sales for fiscal 2004
excludes week one of operations from fiscal 2003.

Cost of Sales

Our
cost of sales consists of merchandise costs, net of incentives under vendor programs,
inventory shrinkage and warehouse and distribution expenses. Gross profit as a percentage
of net sales may be affected by variations in our product mix, price changes in response
to competitive factors and fluctuations in merchandise costs and vendor programs. We seek
to avoid fluctuation in merchandise costs and instability of supply by entering into
long-term purchasing agreements with vendors when we believe it is advantageous.

Selling, General and
Administrative Expenses

Selling,
general and administrative expenses consist of store payroll, store occupancy (including
rent), net advertising expenses, other store expenses and general and administrative
expenses, including salaries and related benefits of corporate team members,
administrative office expenses, data processing, professional expenses and other related
expenses including expenses associated with merger and integration.

Results of Operations

The following table sets forth
certain of our operating data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods
indicated.


Fiscal
2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003

Net
sales for 2004 were $3,770.3 million, an increase of $276.6 million, or 7.9%, over net
sales for 2003. Excluding the effect of the 53

rd

week for 2003 our net sales
increased $339.6 million, or 9.9%, over net sales for 2003. The net sales increase was due
to an increase in the comparable store sales of 6.1% and contributions from our 125 new
stores opened within the last year. The comparable store sales increase was driven by
increases in both customer traffic and average ticket sales. Overall, we believe our 2010
store format, category management and enhanced nationwide advertising program drove our
growth in net sales. In addition, we believe our DIFM sales have increased as a result of
the continued execution of our commercial delivery programs in our existing markets and
our continued focus on a high level of service to our DIFM customers.

Gross
profit for 2004 was $1,753.4 million, or 46.5% of net sales, as compared to $1,604.5
million, or 45.9% of net sales, in 2003. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of
sales reflects continued benefits realized from our category management initiatives and
reduced inventory shrinkage. In 2005, we anticipate our gross profit to continue to
improve as a result of the benefits realized from our category management initiatives,
including the expansion of our private label brand and proprietary brands, and the continued
execution of our supply chain initiatives.

Selling,
general and administrative expenses increased to $1,424.6 million, or 37.8% of net sales
for 2004, from $1,316.3 million, or 37.6% of net sales for 2003. The increase in selling,
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2004 was primarily a
result of increased expenses associated with our self-insurance programs, including the
increased costs required to close claims below our stop-loss limits and increased medical
costs for covered team members due to inflation in the health care sector. Selling,
general and administrative expenses for 2003 included $10.4 million in merger and
integration expenses related to the integration of Discount. These integration expenses
were related to, among other things, overlapping administrative functions and store
conversion expenses. Excluding the merger and integration expenses from 2003, selling,
general and administrative expenses were 37.3% of net sales.

Interest
expense for 2004 was $20.1 million, or 0.5% of net sales, as compared to $37.6 million, or
1.1% of net sales, in 2003. The decrease in interest expense is a result of lower overall
interest rates resulting primarily from our redemption of our outstanding senior
subordinated notes and senior discount debentures in the first quarter of fiscal 2003.
Additionally, the decrease is a result of lower average outstanding debt levels on our
senior credit facility


throughout fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003.

Income
tax expense for 2004 was $117.7 million, as compared to $78.4 million for 2003. This
increase in income tax expense primarily reflects our higher earnings. Our effective
income tax rate was 38.5% for both 2004 and 2003.

We
recorded net income of $188.0 million, $2.49 per diluted share for 2004, as compared to
$124.9 million, or $1.67 per diluted share for 2003. As a percentage of sales, net income
for 2004 was 5.0%, as compared to 3.6% for 2003. Our net income for 2003 included the effect of expenses
associated with merger and integration and loss on extinguishment of debt of $35.5
million, or $0.47 per diluted share.

Fiscal
2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002

Net
sales for 2003 were $3,493.7 million, an increase of $289.6 million, or 9.0%, over net
sales for 2002. Excluding the effect of the 53

rd

week our net sales increased
$226.6 million, or 7.1%, over net sales for 2002. The net sales increase was due to an
increase in the comparable store sales of 3.1%, driven by increases in both customer
traffic and average ticket sales, and contributions from the 125 new stores opened within
the last year. Increases in both our DIY and DIFM business contributed to the comparable
store sales increase.

Gross
profit for 2003 was $1,604.5 million, or 45.9% of net sales, as compared to $1,434.4
million, or 44.8% of net sales, in 2002. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of
sales reflects continued benefits realized from our category management initiatives and
improved efficiencies in our logistics network.

Selling,
general and administrative expenses, including merger and integration costs of $10.4
million in 2003, increased to $1,316.3 million, or 37.6% of net sales for 2003, from
$1,238.1 million, or 38.7% of net sales for 2002. In 2002, merger and integration costs
were $35.5 million. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a
percentage of net sales is primarily a result of a decrease in merger and integration
expenses related to the integration of Discount. These integration expenses are related
to, among other things, overlapping administrative functions and store conversion
expenses. The decline in merger and integration costs was anticipated as we approached the
completion of the Discount integration. Excluding the impact of the merger and integration
costs, the decline in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net
sales is a result of leveraging our fixed costs as a result of the impact of the

rd

week of operations in the fourth quarter of 2003.

Interest
expense for 2003 was $37.6 million, or 1.1% of net sales, as compared to $77.1 million, or
2.4% of net sales, in 2002. The decrease in interest expense is a result of lower overall
interest rates resulting primarily from our redemption of our outstanding senior
subordinated notes and senior discount debentures in first quarter 2003. Additionally, the
decrease is a result of overall lower debt levels in 2003 as compared to 2002.

Income
tax expense for 2003 was $78.4 million, as compared to $39.5 million for 2002. Our
effective income tax rate decreased to 38.5% for 2003, as compared to 38.8%, for 2002. The
decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to increases in pre-tax income, which
reduced the impact of certain permanent differences on the effective rate.

During
2003, we recorded $47.3 million in a loss on extinguishment of debt. This loss reflects
the write-off of deferred loan costs and premiums paid to redeem our senior subordinated
notes and senior discount debentures during the first quarter of fiscal 2003, and also
includes the related financing costs associated with amending our senior credit facility
to finance this redemption. Additionally, this loss includes the ratable portion of
deferred loans costs associated with the partial repayment of our term loans during fiscal
2003.

We
recorded net income of $124.9 million, $1.67 per diluted share for 2003, as compared to
$65.0 million, or $0.90 per diluted share for 2002. As a percentage of sales, net income
for 2003 was 3.6%, as compared to 2.0% for 2002. The effect of the expenses associated
with merger and integration and loss on extinguishment of debt on net income was $35.5
million, or $0.47 per diluted share for 2003 and $32.0 million, or $0.44 per diluted share
for 2002. These per share amounts reflect the two-for-one stock split declared in 2003.

Liquidity and Capital
Resources

Overview of Liquidity

Our
primary cash requirements include the purchase of inventory, capital expenditures,
repurchasing shares under our stock repurchase program and contractual obligations. We
have financed these requirements primarily through a combination of cash generated from
operations and borrowings under our senior credit facility.

At
January 1, 2005, our cash balance was $56.3 million, an increase of $44.8 million compared to 2003. Our cash balance increased primarily due to our
increased earnings in 2004, as well as a decrease in cash used to repay or redeem indebtedness compared to 2003. In 2003, we used available funds
combined with borrowings under our senior credit facility to redeem our senior discount
debentures and senior subordinated notes. At January 1, 2005, we had outstanding
indebtedness consisting of borrowings of $470.0 million under our senior credit facility,
an increase of $25.0 million from 2003. Additionally, we had $38.8 million in letters of
credit outstanding, which reduced our availability under the revolving credit facility to
$161.2 million. Our availability under our revolving credit facility increased by $38.8
million from $122.4 at the end of fiscal 2003 due to the increase in our revolving credit
facility from $160.0 million to $200.0 million. This increase resulted from the
refinancing of our senior credit facility, which gives us additional funds for our primary
cash requirements.

Capital Expenditures

Our
primary capital requirements have been the funding of our continued store expansion
program, including new store openings and store acquisitions, store relocations and
remodels, inventory requirements, the construction and upgrading of distribution centers,
the development and implementation of proprietary information systems and our strategic
acquisitions.

Our
capital expenditures were $179.8 million in 2004. These amounts included costs of $50.0
million for the construction and preparation of our Northeastern distribution center and
additional amounts related to new store openings, the upgrade of our information systems,
remodels and relocations of existing stores, including our continued physical conversion
of stores acquired in the Discount acquisition to our Advance Auto Parts store format. In
2005, we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately $180.0 million to
$200.0 million.

Our
new stores, if leased, require capital expenditures of approximately $160,000 per store
and an inventory investment of approximately $170,000 per store, net of vendor payables. A
portion of the inventory investment is held at a distribution facility. Pre-opening
expenses, consisting primarily of store set-up costs and training of new store team
members, average approximately $20,000 per store and are expensed when incurred.

Our
future capital requirements will depend on the number of new stores we open or acquire and
the timing of those openings or acquisitions within a given year. We opened 125 new stores
each year during 2004 and 2003. We anticipate adding approximately 150 to 175 new
stores during 2005 primarily through new store openings and selective acquisitions.


Vendor Financing Program

Historically,
we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers that help finance inventory
growth, and we believe that we will be able to continue financing much of our inventory
growth through such extended payment terms. During the first quarter of fiscal 2004, we
entered into a short-term financing program with a bank, allowing us to extend our payment
terms on certain merchandise purchases. Under this program, we issue negotiable
instruments to our vendors in lieu of a cash payment. Each vendor is able to present the
instrument to the bank for payment at an agreed upon discount rate. At January 1, 2005,
$56.9 million was payable to the bank by us under this program. This program will allow us
to further reduce our working capital invested in current inventory levels and finance future
inventory growth. Additionally, our new senior credit facility allows us to increase our
capacity under this program from $100 million to $150 million during 2005.

Stock Repurchase Program

During
the third quarter of fiscal 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase
program of up to $200.0 million of our common stock plus related expenses. The program
will allow us to repurchase our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated
transactions form time to time in accordance with the requirements of the Securities and
Exchange Commission. As of January 1, 2005, we had repurchased a total of 3.7 million
shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $146.2 million, or $39.52 per share. At
January 1, 2005, we had $53.8 million, excluding related expenses, available for future
stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program. As of March 9, 2005, we had
repurchased an additional 1.0 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $43.0
million.

Deferred Compensation and
Postretirement Plans

We
maintain two deferred compensation plans. Our ongoing plan was established in 2003 as an
unqualified deferred compensation plan established for certain of our key team members.
This plan provides for a mimimum and maximum deferral percentage of the team member base
salary and bonus, as determined by our Retirement Plan Committee. We fund the plan
liability by remitting the team members’ deferral to a Rabbi Trust where these
deferrals are invested in trading securities. Accordingly, all gains and losses on these
underlying investments are held in the Rabbi Trust to fund the deferred compensation
liability. At January 1, 2005, the liability related to this plan was $1.8 million, all of
which is current. We also maintain an unfunded deferred compensation plan established
prior to the 1998 Western merger for certain key team members of Western. The plan was
frozen at the date of the Western merger. At January 1, 2005, the total liability for the
Western plan was $1.6 million, of which $0.3 million is recorded as a current liability.
The classification for the Western deferred compensation plan is determined by payment
terms elected by plan participants, which can be changed upon 12 months’ notice.

We
provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired team members
through our postretirement plan. At January 1, 2005, our accrued benefit cost related to
this plan was $17.4 million. The plan has no assets and is funded on a cash basis as
benefits are paid/incurred. The discount rate that we utilize for determining our
postretirement benefit obligation is actuarially determined. The discount rate utilized at
January 1, 2005 and January 4, 2004 was 5.75% and 6.25%, respectively. We reserve the
right to change or terminate the benefits or contributions at any time. We also continue
to evaluate ways in which we can better manage these benefits and control costs. Any
changes in the plan or revisions to assumptions that affect the amount of expected future
benefits may have a significant impact on the amount of the reported obligation and annual
expense. Effective second quarter of 2004, we amended the Plan to exclude outpatient
prescription drug benefits to Medicare eligible retirees effective January 1, 2006. Due to
this negative plan amendment, our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was
reduced by $7.6 million, resulting in an unrecognized negative prior service cost in the
same amount. The unrecognized negative prior service cost is being amortized over the
estimated remaining life expectancy of the plan participants of 13 years.


Analysis of Cash Flows

Operating Activities

For
fiscal 2004, net cash provided by operating activities decreased $92.2 million to $263.7
million. Significant components of this decrease consisted of:

•

a $63.1 million increase in earnings from fiscal 2003;

•

a $47.2 million reduction in deferred income tax provision, primarily reflective of (1)
the reduction in operating loss carryforwards from prior years and (2) the impact of the
loss on extinguishment of debt from fiscal 2003;

•

a $22.8 million increase in inventory growth; and

•

a $77.9 million decrease in cash flow from accounts payable, excluding the impact of our
vendor financing program which began in fiscal 2004.

For
fiscal 2003, net cash provided by operating activities increased $112.9 million to $355.9
million. Significant components of this increase consisted of:

•

a $59.9 million increase in earnings primarily due to a reduction in merger and integration expenses and
         increased operating margins; and

•

a $47.3 million loss on extinguishment of debt in fiscal 2003 compared to $16.8 million loss on
         extinguishment of debt in fiscal 2002.

Investing Activities

For
fiscal 2004, net cash used in investing activities increased by $81.3 million to $166.8
million. The primary increase in cash used in investing activities relates to an increase
in capital expenditures of $50.0 million for the construction and preparation of our
Northeastern distribution center.

For
fiscal 2003, net cash used in investing activities increased by $7.5 million to $85.5
million. Significant components of this increase consisted of:

•

a $17.7 million reduction in proceeds received on the disposal of assets; and

•

a decrease in cash used for acquisition purposes compared to 2002 when $13.2 million was used to acquire certain assets of Trak Auto Parts, Inc.

Financing Activities

For
fiscal 2004, net cash used in financing activities decreased by $220.7 million to $52.1
million, primarily due to a cash outflow of $406.4 million during fiscal 2003 for the
early redemption of our senior discount debentures and senior subordinated notes. Cash
used for financing activities in fiscal 2004 consisted primarily of:

•

$146.4 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program;

•

a $56.9 million cash inflow associated with inventory purchased under our vendor financing program;


•

a $25.0 million increase in net borrowings as a result of $105.0 million in principal prepayments on our
previous senior credit facility prior to scheduled maturity, offset by borrowings from our amended senior credit facility; and

•

$20.5 million in proceeds from team member exercises of stock options.

For
fiscal 2003, net cash used in financing activities increased by $103.6 million to $272.8
million. Significant components of this increase consisted of:

•

a $70.9 million increase in net borrowings, which is reflective of the redemption of our senior discount debentures and senior subordinated notes using
proceeds from our senior credit facility;

•

$88.7 in proceeds from an equity offering during fiscal 2002;

•

a $64.1 million cash inflow from the fluctuation of bank overdrafts from fiscal 2002; and

•

$38.3 million paid in debt related costs in connection with the above redemption.

Long Term Debt

Senior
Credit Facility.

On November 3, 2004, we entered into a new amended and restated $670
million senior credit facility. The new senior facility provides for a $200.0 million
tranche A term loan and a $170.0 million tranche B term loan. Proceeds from these term
loans were used to refinance our tranche D and E term loans and revolver under our
previous facility. Additionally, the new senior credit facility provides for a $100.0
million delayed draw term loan, which is available exclusively for stock buybacks under
our stock repurchase program, and a $200.0 million revolving facility, or the revolver
(which provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sub limit of $70.0 million).
In conjunction with this refinancing, we wrote-off deferred financing costs related to the
previous term loans in accordance with EITF Issue No. 96-19, “Debtor’s
Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of Debt Instruments”. The write-off of
these costs combined with additional costs required to establish the new facility resulted
in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.8 million in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations for the year ended January 1, 2005. Earlier during fiscal 2004,
we made $105.0 million of repayments on our previous senior credit facility prior to their
scheduled maturity. In conjunction with these partial repayments, we wrote-off $0.4
million, which is also classified as a loss on extinguishment of debt in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended January 1, 2005.

At
January 1, 2005, our senior credit facility consisted of (1) a tranche A term loan
facility with a balance of $200.0 million, a tranche B term loan facility with a
balance of $170.0 million, a delayed draw term loan with a balance of $100.0 million and
(2) a $200.0 million revolving credit facility (including a letter of credit sub facility)
(of which $161.2 million was available as a result of $38.8 million in letters of credit
outstanding). The senior credit


facility is jointly and severally guaranteed by all of our
domestic subsidiaries (including Discount and its subsidiaries) and is secured by all of
our assets and the assets of our existing and future domestic subsidiaries (including
Discount and its subsidiaries).

The
tranche A term loan currently requires scheduled repayments of $7.5 million on March 31,
2005 and quarterly thereafter through December 31, 2006, $10.0 million on March 31, 2007
and quarterly thereafter through December 31, 2007, $12.5 million on March 31, 2008 and
quarterly thereafter through June 30, 2009 and 25.0 million due at maturity on September
30, 2009. The tranche B term loan currently requires scheduled repayments of $0.4 million
on March 31, 2005 and quarterly thereafter, with a final payment of $160.7 million due at
maturity on September 30, 2010. The delayed draw term loan currently requires
scheduled repayments of 0.25% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding on March 31,
2006 and quarterly thereafter, with a final payment due at maturity on September 30, 2010.
The revolver expires on September 30, 2009.

The
interest rates on the tranche A and B term loans, the delayed draw term loan and the
revolver are based, at our option, on an adjusted LIBOR rate, plus a margin, or an
alternate base rate, plus a margin. The initial margin for the tranche A term loan and
revolver is 1.50% and 0.50% per annum for the adjusted LIBOR and alternate base rate
borrowings, respectively. The initial margin for the tranche B term loan and the delayed
draw term loan is 1.75% and 0.75% per annum for the adjusted LIBOR and alternate base rate
borrowings, respectively. Additionally, a commitment fee of 0.375% per annum is charged on
the unused portion of the tranche A term loan and revolver, payable in arrears. A
commitment fee of 1.75% per annum is charged on the unused portion of the delayed draw
term loan, payable in arrears.

As
of January 1, 2005, we had two interest rate swap agreements outstanding on an aggregate
of $125 million of debt under our credit facility. The first swap allows us to fix our
LIBOR rate at 2.269% on $75.0 million of variable rate debt. The first swap has a term of
36 months and expires in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The second swap allows us to
fix our LIBOR rate at 1.79% on $50.0 million of variable rate debt. The second swap has a
term of 24 months and expires in the first quarter of fiscal 2005.

Subsequent
to January 1, 2005 and in an effort to manage our future interest rate risk, we entered
into the following three new interest rate swap agreements on an aggregate of $175 million of debt under
our senior credit facility:

•

The first swap, beginning in March 2005, allows us to fix our total interest rate at 4.153% on $50 million of our debt for a term of 48 months;

•

The second swap, beginning in March 2005, allows us to fix our total interest rate at 4.255% on $75 million of our debt for a term of 60 months; and

•

The third swap, beginning in March 2006, allows us to fix our total interest rate at 4.6125% on $50 million of our debt for a term of 54 months.

The
senior credit facility is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all, subject
to certain exceptions, of our assets and the assets of our existing domestic subsidiaries
and will be secured by the properties and assets
of our future domestic subsidiaries. The senior credit facility contains covenants
restricting the ability of us and our subsidiaries to, among other things, (1) declare
dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock, (2) prepay, redeem or purchase debt, (3)
incur liens or engage in sale-leaseback transactions, (4) make loans and investments, (5)
incur additional debt (including hedging arrangements), (6) engage in certain
mergers, acquisitions and asset sales, (7) engage in transactions with affiliates, (8)
change the nature of our business and the business conducted by our subsidiaries and (9)
change our passive holding company status. We are also required to comply with financial
covenants with respect to a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum interest coverage ratio, a
minimum current assets to funded senior debt ratio, a maximum senior leverage ratio and
limits on capital expenditures. We were in compliance with the above covenants at January
1, 2005.


Credit Ratings

At
January 1, 2005, we had a credit rating on our senior credit facility from Standard &
Poor’s of BB+ and a credit rating of Ba2 from Moody’s Investor Service. The
current pricing grid used to determine our borrowing rates under our senior credit
facility is based on such credit ratings. If these credit ratings decline, our interest
expense may increase. Conversely, if these credit ratings increase, our interest expense
may decrease.

Seasonality

Our
business is somewhat seasonal in nature, with the highest sales occurring in the spring
and summer months. In addition, our business can be affected by weather conditions. While
unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as elective maintenance is deferred
during such periods, extremely hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing
automotive parts to fail.

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements

In
April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, “Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44
and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13 and Technical Corrections.” As a result of
rescinding FASB Statement No. 4, “Reporting Gains Losses from Extinguishment of
Debt,” gains and losses from extinguishment of debt should be classified as
extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria in APB Opinion No. 30, “Reporting
the Results of Operations — Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a
Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and
Transactions.” This statement also amends FASB Statement No. 13, “Accounting for
Leases,” to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for
sale-leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications
that have economic effects that are similar to sale-leaseback transactions. Additional
amendments include changes to other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various
technical corrections, clarify meanings or describe their applicability under changed
conditions. We adopted SFAS No. 145 during the first quarter of fiscal 2003. For the
fiscal years ended 2004, 2003 and 2002, we recorded losses on the extinguishment of debt
of $3,230, $47,288 and $16,822.

In
July 2003 (as subsequently updated in November 2003), the FASB released Emerging Issues
Task Force, or EITF, Issue No. 03-10, “Application of Issue No. 02-16 by Resellers to
Sales Incentives Offered to Customers by Manufacturers.” This EITF addresses whether
a reseller should account for consideration received from a vendor that is a reimbursement
by the vendor for honoring the vendor’s sales incentives offered directly to
consumers in accordance with the guidance in EITF Issue No. 02-16. For purposes of this
Issue, the “vendor’s sales incentive offered directly to consumers” is
limited to a vendor’s incentive (i) that can be tendered by a consumer at resellers
that accept manufacturer’s incentives in partial (or full) of the price charged by
the reseller for the vendor’s product, (ii) for which the reseller receives a direct
reimbursement from the vendor (or a clearinghouse authorized by the vendor) based on the
face amount of the incentive, (iii) for which the terms of reimbursement to the reseller
for the vendor’s sales incentive offered to the consumer must not be influenced by or
negotiated in conjunction with any other incentive arrangements between the vendor and the
reseller but, rather may only be determined by the terms of the incentive offered to
consumers and (iv) whereby the reseller is subject to an agency relationship with the
vendor, whether expressed or implied, in the sales incentive transaction between the
vendor and the consumer. The consensus is that sales incentives that meet all of such
criteria are not subject to the guidance in Issue No. 02-16. The release is effective for
fiscal periods beginning after November 25, 2003. We adopted this release during the first
quarter of fiscal 2004 with no impact on our financial position or results of operations.

In
May 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position, or FSP, 106-2, “Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003.” FSP 106-2 addresses the appropriate accounting and
disclosure requirements for companies that sponsor a postretirement health care plan that
provides prescription drug benefits. The new guidance was deemed necessary as a result of
the 2003 Medicare prescription law which includes a federal subsidy for qualifying
companies. The effective date of FSP 106-2 is the first interim or annual period beginning
after June 15, 2004. We completed a negative plan amendment to eliminate outpatient
prescription drug benefits from our postretirement plan effective in the second quarter of
fiscal 2004; therefore, the adoption of FSP 106-2 had no impact on our financial position,
results of operations or related footnote disclosure.


In
November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs”. The new
statement amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4, “Inventory
Pricing,” to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense,
freight, handling costs and wasted material. This statement requires that those items be
recognized as current-period charges and requires that allocation of fixed production
overheads to the cost of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production
facilities. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We
do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial
condition or results of operations.

In
December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based
Payment”, or SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R replaces SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation” and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees”, and subsequently issued stock option related guidance.
This statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an
entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, primarily on accounting for
transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment
transactions. It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in
exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity’s
equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments.
Entities will be required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange
for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with
limited exceptions). That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee
is required to provide service in exchange for the award (usually the vesting period). The
grant-date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated
using option-pricing models. If an equity award is modified after the grant date,
incremental compensation cost will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the
fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately
before the modification.

We
are required to apply SFAS No. 123R to all awards granted, modified or settled as of the
beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005.
We are also required to use either the modified-prospective method or
modified-retrospective method. Under the modified-prospective method, we must recognize
compensation cost for all awards subsequent to adopting the standard and for the unvested
portion of previously granted awards outstanding upon adoption. Under the
modified-retrospective method, we must restate our previously issued financial statements
to recognize the amounts we previously calculated and reported on a pro forma basis, as if
the prior standard had been adopted. Under both methods, we are permitted to use either
the straight line or an accelerated method to amortize the cost as an expense for awards
with graded vesting. The standard permits and encourages early adoption.

We
have commenced our analysis of the impact of SFAS No. 123R, but have not yet decided: (1)
whether we elect to early adopt, (2) if we elect to early adopt, what date we would do so,
(3) whether we will use the modified-prospective or modified-retrospective method, and (4)
whether we will elect to use straight line or an accelerated method. Accordingly, we have
not determined the impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 123R will have on our financial
position or results of operations.

Risk Factors

Risks Relating to Our
Business

We may not be able to successfully
implement our business strategy, including increasing comparable store sales, enhancing
our margins and increasing our return on invested capital, which could adversely affect
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We
have implemented numerous initiatives to increase comparable store sales, enhance our
margins and increase our return on invested capital in order to increase our earnings and
cash flow. If these initiatives are unsuccessful, or if we are unable to implement the
initiatives efficiently and effectively, our business, financial condition and results of
operations could be adversely affected.

Successful
implementation of our business strategy also depends on factors specific to the retail
automotive parts industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control.
Adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business strategy:


•

general economic conditions and conditions in our local markets, which could reduce our sales;

•

the competitive environment in the automotive aftermarket parts and accessories retail sector that may force us to reduce prices or increase spending;

•

the automotive aftermarket parts manufacturing industry, such as consolidation, which may disrupt or
         sever one or more of our vendor relationships;

•

our ability to anticipate and meet changes in consumer preferences for automotive products, accessories
         and services in a timely manner; and

•

our continued ability to hire and retain qualified personnel, which depends in part on the
types of recruiting, training and benefit programs we adopt.

We will not be able to expand our
business if our growth strategy is not successful.

We
have increased our store count significantly from 1,567 stores at the end of 1998 to 2,652
stores at January 1, 2005. We intend to continue to expand our base of stores as part of
our growth strategy, primarily by opening new stores. There can be no assurance that the
implementation of this strategy will be successful. The actual number of new stores to be
opened and their success will depend on a number of factors, including, among other
things:

•

our ability to manage the expansion and hire, train and retain qualified sales associates;

•

the availability of potential store locations in highly visible, well-trafficked areas; and

•

the negotiation of acceptable lease terms for new locations.

There can be no assurance that we
will be able to open and operate new stores on a timely or sufficiently profitable basis
or that opening new stores in markets we already serve will not harm existing store
profitability or comparable store sales. The newly opened and existing stores’
profitability will depend on our ability to properly merchandise, market and price the
products required in their respective markets.

Furthermore,
we may acquire or try to acquire stores or businesses from, make investments in, or enter
into strategic alliances with, companies that have stores or distribution networks in our
current markets or in areas into which we intend to expand our presence. Any future
acquisitions, investments, strategic alliances or related efforts will be accompanied by
risks, including:

•

the difficulty of identifying appropriate acquisition candidates;

•

the difficulty of assimilating and integrating the operations of the respective entities;

•

the potential disruption to our ongoing business and diversion of our management’s attention;

•

the inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; and

•

the impairment of relationships with team members and customers as a result of changes in management.

We cannot assure you that we will be
successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered with these
acquisitions, investments, strategic alliances or related efforts.

If overall demand for products
sold by our stores slows, our business, financial condition and results of operations will
suffer.

Overall
demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may slow for a number
of reasons, including:

•

the weather, as vehicle maintenance may be deferred during periods of inclement weather;

•

the economy, as during periods of good economic conditions, more of our DIY customers may pay others to repair and maintain their cars instead of working on their own cars. In periods of declining economic conditions, both DIY and DIFM customers may defer vehicle maintenance or repair; and

•

the decline of the average age of vehicles, miles driven or number of cars on the road may indicate a reduction in the demand for our product offerings.

If
any of these factors cause overall demand for the products we sell to decline, our
business, financial condition and results of operations will suffer.


We depend on the services of many
qualified team members and may not be able to attract and retain such qualified team
members.

Our
success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our
many team members. At March 9, 2005, we employed 37,795 team members. We cannot assure you
that we will be able to retain our current qualified team members as well as attract and
retain additional qualified team members as needed in the future. Our ability to maintain
an adequate level of qualified team members is highly dependent on an attractive and
competitive compensation and benefits package. If we fail to maintain such an adequate
compensation and benefits package, our customer service and execution levels could suffer
by reason of a declining quality of our workforce, which could adversely affect our
financial condition and results of operations.

If we are unable to compete
successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry, we could lose
customers and our revenues may decline.

The
sale of automotive parts, accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many
areas, including price, name recognition, customer service and location. We compete in
both the DIY and DIFM categories of the automotive aftermarket industry, and primarily
with national and regional retail automotive parts chains, wholesalers or jobber stores,
independent operators, automobile dealers that supply parts, discount stores and mass
merchandisers that carry automotive products. These competitors and the level of
competition vary by market. Some of our competitors may possess advantages over us in
certain markets we share, including a greater amount of marketing activities, a larger
number of stores, longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger and more
established customer bases. Our response to these competitive disadvantages may require us
to reduce our prices or increase our spending, which would lower revenue and
profitability. Competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product
lines or require us to discontinue current product offerings or change some of our current
operating strategies. If we do not have the resources or expertise or otherwise fail to
develop successful strategies to address these competitive disadvantages, we could lose
customers and our revenues may decline.

Disruptions in our relationships
with vendors or in our vendors’ operations could increase our cost of goods sold.

Our
business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our vendors and
upon the vendors’ ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable
prices and on other terms. Many factors outside of our control may harm these
relationships and the ability or willingness of these vendors to sell us products on
favorable terms. For example, financial or operational difficulties that some of our
vendors may face may increase the cost of the products we purchase from them. In addition,
the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers may disrupt or end our
relationship with some vendors, and could lead to less competition and, consequently,
higher prices.

Because we are involved in
litigation from time to time, and are subject to numerous governmental laws and
regulations, we could incur substantial judgments, fines, legal fees and other costs.

We
are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers, employees or other
third parties for various actions. In particular, we are currently involved in litigation
involving claims relating to, among other things, breach of contract, tortious conduct,
employment discrimination, asbestos exposure and product defects. The damages sought
against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial. Although we maintain
liability insurance for some litigation claims, if one or more of the claims greatly
exceeds our coverage limits or our insurance policies do not cover a claim, it could have
a material adverse affect on our business and operating results.

Additionally,
we are subject to numerous federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations
relating to employment matters, environmental protection and building and zoning
requirements. If we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations, we may be
subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions. In addition, our capital expenses
could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be
noncompliant with any of these or future laws or regulations.


Risks Relating to Our
Financial Condition

The covenants governing our senior
credit facility impose significant restrictions on us.

The
terms of our senior credit facility impose significant operating and financial
restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and require us to meet certain financial tests.
These restrictions may also have a negative impact on our business, financial condition
and results of operations by significantly limiting or prohibiting us from engaging in
certain transactions, including:

•

incurring or guaranteeing additional indebtedness;

•

paying dividends or making distributions or certain other restricted payments;

•

making capital expenditures and other investments;

•

creating liens on our assets;

•

issuing or selling capital stock of our subsidiaries;

•

transferring or selling assets currently held by us;

•

repurchasing stock and certain indebtedness;

•

engaging in transactions with affiliates;

•

entering into any agreements that restrict dividends from our subsidiaries; and

•

engaging in mergers or consolidations.

The
failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under our senior
credit facility. Furthermore, our senior credit facility contains certain financial
covenants, including establishing a maximum leverage ratio and requiring us to maintain a
minimum interest coverage ratio and a funded senior debt to current assets ratio, which,
if not maintained by us, will cause us to be in default under our senior credit facility.
Any of these defaults, if not waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt,
in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable. If this occurs, we may
not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if new
financing were available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us.

Our ability to service our debt
will require a significant amount of cash and our operations may not generate the amount
of cash we need.

We
will need a significant amount of cash to service our debt. Our ability to generate cash
depends on our successful financial and operating performance. We cannot assure you that
we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that we will be able to obtain
sufficient funding to satisfy all of our obligations. Our financial and operational
performance also depends upon a number of other factors, many of which are beyond our
control. These factors include:

•

economic and competitive conditions in the automotive aftermarket industry; and

•

operating difficulties, operating costs or pricing pressures we may experience.

If
we are unable to service our debt, we will be required to pursue one or more alternative
strategies, such as selling assets, refinancing or restructuring our debt or raising
additional equity capital. However, we cannot assure you that any alternative strategies
will be feasible or prove adequate. Also, some alternative strategies would require the
consent of at least a majority in interest of the lenders under our senior credit facility
and we can provide no assurances that we would be able to obtain this consent. If we are
unable to meet our debt service obligations and alternative strategies are unsuccessful or
unavailable, our lenders would be entitled to exercise various remedies, including
foreclosing on our assets. Under those circumstances, our investors may lose all or a
portion of their investments.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risks.

We
are exposed to cash flow risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to our
long-term debt. Our long-term debt currently consists of borrowings under a senior credit
facility and is primarily vulnerable to movements in the LIBOR rate. While we cannot
predict the impact interest rate movements will have on our debt, exposure to rate changes
is managed through the use of hedging activities. Our future exposure to interest rate
risk increased during


2004 due to the expiration of our $150.0 million zero-cost collar
during November 2004.

In
March 2003, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements on an aggregate of $125
million of our debt under our credit facility. The first swap allows us to fix our LIBOR
rate at 2.269% on $75.0 million of variable rate debt for a term of 36 months, expiring in
the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The second swap allows us to fix our LIBOR rate at 1.79%
on $50.0 million of variable rate debt for a term of 24 months, expiring in the first
quarter of fiscal 2005.

Subsequent
to January 1, 2005 and in an effort to manage our future interest rate risk, we entered
into the following three new interest rate swap agreements on an aggregate of $175 million of debt under
our senior credit facility. The detail for the individual swaps is as follows:

•

The first swap, beginning in March 2005, allows us to fix our total interest rate at 4.153% on $50 million of our debt for a term of 48 months;

•

The second swap, beginning in March 2005, allows us to fix our total interest rate at 4.255% on $75 million of our debt for a term of 60 months; and

•

The third swap, beginning in March 2006, allows us to fix our total interest rate at 4.6125% on $50 million of our debt for a term of 54 months.

The
table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates on
our long-term debt outstanding at January 1, 2005, by expected maturity dates.
Additionally, the table includes the notional amounts of our debt hedged and the impact of
the anticipated average pay and receive rates of our interest rate swaps through their
maturity dates. Expected maturity dates approximate contract terms. Weighted average
variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at January 1, 2005,
as adjusted by the limitations of the swap agreement. The impact of our three interest
rate swap agreements entered into in March 2005 are not reflected in the table below.
Implied forward rates should not be considered a predictor of actual future interest
rates.

MANAGEMENT’S
REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of Advance Auto Parts,
Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company’s
principal executive officer and principal financial officer to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the
Company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Our internal control over financial
reporting includes policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

As of January 1, 2005, management
assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
based on the criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
Based on this assessment, management has determined that the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2005 is effective. Because of the
inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over
financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, the
Company’s independent registered public accounting firm who audited the
Company’s consolidated financial statements, has issued a report on management’s
assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January
1, 2005 and is included on page F-3 herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors
and Stockholders of

Advance Auto Parts, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Roanoke, Virginia

We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of Advance Auto Parts, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as
of January 1, 2005 and January 3, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended January 1, 2005. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Advance Auto Parts, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 1, 2005 and January 3, 2004, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended January 1, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
January 1, 2005, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission and our report dated March 14, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on
management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors
and Stockholders of

Advance Auto Parts, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Roanoke, Virginia

We have audited management’s
assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting, that Advance Auto Parts, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company)
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2005,
based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The
Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing
similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations
of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may
not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are
subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s
assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of January 1, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria
established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of January 1, 2005, based on the criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission.

F-3

We have also audited, in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of Advance Auto Parts, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 1,
2005 and January 3, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
January 1, 2005 and our report dated March 14, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on
those financial statements.

1. Organization and
Description of Business:

Advance
Auto Parts, Inc. (“Advance”) conducts all of its operations through its wholly
owned subsidiary, Advance Stores Company, Incorporated and its subsidiaries
(“Stores”). Advance and Stores (collectively, the “Company”) operate
2,652 stores within the United States, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The Company
operates 2,617 stores throughout 39 states in the Northeastern, Southeastern and
Midwestern regions of the United States. These stores operate under the “Advance Auto
Parts” trade name except for certain stores in the State of Florida which operate
under “Advance Discount Auto Parts” or “Discount Auto Parts” trade
names. These stores offer automotive replacement parts, accessories and maintenance items,
with no significant concentration in any specific area. In addition, the Company operates
35 stores under the “Western Auto” trade name, located primarily in Puerto Rico
and the Virgin Islands, which offer tires and service in addition to automotive parts,
accessories and maintenance items.

2. Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies:

Accounting Period

The
Company’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of December, which results
in an extra week every six years. Accordingly, fiscal 2003 includes 53 weeks of
operations. All other fiscal years presented include 52 weeks of operations.

Principles of
Consolidation

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

Cash, Cash Equivalents
and Bank Overdrafts

Cash
and cash equivalents consist of cash in banks and money market funds. Bank overdrafts
include net outstanding checks not yet presented to a bank for settlement.

Vendor Incentives

The
Company receives incentives in the form of reductions to amounts owed and/or payments from
vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances, volume rebates and other
promotional consideration. The Company accounts for vendor incentives in accordance with
Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, No. 02-16, “Accounting by a Customer (Including
a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor.” Many of the incentives
are under long-term agreements (terms in excess of one year), while others are negotiated
on an annual basis. Certain vendors require the Company to use cooperative advertising
allowances exclusively for advertising. The Company defines these allowances as restricted
cooperative advertising allowances and recognizes them as a reduction to selling, general
and administrative expenses as incremental advertising expenditures are incurred. The
remaining cooperative advertising allowances not restricted by the Company’s vendors
and volume rebates are earned based on inventory purchases and recorded as a reduction to
inventory and recognized through cost of sales as the inventory is sold.

ADVANCE AUTO PARTS,
INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)

January 1, 2005, January 3, 2004, and December 28, 2002

(in thousands, except per share data)

The
Company recognizes other promotional incentives earned under long-term agreements as a
reduction to cost of sales. These incentives are recognized based on the cumulative
purchases as a percentage of total estimated purchases over the life of the agreement. The
Company’s margins could be impacted positively or negatively if actual purchases or
results from any one-year differ from its estimates, however the impact over the life of
the agreement would be the same. Short-term incentives (terms less than one year) are
recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the course of the annual agreements and
are not recorded as reductions to inventory.

Amounts
received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred
revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Management’s estimate of the
portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within one year of the balance sheet
date has been included in other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets. Total deferred revenue is $17,000 and $19,524 at January 1, 2005 and
January 3, 2004, respectively. Earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are
included in receivables, net on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, except for
that portion expected to be received after one-year, which is included in other assets,
net on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Preopening Expenses

Preopening
expenses, which consist primarily of payroll and occupancy costs, are expensed as
incurred.

Advertising Costs

The
Company expenses advertising costs as incurred in accordance with the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountant’s Statement of Position, or SOP, 93-7, “Reporting
on Advertising Costs.” Gross advertising expense incurred was approximately $86,821,
$75,870 and $69,637 in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Merger and Integration
Costs

As
a result of the Discount Auto Parts (“Discount”) acquisition in 2001, the
Company incurred costs related to, among other things, overlapping administrative
functions and store conversions, all of which have been expensed as incurred. These costs
are presented as expenses associated with the merger and integration in the accompanying
statements of operations.

For
the fiscal years ended January 3, 2004 and December 28, 2002, the Company incurred $10,417
and $35,532, respectively, of merger and integration and merger-related restructuring
expenses.

Warranty Costs

The
Company’s vendors are primarily responsible for warranty claims. Warranty costs
relating to merchandise and services sold under warranty, which are not covered by
vendors’ warranties, are estimated based on the Company’s historical experience
and are recorded in the period the product is sold. The Company has applied the disclosure
requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Interpretation No. 45,
“Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
the Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” as they relate to warranties. The
following table presents changes in our defective and warranty reserves.

Represents subsequent adjustments to the Company’s original purchase price allocation from the acquisition of Discount.  These adjustments were the result of obtaining additional information related to the estimated costs of outstanding warranties and have been allocated proportionately to our non-current assets, primarily property and equipment. These adjustments had no direct impact on the statement of operations, but reduced the depreciable base of the associated non-current assets.

Revenue Recognition and
Trade Receivables

The
Company recognizes merchandise revenue at the point of sale to customers. Service revenue
is recognized upon performance of the service. The Company establishes reserves for
returns and allowances at the time of sale based on current sales levels and historical
return rates. The majority of sales are made for cash; however, the Company extends credit
to certain commercial customers through a third-party provider of private label credit
cards. Receivables under the private label credit card program are transferred to the
third-party provider on a limited recourse basis. The Company provides an allowance for
doubtful accounts on receivables sold with recourse based upon factors related to credit
risk of specific customers, historical trends and other information. This arrangement is
accounted for as a secured borrowing. Receivables and the related secured borrowings under
the private label credit card were $26,898 and $20,623 at January 1, 2005 and January 3,
2004, respectively, and are included in accounts receivable and other current liabilities,
respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Earnings Per Share of
Common Stock

Basic
earnings per share of common stock has been computed based on the weighted-average number
of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share of common stock
reflects the increase in the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding assuming
the exercise of outstanding stock options, calculated on the treasury stock method. There
were 340, 59 and 116 antidilutive options for the fiscal years ended January 1, 2005,
January 3, 2004 and December 28, 2002, respectively.

Stock Split

On
October 29, 2003, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock split
of the Company’s common stock, effected as a 100% stock dividend. The dividend was
distributed on January 2, 2004 to holders of record as of December 11, 2003 and began
trading on a post-split basis on January 5, 2004. All share and per share amounts in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect the effects
of the stock split.

Stock-Based Compensation

The
Company has stock-based compensation plans including fixed stock option plans, deferred
stock units and an employee stock purchase plan. As permitted under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard, or SFAS, No.

123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,” the Company accounts for its stock options using the intrinsic value
method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board, or APB, Opinion No. 25, “Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees”, or APB No. 25. Under APB No. 25, compensation cost
for stock options is measured as the excess, if any, of the market price of the
Company’s common stock at the measurement date over the exercise price. Accordingly,
the Company has not recognized compensation expense on the issuance of its fixed options
because the exercise price equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock on the
grant date. In addition, the Company has not recognized compensation expense for its
employee stock purchase plan since it is intended to be a plan that qualifies under
Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The issuance of deferred
stock units results in compensation expense as discussed in the Equity Compensation
footnote (Note 19).

As
required by SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation – Transition
and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123,” the following table reflects
the impact on net income and earnings per share as if the Company had adopted the fair
method of recognizing stock-based compensation costs as prescribed by SFAS No. 123.

Financed Vendor Accounts
Payable

During
the first quarter on fiscal 2004, the Company entered a short-term financing program with
a bank allowing it to extend its payment terms on certain merchandise purchases. Under
this program, the Company issues

(in thousands, except per share data)

negotiable instruments to vendors in lieu of a cash
payment. The vendor presents the instrument to the bank for payment at an agreed upon
discount rate. The Company records this discount given by the vendor to the value of its
inventory upon the Company’s issuance of the negotiable instrument and accretes this
discount to the resulting short-term payable to the bank through interest expense over the
extended term. At January 1, 2005, $56,896 was payable to the bank by the Company under
this program and is included in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as
Financed Vendor Accounts Payable.

Lease Accounting

The
Company leases certain store locations, distribution centers, office space, equipment and
vehicles, some of which are with related parties. Initial terms for facility leases are
typically 10 to 15 years, followed by additional terms containing renewal options at 5
year intervals, and may include rent escalation clauses. The total amount of the minimum
rent is expensed on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the lease unless
external economic factors exist such that renewals are reasonably assured, in which case
the Company would include the renewal period in its amortization period. In those
instances the renewal period would be included in the lease term for purposes of
establishing an amortization period and determining if such lease qualified as a capital
or operating lease. In addition to minimum fixed rentals, some leases provide for
contingent facility rentals. Contingent facility rentals are determined on the basis of a
percentage of sales in excess of stipulated minimums for certain store facilities as
defined in the individual lease agreements. Most of the leases provide that the Company
pay taxes, maintenance, insurance and certain other expenses applicable to the leased
premises and include options to renew. Management expects that, in the normal course of
business, leases that expire will be renewed or replaced by other leases.

Hedge Activities

In
March 2003 the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements to limit its cash
flow risk on an aggregate of $125,000 of its variable rate debt. The first swap allows the
Company to fix its LIBOR rate at 2.269% on $75,000 of debt for a term of 36 months,
expiring first quarter fiscal 2006. The second swap allows the Company to fix its LIBOR
rate at 1.79% on an additional $50,000 of debt for a term of 24 months, expiring first
quarter fiscal 2005.

In
September 2002, the Company entered into a hedge agreement in the form of a zero-cost
collar, which protects the Company from interest rate fluctuations in the LIBOR rate on
$150,000 of its variable rate debt under its senior credit facility. The collar consists
of an interest rate ceiling at 4.5% and an interest rate floor of 1.56% for a term of 24
months. Under this hedge, the Company will continue to pay interest at prevailing rates
plus any spread, as defined by the Company’s credit facility, but will be reimbursed
for any amounts paid on the LIBOR rate in excess of the ceiling. Conversely, the Company
will be required to pay the financial institution that originated the collar if the LIBOR
rate is less than the floor. The collar expired during November 2004.

In
accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,” the fair value of the hedge arrangement is recorded as an asset or
liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at January 3, 2004. The Company
has adopted the “matched terms” accounting method as provided by Derivative
Implementation Group, or DIG, Issue No. G20, “Assessing and Measuring the
Effectiveness of a Purchased Option Used in a Cash Flow Hedge” for the zero-cost
collar, and DIG Issue No. 9, “Assuming No Ineffectiveness When Critical Terms of the
Hedging Instrument and the Hedge Transaction Match in a Cash Flow Hedge” for the
interest rate swaps. Accordingly, the Company has matched the critical terms of each hedge
instrument to the hedged debt and used the anticipated terminal value of zero to assume
the hedges have no ineffectiveness. In addition, the Company will record all adjustments
to the fair value of the hedge instruments in accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) through the maturity date of the applicable hedge arrangement. The fair value at
January 1, 2005 was an unrecognized gain of $814 on the swaps. Any amounts received or
paid under these hedges will be recorded in the statement of operations as earned or
incurred. Comprehensive income for the fiscal years ended January 1, 2005 and January 3,
2004 is as follows:

of $627 associated with the interest rate swaps.

Subsequent
to January 1, 2005, the Company entered into three interest rate swap agreements on an
aggregate of $175 million of debt under its senior credit facility. The first swap,
beginning in March 2005, provides for the Company to fix its total interest rate at 4.153%
on $50 million of debt for a term of 48 months. The second swap, beginning in March 2005,
provides for the Company to fix its total interest rate at 4.255% on $75 million of debt
for a term of 60 months. The third swap, beginning in March 2006, provides for the Company
to fix its total interest rate at 4.6125% on $50 million of debt for a term of 54 months.

Segment Reporting

The
Company operates in one business segment as defined by the provisions of SFAS No. 131,
“Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,” which
defines how operating segments are determined and requires disclosures about products,
services, major customers and geographic areas. Prior to the Company’s discontinuance
of the Wholesale Distribution Network in fiscal 2003 (Note 3), the Company operated in two
business segments.

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements

In
April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, “Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44
and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13 and Technical Corrections.” As a result of
rescinding FASB Statement No. 4, “Reporting Gains Losses from Extinguishment of
Debt,” gains and losses from extinguishment of debt should be classified as
extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria in APB Opinion No. 30, “Reporting
the Results of Operations — Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a
Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and
Transactions.” This statement also amends FASB Statement No. 13, “Accounting for
Leases,” to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for
sale-leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications
that have economic effects that are similar to sale-leaseback transactions. Additional
amendments include changes to other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various
technical corrections, clarify meanings or describe their applicability under changed
conditions. The Company adopted SFAS No. 145 during the first quarter of fiscal 2003. For
the fiscal years ended 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded losses on the
extinguishment of debt of $3,230, $47,288 and $16,822.

In
July 2003 (as subsequently updated in November 2003), the FASB released Emerging Issues
Task Force, or EITF, Issue No. 03-10, “Application of Issue No. 02-16 by Resellers to
Sales Incentives Offered to Customers by Manufacturers.” This EITF addresses whether
a reseller should account for consideration received from a vendor that is a reimbursement
by the vendor for honoring the vendor’s sales incentives offered directly to
consumers in accordance with the guidance in EITF Issue No. 02-16. For purposes of this
Issue, the “vendor’s sales incentive offered directly to consumers” is
limited to a vendor’s incentive (i) that can be tendered by a consumer at resellers
that accept manufacturer’s incentives in partial (or full) of the price charged by
the reseller for the vendor’s product, (ii) for which the reseller receives a direct
reimbursement from the vendor (or a clearinghouse authorized by the vendor) based on the
face amount of the incentive, (iii) for which the terms of reimbursement to the reseller
for the vendor’s sales incentive offered to the consumer must not be influenced by or
negotiated in conjunction with any other incentive arrangements between the vendor and the
reseller but, rather may only be determined by the terms of the incentive offered to
consumers and (iv) whereby the reseller is subject to an agency relationship with the
vendor,

whether expressed or implied, in the sales incentive transaction between the
vendor and the consumer. The consensus is that sales incentives that meet all of such
criteria are not subject to the guidance in Issue No. 02-16. The release is effective for
fiscal periods beginning after November 25, 2003. The Company adopted this release during
the first quarter of fiscal 2004 with no impact on its financial position or results of
operations.

In
May 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position, or FSP, 106-2, “Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003.” FSP 106-2 addresses the appropriate accounting and
disclosure requirements for companies that sponsor a postretirement health care plan that
provides prescription drug benefits. The new guidance was deemed necessary as a result of
the 2003 Medicare prescription law which includes a federal subsidy for qualifying
companies. The effective date of FSP 106-2 is the first interim or annual period beginning
after June 15, 2004. The Company completed a negative plan amendment to eliminate
outpatient prescription drug benefits from its postretirement plan effective in the second
quarter of fiscal 2004; therefore, the adoption of FSP 106-2 had no impact on its
financial position, results of operations or related footnote disclosure.

In
November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs”. The new
statement amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4, “Inventory
Pricing,” to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense,
freight, handling costs and wasted material. This statement requires that those items be
recognized as current-period charges and requires that allocation of fixed production
overheads to the cost of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production
facilities. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005.
The Company does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on
its financial condition or results of operations.

In
December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based
Payment”, or SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R replaces SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation” and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees”, and subsequently issued stock option related guidance.
This statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an
entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, primarily on accounting for
transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment
transactions. It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in
exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity’s
equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments.
Entities will be required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange
for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with
limited exceptions). That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee
is required to provide service in exchange for the award (usually the vesting period). The
grant-date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated
using option-pricing models. If an equity award is modified after the grant date,
incremental compensation cost will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the
fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately
before the modification.

The
Company is required to apply SFAS No. 123R to all awards granted, modified or settled as
of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after June
15, 2005. The statement also requires the Company to use either the modified-prospective
method or modified-retrospective method. Under the modified-prospective method, the
Company must recognize compensation cost for all awards subsequent to adopting the
standard and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards outstanding upon
adoption. Under the modified-retrospective method, the Company must restate its previously
issued financial statements to recognize the amounts it previously calculated and reported
on a pro forma basis, as if the prior standard had been adopted. Under both methods, the
statement permits the use of either the straight line or an accelerated method to amortize
the cost as an expense for awards with graded vesting. The standard permits and encourages
early adoption.

The
Company has commenced its analysis of the impact of SFAS No. 123R, but has not yet
decided: (1) whether to elect early adoption, (2) the early adoption date, if elected, (3)
the use of the modified-prospective or modified-retrospective method, and (4) the election
to use straight line or an accelerated method. Accordingly, the Company has not determined
the impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 123R will have on the financial position or
results of operations.

Reclassifications

Certain
items in the fiscal 2003 financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the
fiscal 2004 presentation.

3. Discontinued
Operations:

On
December 19, 2003, the Company discontinued the supply of merchandise to its Wholesale
Distribution Network, or Wholesale. Wholesale consisted of independently owned and
operated dealer locations, for which the Company supplied merchandise inventory. This
component of the Company’s business operated in the Company’s previously
reported wholesale segment. The Company has accounted for the discontinuance of the
wholesale segment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” The Company has classified these operating results as
discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the
fiscal years ended January 3, 2004 and December 28, 2002. For the fiscal years ended
January 3, 2004 and December 28, 2002, the Wholesale Distribution Network had revenues of
$52,486 and $83,743, respectively. At January 3, 2004, the Wholesale Distribution Network
assets were not significant to the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. For the fiscal
year ended January 1, 2005, the operating results related to the discontinued wholesale
business were minimal as a result of recognizing an estimate of exit costs in
fiscal 2003.

The
discontinued wholesale segment, excluding certain allocated and team member benefit
expenses, represented the entire results of operations previously reported in that
segment. These excluded expenses represented $2,361 and $3,272 of allocated and team
member benefit expenses for fiscal 2003, and 2002, respectively, that remain a component
of income from continuing operations and have therefore been excluded from discontinued
operations. The Company has allocated corporate interest expenses incurred under the
Company’s senior credit facility and subordinated notes. The allocated interest
complies with the provisions of EITF 87-24, “Allocation of Interest to Discontinued
Operations,” and are reported in discontinued operations on the accompanying
statements of operations. These amounts were $484 and $1,126 for fiscal 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The loss on the discontinued operations of Wholesale for fiscal 2003
included $2,693 of exit costs as follows:

Severance costs

4. Closed Store and
Restructuring Liabilities:

The
Company continually reviews the operating performance of its existing store locations and
closes certain locations identified as under performing. Closing an under performing
location does not result in the elimination of the operations and associated cash flows
from the Company’s ongoing operations as the Company transfers those operations to
another location in the local market. The Company maintains closed store liabilities that
include liabilities for these exit activities and liabilities assumed through past
acquisitions that are similar in nature but recorded by the acquired companies prior to
acquisition. The Company also maintains restructuring liabilities recorded through
purchase accounting that reflect costs of the plan to integrate the acquired operations
into the Company’s business. These integration plans relate to the operations
acquired in the fiscal 1998 merger with Western Auto Supply Company, or Western, and the
fiscal 2001 acquisition of Discount. The following table presents a summary of the
activity for both of these liabilities:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

January 1, 2005, January 3, 2004, and December 28, 2002

(in thousands, except per share data)

New
provisions established for closed store liabilities include the present value of the
remaining lease obligations and management’s estimate of future costs of insurance,
property tax and common area maintenance reduced by the present value of estimated
revenues from subleases and lease buyouts and are established by a charge to selling,
general and administrative costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations
at the time the facilities actually close. The Company currently uses discount rates
ranging from 4.5% to 7.8% for estimating these liabilities.

From
time to time these estimates require revisions that affect the amount of the recorded
liability. The above change in estimates relate primarily to changes in assumptions
associated with the revenue from subleases. The effect of changes in estimates for the
closed store liabilities is netted with new provisions and included in selling, general
and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

Changes
in estimates associated with restructuring liabilities resulted in adjustments to the
carrying value of property and equipment, net on the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets and did not affect the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. The
closed store and restructuring liabilities are recorded in accrued expenses (current
portion) and other long-term liabilities (long-term portion) in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets.

5. Receivables:

Receivables consist of the following:

6. Inventories, net

Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market, cost being determined using the last-in,
first-out (“LIFO”) method for approximately 93% of inventories at both January
1, 2005 and January 3, 2004. Under the LIFO method, the Company’s cost of sales
reflects the costs of the most currently purchased inventories while the inventory
carrying balance represents the costs relating to prices paid in prior years. The
Company’s costs to acquire inventory have been decreasing in recent years as a result
of its significant growth. Accordingly, the cost to currently replace inventory is less
than the LIFO balances carried for similar product. As a result of the LIFO method and the
ability to obtain lower product costs, the Company recorded reductions to cost of sales of
$11,212, $2,156 and $13,128 for fiscal years ended 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The
remaining inventories are comprised of product cores, which consist of the non-consumable
portion of certain parts and batteries and are valued under the first-in, first-out
(“FIFO”) method. Core values are included as part of our merchandise costs and
are either passed on to the customer or returned to the vendor. Additionally, these
products are not subject to the frequent cost changes like our other merchandise
inventory, therefore resulting in no material difference from applying either the LIFO or
FIFO valuation methods.

The
Company capitalizes certain purchasing and warehousing costs into inventory. Purchasing
and warehousing costs included in inventory, at FIFO, at January 1, 2005 and January 3,
2004, were $81,458 and $75,349, respectively. Inventories consist of the following:

quantities are tracked through a perpetual inventory system. The Company uses a cycle
counting program in all distribution centers, Parts Delivered Quickly (“PDQs”),
Local Area Warehouses, or LAWs, and retail stores to ensure the accuracy of the perpetual
inventory quantities of both merchandise and core inventory. The Company establishes
reserves for estimated shrink based on historical accuracy and effectiveness of the cycle
counting program. The Company also establishes reserves for potentially excess and
obsolete inventories based on current inventory levels of discontinued product and the
historical analysis of the liquidation of discontinued

inventory below cost. The nature of
the Company’s inventory is such that the risk of obsolescence is minimal and excess
inventory has historically been returned to the Company’s vendors for credit. The
Company provides reserves when less than full credit is expected from a vendor or when
liquidating product will result in retail prices below recorded costs. The Company’s
reserves against inventory for these matters were $21,929 and $16,011 at January 1, 2005
and January 3, 2004, respectively.

7. Property and
Equipment:

Property
and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged directly to expense when incurred;
major improvements are capitalized. When items are sold or retired, the related cost and
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, with any gain or loss reflected in
the consolidated statements of operations.

Depreciation
of land improvements, buildings, furniture, fixtures and equipment, and vehicles is
provided over the estimated useful lives, which range from 2 to 40 years, of the
respective assets using the straight-line method. Amortization of building and leasehold
improvements is provided over the shorter of the original useful lives of the respective
assets or the term of the lease using the straight-line method. The term of the lease is
generally the initial term of the lease unless external economic factors exist such that
renewals are reasonably assured in which case, the renewal period would be included in the
lease term for purposes of establishing an amortization period. At January 1, 2005,
construction in progress primarily consisted of construction related costs for
the Company’s new Northeast distribution center.
Depreciation and amortization expense was $104,877, $100,737 and $94,090 for the fiscal
years ended 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Property
and equipment consists of the following:

The
Company capitalized approximately $4,625, $5,423 and $2,888 incurred for the development
of internal use computer software in accordance with the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountant’s Statement of Position 98-1, “Accounting for the Cost of
Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use” during fiscal 2004, fiscal
2003 and fiscal 2002, respectively. These costs are included in the furniture, fixtures
and equipment category above and are depreciated on the straight-line method over three to
seven years.

12. Long-term Debt:

Long-term
debt consists of the following:

On
November 3, 2004, the Company entered into a new amended and restated $670,000 senior
credit facility. This new senior credit facility provides for a $200,000 tranche A term
loan and a $170,000 tranche B term loan. Proceeds from these term loans were used to
refinance the Company’s previously existing tranche D and E term loans and revolver
under the Company’s previous senior credit facility. Additionally, the new senior
credit facility will provide for a $100,000 delayed draw term loan, which is available
exclusively for stock buybacks under the Company’s stock repurchase program, and a
$200,000 revolving facility, or the revolver (which provides for the issuance of letters
of credit with a sub limit of $70,000).

In
conjunction with this refinancing, the Company wrote-off existing deferred financing costs
related to the Company’s tranche D and E term loans in accordance with EITF Issue No.
96-19, “Debtor’s Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of Debt
Instruments”. The write-off of these costs combined with the related refinancing
costs incurred to set up the new credit facility resulted in a loss on extinguishment of
debt of $2,818 in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year
ended January 1, 2005. During fiscal 2004, prior to the refinancing of its credit
facility, the Company repaid $105,000 in debt prior to its scheduled maturity. In
conjunction with these partial repayments, the Company wrote-off deferred financing costs
in the amount of $412, which is classified as a loss on extinguishment of debt in the
accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended January 1, 2005.

At
January 1, 2005, the senior credit facility provided for (1) $470,000 in term loans (as
detailed above) and (2) $200,000 under a revolving credit facility (which provides for the
issuance of letters of credit with a sub limit of $70,000). As of January 1, 2005, the
Company had $38,822 in letters of credit outstanding, which reduced availability under the
credit facility to $161,178.

The
tranche A term loan currently requires scheduled repayments of $7,500 on March 31, 2005
and quarterly thereafter through December 31, 2006, $10,000 on March 31, 2007 and
quarterly thereafter through December 31, 2007, $12,500 on March 31, 2008 and quarterly
thereafter through June 30, 2009 and $25,000 due at maturity on

January 1, 2005, January 3, 2004, and December 28, 2002

(in thousands, except per share data)

September 30, 2009. The
tranche B term loan currently requires scheduled repayments of $425 on March 31, 2005 and
quarterly thereafter, with a final payment of $160,650 due at maturity on September 30,
2010. The delayed draw term loan currently requires scheduled repayments of 0.25% of the
aggregate principal amount outstanding on March 31, 2006 and quarterly thereafter, with a
final payment due at maturity on September 30, 2010. The revolver expires on September 30,
2009.

The
interest rates on the tranche A and B term loan loans, the delayed term loan and the
revolver are based, at the Company’s option, on an adjusted LIBOR rate, plus a
margin, or an alternate base rate, plus a margin. The initial margin for the tranche A
term loan and revolver is 1.50% and 0.50% per annum for the adjusted LIBOR and alternate
base rate borrowings, respectively. The initial margin for the tranche B loan and the
delayed draw term loan is 1.75% and 0.75% per annum for the adjusted LIBOR and alternative
base rate borrowings, respectively. Additionally, a commitment fee of 0.375% per annum
will be charged on the unused portion of the tranche A term loan and revolver, payable in
arrears. A commitment fee of 1.75% per annum will be charged on the unused portion of the
delayed draw term loan, payable in arrears.

Borrowings
under the senior credit facility are required to be prepaid, subject to certain
exceptions, with (1) 50% of the Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the senior credit
facility) unless the Company’s Senior Leverage Ratio (as defined in the senior credit
facility) at the end of any fiscal year is less than or equal to 1.00 to 1.00, in which
case 25% of Excess Cash Flow for such fiscal year will be required to be repaid, (2) 100%
of the net cash proceeds of all asset sales or other dispositions of property by the
Company and its subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions (including exceptions for
reinvestment of certain asset sale proceeds within 270 days of such sale and certain
sale-leaseback transactions), and (3) 100% of the net proceeds of certain issuances of
debt or equity by the Company and its subsidiaries.

Voluntary
prepayments and voluntary reductions of the unutilized portion of the revolver are
permitted in whole or in part, at the Company’s option, in minimum principal amounts
specified in the senior credit facility, without premium or penalty, subject to
reimbursement of the lenders’ redeployment costs in the case of a prepayment of
adjusted LIBOR borrowings other than on the last day of the relevant interest period.
Voluntary prepayments will (1) generally be allocated among the facilities on a pro
rata basis (based on the then outstanding principal amount of the loans under each
facility) and (2) within each such facility, be applied to the installments under the
amortization schedule within the following 12 months under such facility until eliminated.
All remaining amounts of prepayments will be applied pro rata to the remaining
amortization payments under such facility. The senior credit facility also provides for
customary events of default, including non-payment defaults, covenant defaults and
cross-defaults to the Company’s other material indebtedness.

The
senior credit facility is guaranteed by the Company and by each of its existing domestic
subsidiaries and will be guaranteed by all future domestic subsidiaries. The facility is
secured by a first priority lien on substantially all, subject to certain exceptions, of
the Advance Stores’ properties and assets and the properties and assets of its
existing domestic subsidiaries and will be
secured by the properties and assets of its future domestic subsidiaries. The senior
credit facility contains covenants restricting the ability of the Company and its
subsidiaries to, among other things, (1) declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital
stock, (2) prepay, redeem or purchase debt, (3) incur liens or engage in sale-leaseback
transactions, (4) make loans and investments, (5) incur additional debt (including hedging
arrangements), (6) engage in certain mergers, acquisitions and asset sales, (7)
engage in transactions with affiliates, (8) change the nature of the Company’s
business and the business conducted by its subsidiaries and (9) change the holding company
status of the Company. The Company is required to comply with financial covenants with
respect to a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum interest coverage ratio, a minimum current
assets to funded senior debt ratio, a maximum senior leverage ratio and maximum limits on
capital expenditures.

During
fiscal 2003, the Company completed the redemption of its outstanding senior subordinated
notes and senior discount debentures. Incremental facilities were added to fund the
redemption in the form of a tranche A-1 term loan facility of $75,000 and tranche C-1 term
loan facility of $275,000. In conjunction with this redemption and overall partial
repayment of $54,433, the Company wrote-off deferred financing costs. The write-off of
these costs combined with the accretion of the discounts and related premiums paid on the
repurchase of the senior

subordinated notes and senior discount debentures resulted in a
loss on extinguishment of debt of $46,887 in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations for the year ended January 3, 2004.

During
the remainder of fiscal 2003, the Company repaid $236,089 of its terms loans under the
senior credit facility. In conjunction with this partial repayment, the Company wrote-off
additional deferred financing costs in the amount of $401, which is classified as a loss
on extinguishment of debt in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for
the year ended January 3, 2004. Additionally in December 2003, the Company refinanced the
remaining portion of its tranche A, A-1, C and C-1 term loan facilities under the previous
senior credit facility by amending and restating the credit facility to add a new $100,000
tranche D term loan facility and $340,000 tranche E term loan facility. The borrowings
under the tranche D term loan facility and tranche E term loan facility were used to
replace the tranche A, A-1, C and C-1 term loan facilities.

During
fiscal 2002, the Company repaid a portion of its tranche A and tranche B term loan
facilities. Subsequently, it also refinanced the remaining portion of its tranche B term
loan facility under its previous senior credit facility by amending and restating the
credit facility to add a new $250,000 tranche C term loan facility. The borrowings under
the tranche C term loan facility were used to refinance the tranche B term loan facility.
In conjunction with the extinguishment of this debt, the Company wrote-off deferred
financing costs in accordance with EITF No. 96-19. The write-off of these costs is
classified as a loss on extinguishment of debt of $8,542 in the accompanying consolidated
statement of operations.

During
fiscal 2002, the Company also repurchased and retired a portion of its senior subordinated
notes and senior discount debentures. The premiums paid and the write-off of the related
deferred financing costs are classified as a loss on extinguishment of debt of $8,280 in
the accompanying statements of operations.

As
of January 1, 2005, the Company was in compliance with the covenants of the senior credit
facility. Substantially all of the net assets of the Company’s subsidiaries are
restricted at January 1, 2005.

At
January 1, 2005, the aggregate future annual maturities of long-term debt are as follows:

13. Stock Repurchase
Program:

During the
third quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock
repurchase program of up to $200,000 of the Company’s common stock plus related
expenses. The program will allow the Company to repurchase its common stock on the open
market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time in accordance with the
requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission. As of January 1, 2005, the Company
has repurchased a total of 3,700 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $146,222, or
$39.52 per share. At January 1, 2005, the Company had $53,778, excluding related expenses,
available for stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program.

and $4,691, respectively. The Company recorded an income tax (benefit) expense of $(24),
$(220) and $1,820 related to these discontinued operations for the years ended January 1,
2005, January 3, 2004, and December 28, 2002, respectively.

Deferred
income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at
each period-end, based on enacted tax laws and statutory income tax rates applicable to
the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Deferred
income taxes reflect the net income tax effect of temporary differences between the bases
of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and for income tax reporting
purposes. Net deferred income tax balances are comprised of the following:

At
January 1, 2005 and January 3, 2004, the Company has cumulative net deferred income tax
liabilities of $69,297 and $63,341, respectively. The gross deferred income tax assets
also include state net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, and state tax credit
carryforwards of approximately $3,720 and $6,695, respectively. These NOLs and state tax
credit carryforwards may be used to reduce future taxable income and expire periodically
through fiscal year 2024. The Company believes it will realize these tax benefits through
a combination of the reversal of temporary differences, projected future taxable income
during the NOL carryforward periods and available tax planning strategies. Due to
uncertainties related to the realization of certain deferred tax assets for NOLs in
various jurisdictions, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $1,029 as of January
1, 2005 and $793 as of January 3, 2004. The amount of deferred income tax assets
realizable, however, could change in the near future if estimates of future taxable income
are changed.

Temporary differences which give rise
to significant deferred income tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:

These
amounts are recorded in other current assets, other current liabilities, other assets and
other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as
appropriate.

The
Company currently has certain years that are open to audit by the Internal Revenue
Service. In addition, the Company has certain years that are open for audit by various
state and foreign jurisdictions for income taxes and sales, use and excise taxes. In
management’s opinion, any amounts assessed will not have a material effect on the
Company’s financial position or results of operations.

15. Lease Commitments:

The
Company leases certain store locations, distribution centers, office space, equipment and
vehicles, some of which are with related parties. Initial terms for facility leases are
typically 10 to 15 years, followed by additional terms containing renewal options at 5
year intervals, and may include rent escalation clauses. The total amount of

(in thousands, except per share data)

the minimum
rent is expensed on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the lease unless
external economic factors exist such that renewals are reasonably assured, in which case
the Company would include the renewal period in its amortization period. In addition to
minimum fixed rentals, some leases provide for contingent facility rentals. Contingent
facility rentals are determined on the basis of a percentage of sales in excess of
stipulated minimums for certain store facilities as defined in the individual lease
agreements. Most of the leases provide that the Company pays taxes, maintenance, insurance
and certain other expenses applicable to the leased premises and include options to renew.
Management expects that, in the normal course of business, leases that expire will be
renewed or replaced by other leases.

At
January 1, 2005, future minimum lease payments due under non-cancelable operating leases
with lease terms ranging from one year through the year 2024 are as follows:

non-cancelable operating leases is $8,413 and $9,487, respectively.

Net
rent expense for fiscal 2004, fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 was as follows:

Rental
payments to related parties of approximately $3,044 in fiscal 2004, $3,011 in fiscal 2003

associated with closed locations is included in other selling, general and administrative
expenses.

16. Installment Sales
Program:

A
subsidiary of the Company maintains an in-house finance program, which offers financing to
retail customers. Finance charges of $2,257, $3,380 and $3,901 on the installment sales
program are included in net sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations for the fiscal years ended January 1, 2005, January 3, 2004 and December 28,
2002, respectively. The cost of administering the installment sales program is included in
selling, general and administrative expenses.

17. Contingencies:

In
the case of all known contingencies, the Company accrues for an obligation, including
estimated legal costs, when it is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. As
facts concerning contingencies become known to the Company, the Company reassesses its
position with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. Estimates that
are particularly sensitive to future change include tax and legal matters, which are
subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during
the administrative and litigation process.

The
Company’s Western Auto subsidiary, together with other defendants including
automobile manufacturers, automotive parts manufacturers and other retailers, has been
named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging injury as a result of exposure to
asbestos-containing products. The Company and some of its subsidiaries also have been named
as defendants in many of these lawsuits. The plaintiffs have alleged that these products
were manufactured, distributed and/or sold by the various defendants. To date, these
products have included brake and clutch parts and roofing materials. Many of the cases
pending against the Company or its subsidiaries are in the early stages of litigation. The
damages claimed against the defendants in some of these proceedings are substantial.
Additionally, some of the automotive parts manufacturers named as defendants in these
lawsuits have declared bankruptcy, which will limit plaintiffs’ ability to recover
monetary damages from those defendants. The Company believes that it has valid defenses
against these claims. The Company also believes that most of these claims are at least
partially covered by insurance. Based on discovery to date, the Company does not believe
the cases currently pending will have a material adverse effect on it. However, if the
Company was to incur an adverse verdict in one or more of these claims and were ordered to
pay damages that were not covered by insurance, these claims could have a material adverse
affect on its operating results, financial position and liquidity. If the number of claims
filed against the Company or any of its subsidiaries alleging injury as a result of
exposure to asbestos-containing products increases substantially, the costs associated
with concluding these claims, including damages resulting from any adverse verdicts, could
have a material adverse effect on its operating results, financial position and liquidity
in future periods.

The
Company is also involved in various other claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course
of business. The damages claimed against the Company in some of these proceedings are
substantial. Although the final outcome of these legal matters cannot be determined, based
on the facts presently known, it is management’s opinion that the final outcome of
such claims and lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
financial position or results of operations.

The
Company is self-insured for general and automobile liability, workers’ compensation
and the health care claims of its team members although the Company maintains stop-loss
coverage with third-party insurers to limit its total liability exposure. Liabilities
associated with these losses are calculated for claims filed and claims incurred but not
yet reported at the Company’s estimate of their ultimate cost based upon analyses of
historical data, demographic and severity factors and valuations provided by third-party
actuaries. Management monitors new claims and claim development as well as negative trends
related to the claims incurred but not reported in order to assess the adequacy of the
Company’s insurance reserves. On a periodic basis, the Company also reviews its
assumptions with the Company’s third-party actuaries. While the Company does not
expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from its estimates, the
self-insurance reserves could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly
from the historical trends and the actuarial assumptions.

The
Company accrues for tax contingencies when it is probable that a liability to a taxing
authority has been incurred and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated,
based on past experience. The Company’s tax contingency reserve is adjusted for
changes in circumstances and additional uncertainties, such as significant amendments to
existing tax law, both legislated and concluded through the various jurisdictions’
tax court systems. At January 1, 2005, the Company had a tax contingency reserve of
$7,576. It is the opinion of the Company’s management that the possibility is remote
that costs in excess of those reserved for will have a material adverse impact on the
Company’s financial position or results of operations.

The
Company has entered into employment agreements with certain team members that provide
severance pay benefits under certain circumstances after a change in control of the
Company or upon termination of the team member by the Company. The maximum contingent
liability under these employment agreements is approximately

$2,491 and $2,408 at January
1, 2005 and January 3, 2004 of which nothing has been accrued, respectively.

18. Benefit Plans:

401(k) Plan

The
Company maintains a defined contribution team member benefit plan, which covers
substantially all team members after one year of service and have attained the age of
twenty-one. The plan allows for team member salary deferrals, which are matched at the
Company’s discretion. Company contributions were $6,752, $6,398 and $6,930 in fiscal
2004, fiscal 2003, and fiscal 2002, respectively.

The
Company also maintains a profit sharing plan covering Western team members that was frozen
prior to the Western Merger on November 2, 1998. This plan covered all full-time team
members who had completed one year of service and had attained the age of twenty-one.

Deferred Compensation

During
third quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company established an unqualified deferred compensation
plan for certain team members. The Company has accounted for the unqualified deferred
compensation plan in accordance with EITF 97-14, “Accounting for Deferred
Compensation Arrangements Where Amounts Earned Are Held in a Rabbi Trust and
Invested.” The liability related to the former Discount deferred compensation plan,
which was terminated in May 2002, was merged into the new plan. This plan provides for a
minimum and maximum deferral percentage of the team member base salary and bonus, as
determined by the Retirement Plan Committee. The Company establishes and maintains a
deferred compensation liability for this plan. The Company funds this liability by
remitting the team member’s deferral to a Rabbi Trust where these deferrals are
invested in trading securities. Accordingly, all gains and losses on these underlying
investments, which are held in the Rabbi Trust to fund the deferred compensation
liability, are recognized in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. At
January 1, 2005 and January 3, 2004 these liabilities were $1,840 and $1,011,
respectively.

The
Company maintains an unfunded deferred compensation plan established for certain key team
members of Western prior to the fiscal 1998 Western merger. The Company assumed the plan
liability of $15,253 through the Western merger. The plan was frozen at the date of the
Western merger. As of January 1, 2005 and January 3, 2004, $1,598 and $2,409,
respectively, was accrued for these plans with the current portion included in accrued
expenses and the long-term portion in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets.

Postretirement Plan

The
Company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired team
members through a postretirement plan, or the Plan. These benefits are subject to
deductibles, co-payment provisions and other limitations. The Plan has no assets and is
funded on a cash basis as benefits are paid. During the second quarter of fiscal 2004, the
Company amended the Plan to exclude outpatient prescription drug benefits to Medicare
eligible retirees effective January 1, 2006. Due to this negative plan amendment, the
Company’s accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was reduced by $7,557,
resulting in an unrecognized negative prior service cost in the same amount. The
unrecognized negative prior service cost is being amortized over the estimated remaining
life expectancy of the plan participants of 13 years as allowed under SFAS No. 106,
“Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions.”

Other
financial information related to the plans was determined by the Company’s
independent actuaries. The measurement date used by the actuaries was October 31 of each

included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets,
recorded and the funded status of the plan as of January 1, 2005 and January 3, 2004:

The health

10.0% for 2008, 9.5% for 2009, 8.5% for 2010 and 5.0% to 8.0% for 2011 and thereafter. If
the health care cost were increased 1% for all future years the accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation would have increased by $1,247 as of January 1 2005. The effect of
this change on the combined service and interest cost would have been an increase of $102
for 2004. If the health care cost were decreased 1% for all future years the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation would have decreased by $1,318 as of January 1, 2005.
The effect of this change on the combined service and interest cost would have been a
decrease of $121 for 2004.

The
postretirement benefit obligation and net periodic postretirement benefit cost was
computed using the following weighted average discount rates as determined by the
Company’s actuaries for each applicable year:

The
Company expects plan contributions to completely offset benefits paid. The following table

be paid for each of the following fiscal years:

The
Company reserves the right to change or terminate the benefits or contributions at any
time. The Company also continues to evaluate ways in which it can better manage these
benefits and control costs. Any changes in the plan or revisions to assumptions that
affect the amount of expected future benefits may have a significant impact on the amount
of the reported obligation, annual expense and projected benefit payments.

19. Equity Compensation:

During
fiscal 2004, the Company established the Advance Auto Parts, Inc. 2004 Long-Term Incentive
Plan, or the LTIP, which was approved at its 2004 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The LTIP
was created to enable the Company to continue to attract and retain team members of
exceptional managerial talent upon whom, in large measure, its sustained progress, growth
and profitability depends. The LTIP replaces the Company’s previous senior executive
stock option plan and executive stock option plan. The stock options that remained
available for future grant under these predecessor plans became available under the LTIP
and thus, no stock options will be available for grant under those plans. The stock
options authorized to be granted are non-qualified stock options and terminate on the
seventh anniversary of the grant date. Additionally, the stock options vest over a
three-year period in equal installments beginning on the first anniversary grant date.

In
addition to stock options, the Company also has the ability to offer additional types of
equity incentives as allowed under the LTIP. Accordingly, during fiscal 2004, the Company
created the Advance Auto Parts, Inc. Deferred Stock Unit Plan for Non-Employee Directors
and Selected Executives, or the DSU Plan. The DSU Plan provides for the annual grant of
deferred stock units, or DSUs, to the Company’s board of directors as allowed under
the LTIP. Each DSU is equivalent to one share of common stock of the Company. The DSUs are
immediately vested upon issuance since the DSU Plan provides for the board members to
receive their equivalent shares at any point upon departure from the board. The Company
granted 6 DSUs in fiscal 2004 at a weighted average fair value of $41.57. For fiscal 2004,
the Company recognized a total of $494, on a pre-tax basis, in compensation expense
related to the issuance of DSUs. Additionally, the DSU Plan provides for the deferral of
compensation as earned in the form of an annual retainer for board members and wages for
certain highly compensated employees of the Company. These deferred stock units are
payable to the participants at a future date or over a specified time period as elected by
the participants in accordance with the DSU Plan.

Shares
authorized for grant under the LTIP are 5,747 at January 1, 2005. Subsequent to January 1,
2005, the Company granted 1,298 stock options at an exercise price of $50.06.

As
a result of the recapitalization in fiscal 1998, an existing stockholder received stock
options, referred to as other options, to purchase up to 1,000 shares of common stock. The
stock options are fully vested, nonforfeitable and provided for a $5.00 per share
exercise price, increasing $1.00 per share annually, through the expiration date of April
2005. The fair value of these options, as determined at the grant date were included in
the recapitalization in

fiscal 1998 as consideration paid to the existing stockholder. The
other options were completely exercised during fiscal 2003.

Total
option activity for the last three fiscal years was as follows:

For
each of the Company’s option grants during fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, the
Company granted options at prices consistent with the market price of its stock on each
respective grant date. Information related to the Company’s options by range of
exercise prices is as follows:

As
permitted under SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” the
Company accounts for its stock options using the intrinsic value method prescribed in
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees”, or APB No. 25. Under APB No. 25, compensation cost for stock options is
measured as the excess, if any, of the market price of the Company’s common stock at
the measurement date over the exercise price. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized
compensation expense on the issuance of its stock options because the exercise price
equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date. No compensation
expense was required for the fiscal years ended January 1, 2005, January 3, 2004 and
December 28, 2002.

During
fiscal 2002, the Company established an employee stock purchase plan. The plan is intended
to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended. In May 2002, the Company registered 700 shares with the
Securities and Exchange Commission to be issued under the plan. All eligible team members
may purchase common stock at 85% of fair market value (determined quarterly) through

payroll deductions. There are annual limitations on team member purchases of either
$25,000 per team member or ten percent of compensation, whichever is less. Under the plan,
team members purchased 118, 147 and 28 shares in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

20. Fair Value of
Financial Instruments:

The carrying
amount of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, bank overdrafts, accounts payable,
borrowings secured by receivables and current portion of long-term debt approximates fair
value because of the short maturity of those instruments. The carrying amount for variable
rate long-term debt approximates fair value for similar issues available to the Company.
There was no fixed rate long-term debt outstanding at January 1, 2005 or January 3, 2004.

1. Presentation

These
condensed financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and note disclosures normally
included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted pursuant
to those rules and regulations, although management believes that the disclosures made are
adequate to make the information presented not misleading.

2. Organization

Advance
Auto Parts, Inc. (“the Company”) is a holding company, which was the 100%
shareholder of Advance Stores Company, Incorporated and its subsidiaries
(“Stores”) during the periods presented. The parent/subsidiary relationship
between the Company and Stores includes certain related party transactions. These
transactions consist primarily of interest on intercompany advances, dividends, capital
contributions and allocations of certain costs. Deferred income taxes have not been
provided for financial reporting and tax basis differences on the undistributed earnings
of the subsidiaries.

3. Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies

Accounting Period

The
Company’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of December, which results
in an extra week every six years. Accordingly, fiscal 2003 includes 53 weeks of
operations. All other fiscal years presented include 52 weeks of operations.

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements

In
April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, “Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44
and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13 and Technical Corrections.” As a result of
rescinding FASB Statement No. 4, “Reporting Gains Losses from Extinguishment of
Debt,” gains and losses from extinguishment of debt should be classified as
extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria in Accounting Principles Board, or APB,
Opinion No. 30, “Reporting the Results of Operations — Reporting the Effects of
Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring
Events and Transactions.” This statement also amends FASB Statement No. 13,
“Accounting for Leases,” to eliminate an inconsistency between the required
accounting for sale-leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease
modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale-leaseback transactions.
Additional amendments include changes to other existing authoritative pronouncements to
make various technical corrections, clarify meanings or describe their applicability under
changed conditions. The Company adopted SFAS No. 145 during the first quarter of fiscal
2003. For the fiscal years ended 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded losses on the
extinguishment of debt of $0, $7,025 and $2,365, respectively.

Stock Split

On
October 29, 2003, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock split
of the Company’s common stock, effected as a 100% stock dividend. The dividend was
distributed on January 2, 2004 to holders of record as of December 11, 2003 and began
trading on a post-split basis on January 5, 2004. The accompanying condensed Parent
Company balance sheet and condensed Parent Company statements of operations reflect the
effect of the stock split for all years represented.
