PART I

Item 1.    Business.

Unless
the context otherwise requires, “Advance,” “we,” “us,”
“our,” and similar terms refer to Advance Auto Parts, Inc., its predecessor, its
subsidiaries and their respective operations. Our fiscal year consists of 52 or 53 weeks
ending on the Saturday closest to December 31 of each year. Fiscal 2003 included 53 weeks
of operations. All other fiscal years presented included 52 weeks of operations.

Overview

We
primarily operate within the United States automotive aftermarket industry, which includes
replacement parts (excluding tires), accessories, maintenance items, batteries and
automotive chemicals for cars and light trucks (pickup trucks, vans, minivans and sport
utility vehicles). We currently are the second largest specialty retailer of automotive
parts, accessories and maintenance items to “do-it-yourself,” or DIY, customers
in the United States,


based on store count and sales. Our combined
operations are now conducted in our retail operating segment subsequent to the
discontinuation of the wholesale distribution network in 2003.

We
were formed in 1929 and operated as a retailer of general merchandise until the 1980s.
During the 1980s, we sharpened our focus to target sales of automotive parts and
accessories to DIY customers. From the 1980s to the present, we have grown significantly
as a result of strong comparable store sales growth, new store openings and strategic
acquisitions, including our 1998 Western Auto Supply Company acquisition and our 2001
acquisition of Discount Auto Parts, or Discount. Additionally, in 1996, we began to
aggressively expand our sales to “do-it-for-me,” or DIFM, customers by
implementing a commercial delivery program.

At
January 3, 2004, we operated 2,539 stores within the United States, Puerto Rico and the
Virgin Islands. We operated 2,503 stores throughout 39 states in the Northeastern,
Southeastern and Midwestern regions of the United States. These stores operated primarily
under the “Advance Auto Parts” trade name except for the state of Florida, which
operated under “Advance Discount Auto Parts” or “Discount Auto Parts”
trade names. Our stores offer a broad selection of brand name and proprietary automotive replacement
parts, accessories and maintenance items for domestic and imported cars and light trucks, with no
significant concentration in any specific area.
In addition, we
operated 36 stores under the “Western Auto” trade name, located primarily in
Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, which offer certain home and garden merchandise in
addition to automotive parts, accessories and service.

In
addition to our DIY business, we serve DIFM customers via sales to commercial accounts.
Sales to DIFM customers represented approximately 16% of our retail sales in 2003 and
consisted of sales to both walk-in commercial customers and sales delivered to our
commercial customers’ places of business, including independent garages, service
stations and auto dealers. At January 3, 2004, we had 1,625 stores with commercial
delivery programs.

We
also provide our customers online shopping and access to over 1 million stock keeping
units, or SKUs. Our online site allows our customers to pick up merchandise at a
conveniently located store or have their purchase shipped directly to their home or
business.

Our
Internet address is

www.advanceautoparts.com

. We make available free of charge through our
Internet website our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current
reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to the
Securities Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such
material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.

Discontinued Operations

On
December 19, 2003, we discontinued the supplying of merchandise to our wholesale
distribution network. The wholesale distribution network consisted of independently owned
and operated dealer locations, for which we supplied merchandise inventory and certain
services. Due to the wide variety of products supplied to the dealers and the reduced
concentration of stores spread over a wide geographic area, it had become difficult to
serve these dealers effectively. This component of our business operated in the previously
reported wholesale segment and, excluding certain allocated and team member benefit
expenses of $2.4 million, $3.3 million and $5.5 million for fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001, represented the
entire results of operations previously reported in that segment. We have classified these
operating results as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements
of operations for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2004, December 28, 2002 and December
29, 2001.

Competitive Strengths

We
believe our competitive strengths include the following:

Leading
Market Position.

We compete in both the DIY and DIFM categories of the
automotive aftermarket industry. Our primary competitors include national and regional
retail automotive parts chains, wholesalers or jobber stores, independent operators,
automobile dealers that supply parts, discount stores and mass merchandisers


that carry
automotive products. Although the number of competitors and level of competition vary by
market, both the DIY and DIFM categories are highly fragmented and generally very
competitive. We enjoy significant advantages over most of our competitors. We believe we
have strong brand recognition and customer traffic in our stores
based on our significant
marketing activities. In addition, we have purchasing, distribution, marketing and
advertising efficiencies due to our economies of scale. In particular, our acquisition of
Discount Auto Parts in November 2001 has provided us with the leading market position in
Florida, which is especially attractive due to that state’s strong DIY customer
demographics.

Industry
Leading Selection of Quality Products.

As the number of automotive replacement
parts has proliferated, we believe discount stores and mass merchandisers have had
increasing difficulties in maintaining a broad inventory selection that DIY customers
demand. We believe this has created a strong competitive advantage for specialty
automotive parts retailers, like us, that have the distribution capacity, sophisticated
information systems and knowledgeable sales staff needed to offer a broad inventory
selection to DIY customers. We offer one of the largest selections of brand name and
proprietary automotive parts, accessories and maintenance items in the automotive
aftermarket industry. Our stores carry between 16,500 and 26,500 in-store SKUs. We also
offer approximately 100,000 additional SKUs that are available on a same-day or overnight
basis through our PDQ® and our Master PDQ® distribution systems, including harder-to-find replacement
parts.

Superior
Customer Service.

We believe that our customers place significant value on our
well-trained sales associates, who offer knowledgeable assistance in product selection and
installation, and that this differentiates us from mass merchandisers. We invest
substantial resources in the recruiting and training of our employees, who we refer to as
team members, and provide formal classroom workshops, seminars and Automotive Service
Excellence(TM) certification to build technical, managerial and customer service skills.
In addition, we have a performance management process that allows us to align each team
member’s goals with our strategic corporate goals. This process has resulted in
increased team member retention, which we believe leads to increased customer satisfaction
and higher sales, and differentiates us from mass merchandisers.

Experienced
Management Team with Proven Track Record.

The 18 members of our senior
management team have an average of 10 years of experience with us and 14 years in the
industry and have successfully grown our Company to the second largest specialty retailer
of automotive products in the United States. Our management team has accomplished this
using a disciplined strategy of growing comparable store sales, opening new stores,
increasing the penetration of our commercial delivery program and making selective
acquisitions.

Growth Strategy

Our growth strategies consist of the
following:

Increase
Our Comparable Store Sales.

We have been among the industry leaders in comparable store sales
growth over the last five years, averaging 5.9% annually. We plan to increase our
comparable store sales in both the DIY and DIFM categories by, among other things, (1)
implementing merchandising and marketing initiatives, (2) investing in store-level systems
to enhance our ability to recommend complementary products in order to increase sales per
customer, (3) refining our store selection and in-stock availability through customized
assortments and other supply chain initiatives, (4) continuing to increase customer
service through store staffing and retention initiatives and (5) increasing our commercial
delivery sales by focusing on key customers to grow average sales per program and adding
programs to markets with commercial opportunities using our database of potential
customers. In particular, we intend to continue to make the necessary investments in
several applications that are critical to improving our customer service and in-stock
availability. We have established strong inventory management systems at the store and
distribution center level and have implemented Advance Parts Accessories Lookup, or APAL,
our new fully integrated point-of-sale system and electronic parts catalog, in
approximately 85% of our stores.

Continue
to Enhance Our Margins.

In addition to driving operating margin expansion via
continued strong comparable store sales growth, we will continue to focus on increasing
margins by: (1) improving our purchasing efficiencies with vendors; (2) utilizing our
supply chain infrastructure and existing distribution network to optimize our inventory
mix and maximize distribution capacity; (3) leveraging our overall scale to reduce other
operating expenses as a percentage of sales and (4) continuing to implement our category
management initiatives and custom


mix initiatives.

Increase
Return on Invested Capital.

We believe we can continue to successfully increase
our return on invested capital by generating strong comparable store sales growth and
increasing our margins. We believe we can also increase our return on invested capital by
leveraging our supply chain initiatives to increase sales faster than inventory growth and
selectively expanding our store base primarily in existing markets. Based on our
experience, such in-market openings provide higher returns on our invested capital by
enabling us to leverage our distribution infrastructure, marketing expenditures and local
management resources. We intend to open approximately 125 to 135 stores in existing
markets in 2004 primarily through new store openings.

Industry

The
United States automotive aftermarket industry is generally grouped into two major
categories DIY and DIFM. According to the Automotive Aftermarket Industry Association, or
AAIA, Aftermarket Factbook, from 1997 to 2002, the DIY category grew at a 3.9% compound
annual growth rate from approximately $27 billion to $35 billion. This category
represents sales to consumers who maintain and repair vehicles themselves. We believe this
category is characterized by stable, more recession-resistant demand than most retailers
because of the need-based characteristics of the DIY category. Additionally, in difficult
economic times, we believe people tend to drive more and use air travel less. We also
believe difficult economic times result in people retaining their vehicles longer, which
moves these vehicles in the range of years in age when more repairs are needed. Alternatively
in an improving economy, we believe the need-based characteristics of our DIY customers still
exist and they are more inclined to complete preventative maintenance than to defer these activities.
From 1997 to 2002, the DIFM category grew at a 5.0% compound annual growth rate, from approximately
$57 billion to $73 billion according to the AAIA Aftermarket Factbook. This category
represents sales to professional installers, such as independent garages, service stations
and auto dealers. DIFM parts and services are typically offered to vehicle owners who are
less price sensitive or who are less inclined to repair their own vehicles.

We
believe the United States automotive aftermarket industry will continue to benefit from
several favorable trends, including the:

•

increasing number and age of vehicles in the United States, increasing number of miles driven annually, and increasing number of cars coming off of warranty, particularly previously leased vehicles;

•

higher cost of replacement parts as a result of technological changes in recent models of vehicles and increasing number of light trucks and sport utility vehicles that require more expensive parts, resulting in higher average sales per customer; and

•

continued consolidation of automotive aftermarket retailers, resulting in a reduction in the number of stores in the marketplace.

We
believe these trends will continue to support strong comparable store sales growth in the
industry.

Store Operations

Our
well-merchandised retail stores are where our customers judge and value our service. While
serving over 200 million customers per year, our focus is to execute our promise;

“With Low Prices on Quality Parts our Dedicated Team Will Serve you Better”

, one
customer at a time.

Our
stores generally are located in freestanding buildings in areas with high vehicle traffic
counts, good visibility and easy access to major roadways. Our stores typically range in
size from 5,000 to 10,000 square feet with an average of approximately 7,500 square feet
and offer approximately 16,500 items/SKU’s in our standard store.
In addition, we provide a customized product assortment in our hub stores, which provide up to
an additional 2,000 SKU’s of merchandise specifically identified based on the demand within
an individual market. Our hub stores provide a centralized market location for this
assortment, which benefits all our DIY and DIFM customers within the market.
Our local area warehouse
concept utilizes existing space in selected stores to ensure the availability of an additional customized assortment of
4,500 to 8,000 SKUs on a same day basis, in addition to our hub store product
assortments. At January 3, 2004, we operated 30 local area warehouses.


To
ensure our stores have the right product at the right time, we also utilize local area
warehouses and a network of Parts Delivered Quickly, or PDQ®, facilities and one
Master PDQ® facility. Our PDQ® and Master PDQ® network of facilities provide our customers an additional assortment of
100,000 additional harder to find parts and accessories on a same day or overnight
basis.

In
addition, our proprietary electronic parts catalog, or EPC system, enables our team
members to identify and suggest the appropriate, quality and price options for the
SKU’s that we carry, as well as the related products, tools or advice that is
required by our customer to complete their automotive repair projects properly and safely.
Replacement parts sold at our stores include an extensive number of applications of
automotive filters, radiators, brake pads, fan belts, radiator hoses, starters,
alternators, batteries, shock absorbers, struts, CV shafts, spark plugs, transmission
parts, clutches, electronic ignition components, suspension parts, engines and
transmissions.

Our
retail stores are 100% company operated and are divided into geographic areas. A senior
vice president, who is supported by three to four regional vice presidents, manages each
area of retail stores. Division managers report to the regional vice presidents and have
direct responsibility for store operations in a specific division, which typically
consists of 10 to 15 stores. Depending on store size and sales volume, each store is
staffed by 10 to 20 team members under the leadership of a store manager. Our stores
generally are open from 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. six days a week and 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.
on Sundays and most holidays to meet the needs of our DIY and DIFM customers.

Commercial Sales

In addition to the customer  service  provided by our store  operations  team,  we also  maintain a commercial
sales team dedicated to the development of our commercial  business and the support of our DIFM  customers.  A vice
president of commercial sales leads our commercial  sales team with the support of five directors  assigned to each
area of our  retail  stores.  Each  director  leads  three to four  regional  commercial  sales  mangers.  Division
commercial  sales mangers report directly to our regional  commercial  sales managers and, like our retail division
managers,  are directly  responsible  for  commercial  operations  in each  division.  We target the DIFM  customer
through our commercial  marketing efforts in all our retail stores.

Purchasing and
Merchandising

Virtually
all of our merchandise is selected and purchased for our stores by personnel at our
corporate offices in Roanoke, Virginia.
In 2003, we purchased merchandise from over 300 vendors, with no single
vendor accounting for more than 7% of purchases. Our purchasing strategy involves
negotiating multi-year agreements with certain vendors, which allows us to achieve more
favorable terms and pricing.

Our
purchasing team is currently led by a group of six senior professionals, who have an
average of 15 years of automotive purchasing experience and over 25 years in
retail. This team is skilled in sourcing products globally and maintaining high quality
levels, while streamlining costs associated with the handling of merchandise through the
supply chain. The purchasing team has developed strong vendor relationships in the
industry and is utilizing a “best-in-class” category management process to
improve comparable store sales, gross margin and inventory turns.

Our
merchandising strategy is to carry a broad selection of high quality brand automotive
parts and accessories such as Monroe, Bendix, Purolator and AC Delco, which generates DIY
customer traffic and also


appeals to commercial delivery customers. In addition to these
branded products, we stock a wide selection of high quality proprietary products that
appeal to value conscious customers. Sales of replacement parts account for a majority of
our net sales and typically generate higher gross margins than maintenance items or
general accessories. We are currently in the process of customizing our product mix based
on a merchandising program designed to optimize inventory mix at each individual store
based on that store’s historical and projected sales mix and regionally specific
customer needs.

Supply Chain

We
currently operate eight distribution centers. All of these distribution centers are equipped with
our distribution management system, which includes technologically advanced material
handling equipment, including carousels, “pick-to-light” systems, radio
frequency technology and automated sorting systems. Through the continued implementation
of our supply chain initiatives, we expect to further increase the efficient utilization
of our distribution capacity, which currently provides us the capacity to service over
3,000 stores, excluding the recently announced closure of our Gadsden, Alabama distribution facility.

We
currently offer over 20,000 SKUs to substantially support all of our retail stores via
our 19 PDQ® warehouses and/or our distribution centers, which also stock PDQ®
items. Stores have visibility to inventory in their respective facilities and can place
orders to these facilities, or as an alternative, through an online ordering system.
Ordered parts are delivered to substantially all stores on a same day or next day basis
through our dedicated PDQ® trucking fleet. In addition, we operate a PDQ®
warehouse that stocks approximately 80,000 SKUs of harder to find automotive parts and
accessories. This facility is known as the “Master PDQ®” warehouse and
utilizes existing PDQ® distribution infrastructure to provide next day service to
substantially all of our stores.

Advertising

We
have an extensive advertising program designed to communicate our merchandise offerings,
product assortment, competitive prices, free services (battery installation and wiper
replacements) and commitment to customer service. The program is focused on establishing
Advance Auto Parts as the solution for a customer’s automotive needs. We utilize a
mix of media that reinforces our brand image, including television, radio, print,
promotional signage and outdoor media, plus our proprietary in-store television network
and internet site.

Our
advertising plan is a brand-building program built around television and radio advertising.
The plan is supported by print and in-store signage.
Our television advertising is a combination of national and regional media in both sports
and entertainment programming. Radio advertising, which is used as a supplementary medium,
generally airs during peak drive times. We also sponsor sporting events, racing teams and
other events at all levels in a grass-roots effort to positively impact individual
communities, including Hispanic and other ethnic communities, to create awareness and
drive traffic for our stores.

Since
early 2003, we’ve supported our new advertising campaign, “We’re ready in
Advance” throughout all of our media. We believe this advertising campaign
differentiates Advance Auto Parts in the customer’s mind by positioning us as both a
source for brand name auto parts at low prices and as a resource for expert advice and
useful tips to help customers keep their vehicles running smoothly. The campaign includes
creative and compelling television and radio commercials designed to drive sales and build
an enduring, positive image of Advance Auto Parts as a special place to shop.

In
2004, we are building upon the campaign by initiating a consumer education program. This
program is intended to build our image as not only the source for product, but also the
best resource for information regarding a vehicle’s reliability, safety, performance,
appearance and ultimate investment value. Our goal with this initiative is to continue our
long-term brand building success, increase customer loyalty and expand our customer base.


Management Information
Systems

We
have developed a flexible technology infrastructure that supports our growth strategy. Our
information technology infrastructure is comprised of software and hardware designed to
integrate store, distribution and vendor services into a seamless network. All stores,
corporate and regional offices, and distribution centers are linked via a communications
network, which is based on frame relay technology. Our stores in Puerto Rico are linked to
the communications network via satellite. Electronic documents transferred between us and
our vendors expedite the ordering, receiving and merchandise payment processes. During
2003, we completed the implementation of our technology platform in the Discount Auto
Parts stores and the Lakeland distribution center, including the administrative offices.

Enterprise Information
System

Our
management team has online access to certain financial information via Hyperion Analyzer,
a web-enabled front-end tool, which retrieves information from our Hyperion Essbase
database. This system, which is tightly integrated to our “best in class”
PeopleSoft Financial and Human Resource systems, helps ensure that accurate, consistent,
and timely financial information, including our sales, margin, payroll and other key
metrics, is available to all levels of management. This system assists the management team
in planning and responding to our business and industry trends quickly and
cost-effectively. This system contains analysis tools that provide our management the
ability to rank and rate their operations and identify “best practices”
opportunities for business improvement.

Store Based Information
Systems

Our
store based information systems, which are designed to improve the efficiency of our
operations and enhance customer service, are comprised of point-of-sale, or POS,
electronic parts catalog, or EPC, store-level inventory management, time and attendance
and store intranet, or STORENET, systems. Additionally, we support store level operations
with our management planning and training and customer contact systems. These systems are
integrated tightly and together provide real time, comprehensive information to store and
merchandising personnel, resulting in improved customer service levels, team member
utilization and in-stock availability. We have completely implemented our store based
information systems into all of the Discount stores.

Point-of-Sale.

Our POS system is used to formulate pricing, marketing and merchandising
          strategies and to replenish inventory accurately and rapidly. We have fully
          implemented our new POS system, or APAL, in approximately 85% of our stores and
          plan to complete the remaining stores during 2004. APAL is designed to improve
          customer checkout time and decrease the time required to train newly hired team
          members. In addition, APAL provides additional customer purchase history, which
          may be used for customer demographic analysis.

Electronic
Parts Catalog.

Our EPC system is a software system that enables our store team members to
identify over 40 million application uses for automotive parts and accessories. The EPC
system enables store team members to assist our customers in their parts selection and
ordering based on year, make, model and engine type of their vehicle. If a hard-to-find
part or accessory is not available at one of our stores, the EPC system can determine
whether the part is carried and in-stock through our PDQ® system. The EPC
system also enables our store team members to identify additional parts that are required
by our customers to complete their automotive repair projects. This generally leads to an
increase in average sales per transaction. The integration of this system with our POS
system improves customer service by reducing time spent at the cash register and fully
automating the sales process between the parts counter and our POS register. This system
enables store team members to order parts and accessories electronically through our
PDQ® system, with immediate confirmation of price, availability and estimated
delivery time. Additionally, information about a customer’s automobile can be entered
into a permanent customer database that can be accessed immediately whenever the customer
visits or telephones one of our stores.

In
conjunction with the rollout of APAL, we are also enhancing our EPC system in our stores.
The enhanced EPC system, which is fully integrated with APAL, provides the capability of
cataloging non-application specific parts and additional product information, such as
technical service bulletins, installation instructions, images of parts, and related
diagrams of automotive systems. The enhanced EPC system contains enhanced search engines
and more user-friendly navigation tools that enhance our store team members’ ability
to look-up any needed parts as well as additional products the customer needs to complete
their automotive repair project. We believe these


components will enhance our
customers’ shopping experience with us and help them accurately complete the repair
job the first time, saving them time and money.

To
ensure ongoing improvement of EPC information in all stores, we have developed a centrally
based EPC data management system that enables us to reduce the time needed to exchange
data with our vendors and ultimately catalogue and deliver updated, accurate product
information to our stores. Additionally, we are enhancing the EPC system to provide
additional methods of parts look-up while reducing keystrokes and allowing our store team
members to more efficiently serve our customers.

Store
Level Inventory Management System.

Our store-level inventory management system provides
real-time inventory tracking at the store level. With the store-level system, store team
members can check the quantity of on-hand inventory for any SKU, adjust stock levels for
select items for store specific events, automatically process returns and defective
merchandise, designate SKU’s for cycle counts and track merchandise transfers. As our
stores convert to APAL, we also implement radio frequency hand held devices, which helps
ensure the accuracy of inventory.

Store
Intranet.

Our STORENET system delivers product information, electronic manuals, forms,
store operating results, in-store training opportunities and internal communications to
all store team members. In addition STORENET provides online tools that enhance the
productivity of our team members as follows:

•

our online learning center delivers online training programs to all team members. A tracking and reporting function provides human resources and management with an overview of training schedules and results by team member;

•

our online budgeting site allows stores more direct input to the budgeting process, significantly reduces telecommunications usage by store management and results in efficiencies in the overall corporate budgeting process;

•

our online inventory cycle count accuracy report facilitates maintaining more accurate stock levels and reduce out of stock and overstock conditions; and

•

our online telecommunications audit reports application provides managers access to detailed information regarding company telecommunications expenses, promoting targeted efforts to reduce ineffective expenses.

Management
Planning and Training (MPT).

MPT is our proprietary system designed to streamline our
store labor management and training processes. MPT gives our store managers the tools to
plan for peak customer traffic to ensure we have knowledgeable and friendly sales people
in our stores and well-stocked shelves to meet our customers’ needs. After a thorough
review of all our store processes, we believe MPT improves our results of operations
through industry-leading labor utilization on all store labor events, including sales,
training, unloading and stocking of weekly product deliveries.

Customer
Contact Center.

Our customer contact center utilizes call routing software and customer
service software and functions as a centralized support center. The customer contact
center has resulted in a substantial improvement in the average speed in which a call is
answered, a reduction in calls to voice mail and a reduction in the number of outbound
calls required to respond to voice mail. We believe these improvements allow us to better
support each of our stores, therefore, increasing customer service.

Logistics and Purchasing
Information Systems

Distribution
Center Management System.

Our distribution management system, or DCMS, provides real-time
inventory tracking through the processes of receiving, picking, shipping and replenishing
at our distribution centers. The DCMS, integrated with material handling equipment,
significantly reduces warehouse and distribution costs, while improving efficiency.

Replenishment
Systems.

Our E3 Replenishment System monitors the distribution center and PDQ®
warehouse inventory levels and orders additional product when appropriate. In addition,
the system tracks sales trends by SKU, allowing us to adjust future orders to support
seasonal and demographic shifts in demand.


Transportation
Management System.

Our transportation management system is an effective planning tool that
allows for the efficient management of incoming shipments. Benefits from this system
include reduced vendor to distribution center freight costs, visibility of purchase orders
and shipments for the entire supply chain, the reduction in distribution center inventory,
or safety stock, due to consistent transit times and decreased third party freight and
billing service costs.

Team Members

At
March 10, 2004, we employed 22,393 full-time team members and 12,562 part-time
team members. Our workforce consisted of 85.6% team members employed in store-level
operations, 9.5% employed in distribution and 4.9% employed in our corporate offices
in Roanoke, Virginia. We have never experienced any labor disruption and are not party to
any collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our labor relations are good.

We
allocate substantial resources to the recruiting, training and retaining of team members.
Our performance management process allows us to align each team member’s goals with
our corporate strategic goals. We believe this program provides us with a well-trained,
productive workforce that is committed to high levels of customer service and assures a
qualified team to support future growth.

Trade Names, Service
Marks and Trademarks

We
own and have registrations for the trade names “Advance Auto Parts,”
“Western Auto” and “Parts
America” and the trademark “PDQ®” with the United States Patent and
Trademark Office for use in connection with the automotive parts retailing business. In
addition, we own and have registered a number of trademarks with respect to our
proprietary products, and we also acquired from Discount various registered trademarks,
service marks and copyrights. We believe that these trade names, service marks and
trademarks are important to our merchandising strategy. We do not know of any infringing
uses that would materially affect the use of these marks and actively defend and enforce
them.

Competition

Our
primary competitors are both national and regional retail chains of automotive parts
stores, including AutoZone, Inc., O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. and The Pep
Boys–Manny, Moe & Jack, wholesalers or jobber stores, including those associated
with national parts distributors or associations, such as NAPA, independent operators,
automobile dealers that supply parts, discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry
automotive products, including Wal-Mart, Target and K-Mart. We believe that chains of
automotive parts stores, like us, with multiple locations in one or more markets, have
competitive advantages in customer service, marketing, inventory selection, purchasing and
distribution as compared to independent retailers and jobbers that are not part of a chain
or associated with other retailers or jobbers. The principal competitive factors that
affect our business include price, store location, customer service and product offerings,
quality and availability.

Environmental Matters

We
are subject to various federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations relating
to the operation of our business, including those governing recycling of batteries and
used lubricants, and regarding ownership and operation of real property. We handle
hazardous materials as part of our operations, and our customers may also use hazardous
materials on our properties or bring hazardous materials or used oil onto our properties.
We currently provide collection and recycling programs for used automotive batteries and
used lubricants at all of our stores as a service to our customers under agreements with
third party vendors. Pursuant to these agreements, used batteries and lubricants are
collected by our team members, deposited into vendor supplied containers or pallets and
stored by us until collected by the third party vendors for recycling or proper disposal.
Persons who arrange for the disposal, treatment or other handling of hazardous or toxic
substances may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation at any affected disposal,
treatment or other site affected by such substances.

We
own and lease real property. Under various environmental laws and regulations, a current
or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or
remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in such property. These laws
often impose joint and several liability and may be imposed without regard to


whether the
owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release of such hazardous or toxic
substances. Other environmental laws and common law principles also could be used to
impose liability for releases of hazardous materials into the environment or work place,
and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for
personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous
substances. From time to time, we receive notices from the Environmental Protection Agency
and state environmental authorities indicating that there may be contamination on
properties we own or operate or on adjacent properties for which we may be responsible.
Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our operations
to date. We believe that we are currently in material compliance with these laws and
regulations.

This  facility  is owned by  Nicholas  F.  Taubman.  See  “Item  13.  Certain  Relationships  and  Related Transactions.”  Nicholas F. Taubman was the chairman of our board of directors  through  February 2003, at which time he resigned from our board of directors. On February 18, 2004, Mr. Taubman rejoined our board of directors.

(2)

We announced in January 2004 that this facility will be closing in 2004.


(3)

This facility moved from a stand-alone  facility to within one of our main  distribution  centers during 2003.

(4)

Total  capacity of this  facility is  approximately  433,000  square  feet,  of which  50,000  square feet continues to be used as a PDQ® warehouse.  This facility was also used as a  distribution  center prior to its closure in the fourth quarter of 2001. This facility is currently held for sale.

(5)

This facility is located within one of our main distribution center facilities.

(6)

This  facility is owned by Ki,  L.C., a Virginia  limited  liability  company  owned by two trusts for the benefit of a child and  grandchild  of  Nicholas  F.  Taubman.  See “Item 13.  Certain  relationships  and Related Transactions.”

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

In
February 2000, the Coalition for a Level Playing Field and over 100 independent automotive
parts and accessories aftermarket warehouse distributors and jobbers filed a lawsuit
styled Coalition for a Level Playing Field, et al. v. AutoZone, Inc. et al., Case No.
00-0953 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York against
various automotive parts and accessories retailers. In March 2000, we were notified that
we had been named defendants in the lawsuit. The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants
knowingly induced and received volume discounts, rebates, slotting and other allowances,
fees, free inventory, sham advertising and promotional payments, a share in the
manufacturers’ profits, and excessive payments for services purportedly performed for
the manufacturers in violation of the Robinson-Patman Act. In January 2003, a trial was
held and the jury found that we did not violate the Robinson-Patman Act. The plantiffs
subsequently appealed this decision, however, in November 2003 the Court of Appeals upheld
the verdict.

Our
Western Auto subsidiary, together with other defendants including automobile
manufacturers, automotive parts manufacturers and other retailers, has been named as a
defendant in lawsuits alleging injury as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing
products. We, Discount and Parts America also have been named as defendants in many of
these lawsuits. The plaintiffs have alleged that these products were manufactured,
distributed and/or sold by the various defendants. To date, these products have included
brake and clutch parts and roofing materials. The number of cases in which we or one of
our subsidiaries has been named as a defendant has increased in the past year. Many of the
cases pending against us or our subsidiaries are in the early
stages of litigation. The damages claimed against the defendants in some of these
proceedings are substantial. Additionally, some of the automotive parts manufacturers
named as defendants in these lawsuits have declared bankruptcy, which will limit
plaintiffs’ ability to recover monetary damages from those defendants. We believe
that we have valid defenses against these claims. We also believe that most of these
claims are at least partially covered by insurance. Based on discovery to date, we do not
believe the cases currently pending will have a material adverse effect on us. However, if
we were to incur an adverse verdict in one or more of these claims and were ordered to pay
damages that were not covered by insurance, these claims could have a material adverse
effect on our operating results, financial position and liquidity. If the number of claims
filed against us or any of our subsidiaries alleging injury as a result of exposure to
asbestos-containing products increases substantially, the costs associated with concluding
these claims, including damages resulting from any adverse verdicts, could have a material
adverse effect on our operating results, financial position and liquidity in future
periods.

In
addition to the above matters, we currently and from time to time are involved in
litigation incidental to the conduct of our business. The damages claimed against us in
some of these proceedings are substantial. Although the amount of liability that may result from these matters cannot be ascertained, we do not currently believe that, in the


aggregate, they will result in liabilities material to our consolidated financial
condition, future results of operations or cash flow.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a
Vote of Security Holders.

None.

The
closing price of our common stock on March 10, 2004 was $40.72. The table gives effect
to our two-for-one stock split effectuated in the form of a 100% stock dividend
distributed on January 2, 2004, as trading began on a post-split basis on January 5, 2004.
At March 10, 2004, there were 476 holders of record of our common stock.

We
have not declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock in the last two years. We
anticipate that we will retain all of our earnings in the foreseeable future to finance
the expansion of our business and, therefore, do not anticipate paying any dividends on
our common stock. In addition, our amended senior credit facility contains restrictions on
the amount of cash dividends or other distributions we may declare and pay on our capital
stock. Any payments of dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of
directors and will depend upon our results of operations, earnings, capital requirements,
contractual restrictions contained in our amended senior credit facility, or other
agreements, and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.

Stores  acquired in the Discount  acquisition are included in the comparable sales  calculation  beginning in December 2002,  which was 13 complete  accounting periods  after the  acquisition  date of November 28,  2001.  We do not include net sales from the 36 Western Auto retail  stores in our  comparable  store  calculation  as a result of their  unique  product  offerings, including specialty  merchandise and service.

(20)

Average net sales per square foot is  calculated  as net sales divided by the average of the beginning and ending total store square  footage for the  respective  period.  The fiscal 2003 net sales exclude the effect of the 53rd week in the amount of $63.0  million.  The fiscal 2001  amounts were  calculated  by reducing the number of Discount stores by one-thirteenth to reflect our ownership of Discount from December 2, 2001 (the acquisition date) through December 29, 2001.

Item 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The
following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should
be read in conjunction with “Selected Financial Data,” our consolidated
historical financial statements and the notes to those statements that appear elsewhere in
this report. Our discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current
expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives,
expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ
materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a
number of factors, including those set forth under “Forward Looking Statements”
and “Risk Factors” elsewhere in this report.

Our
fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest December 31 of each year. Our first quarter
consists of 16 weeks, and the other three quarters consist of 12 weeks, with the exception
of the fourth quarter fiscal 2003 which contained 13 weeks due to our 53- week fiscal year

2003, we produced strong operating results and built momentum to carry us into what we
believe will be another successful year in 2004. Our 2003 performance and our positive
outlook for 2004, is primarily a result of our management team’s focus to drive
top-line sales growth and increase our operating margins through our category management
initiatives, our national advertising campaign and leveraging our logistics and operating expenses. The
category management initiative not only drives top-line sales by developing improved
product assortments by category but also focusing on maximizing gross profit within each
product category offered. For 2003, we grew our total sales by 9.0% over last year to $3.5
billion, including the 53rd week. We also improved our operating margins to 8.3% of total
sales, including the 53rd week, an increase of 46.8% over 2002. In addition to the above
initiatives, our operating margins benefited from leveraging our selling, general and
administrative expenses.


Additionally,
we evaluate the quality of our results based on growth in certain key financial metrics.

General

We
operated stores within the United States, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. At January
3, 2004, we operated 2,503 stores throughout 39 states in the Northeastern, Southeastern
and Midwestern regions of the United States. These stores operated primarily under the
“Advance Auto Parts” trade name except for the state of Florida, which operated
under “Advance Discount Auto Parts” or “Discount Auto Parts” trade
names. These stores offered automotive replacement parts, accessories and maintenance
items, with no significant concentration in any specific area. In addition, we operated 36
stores under the “Western Auto” trade name, located primarily in Puerto Rico and
the Virgin Islands, which offer certain home and garden merchandise in addition to
automotive parts, accessories and service.

Stock Split

On
October 29, 2003, our Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock split of our common
stock, effected as a 100% stock dividend. The dividend was distributed on January 2, 2004
to holders of record as of December 11, 2003 and began trading on a post-split basis on
January 5, 2004. All references to share and per share amounts in this discussion and
analysis reflect the effect of the stock split.

Discontinued Operations

On
December 19, 2003, we discontinued the supplying of merchandise to our wholesale distribution
network. The wholesale distribution network, or Wholesale, consisted of independently
owned and operated dealer locations, for which we supplied merchandise inventory and
certain services. Due to the wide variety of products supplied to the dealers and the
reduced concentration of stores spread over a wide geographic area, it had become
difficult to


serve these dealers effectively. This component of our business operated in
the wholesale segment and excluding certain allocated and team member benefit expenses of $2.4 million, $3.3 million and $5.5 million for fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001,
represented the entire results of operations previously reported in that segment. We have
classified these operating results as discontinued operations in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2004, December
28, 2002 and December 29, 2001 to reflect this decision.

Critical Accounting
Policies

Our
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally
accepted in the United States of America. Our discussion and analysis of the financial
condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements. The
preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting
policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management. Our estimates
and judgments are based on currently available information, historical results and other
assumptions we believe are reasonable. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

The
preparation of our financial statements included the following significant estimates.

Vendor
Incentives

As
discussed further elsewhere in this report, we recognize certain vendor incentives earned
related to long-term supply agreements as a reduction to cost of sales over the life of
the agreement based on the timing of purchases, not as reductions to inventory. The
functional amounts earned under long-term arrangements are based on our estimate of total
purchases that will be made over the life of the contracts and the amount of incentives
that will be earned. The incentives are generally recognized based on the cumulative
purchases as a percentage of total estimated purchases over the life of the contract. The
estimate of total purchases are highly sensitive to market demand for certain product and
could positively or negatively impact our gross margins if actual purchases or results
from any one year differ from our estimates, however, incentives earned over the life of
the contract would be the same.

Inventory
Reserves

We
establish reserves for inventory shrink for our stores and distribution centers based on
our extensive and frequent cycle counting program. Our estimates of these shrink reserves
depend on the accuracy of the program, which is dependent on compliance rates of our
facilities and the execution of the required procedures. We evaluate the accuracy of this
program on an on-going basis and believe it provides reasonable assurance for the
established reserves. If the effectiveness of the program declines management estimates
will be required to ensure the accuracy of the overall shrink reserves.

Reserves
for potentially excess and obsolete inventories are recorded as well based on current
inventory levels of discontinued product and historical analysis of the liquidation of
discontinued inventory below cost. The nature of our inventory is such that the risk of
obsolescence is minimal and excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors
for credit. We provide reserves where less than full credit will be received for such
returns and where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less
than recorded cost. We develop these estimates based on the determination of return
privileges with vendors, the level of credit provided by the vendor and management’s
estimate of the discounts to recorded cost, if any, required by market conditions. Future
changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory
could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves for excess and obsolete
inventory.

Warranty
Reserves

Our
vendors are primarily responsible for warranty claims. Merchandise and services sold under
warranty, which are not covered by vendors’ warranties, include batteries, tires,
roadside assistance and Craftsman products. We record accruals for future warranty claims
based on current sales of the warranted products and historical claim experience. If
claims experience differs from historical levels, revisions in our estimates may be
required. We have seen positive trends in the defective rates of our batteries sold, which
have offset historically higher trends used to


develop our battery warranty accrual
resulting in overall lower warranty expense on our consolidated statement of operations.
We believe these positive trends are a result of quality enhancements of our currently
offered battery line and better policies and procedures surrounding the testing and
defecting of batteries by our store personnel. While we expect these positive trends to
continue, an increase in defective rates would have a negative impact on our consolidated
statement of operations.

Self-Insured
Reserves

We
are self-insured for general and automobile liability, workers’ compensation and the health
care claims of our team members. Therefore, we record estimated reserve amounts for the
settlement of such claims below our stop-loss limits. These estimates are developed based on information obtained
through our claims management procedures, from actual claims reported to us and an
estimate for claims incurred but not reported. This information is obtained through a
collaboration of both our internal and external claims professionals and third party
administrators. The estimated claim cost is actively reviewed for changes in claim facts
or action plans and negative trends related to claims incurred but not reported.
Accordingly, our estimated reserves may require an adjustment to previously recorded
amounts.

Restructuring
and Closed Store Liabilities

We
recognize a provision for future obligations at the time a store location closes. The
provision includes future minimum lease payments and common area maintenance and taxes all
reduced by management’s estimate of potential subleases and lease buyouts. These
estimates are based on current market and our experience of executing subleases or buyouts
on similar properties. However, our inability to enter into the subleases or obtain
buyouts due to a change in the economy or prevailing real estate markets for these
properties within the estimated timeframe may result in increases or decreases to these
reserves and could negatively impact our result of operations and cash flows.

Components of Statement
of Operations

Net Sales

Net
sales consist primarily of comparable store sales, new store net sales, and finance
charges on installment sales. Comparable store sales is calculated based on the change in
net sales starting once a store has been opened for 13 complete accounting periods (each
accounting period represents four weeks). Relocations are included in comparable store
sales from the original date of opening. Our 2003 comparable store sales results include
the 53rd week of operation compared to our first week of operation in 2003 (the comparable
calendar week). Stores acquired in the Discount acquisition were included in the
comparable store sales calculation beginning in December 2002, which was 13 complete
accounting periods after the acquisition date of November 28, 2001. We do not include net
sales from the 36 Western Auto retail stores in our comparable store sales calculation
as a result of their unique product offerings, including specialty merchandise.

Cost of Sales

Our
cost of sales consists of merchandise costs, net of incentives under vendor programs, and
warehouse and distribution expenses. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales may be
affected by variations in our product mix, price changes in response to competitive
factors and fluctuations in merchandise costs and vendor programs. We seek to avoid
fluctuation in merchandise costs and instability of supply by entering into long-term
purchasing agreements with vendors when we believe it is advantageous.

Selling, General and
Administrative Expenses

Selling,
general and administrative expenses consist of store payroll, store occupancy (including
rent), net advertising expenses, other store expenses and general and administrative
expenses, including salaries and related benefits of corporate team members,
administrative office expenses, data processing, professional expenses and other related
expenses including expenses associated with merger and integration. We lease a significant
portion of our stores.


Results of Operations

The following table sets forth
certain of our operating data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods
indicated.

Fiscal
2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002

Net
sales for 2003 were $3,493.7 million, an increase of $289.6 million, or 9.0%, over net
sales for 2002. Excluding the effect of the 53rd week our net sales increased $226.6
million, or 7.1%, over net sales for 2002. The net sales increase was due to an increase
in the comparable store sales of 3.1%, driven by increases in both customer traffic and average ticket sales, and contributions from new stores opened within the
last year. As previously mentioned, increases in both our DIY and DIFM business
contributed to the comparable store sales increase.

Gross
profit for 2003 was $1,604.5 million, or 45.9% of net sales, as compared to $1,434.4
million, or 44.8% of net sales, in 2002. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of
sales reflects continued benefits realized from our category management initiatives and
improved efficiencies in our logistics network. In 2004, we anticipate our gross profit to
continue to improve as a result of the benefits realized from our category management
initiatives and leveraging our logistics expenses.

Selling,
general and administrative expenses, including merger and integration costs of $10.4
million in 2003 and $35.5 million in 2002, increased to $1,316.3 million, or 37.6% of net
sales for 2003, from $1,238.1 million, or 38.7% of net sales for 2002. The decrease in
selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales is primarily a
result of a decrease in merger and integration expenses related to the integration of
Discount. These integration expenses are related to, among other things, overlapping
administrative functions and store conversion expenses. The decline in merger and
integration costs was anticipated as we near the completion of the Discount integration.
Excluding the impact of the merger and integration costs, the decline as a percentage of
net sales is a result of leveraging our fixed costs with the impact of the 53rd week of
operations in the fourth quarter of 2003.


Interest
expense for 2003 was $37.6 million, or 1.1% of net sales, as compared to $77.1 million, or
2.4% of net sales, in 2002. The decrease in interest expense is a result of lower overall
interest rates resulting primarily from our redemption of our outstanding senior
subordinated notes and senior discount debentures in first quarter 2003. Additionally, the
decrease is a result of overall lower debt levels in 2003 as compared to 2002, due to our
use of free cash flow to pay down debt.

Income
tax expense for 2003 was $78.4 million, as compared to $39.5 million for 2002. Our
effective income tax rate decreased to 38.5% for 2003, as compared to 38.8%, for 2002. The
decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to increases in pre-tax income, which
reduced the impact of certain permanent differences on the effective rate.

During
2003, we recorded $47.3 million in a loss on extinguishment of debt. This loss reflects
the write-off of deferred loan costs and premiums paid to redeem our senior subordinated
notes and senior discount debentures during the first quarter of fiscal 2003, and also
includes the related financing costs associated with amending our senior credit facility
to finance this redemption. Additionally, this loss includes the ratable portion of
deferred loans costs associated with the partial repayment of our term loans during fiscal
2003.

We
recorded net income of $124.9 million, $1.67 per diluted share for 2003, as compared to
$65.0 million, or $0.90 per diluted share for 2002. As a percentage of sales, net income
for 2003 was 3.6%, as compared to 2.0% for 2002. The effect of the expenses associated
with merger and integration and loss on extinguishment of debt on net income was $35.5
million, or $0.47 per diluted share for 2003 and $32.0 million, or $0.44 per diluted share
for 2002. As previously mentioned, these per share amounts reflect the two-for-one stock
split declared in 2003.

Fiscal
2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001

Net
sales for 2002 were $3,204.1 million, an increase of $784.4 million, or 32.4%, over net
sales for 2001. The net sales increase was due to an increase a full year’s
contribution of sales from stores acquired in the Discount acquisition, in the comparable
store sales of 5.5% and contributions from new stores opened within the last year. The
comparable store sales increase was a result of growth in both the DIY and DIFM market
segments (indicated by an increase in both comparative customers and average customer
sales), as well as the continued maturation of new stores.

Gross
profit for 2002 was $1,434.4 million, or 44.8% of net sales, as compared to $1,053.1
million, or 43.5% of net sales, in 2001. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of
sales reflects more favorable merchandise costs realized in fiscal 2002 as a result of renegotiating merchandise contracts after the Discount acquisition. Additionally,
this increase represents our ability to leverage logistics costs primarily driven by a
review of our logistics operations, which occurred in connection with our supply chain
initiatives. We began these initiatives during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, in which
we recorded a $9.1 million charge for restocking and handling fees associated with the
return of inventory under these initiatives.

Selling,
general and administrative expenses increased to $1,238.1 million, or 38.7% of net sales
for 2002, from $968.6 million, or 40.0% of net sales for 2001. Selling, general and
administrative expenses include merger and integration expenses related to the integration
of Discount of $35.5 million, or 1.1% of sales, and $4.9 million, or 0.2% of sales, for
2002 and 2001, respectively. These integration expenses are related to, among other
things, merger related restructuring, overlapping administrative functions and store
conversion expenses. The merger related restructuring charges primarily relate to lease
costs associated with closed Advance Auto Parts stores in overlapping markets as a result
of the Discount acquisition. Additionally, selling, general and administrative expenses include charges of $25.4
million, or 1.0% of sales, in 2001 as detailed below:

•

$1.4 million represents costs of relocating certain equipment held at facilities closed as a result of our supply chain initiatives;

•

$12.3 million represented the devaluation of property held for sale; and

•

$11.7 million was related to stock option compensation charges resulting from the elimination of variable provisions in certain of our stock options plans.


Excluding the effects of the above
merger and integration and other expenses above, the decrease in selling, general and
administrative expenses as a percentage of sales reflects an approximate 43 basis point
reduction related to our ability to leverage our store payroll expenses against a higher
sales base, and an approximate 66 basis point reduction from lower rent expense as a
result of owning a higher percentage of stores after the Discount acquisition.

Interest
expense for 2002 was $77.1 million, or 2.4% of net sales, as compared to $61.0 million, or
2.5% of net sales, in 2001. Interest expense reflects the overall increase in average
borrowings offset by more favorable interest rates during 2002 as compared to 2001. This
increase in borrowings is a result of the additional debt incurred in conjunction with the
Discount acquisition.

Income
tax expense for 2002 was $39.5 million, as compared to $7.3 million for 2001. Our
effective income tax rate decreased to 38.8% for 2002, as compared to 39.7%, for 2001. The
decrease was primarily due to increases in pre-tax income, which reduced the impact of
certain permanent differences on the effective rate.

During
2002, we recorded $16.8 million in a loss on extinguishment of debt. This loss reflects
the write-off of the ratable portion of the deferred loan costs associated with our
partial repayment of our tranche A and tranche B term loans and expenses associated with
the refinancing of the remaining portion of our tranche B term loans. Additionally, this
loss includes the write-off of the ratable portion of deferred loan costs and premiums
paid associated with the partial repurchase and retirement of our outstanding senior
subordinated notes and senior discount debentures.

We
recorded net income of $65.0 million, $0.90 per diluted share for 2002, as compared to
$11.4 million, or $0.20 per diluted share for 2001. As a percentage of sales, net income
for 2002 was 2.0%, as compared to 0.5% for 2001. The effect of the above merger and
integration items and loss on extinguishment of debt on net income is $32.0 million, or $0.44 per
diluted share for 2002. The effect of the 2001 merger and integration expenses, loss on extinguishment
of debt, cumulative effect of a change in accounting policy and other charges as detailed above were
$29.5 million, or $0.51 per diluted share for 2001. As
previously mentioned these per share amounts reflect the two-for-one stock split declared in
2003.

Liquidity and Capital
Resources

At
January 3, 2004, we had outstanding indebtedness consisting of borrowings of $440.0
million under our senior credit facility. Additionally, we had outstanding borrowings of
$5.0 million under our revolving credit facility and had $32.6 million in letters of
credit outstanding, which reduced our availability under the revolving credit facility to
$122.4 million.

Our
primary capital requirements have been the funding of our continued store expansion
program, including new store openings and store acquisitions, store relocations and
remodels, inventory requirements, the construction and upgrading of distribution centers,
the development and implementation of proprietary information systems and our strategic
acquisitions. We have financed our growth through a combination of cash generated from
operations, borrowings under the credit facility and issuances of equity.

Our
new stores, if leased, require capital expenditures of approximately $150,000 per store
and an inventory


investment of approximately $150,000 per store, net of vendor payables.
A portion of the inventory investment is held at a distribution facility. Pre-opening
expenses, consisting primarily of store set-up costs and training of new store team
members, average approximately $25,000 per store and are expensed when incurred.

Our
future capital requirements will depend on the number of new stores we open or acquire and
the timing of those openings or acquisitions within a given year. We opened 125 and 110
new stores during 2003 and 2002, respectively, (including stores acquired in the Trak and
Carport acquisitions, but excluding stores acquired in the Discount acquisition). In
addition, we anticipate adding approximately 125 to 135 new stores during 2004
primarily through new store openings.

Historically,
we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers that help finance inventory
growth, and we believe that we will be able to continue financing much of our inventory
growth through such extended payment terms. We anticipate that inventory levels will
continue to increase but at a rate lower than anticipated sales growth. As recently announced,
we have launched a vendor factoring program in 2004 that will allow us to extend the terms
on a portion of our accounts payable with our suppliers, therefore, positively impacting
cash flow.

Our
capital expenditures were $101.2 million in 2003. These amounts related to the new store
openings, the upgrade of our information systems, remodels and relocations of existing
stores, including our physical conversion of Discount stores, and capitalizable store
improvements. In 2004, we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately
$130.0 million, up from 2003 reflecting our intent to own rather than lease a portion
of our new store openings.

Our
recent acquisitions have resulted in restructuring reserves recorded in purchase
accounting for the closure of certain stores, severance and relocation costs and other
facility exit costs. In addition, we assumed certain restructuring and deferred
compensation liabilities previously recorded by Western and Discount. At January 3, 2004,
the restructuring reserves had a remaining balance of $7.5 million, of which $2.8
million is recorded as a current liability. Additionally, at January 3, 2004, the
total liability for the deferred compensation plans was $2.4 million, of which
$0.6 million, is recorded as a current liability. The classification for deferred
compensation is determined by payment terms elected by plan participants, primarily former
Western team members, which can be changed upon 12 months’ notice. These reserves are
utilized through the settlement of the corresponding liabilities with cash provided by
operations and therefore do not affect our consolidated statement of operations.

We
provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired team members
through our postretirement plan. At January 3, 2004, our accrued benefit cost related to
this plan was $17.4 million. The plan has no assets and is funded on a cash basis as
benefits are paid/incurred. The discount rate that we utilize for determining our
postretirement benefit obligation is actuarilly determined. The discount rate utilized at
January 3, 2004 and December 28, 2002 was 6.25% and 6.75%, respectively. We reserve the
right to change or terminate the benefits or contributions at any time. We also continue
to evaluate ways in which we can better manage these benefits and control costs. Any
changes in the plan or revisions to assumptions that affect the amount of expected future
benefits may have a significant impact on the amount of the reported obligation and annual
expense. Effective December 2002, we amended the plan to only provide benefits for team
members who are eligible at January 1, 2005. This negative plan amendment resulted in a
curtailment gain of $2.9 million in 2002, which is being amortized over 12 years to offset
corresponding increases in health care cost trends.

We
expect that funds provided from operations and available borrowings of approximately
$122.4 million under our revolving credit facility at January 3, 2004, will provide
sufficient funds to operate our business, make expected capital expenditures of
approximately $130.0 million in 2004, finance our restructuring activities and fund future
debt service on our senior credit facility through the next three years.

For
2003, net cash provided by operating activities was $355.9 million. Of this amount,
$124.9 million was provided by net income and $24.2 million was provided as a result
of a net decrease in working capital, other long-term assets and liabilities and other operating activities.
Significant non-cash items added back for operating cash purposes include depreciation and
amortization of $100.7 million, amortization of bond discounts and deferred debt issuance
costs of $5.1 million, loss on extinguishment of debt of $47.3 and provision for deferred
income taxes of $53.7 million. Net cash used in investing activities was $85.5 million and
was comprised primarily of capital expenditures. Net cash used in financing activities was
$272.8 million and was comprised primarily of a $294.2


million decrease in our net
borrowings, $38.3 million of expenses to complete the redemption of our senior
subordinated notes and senior discount debentures in April 2003, offset by proceeds from
the exercise of stock options of $25.4 million and an increase in bank overdrafts of $30.2
million.

For
2002, net cash provided by operating activities was $243.0 million. Of this amount,
$65.0 million was provided by net income and $15.9 million was provided as a result
of a net decrease in working capital, other long-term assets and liabilities and other operating activities.
Significant non-cash items added back for operating cash purposes include depreciation and
amortization of $94.1 million, amortization of bond discounts and deferred debt issuance
costs of $16.6 million and provision for deferred income taxes of $51.4 million. Net cash
used in investing activities was $78.0 million and was comprised primarily of capital
expenditures. Net cash used in financing activities was $169.2 million and was
comprised primarily of $223.3 million in net payments on the credit facility and payments
to repurchase and retire outstanding bonds and a decrease in bank overdrafts of $33.9
million, all offset by $88.7 million in net proceeds from our equity offering in March
2002, and $17.4 million in proceeds from team member exercises of stock options.
Additionally, in November 2002, we repurchased the entire $10 million of indebtedness
under the industrial development revenue bonds.

In
2001, net cash provided by operating activities was $103.5 million. This amount consisted
of an $11.4 million in net income, depreciation and amortization of $71.2 million,
amortization of deferred debt issuance costs and bond discount of $14.6 million,
impairment of assets held for sale of $12.3 million, amortization of stock option
compensation of $11.7 million and an increase of $17.7 million of net working capital and
other operating activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $451.0 million and
was comprised primarily of capital expenditures of $63.7 million and cash consideration of
$390.0 million paid in the Discount and Carport mergers. Net cash provided by financing
activities was $347.6 million and was comprised primarily of net borrowings.

Our
future contractual obligations related to long-term debt and operating leases at January
3, 2004 were as follows:

Long Term Debt

Senior
Credit Facility.

In March 2003, we added incremental facilities under our senior credit
facility in the form of a tranche A-1 term loan facility of $75 million and tranche C-1
term loan facility of $275 million to fund the redemption of our outstanding senior
subordinated notes and senior discount debentures in April 2003. Additionally in December
2003, we refinanced the remaining portion of our tranche A, A-1, C and C-1 term loan
facilities under the previous senior credit facility by amending and restating the credit
facility to add a new $100 million tranche D term loan facility and $340 million tranche E
term loan facility. In fiscal 2003, we repaid $291.0 million of total debt.

At
January 3, 2004, our senior credit facility consisted of (1) a tranche D term loan
facility with a balance of approximately $100.0 million and a tranche E term loan
facility with a balance of approximately $340.0 million, and (2) a $160 million revolving
credit facility (including a letter of credit sub facility) (of which $122.4 million was
available). The credit facility is jointly and severally guaranteed by all of our domestic
subsidiaries (including Discount and its subsidiaries) and is secured by all of our assets
and the assets of our existing and future domestic subsidiaries (including Discount and
its subsidiaries).


The
tranche D term loan facility currently provides for amortization of $19.3 million on
November 30, 2004, $21.6 million in May and November 2005 and in May 2006 and $15.8
million at maturity on November 30, 2006. The tranche E term loan facility currently
provides for amortization of $2.9 million in November 30, 2004 and semi-annually
thereafter, with a final payment of $325.2 million due at maturity on November 30,
2007.

The
interest rates on the tranche D and E term loan facilities are based, at our option, on an
adjusted LIBOR rate, plus a margin, or an alternate base rate, plus a margin. Until our
delivery of our financial statements for the fiscal year ending on January 3, 2004, the
initial margins for the tranche D and E term loan facilities are 2.00% and 1.00% per annum
for the adjusted LIBOR rate and alternate base rate borrowings, respectively. The margins
after such date will be determined by a pricing grid based on our leverage ratio at that
time. At January 3, 2004, interest rates on our tranche D and E term loan facilities were
3.13% and 3.18%, respectively.

The
interest rates on the revolving credit facility are based, at our option, on either an
adjusted LIBOR rate, plus a margin, or an alternate base rate, plus a margin. Until our
delivery of our financial statements for the fiscal year ending on January 3, 2004, the
initial margins for the revolving credit facility is 2.25% and 1.25% per annum for the
adjusted LIBOR rate and alternate base rate borrowings, respectively. Additionally, a
commitment fee of 0.375% per annum will be charged on the unused portion of the revolving
credit facility, payable quarterly in arrears. At January 3, 2004, interest rates on our
revolving credit facility were 3.38%.

The
senior credit facility is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all, subject
to certain exceptions, of our assets and the assets of our existing domestic subsidiaries
(including Discount and its subsidiaries) and will be secured by the properties and assets
of our future domestic subsidiaries.

The
senior credit facility contains covenants restricting the ability of us and our
subsidiaries to, among other things, (1) declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital
stock, (2) prepay, redeem or purchase debt, (3) incur liens or engage in sale-leaseback
transactions, (4) make loans and investments, (5) incur additional debt (including hedging
arrangements), (6) engage in certain mergers, acquisitions and asset sales, (7)
engage in transactions with affiliates, (8) change the nature of our business and the
business conducted by our subsidiaries and (9) change our passive holding company status.
We are also required to comply with financial covenants with respect to (a) a maximum
leverage ratio, (b) a minimum interest coverage ratio, (c) a minimum current assets to
funded senior debt ratio, (d) a maximum senior leverage ratio and (e) limits on
capital expenditures. We were in compliance with the above covenants of the senior credit
facility at January 3, 2004.

Seasonality

Our
business is somewhat seasonal in nature, with the highest sales occurring in the spring
and summer months. In addition, our business can be affected by weather conditions. While
unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as elective maintenance is deferred
during such periods, extremely hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing
automotive parts to fail.

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements

In
April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, “Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44
and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13 and Technical Corrections.” As a result of
rescinding FASB Statement No. 4, “Reporting Gains Losses from Extinguishment of
Debt,” gains and losses from extinguishment of debt should be classified as
extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria in APB
Opinion No. 30, “Reporting the Results of Operations — Reporting the Effects of
Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring
Events and Transactions.” This statement also amends FASB Statement No. 13,
“Accounting for Leases,” to eliminate an inconsistency between the required
accounting for sale-leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease
modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale-leaseback transactions.
Additional amendments include changes to other existing authoritative pronouncements to
make various technical corrections, clarify meanings or describe their applicability under
changed conditions. We adopted SFAS No. 145 during the first quarter of fiscal 2003. For
the fiscal years ended 2003, 2002 and 2001, we recorded losses on the extinguishment of
debt of $47.3 million, $16.8 million and $6.1 million, respectively and appropriately reclassified
such amounts.


In
September 2002 (as subsequently updated in November 2003), the FASB released EITF Issue No.
02-16, “Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor.”
This EITF addresses how a reseller should account for consideration received from a vendor
since EITF Issue No. 01-9, “Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a
Customer (including a Reseller of the Vendor’s Products),” only addresses the accounting treatment from the vendor’s perspective.
The consensus is that cash received from a vendor is presumed to be a reduction of the
vendor’s products or services and should, therefore, be characterized as a reduction
in the cost of sales when recognized in the customer’s income statement, unless a
reimbursement of costs is incurred by the customer to sell the vendor’s products, in
which case the cash consideration should be characterized as a reduction of that cost when
recognized in the customer’s income statement. Additionally, any rebate or refund
should also be recognized as a reduction of the cost of sales based on a systematic and
rational allocation. The release is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December
15, 2002. Our current accounting policy for vendor incentives meets the requirements of
this EITF and therefore the adoption of this release during the first quarter of fiscal
2003 had no impact on our financial position or results of operations.

In
November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation, or FIN, No. 45,
“Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.” FIN No. 45 sets forth
expanded disclosure requirements in the financial statements about a guarantor’s
obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that, under
certain circumstances, a guarantor is required to recognize a liability for the fair value
of the obligation at the inception of the guarantee. Certain types of guarantees, such as
product warranties, guarantees accounted for as derivatives, and guarantees related to
parent-subsidiary relationships are excluded from the liability recognition provisions of
FIN No. 45, however, they are subject to the disclosure requirements. The initial
liability recognition provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees
issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements of
Interpretation No. 45 are effective for financial statements for interim or annual
periods ending after December 15, 2002. We have no guarantees of third party
indebtedness and therefore the adoption of FIN No. 45 during the first quarter of fiscal
2003 had no impact on our financial position or results of operations. Additionally, we have
complied with the disclosure aspect of FIN No. 45 as it relates to warranties.

In
January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities,” an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin
No. 51, “Consolidated Financial Statements.” Interpretation No. 46
prescribes how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise assesses its
interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity. This
interpretation requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be
consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse
risks among parties involved. Interpretation No. 46 is effective immediately for
variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interest
entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date. The interpretation
applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003, to
variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it
acquired before February 1, 2003. We do not have interests in variable interest
entities; therefore, the adoption of Interpretation No. 46 had no impact on our
financial position or results of operations.

In
December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
– Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123.” This
statement amends SFAS 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” to allow
for alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based
method of accounting for stock issued to employees, who we refer to as team members. This statement also amends FASB No.
123 to require disclosure of the accounting method used for valuation in both annual and
interim financial statements. This statement permits an entity to recognize compensation
expense under the prospective method, modified prospective method or the retroactive
restatement method. If an entity elects to adopt this statement, fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2003 must include this change in accounting for team member stock-based
compensation. We have adopted the enhanced disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 148 and accordingly
included the related disclosures in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. We have concluded that we will continue to account
for team member stock-based compensation in accordance with Accounting Principles Board No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.”

In
July 2003 (as subsequently updated in November 2003), the FASB released EITF Issue No.
03-10, “Application of Issue No. 02-16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to
Customers by Manufacturers.” This EITF addresses whether a reseller should account
for consideration received from a vendor that is a reimbursement


by the vendor for
honoring the vendor’s sales incentives offered directly to consumers in accordance
with the guidance in EITF Issue No. 02-16. For purposes of this Issue, the
“vendor’s sales incentive offered directly to consumers” is limited to a
vendor’s incentive (i) that can be tendered by a consumer at resellers that accept
manufacturer’s incentives in partial (or full) of the price charged by the reseller
for the vendor’s product, (ii) for which the reseller receives a direct reimbursement
from the vendor (or a clearinghouse authorized by the vendor) based on the face amount of
the incentive, (iii) for which the terms of reimbursement to the reseller for the
vendor’s sales incentive offered to the consumer must not be influenced by or
negotiated in conjunction with any other incentive arrangements between the vendor and the
reseller but, rather may only be determined by the terms of the incentive offered to
consumers and (iv) whereby the reseller is subject to an agency relationship with the
vendor, whether expressed or implied, in the sales incentive transaction between the
vendor and the consumer. The consensus is that sales incentives that meet all of such
criteria are not subject to the guidance in Issue No. 02-16. The release is effective for
fiscal periods beginning after November 25, 2003. The Company does not expect the adoption
will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

In December 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 132R, “Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and Other
Postretirement Benefits.”  SFAS No. 132R amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 132 to require additional
disclosures about assets, obligations, cash flow and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans
and other defined postretirement plans.  This statement is effective for fiscal periods ending after December 15,
2003 and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2003. We adopted this statement during the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2003 and accordingly included the related disclosures in our other benefits footnote.

Risk Factors

Risks Relating to Our
Business

We will not be able to expand our
business if our growth strategy is not successful.

We
have increased our store count significantly from 1,567 stores at the end of 1998 to 2,539
stores at January 3, 2004. We intend to continue to expand our base of stores as part of
our growth strategy, primarily by opening new stores. There can be no assurance that this
strategy will be successful. The actual number of new stores to be opened and their
success will depend on a number of factors, including, among other things, our ability to
manage the expansion and hire, train and retain qualified sales associates, the
availability of potential store locations in highly visible, well-trafficked areas and the
negotiation of acceptable lease terms for new locations. There can be no assurance that we
will be able to open and operate new stores on a timely or profitable basis or that
opening new stores in markets we already serve will not harm existing store profitability
or comparable store sales. The newly opened and existing stores’ profitability will
depend on our ability to properly merchandise, market and price the products required in
their respective markets.

Furthermore,
we may acquire or try to acquire stores or businesses from, make investments in, or enter
into strategic alliances with, companies that have stores or distribution networks in our
current markets or in areas into which we intend to expand our presence. Any future
acquisitions, investments, strategic alliances or related efforts will be accompanied by
risks, including:

•

the difficulty of identifying appropriate acquisition candidates;

•

the difficulty of assimilating and integrating the operations of the respective entities;

•

the potential disruption to our ongoing business and diversion of our management’s attention;

•

the inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; and

•

the impairment of relationships with team members and customers as a result of changes in management.

We
cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other
problems encountered with these acquisitions, investments, strategic alliances or related
efforts.


We may not be able to successfully
implement our business strategy, including increasing comparable store sales, enhancing
our margins and increasing our return on capital, which could adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

We
have implemented numerous initiatives to increase comparable store sales, enhance our
margins and increase our return on capital in order to increase our earnings and cash
flow. If these initiatives are unsuccessful, or if we are unable to implement the
initiatives efficiently and effectively, our business, financial condition and results of
operations could be adversely affected.

Successful
implementation of our growth strategy also depends on factors specific to the retail
automotive parts industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control. These
include adverse changes in:

•

general economic conditions and conditions in our local markets, which could reduce our sales;

•

the competitive environment in the automotive aftermarket parts and accessories retail sector that may force us to reduce prices or increase spending;

•

the automotive aftermarket parts manufacturing industry, such as consolidation, which may disrupt or sever one or more of our vendor relationships;

•

our ability to anticipate and meet changes in consumer preferences for automotive products, accessories and services in a timely manner; and

•

our continued ability to hire and retain qualified personnel, which depends in part on the types of recruiting, training and benefit programs we adopt.

Disruptions in our relationships with
vendors or in our vendors’ operations could increase our cost of goods sold.

Our
business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our vendors and
upon the vendors’ ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable
prices and other terms. Many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships
and the ability or willingness of these vendors to sell us products on favorable terms.
For example, financial or operational difficulties that some of our vendors may face may
increase the cost of the products we purchase from them. In addition, the trend towards
consolidation among automotive parts suppliers may disrupt or sever our relationship with
some vendors, and could lead to less competition and, consequently, higher prices.

If demand for products sold by our
stores slows, our business, financial condition and results of operations will suffer.

Demand
for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may slow for a number of
reasons, including:

•

the weather, as vehicle maintenance may be deferred during periods of inclement weather;

•

the economy, as during periods of good economic conditions, more of our DIY customers may pay others to repair and maintain their cars instead of working on their own cars. In periods of declining economic conditions, both DIY and DIFM customers may defer vehicle maintenance or repair; and

•

the decline of the average age of vehicles, miles driven or number of cars on the road may indicate a reduction in the demand for our product offerings.

If
any of these factors cause demand for the products we sell to decline, our business,
financial condition and results of operations will suffer.

We depend on the services of our
existing management team and may not be able to attract and retain additional qualified
management personnel.

Our
success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our
executive officers and senior management team. If for any reason our senior executives do
not continue to be active in management, our business could suffer. We have entered into
employment agreements with some of our executive officers and senior management; however,
these agreements do not ensure their continued employment with us. Additionally, we cannot
assure you that we will be able to attract and retain additional qualified senior
executives as needed in the


future, which could adversely affect our financial condition
and results of operations.

If we are unable to compete
successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry, we could lose
customers and our revenues may decline.

The
sale of automotive parts, accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many
areas, including price, name recognition, customer service and location. We compete
primarily with national and regional retail automotive parts chains, wholesalers or jobber
stores, independent operators, automobile dealers that supply parts, discount stores and
mass merchandisers that carry automotive replacement parts, accessories and maintenance
items. Some of our competitors possess advantages over us, including substantially greater
financial and marketing resources, a larger number of stores, longer operating histories,
greater name recognition, larger and more established customer bases and more established
vendor relationships. Our response to these competitive disadvantages may require us to
reduce our prices or increase our spending, which would lower revenue and profitability.
Competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines or
require us to discontinue current product offerings or change some of our current
operating strategies. If we do not have the

resources or expertise or otherwise fail to
develop successful strategies to address these competitive disadvantages, we could lose
customers and our revenues may decline.

Because we are involved in litigation
from time to time, and are subject to numerous governmental laws and regulations, we could
incur substantial judgments, fines, legal fees and other costs.

We
are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers, employees or other
third parties for various actions. In particular, we are currently involved in litigation
involving claims relating to, among other things, breach of contract, anti-competitive
behavior, tortious conduct, employment discrimination, asbestos exposure and product
defect. The damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are
substantial. Although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims, if one
or more of the claims greatly exceeds our coverage limits or our insurance policies do not
cover a claim, it could have a material adverse affect on our business and operating
results.

Additionally,
we are subject to numerous federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations
relating to employment matters, environmental protection and building and zoning
requirements. If we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations, we may be
subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions. In addition, our capital expenses
could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be
noncompliant with any of these or future laws or regulations.

Risks Relating to Our
Financial Condition

Our level of debt and restrictions in
our debt instruments may limit our ability to take certain actions, including obtaining
additional financing in the future, that we would otherwise consider in our best interest.

At
January 3, 2004, we had total debt of approximately $445.0 million. Our debt levels
could have important consequences to you. For example, it could:

•

impair our ability to implement our growth strategy;

•

impair our ability to obtain additional financing, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes in the future;

•

place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt;

•

restrict our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions;

•

increase our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry and business conditions; or

•

cause our interest expense to increase if interest rates in general were to increase because a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at a floating rate.


Our ability to service our debt will
require a significant amount of cash and our operations may not generate the amount of
cash we need.

We
will need a significant amount of cash to service our debt. Our ability to generate cash
depends on our successful financial and operating performance. We cannot assure you that
we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that we will be able to obtain
sufficient funding to satisfy all of our obligations. Our financial and operational
performance also depends upon a number of other factors, many of which are beyond our
control. These factors include:

•

economic and competitive conditions in the automotive aftermarket industry; and

•

operating difficulties, operating costs or pricing pressures we may experience.

If
we are unable to service our debt, we will be required to pursue one or more alternative
strategies, such as selling assets, refinancing or restructuring our debt or raising
additional equity capital. However, we cannot assure you that any alternative strategies
will be feasible or prove adequate. Also, some alternative strategies would require the
consent of at least a majority in interest of the lenders under our senior credit facility
and we can provide no assurances that we would be able to obtain this consent. If we are
unable to meet our debt service obligations and alternative strategies are unsuccessful or
unavailable, our lenders would be entitled to exercise various remedies, including
foreclosing on our assets. Under those circumstances, our investors may lose all or a
portion of their investments.

The covenants governing our debt
impose significant restrictions on us.

The
terms of our amended senior credit facility impose significant operating and financial
restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and require us to meet certain financial tests.
These restrictions may also have a negative impact on our business, financial condition
and results of operations by significantly limiting or prohibiting us from engaging in
certain transactions, including:

•

incurring or guaranteeing additional indebtedness;

•

paying dividends or making distributions or certain other restricted payments;

•

making capital expenditures and other investments;

•

creating liens on our assets;

•

issuing or selling capital stock of our subsidiaries;

•

transferring or selling assets currently held by us;

•

repurchasing stock and certain indebtedness;

•

engaging in transactions with affiliates;

•

entering into any agreements that restrict dividends from our subsidiaries;

•

engaging in mergers or consolidations.

The
failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under our senior
credit facility. Furthermore, our senior credit facility contains certain financial
covenants, including establishing a maximum leverage ratio and requiring us to maintain a
minimum interest coverage ratio and a funded senior debt to current assets ratio, which,
if not maintained by us, will cause us to be in default under our senior credit facility.
Any of these defaults, if not waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt,
in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable. If this occurs, we may
not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if new
financing were available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us.

Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risks.

We
are exposed to cash flow risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to our
long-term debt. While we cannot predict the impact interest rate movements will have on
our debt, exposure to rate changes is managed through the use of fixed and variable rate
debt and hedging activities. Our variable rate debt is primarily vulnerable to movements
in the LIBOR rate. Our future exposure to interest rate risk increased during 2003 due to
the addition of variable rate debt and redemption of our fixed rate senior subordinated
notes and senior discount debentures, all offset by decreased interest rates, a reduction
in overall debt levels and the addition of two interest rate swaps.


In
March 2003, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements on an aggregate of $125
million of our variable rate debt under our senior credit facility. The first swap allows
us to fix our LIBOR rate at 2.269% on $75 million of variable rate debt for a term of 36
months. The second swap allows us to fix our LIBOR rate at 1.79% on $50 million of
variable rate debt for a term of 24 months.

In
September 2002, we entered into a hedge agreement in the form of a zero-cost collar, which
protects us against interest rate fluctuations in the LIBOR rate on $150 million of our
variable rate debt under our senior credit facility. The collar consists of an interest
rate ceiling of 4.5% and an interest floor of 1.56% for a term of 24 months. Under this
hedge, we will continue to pay interest at prevailing rates plus any spread, as defined by
our credit facility, but will be reimbursed for any amounts paid on the LIBOR rate in
excess of the ceiling. Conversely, we will be required to pay the financial institution
that originated the collar if the LIBOR rate is less than the 1.56% floor.

The
table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates on
our long-term debt outstanding at January 3, 2004, by expected maturity dates.
Additionally, the table includes the notional amounts of our debt hedged and the impact of
the anticipated average pay and receive rates of our hedges through their maturity dates.
Expected maturity dates approximate contract terms. Weighted average variable rates are
based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at January 3, 2004, as adjusted by the
limitations of the hedge agreement. Implied forward rates should not be considered a
predictor of actual future interest rates.

INDEPENDENT
AUDITORS’ REPORT

To the Board of Directors
and Stockholders of

Advance Auto Parts, Inc.

Roanoke, Virginia

We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of Advance Auto Parts, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as
of January 3, 2004 and December 28, 2002, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended January 3, 2004. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Advance Auto Parts, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 3, 2004 and December 28, 2002, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended January 3, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America.

As discussed in Note 2 to the
consolidated financial statements, effective December 29, 2002, the Company changed its financial
statement classification of losses from the extinguishment of debt to conform with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 145,

Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4,
44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13 and Technical Corrections.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(in thousands, except per share data)

1.    
          Organization and Description of Business:

Advance
Auto Parts, Inc. (“Advance”) conducts all of its operations through its wholly
owned subsidiary, Advance Stores Company, Incorporated and its subsidiaries
(“Stores”). Advance and Stores (collectively, the “Company”) operate
2,539 stores within the United States, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The Company
operates 2,503 stores throughout 39 states in the Northeastern, Southeastern and
Midwestern regions of the United States. These stores operate primarily under the
“Advance Auto Parts” trade name except for the State of Florida which operate
under “Advance Discount Auto Parts” or “Discount Auto Parts” trade
names. These stores offer automotive replacement parts, accessories and maintenance items,
with no significant concentration in any specific area. In addition, the Company operates
36 stores under the “Western Auto” trade name, located primarily in Puerto Rico
and the Virgin Islands, which offer certain home and garden merchandise in addition to
automotive parts, accessories and service.

2.    
          Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:

Accounting Period

The
Company’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of December, which results
in an extra week every six years. Accordingly, fiscal 2003 includes 53 weeks of
operations. All other fiscal years presented include 52 weeks of operations.

Principles of
Consolidation

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

Cash, Cash Equivalents
and Bank Overdrafts

Cash
and cash equivalents consist of cash in banks and money market funds. Bank overdrafts
include net outstanding checks not yet presented to a bank for settlement.

Vendor Incentives and
Change in Accounting Method

The
Company receives incentives from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances,
volume rebates and other functional discounts. Many of the incentives are under long-term
agreements (terms in excess of one year), while others are negotiated on an annual basis.
Certain vendors require the Company to use cooperative advertising allowances exclusively
for advertising. The Company defines these allowances as restricted cooperative
advertising allowances and recognizes them as a reduction to selling, general and
administrative expenses as incremental advertising expenditures are incurred. The
remaining cooperative advertising allowances not restricted by the Company’s vendors,
or unrestricted, rebates and other functional incentives are earned based on purchases
and/or the sale of product. The Company accounts for vendor incentives in accordance with
Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, No. 02-16, “Accounting by a Customer (Including
a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor.” Accordingly, the
Company records unrestricted cooperative advertising and volume rebates earned as a
reduction of inventory and recognizes the incentives as a reduction to cost of sales as
the inventory is sold.

F-8

ADVANCE AUTO PARTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

January 3, 2004, December 28, 2002, and December 29, 2001

(in thousands, except per share data)

The
Company recognizes the functional incentives earned related to long-term agreements as a
reduction of cost of sales over the life of the agreement based on the timing of
purchases. These incentives are not recorded as reductions to inventory. The functional
amounts earned under long-term arrangements are based on estimates of total purchases that
will be made over the life of the contracts and the amount of incentives that will be
earned. These incentives are generally recognized based on the cumulative purchases as a
percentage of total estimated purchases over the life of the contract. The Company’s
margins could be impacted positively or negatively if actual purchases or results from any
one-year differ from its estimates, however the impact over the life of the contract would
be the same. Short-term incentives (terms less than one year) are recognized as a
reduction to cost of sales over the course of the annual agreement and are not recorded as
reductions to inventory.

Amounts
received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred
revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Management’s estimate of the
portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within one year of the balance sheet
date has been included in other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets. Total deferred revenue is $19,524 and $20,592 at January 3, 2004 and
December 28, 2002. Earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in
receivables, net on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets except for that portion
expected to be received after one-year, which is included in other assets, net on the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Effective
December 31, 2000, the Company changed its method of accounting for unrestricted
cooperative advertising funds received from certain vendors to recognize these payments as
a reduction to the cost of inventory acquired from these vendors. Previously, these funds
were accounted for as a reduction to selling, general and administrative expenses as
advertising expense was incurred. The new method was adopted to better align the reporting
of these payments with the Company’s and the vendors’ use of these payments as
reductions to the price of inventory acquired from the vendors. The effect of the change
in fiscal 2001 was to increase income from continuing operations by $358, or $0.01 per
diluted share. The cumulative effect of retroactive application of the change on the year
ended December 29, 2001, was to reduce income by approximately $2,065, net of $1,360
income tax, or $0.03 per share.

Preopening Expenses

Preopening
expenses, which consist primarily of payroll and occupancy costs, are expensed as
incurred.

Advertising Costs

The
Company expenses advertising costs as incurred in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountant's Statement of Position, or SOP, 93-7, “Reporting on Advertising Costs.” Advertising expense
incurred was approximately $75,870, $69,637 and $56,698 in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Merger and Integration
Costs

As
a result of the Discount Auto Parts (“Discount”) acquisition in 2001, the
Company incurred costs related to, among other things, overlapping administrative
functions and store conversions, all of which have been expensed as incurred. These costs
are presented as expenses associated with the merger and integration in the accompanying
statements of operations.

Warranty Costs

The
Company’s vendors are primarily responsible for warranty claims. Warranty costs
relating to merchandise and services sold under warranty, which are not covered by
vendors’ warranties, are estimated based on the Company’s historical experience
and are recorded in the period the product is sold. The following table presents changes
in our defective and warranty reserves.

These adjustments were the result of obtaining additional information related to the estimated costs of outstanding warranties and have been allocated proportionately to our non-current assets, primarily property and equipment. These adjustments had no direct impact on the statement of operations, but reduced the depreciable base of the associated non-current assets.

Revenue Recognition and
Trade Receivables

The
Company recognizes merchandise revenue at the point of sale to customers in the retail
segment and point of shipment to a wholesale segment customer. Service revenue is
recognized upon performance of the service. The majority of sales are made for cash;
however, the Company extends credit to certain commercial customers through a third-party
provider of private label credit cards. The Company establishes reserves for returns and
allowances at the time of sale based on current sales levels and historical return rates.
Receivables under the private label credit card program are transferred to the third-party
provider on a limited recourse basis. The Company provides an allowance for doubtful
accounts on receivables sold with recourse based upon factors related to credit risk of
specific customers, historical trends and other information. This arrangement is accounted
for as a secured borrowing. Receivables and the related secured borrowings under the
private label credit card were $20,623 and $17,575 at January 3, 2004 and December 28,
2002, respectively, and are included in accounts receivable and other current liabilities,
respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Earnings Per Share of
Common Stock

Basic
earnings per share of common stock has been computed based on the weighted-average number
of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share of common stock
reflects the increase in the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding assuming
the exercise of outstanding stock options, calculated on the treasury stock method. There
were 59, 116 and 509 antidilutive options for the fiscal years ended January 3, 2004,
December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001, respectively.

Stock Split

On
October 29, 2003, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock split
of the Company’s common stock, effected as a 100% stock dividend. The dividend was
distributed on January 2, 2004 to holders of record as of December 11, 2003 and began
trading on a post-split basis on January 5, 2004. All share and per share amounts in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect the effects
of the stock split.

Employee Stock Options

As
permitted under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard, or SFAS, No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” the Company accounts for its stock
options using the intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board, or
APB, Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”, or APB No.

25.
Under APB No. 25, compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess, if any,
of the market price of the Company’s common stock at the measurement date over the
exercise price. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized compensation expense on the
issuance of its Fixed Options because the exercise price equaled the fair market value of
the underlying stock on the grant date. The Company recorded compensation expense related
to its Performance Options and Variable Options of $11,735 in non-cash stock option
compensation expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the
fiscal year ended December 29, 2001. No compensation expense was required for the fiscal
years ended January 3, 2004 and December 28, 2002.

As
required by SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation – Transition
and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123,” the following table reflects

For
the above information, the fair value of each option granted in the fiscal 2003 was
estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the
following assumptions: (i) weighted average risk-free interest rate of 3.12%; (ii)
weighted-average expected life of options of four years; (iii) expected dividend yield of
zero and (iv) weighted-average volatility of 41%.

For
the above information, the fair value of each option granted in the fiscal 2002 was
estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the
following assumptions: (i) weighted average risk-free interest rate ranging from 4.45% to
3.12%; (ii) weighted-average expected life of options of four years; (iii) expected
dividend yield of zero and (iv) weighted-average volatility of 17%.

For
the above information, the fair value of each option granted in fiscal 2001 was estimated
on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
assumptions: (i) weighted average risk-free interest rate of 2.89%; (ii) weighted-average
expected life of options of three years; (iii) expected dividend yield of zero and (iv)
volatility of 60%.

Hedge Activities

In
March 2003, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements to limit its cash
flow risk on an aggregate of $125,000 of its variable rate debt. The first swap allows the
Company to fix its LIBOR rate at 2.269% on $75,000 of debt for a term of 36 months. The
second swap allows the Company to fix its LIBOR rate at 1.79% on an additional $50,000 of
debt for a term of 24 months.

(in thousands, except per share data)

In
September 2002, the Company entered into a hedge agreement in the form of a zero-cost
collar, which protects the Company from interest rate fluctuations in the LIBOR rate on
$150,000 of its variable rate debt under its senior credit facility. The collar consists
of an interest rate ceiling at 4.5% and an interest rate floor of 1.56% for a term of 24
months. Under this hedge, the Company will continue to pay interest at prevailing rates
plus any spread, as defined by the Company’s credit facility, but will be reimbursed
for any amounts paid on the LIBOR rate in excess of the ceiling. Conversely, the Company
will be required to pay the financial institution that originated the collar if the LIBOR
rate is less than the floor.

In
accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,” the fair value of the hedge arrangement is recorded as an asset or
liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at January 3, 2004. The Company
has adopted the “matched terms” accounting method as provided by Derivative
Implementation Group, or DIG, Issue No. G20, “Assessing and Measuring the
Effectiveness of a Purchased Option Used in a Cash Flow Hedge” for the zero-cost
collar, and DIG Issue No. 9, “Assuming No Ineffectiveness When Critical Terms of the
Hedging Instrument and the Hedge Transaction Match in a Cash Flow Hedge” for the
interest rate swaps. Accordingly, the Company has matched the critical terms of each hedge
instrument to the hedged debt and used the anticipated terminal value of zero to assume
the hedges have no ineffectiveness. In addition, the Company will record all adjustments
to the fair value of the hedge instruments in accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) through the maturity date of the applicable hedge arrangement. The fair value at
January 3, 2004 was an unrecognized loss of $433 and $96 on the interest rate collar and
swaps, respectively. At December 28, 2002, the fair value of the interest rate collar was
an unrecognized loss of $592. Any amounts received or paid under these hedges will be
recorded in the statement of operations as earned or incurred. Comprehensive income for
the fiscal years ended January 3, 2004 and December 28, 2002 is as follows:

Based
on the estimated current and future fair values of the hedge arrangements at January 3,

income that will be reclassified to earnings in the next 12 months will consist of a loss
of $433 under the interest rate collar and a loss of $821 associated with the interest
rate swaps.

Segment Reporting

The
Company has adopted SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information,” which defines how operating segments are determined and
requires disclosures about products, services, major customers and geographic areas.
Subsequent to the Company’s discontinuance of the Wholesale Distribution Network
(Note 3), the Company believes that it began operating in one business segment.

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements

In
April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, “Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44
and 64, Amendment

of FASB Statement No. 13 and Technical Corrections.” As a result of
rescinding FASB Statement No. 4, “Reporting Gains Losses from Extinguishment of
Debt,” gains and losses from extinguishment of debt should be classified as
extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria in APB Opinion No. 30, “Reporting
the Results of Operations — Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a
Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and
Transactions.” This statement also amends FASB Statement No. 13, “Accounting for
Leases,” to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for
sale-leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications
that have economic effects that are similar to sale-leaseback transactions.

(in thousands, except per share data)

Additional
amendments include changes to other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various
technical corrections, clarify meanings or describe their applicability under changed
conditions. The Company adopted SFAS No. 145 during the first quarter of fiscal 2003. For
the fiscal years ended 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company recorded losses on the
extinguishment of debt of $47,288, $16,822 and $6,106, respectively and has appropriately
reclassified such amounts.

In
September 2002 (as subsequently updated in November 2003), the FASB released EITF Issue
No. 02-16, “Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration
Received from a Vendor.” This EITF addresses how a reseller should account for
consideration received from a vendor since EITF Issue No. 01-9, “Accounting for
Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (including a Reseller of the Vendor’s
Products),” only addresses the accounting treatment from the vendor’s
perspective. The consensus is that cash received from a vendor is presumed to be a
reduction of the vendor’s products or services and should, therefore, be
characterized as a reduction in the cost of sales when recognized in the customer’s
income statement, unless a reimbursement of costs is incurred by the customer to sell the
vendor’s products, in which case the cash consideration should be characterized as a
reduction of that cost when recognized in the customer’s income statement.
Additionally, any rebate or refund should also be recognized as a reduction of the cost of
sales based on a systematic and rational allocation. The release is effective for fiscal
periods beginning after December 15, 2002. The Company’s current accounting policy
for vendor incentives meets the requirements of this EITF and therefore the adoption of
this release during the first quarter of fiscal 2003 had no impact on the Company’s
financial position or results of operations.

In
November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation, or FIN, No. 45,
“Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.” FIN No. 45 sets forth expanded
disclosure requirements in the financial statements about a guarantor’s obligations
under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that, under certain
circumstances, a guarantor is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of the
obligation at the inception of the guarantee. Certain types of guarantees, such as product
warranties, guarantees accounted for as derivatives, and guarantees related to
parent-subsidiary relationships are excluded from the liability recognition provisions of
FIN No. 45, however, they are subject to the disclosure requirements. The initial
liability recognition provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees
issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements of
Interpretation No. 45 are effective for financial statements for interim or annual
periods ending after December 15, 2002. The Company has no guarantees of third party
indebtedness and therefore the adoption of FIN No. 45 during the first quarter of fiscal
2003 had no impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. The
Company has accurately complied with the disclosure aspect of FIN No. 45 as it relates to
warranties.

In
January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities,” an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin
No. 51, “Consolidated Financial Statements.” Interpretation No. 46
prescribes how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise assesses its
interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity. This
interpretation requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be
consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse
risks among parties involved. Interpretation No. 46 is effective immediately for
variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interest
entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date. The interpretation
applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003, to
variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it
acquired before February 1, 2003. The Company does not have interests in variable
interest entities; therefore, the adoption of Interpretation No. 46 had no impact on
its financial position or results of operations.

In
December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
– Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123.” This
statement amends SFAS 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” to allow
for alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based
method of accounting for stock issued to employees, who the Company refers to as team
members. This statement also amends FASB No. 123 to require disclosure of the accounting
method used for valuation in both annual and interim financial statements. This statement
permits an entity to recognize compensation expense under the prospective method, modified
prospective method or the retroactive restatement method. If an entity elects to

adopt
this statement, fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2003 must include this change in
accounting for team member stock-based compensation. The Company has adopted the enhanced disclosure
requirements of SFAS No. 148 and accordingly included the related disclosures in these footnotes.
The Company has concluded that it will continue to account for team member stock-based compensation in
accordance with Accounting Principles Board No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.”

In
July 2003 (as subsequently updated in November 2003), the FASB released EITF Issue No.
03-10, “Application of Issue No. 02-16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to
Customers by Manufacturers.” This EITF addresses whether a reseller should account
for consideration received from a vendor that is a reimbursement by the vendor for
honoring the vendor’s sales incentives offered directly to consumers in accordance
with the guidance in EITF Issue No. 02-16. For purposes of this Issue, the
“vendor’s sales incentive offered directly to consumers” is limited to a
vendor’s incentive (i) that can be tendered by a consumer at resellers that accept
manufacturer’s incentives in partial (or full) of the price charged by the reseller
for the vendor’s product, (ii) for which the reseller receives a direct reimbursement
from the vendor (or a clearinghouse authorized by the vendor) based on the face amount of
the incentive, (iii) for which the terms of reimbursement to the reseller for the
vendor’s sales incentive offered to the consumer must not be influenced by or
negotiated in conjunction with any other incentive arrangements between the vendor and the
reseller but, rather may only be determined by the terms of the incentive offered to
consumers and (iv) whereby the reseller is subject to an agency relationship with the
vendor, whether expressed or implied, in the sales incentive transaction between the
vendor and the consumer. The consensus is that sales incentives that meet all of such
criteria are not subject to the guidance in Issue No. 02-16. The release is effective for
fiscal periods beginning after November 25, 2003. The Company is currently evaluating the
effect of this release and does not expect that the adoption will have a material impact
on its financial position or results of operations.

In December 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 132R, “Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and Other
Postretirement Benefits.”  SFAS No. 132R amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 132 to require additional
disclosures about assets, obligations, cash flow and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans
and other defined postretirement plans.  This statement is effective for fiscal periods ending after December 15,
2003 and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2003. The Company adopted this statement during the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2003 and accordingly included the related disclosures in the other benefits footnote.

Reclassifications

Certain
items in the fiscal 2002 financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the
fiscal 2003 presentation.

3.    
          Discontinued Operations:

On
December 19, 2003, the Company discontinued the supply of merchandise to its Wholesale
Distribution Network, or Wholesale. Wholesale consisted of independently owned and
operated dealer locations, for which the Company supplied merchandise inventory. This
component of the Company’s business operated in the Company’s previously
reported wholesale segment. The Company has accounted for the discontinuance of the
wholesale segment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” The Company has classified these operating results as
discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the
fiscal years ended January 3, 2004, December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001. For the fiscal years ended January 3,
2004, December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001, the Wholesale Distribution Network had revenues of $52,486, $83,743 and
$97,893, respectively. At January 3, 2004, the Wholesale Distribution Network assets were not significant
to the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

The
discontinued wholesale segment, excluding certain allocated and team member benefit
expenses, represented the entire results of operations previously reported in that
segment. These excluded expenses represented $2,361, $3,272 and $5,490 of allocated
and team member benefit expenses for fiscal 2003,
2002, and 2001, respectively, that remain a component of income from continuing operations
and have therefore been

excluded from discontinued operations. The Company has also allocated
corporate interest expenses incurred under the Company’s senior credit facility and
subordinated notes. The allocated interest complies with the provisions of EITF 87-24,
“Allocation of Interest to Discontinued Operations,” and are reported in
discontinued operations on the accompanying statements of operations. These amounts were
$484, $1,126 and $1,665 for fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The loss on the
discontinued operations of Wholesale for fiscal 2003 included $2,693 of exit costs as

4.    
          Acquisitions:

Discount Acquisition

On
November 28, 2001, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of Discount
Auto Parts, Inc. (“Discount”). Discount’s shareholders received $7.50 per
share in cash plus 0.2577 shares of Advance common stock for each share of Discount common
stock. The Company issued 4,310 shares of Advance common stock to the former Discount
shareholders, which represented 13.2% of the Company’s total shares outstanding
immediately following the acquisition.

Discount
was the fifth largest specialty retailer of automotive parts, accessories and maintenance
items in the United States with 671 stores in six states, including the leading market
position in Florida, with 437 stores. The Discount acquisition further solidified the
Company’s leading market position throughout the Southeast.

In
accordance with SFAS No. 141, the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase
method of accounting and was effective for accounting purposes on December 2, 2001.
Accordingly, the results of operations of Discount for the period from December 2, 2001
are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The purchase price of $481,688
was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon estimates of fair
values. Negative goodwill of $58,763, resulting from excess fair value over the purchase
price, was allocated proportionately as a reduction to certain non-current assets,
primarily property and equipment.

For the fiscal
years ended January 3, 2004, December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001, the Company incurred
$10,417, $35,532 and 4,854, respectively, of merger and integration and merger-related
restructuring expenses. These expenses represent merger and integration costs associated
with integrating the Discount operations.

Trak Acquisition

On
July 23, 2002, the Company announced that it had received bankruptcy court approval to
acquire certain assets of Trak Auto Corporation, or Trak, including the leases on 55
stores in Virginia, Washington, D.C. and Maryland. On September 20, 2002, the Company
agreed to acquire two additional Trak stores. The acquisition has been accounted for under
the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, each store’s results of
operations has been included in the Company’s financial records from the date each
store was transferred to the Company. Negative goodwill of $1,687, resulting from excess
fair value over the purchase price, was allocated proportionately as a reduction to
certain noncurrent assets. As of December 28, 2002, the Company had taken ownership and
converted all 57 stores, assumed the respective lease obligations and had paid $12,465 for
inventory and fixtures.

Carport Acquisition

On
April 23, 2001, the Company completed its acquisition of Carport Auto Parts, Inc., or
Carport. The acquisition included a net 30 retail stores located in Alabama and
Mississippi, and substantially all of the assets used in Carport’s operations. The
acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and,
accordingly, Carport’s results of operations have been included in the Company’s
consolidated statement of operations since the acquisition date.

The
purchase price of $21,533 has been allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities
assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition. This allocation resulted in
the recognition of $3,695 in goodwill, of which $444 was amortized during fiscal 2001.

5.    
          Closed Store and Restructuring Liabilities:

The
Company continually reviews the operating performance of its existing store locations and
closes certain locations identified as under performing. Closing an under performing
location does not result in the elimination of the operations and associated cash flows
from the Company’s ongoing operations as the Company transfers those operations to
another location in the local market. Accordingly, the Company maintains closed store
liabilities that include liabilities for these exit activities and liabilities assumed
through past acquisitions that are similar in nature but recorded by the acquired
companies prior to acquisition. The Company also maintains restructuring liabilities
recorded through purchase accounting that reflect costs of the plan to integrate the
acquired operations into the Company’s business. These integration plans relate to
the operations acquired in the fiscal 1998 merger with Western Auto Supply Company, or
Western, and the fiscal 2001 acquisition of Discount. The following table presents a
summary of the activity for both of these liabilities:

F-16

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

January 3, 2004, December 28, 2002, and December 29, 2001

(in thousands, except per share data)

New
provisions established for closed store liabilities include the present value of the
remaining lease obligations and management’s estimate of future costs of insurance,
property tax and common area maintenance reduced by the present value of estimated
revenues from subleases and are established by a charge to selling, general and
administrative costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations at the time
the facilities actually close. The Company currently uses discount rates ranging from 4.5%
to 7.8% for estimating these liabilities.

From
time to time these estimates require revisions that affect the amount of the recorded
liability. The above change in estimates relate primarily to changes in assumptions
associated with the revenue from subleases. The effect of changes in estimates for the
closed store liabilities is netted with new provisions and included in selling, general
and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

Changes
in estimates associated with restructuring liabilities resulted in adjustments to the
carrying value of property and equipment, net on the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets and did not affect the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. The
closed store and restructuring liabilities are recorded in accrued expenses (current
portion) and other long-term liabilities (long-term portion) in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets.

6.    
          Receivables:

Receivables consist of the following:

7. Inventories, net

Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost was determined using the last-in,
first-out (“LIFO”) method for approximately 93% and 91% of inventories at
January 3, 2004 and December 28, 2002, respectively, and the first-in, first-out
(“FIFO”) method for remaining inventories. The remaining inventories consist of
product cores, which consist of the non-consumable portion of certain parts and batteries.
Core values are included as part of our merchandise costs and are either passed on to the
customer or returned to the vendor. Additionally, these products are not subject to the
frequent cost changes like our other merchandise inventory, therefore resulting in no
material difference from applying either the LIFO or FIFO valuation methods.

The
Company capitalizes certain purchasing and warehousing costs into inventory. Purchasing
and warehousing costs included in inventory, at FIFO, at January 3, 2004 and December 28,
2002, were $75,349 and $69,160, respectively. Inventories consist of the following:

Replacement
cost approximated FIFO cost at January 3, 2004 and December 28, 2002.

Inventory
quantities are tracked through a perpetual inventory system. The Company uses a cycle
counting program in all distribution centers, Parts Delivered Quickly warehouses, or PDQs, Local Area Warehouses, or LAWs, and
retail stores to ensure the accuracy of the perpetual inventory quantities of both merchandise and core inventory. The Company
establishes reserves for estimated shrink based on historical accuracy and effectiveness
of the cycle counting program. The Company also establishes reserves for potentially
excess and obsolete inventories based on current inventory levels of discontinued product
and the historical analysis of the liquidation of discontinued inventory below cost. The
nature of the Company’s inventory is such that the risk of obsolescence is minimal
and excess inventory has historically been returned to the Company’s vendors for
credit. The Company provides reserves when less than full credit is expected from a vendor
or when liquidating product will result in retail prices below recorded costs. The
Company’s reserves against inventory for these matters were $16,011 and $16,289 at
January 3, 2004 and December 28, 2002, respectively.

8.    
          Property and Equipment:

Property
and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged directly to expense when incurred;
major improvements are capitalized. When items are sold or retired, the related cost and
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, with any gain or loss reflected in
the consolidated statements of operations.

Depreciation
of land improvements, buildings, furniture, fixtures and equipment, and vehicles is
provided over the estimated useful lives, which range from 2 to 40 years, of the
respective assets using the straight-line method. Amortization of building and leasehold
improvements is provided over the shorter of the original useful lives of the respective
assets or the term of the lease using the straight-line method. Depreciation and
amortization expense was $100,737, $94,090 and $70,745 for the fiscal years ended 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively.

Property
and equipment consists of the following:

The
Company capitalized approximately $5,423, $2,888 and $19,699 incurred for the development
of internal use computer software during fiscal 2003, fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001,
respectively. These costs are included in the furniture, fixtures and equipment category
above and are depreciated on the straight-line method over three to seven years.

9. Assets Held for Sale

The
Company applies SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets,” which requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable
intangible assets to be disposed of be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the
fair market value less selling costs. At January 3, 2004 and December 28, 2002, the
Company’s assets held for sale were $20,191 and $28,346, respectively, primarily
consisting of closed stores as a result of the Discount integration and a closed
distribution center.

During
fiscal 2001, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $12,300, to reduce the carrying
value of certain non-operating facilities to their estimated fair market value. A charge
of $4,700 represents the write-down of a closed distribution center acquired as part of
the Western merger. A charge of $4,600 represents the reduction in carrying value of the
former Western Auto corporate office also acquired in the Western merger. Both of these
facilities were disposed of in fiscal 2002.

The
remaining $3,000 represents a reduction to the carrying value of a closed distribution
center in Jeffersonville, Ohio that was identified for closure in fiscal 2002 as part of
the Company’s supply chain initiatives. The carrying value for this property included
in assets held for sale was $5,700 and $5,800 at January 3, 2004 and December 28, 2002,
respectively. The reduction in this book value represents the Company’s best estimate
of fair market value based on recent marketing efforts to attract buyers for this
property.

of January 3, 2004 and December 28, 2002, other assets include deferred debt issuance
costs of $3,987 and $14,244, respectively (net of accumulated amortization of $1,793 and
$5,837, respectively), relating primarily to the financing in connection with the Discount
acquisition and the fiscal 1998 recapitalization. Such costs are being amortized over the
term of the related debt (5 years). In April 2003, the Company redeemed all of its
currently outstanding senior subordinated notes and senior discount debentures.
Accordingly, the Company wrote-off $9,822 in deferred debt issuance cost included in other
assets.

13.  
          Long-term Debt:

Long-term debt consists of the following:

The
Company completed the redemption of its outstanding senior subordinated notes and senior
discount debentures on April 15, 2003. Incremental facilities were added to fund the
redemption in the form of a tranche A-1 term loan facility of $75,000 and tranche C-1 term
loan facility of $275,000. In conjunction with this redemption and overall partial repayment of $54,433, the
Company wrote-off deferred financing costs in accordance with EITF Issue No. 96-19,
“Debtor’s Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of Debt Instruments”.
The write-off of these costs combined with the accretion of the discounts and related
premiums paid on the repurchase of the senior subordinated notes and senior discount
debentures resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $46,887 in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations for the year ended January 3, 2004.

During
the remainder of fiscal 2003, the Company repaid $236,089 of its terms loans under the
senior credit facility. In conjunction with this partial repayment, the Company wrote-off
additional deferred financing costs in the amount of $401, which is classified as a
loss on extinguishment of debt in the accompanying consolidated statements
of operations for the year ended January 3, 2004. Additionally in December 2003, the
Company refinanced the remaining portion of its tranche A, A-1, C and C-1 term loan
facilities under the previous senior credit facility by amending and restating the credit
facility to add a new $100,000 tranche D term loan facility and $340,000 tranche E term
loan facility. The borrowings under the tranche D term loan facility and tranche E term
loan facility were used to replace the tranche A, A-1, C and C-1 term loan facilities.

(in thousands, except per share data)

During
fiscal 2002, the Company repaid a portion of its tranche A and tranche B term loan
facilities. Subsequently, it also refinanced the remaining portion of its tranche B term
loan facility under its previous senior credit facility by amending and restating the
credit facility to add a new $250,000 tranche C term loan facility. The borrowings under
the tranche C term loan facility were used to refinance the tranche B term loan facility.
In conjunction with the extinguishment of this debt, the Company wrote-off deferred
financing costs in accordance with EITF No. 96-19. The write-off of these costs are
classified as a loss on extinguishment of debt of $8,542 in the accompanying consolidated statement
of operations.

During
fiscal 2002, the Company also repurchased and retired a portion of its senior subordinated
notes and senior discount debentures. The premiums paid and the write-off of the related
deferred financing costs are classified as a loss on extinguishment of debt of $8,280 in the
accompanying statements of operations.

At
January 3, 2004, the senior credit facility provided for (1) $440,000 in term loans (as
detailed above) and (2) $160,000 under a revolving credit facility (which provides for the
issuance of letters of credit with a sub limit of $70,000). As of January 3, 2004, the
Company had borrowed $5,000 under the revolving credit facility and had $32,585 in letters
of credit outstanding, which reduced availability under the credit facility to $122,415.

The
amended tranche D term loan facility amortization schedule currently reflects required
repayments of $19,251 on November 30, 2004, $21,636 in May and November 2005, $21,636 in
May 2006 and $15,839 at maturity on November 30, 2006. Under the amended credit facility,
the tranche E term loan facility requires scheduled repayments of $2,969 semi-annually
beginning November 30, 2004 through May 31, 2007, and the Company will be required to pay
the remaining balance at maturity on November 30, 2007.

The
interest rates on the tranche D and E term loan facilities are based, at the
Company’s option, on either an adjusted LIBOR rate, plus a margin, or an alternate
base rate, plus a margin. Under the Company’s senior credit facility as amended in
December 2003 and until its delivery of its financial statements for the fiscal year
ending on January 3, 2004, the initial margins for the tranche D term loan facilities and
the tranche E term loan facilities are 2.00% and 1.00% per annum for the adjusted LIBOR
rate and alternate base rate borrowings, respectively. The margins subsequent to such date
will be determined by a pricing grid based on the Company’s leverage ratio at that
time.

The
interest rates on the revolving credit facility is based, at the Company’s option, on
either an adjusted LIBOR rate, plus a margin, or an alternate base rate, plus a margin.
Under the Company’s senior credit facility as amended in December 2003 and until its
delivery of its financial statements for the fiscal year ending on January 3, 2004, the
initial margins for the revolving credit facility is 2.25% and 1.25% per annum for the
adjusted LIBOR rate and alternate base rate borrowings, respectively. Additionally, a
commitment fee of 0.375% per annum will be charged on the unused portion of the revolving
credit facility, payable quarterly in arrears.

Borrowings
under the senior credit facility are required to be prepaid, subject to certain
exceptions, with (1) 50% of the Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the senior credit
facility) unless the Company’s Senior Leverage Ratio (as defined in the senior credit
facility) at the end of any fiscal year is less than or equal to 1.00 to 1.00, in which
case 25% of Excess Cash Flow for such fiscal year will be required to be repaid, (2) 100%
of the net cash proceeds of all asset sales or other dispositions of property by the
Company and its subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions (including exceptions for
reinvestment of certain asset sale proceeds within 270 days of such sale and certain
sale-leaseback transactions), and (3) 100% of the net proceeds of certain issuances of
debt or equity by the Company and its subsidiaries.

Voluntary
prepayments and voluntary reductions of the unutilized portion of the revolving credit
facility are permitted in whole or in part, at the Company’s option, in minimum
principal amounts specified in the senior credit facility, without premium or penalty,
subject to reimbursement of the lenders’ redeployment costs in the case of a
prepayment of adjusted LIBOR borrowings other than on the last day of the relevant
interest period. Voluntary prepayments will (1) generally be allocated among the
facilities on a pro rata basis (based on the then outstanding principal amount of the
loans under each facility) and (2) within each such facility, be applied to the
installments

under the amortization schedule within the following 12 months under such
facility until eliminated. All remaining amounts of prepayments will be applied pro rata
to the remaining amortization payments under such facility.

The
senior credit facility is guaranteed by the Stores and by each of its existing domestic
subsidiaries and will be guaranteed by all future domestic subsidiaries. The senior credit
facility is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all, subject to certain
exceptions, of the stores’ properties and assets and the properties and assets of its
existing domestic subsidiaries (including Discount and its subsidiaries) and will be
secured by the properties and assets of its future domestic subsidiaries. The senior
credit facility contains covenants restricting the ability of the Company and its
subsidiaries to, among other things, (1) declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital
stock, (2) prepay, redeem or purchase debt, (3) incur liens or engage in sale-leaseback
transactions, (4) make loans and investments, (5) incur additional debt (including hedging
arrangements), (6) engage in certain mergers, acquisitions and asset sales, (7)
engage in transactions with affiliates, (8) change the nature of the Company’s
business and the business conducted by its subsidiaries and (9) change the holding company
status of Advance. The Company is required to comply with financial covenants with respect
to a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum interest coverage ratio, a minimum current assets
to funded senior debt ratio, a maximum senior leverage ratio and maximum limits on capital
expenditures.

As
of January 3, 2004, the Company was in compliance with the covenants of the senior credit
facility. Substantially all of the net assets of the Company’s subsidiaries are
restricted at January 3, 2004.

At
January 3, 2004, the aggregate future annual maturities of long-term debt are as follows:

          Stockholder Subscription Receivables:

The
Company established a stock subscription plan in fiscal 1998, which allows certain
directors, officers and key team members of the Company to purchase shares of common
stock. The plan required that the purchase price of the stock equal the fair market value
at the time of the purchase and allowed fifty percent of the purchase price to be executed
through the delivery of a full recourse promissory note. All of the notes were in paid in
full during 2003. At December 28, 2002, outstanding stockholder subscription receivables
were $976, and are included as a reduction to stockholders’ equity in the
accompanying balance sheet.

had a (loss) income from operations of the discontinued Wholesale Dealer Network of
$(572), 4,691, and 4,040, respectively. The Company recorded an income tax (benefit) expense
of $(220), 1,820 and 1,604 related to these discontinued operations for the years ended
January 3, 2004, December 28, 2002, and December 29, 2001, respectively. During the year
ended December 29, 2001, the Company recorded the cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle of $3,425. The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $1,360
related to this cumulative effect for the year ended December 29, 2001.

Deferred
income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at
each period-end, based on enacted tax laws and statutory income tax rates applicable to
the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Deferred
income taxes reflect the net income tax effect of temporary differences between the bases
of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and for income tax reporting
purposes. Net deferred income tax balances are comprised of the following:

The
Company incurred financial reporting and tax losses in 1999 primarily due to integration
and interest costs incurred as a result of the fiscal 1998 Western merger and the 1998
recapitalization. At January 3, 2004 and December 28, 2002, the Company has cumulative net
deferred income tax liabilities of $63,341 and $9,603, respectively. The gross deferred
income tax assets also include state net operating loss carryforwards, or
NOLs, and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately $6,695 and $594, respectively. These NOLs
and state tax credit carryforwards may be used to reduce future taxable income and
expire periodically through fiscal year 2022. The Company believes it will realize these
tax benefits through a combination of the reversal of temporary differences, projected
future taxable income during the NOL carryforward periods and available tax planning
strategies. Due to uncertainties related to the realization of certain deferred tax assets
for NOLs in various jurisdictions, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $793 as
of January 3, 2004 and $1,795 as of December 28, 2002. The amount of deferred income tax
assets realizable, however, could change in the near future if estimates of future taxable
income are changed.

Temporary differences which give rise
to significant deferred income tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:

These
amounts are recorded in other current assets, other current liabilities, other assets and
other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as
appropriate.

The
Company currently has four years that are open to audit by the Internal Revenue Service.
In addition, various state and foreign income tax returns for several years are open to
audit. In management’s opinion, any amounts assessed will not have a material effect
on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

Additionally,
the Company has certain periods open to examination by taxing authorities in various
states and foreign jurisdictions for sales, use and excise taxes. In management’s
opinion, any amounts assessed will not have a material effect on the Company’s
financial position or results of operations.

Net rent expense for fiscal 2003, fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 was as follows:

Contingent
facility rentals are determined on the basis of a percentage of sales in excess of
stipulated minimums for certain store facilities as defined in the individual lease
agreements. Most of the leases provide that the Company pay taxes, maintenance, insurance
and certain other expenses applicable to the leased premises and include options to renew.
Certain leases contain rent escalation clauses, which are recorded on a straight-line
basis. Management expects that, in the normal course of business, leases that expire will
be renewed or replaced by other leases.

Rental
payments to related parties of approximately $3,011 in fiscal 2003, $3,168 in fiscal 2002
and $3,824 in fiscal 2001 are included in net rent expense for open stores. Rent expense
associated with closed locations is included in other selling, general and administrative
expenses.

program are included in net sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations for the fiscal years ended January 3, 2004, December 28, 2002 and December 29,

18.  
          Contingencies:

In
the case of all known contingencies, the Company accrues for an obligation, including
estimated legal costs, when it is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. As
facts concerning contingencies become known to the Company, the Company reassesses its
position with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. Estimates that
are particularly sensitive to future change include tax and legal matters, which are
subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during
the administrative and litigation process.

In
February 2000, the Coalition for a Level Playing Field and over 100 independent automotive
parts and accessories aftermarket warehouse distributors and jobbers filed a lawsuit
styled Coalition for a Level Playing Field, et al. v. AutoZone, Inc. et al., Case No.
00-0953 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York against
various automotive parts and accessories retailers. In March 2000, the Company was
notified that it had been named defendants in the lawsuit. The plaintiffs claimed that the
defendants knowingly induced and received volume discounts, rebates, slotting and other
allowances, fees, free inventory, sham advertising and promotional payments, a share in
the manufacturers’ profits, and excessive payments for services purportedly performed
for the manufacturers in violation of the Robinson-Patman Act. In January 2003, a trial
was held and the jury found that the Company did not violate the Robinson-Patman Act. The
plantiffs subsequently appealed this decision, however, in November 2003 the Court of
Appeals upheld the verdict.

The
Company’s Western Auto subsidiary, together with other defendants including
automobile manufacturers, automotive parts manufacturers and other retailers, has been
named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging injury as a result of exposure to
asbestos-containing products. The Company, Discount and Parts America, acquired as part of
the Western Auto Supply Company acquisition in 1998, also have been named as defendants in
many of these lawsuits. The plaintiffs have alleged that these products were manufactured,
distributed and/or sold by the various defendants. To date, these products have included
brake and clutch parts and roofing materials. The number of cases in which the Company or
one of its subsidiaries has been named as a defendant has increased in the past year. Many
of the cases pending against the Company or its subsidiaries are
in the early stages of litigation. The damages claimed against the defendants in some of
these proceedings are substantial. Additionally, some of the automotive parts
manufacturers named as defendants in these lawsuits have declared bankruptcy,
which will limit plaintiffs’ ability to recover monetary damages from those
defendants. The Company believes that it has valid defenses against these claims. The
Company also believes that most of these claims are at least partially covered by
insurance. Based on discovery to date, the Company does not believe the cases currently
pending will have a material adverse effect on it. However, if the Company was to incur an
adverse verdict in one or more of these claims and were ordered to pay damages that were
not covered by insurance, these claims could have a material adverse affect on its
operating results, financial position and liquidity. If the number of claims filed against
the Company or any of its subsidiaries alleging injury as a result of exposure to
asbestos-containing products increases substantially, the costs associated with concluding
these claims, including damages resulting from any adverse verdicts, could have a material
adverse effect on its operating results, financial position and liquidity in future
periods.

In
October 2000, a vendor repudiated a long-term purchase agreement entered into with the
Company in January 2000. The Company filed suit against the vendor in November of fiscal
2000 to recover monetary damages. Based on consultation with the Company’s legal
counsel, management believed the purchase agreement was entered into in good faith and it
was highly probable that the Company would prevail in its suit. Therefore, the Company
recorded a gain of $3,300, which represented actual damages incurred through December 30,
2000, as a reduction of cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated statement of
operations for the year ended December 30, 2000. Related income taxes and legal fees of
$1,300 were also recorded in the accompanying consolidated statement of

F-27

operations for the
year ended December 30, 2000. During the first quarter of fiscal 2001, the Company reached
a settlement with this vendor and recorded a net gain of $8,300 as a reduction to cost of
sales in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December
29, 2001.

The
Company is also involved in various other claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course
of business. The damages claimed against the Company in some of these proceedings are
substantial. Although the final outcome of these legal matters cannot be determined, based
on the facts presently known, it is management’s opinion that the final outcome of
such claims and lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
financial position or results of operations.

The
Company is self-insured with respect to workers’ compensation and health care claims
for eligible active team members. In addition, the Company is self-insured for general and
automobile liability claims. The Company maintains certain levels of stop-loss insurance
coverage for these claims through an independent insurance provider. The cost of
self-insurance claims is accrued based on actual claims reported plus an estimate for
claims incurred but not reported. These estimates are based on historical information
along with certain assumptions about future events, and are subject to change as
additional information becomes available.

The
Company has entered into employment agreements with certain team members that provide
severance pay benefits under certain circumstances after a change in control of the
Company or upon termination of the team member by the Company. The maximum contingent
liability under these employment agreements is approximately $2,408 and $7,309 at January
3, 2004 and December 28, 2002 of which nothing has been accrued, respectively.

19.  
          Benefit Plans:

401(k) Plan

The
Company maintains a defined contribution team member benefit plan, which covers
substantially all team members after one year of service. The plan allows for team member
salary deferrals, which are matched at the Company’s discretion. Company
contributions were $6,398, $6,930 and $5,238 in fiscal 2003, fiscal 2002, and fiscal 2001.
All team members covered under the Discount plan were included in the Company’s plan
effective May 31, 2002.

The
Company also maintains a profit sharing plan covering Western team members that was frozen
prior to the Western Merger on November 2, 1998. This plan covered all full-time team
members who had completed one year of service and had attained the age of 21 on the first
day of each month. All team members covered under this plan were included in the
Company’s plan on January 3, 2004.

Deferred Compensation

During
third quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company established an unqualified deferred compensation
plan for certain team members. The Company has accounted for the unqualified deferred
compensation plan in accordance with EITF 97-14, “Accounting for Deferred
Compensation Arrangements Where Amounts Earned Are Held in a Rabbi Trust and
Invested.” The liability related to the former Discount deferred compensation plan,
which was terminated in May 2002, was merged into the new plan. This plan provides for a
minimum and maximum deferral percentage of the team member base salary and bonus, as
determined by the Retirement Plan Committee. The Company establishes and maintains a
deferred compensation liability for this plan. The Company funds this liability by
remitting the team members deferral to a Rabbi Trust. All gains and losses are held in the
Rabbi Trust to fund the deferred compensation liability. At January 3, 2004 and December
28, 2002 these liabilities were $1,011 and $863, respectively.

The
Company maintains an unfunded deferred compensation plan established for certain key team
members of Western prior to the fiscal 1998 Western merger. The Company assumed the plan
liability of $15,253 through the Western merger. The plan was frozen at the date of the
Western merger. As of January 3, 2004 and December 28, 2002, $2,409 and $2,998,
respectively, was accrued for these plans with the current portion included in accrued
expenses and the long-term portion in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets.

Postretirement Plan

The
Company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired team
members. Team members retiring from the Company with 20 consecutive years of service after
age 40 are eligible for these benefits, subject to deductibles, co-payment provisions and
other limitations. Effective December 2002, the Company amended its postretirement plan to
only include benefits for team members who are eligible at January 1, 2005. This negative
plan amendment also resulted in a curtailment gain of $2,939, which is being amortized
over 12 years consistent with the provisions of SFAS 106, “Employers Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions.”

The
estimated cost of retiree health and life insurance benefits is recognized over the years
that the team members render service as required by SFAS No. 106, “Employers
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions.” The initial accumulated
liability, measured as of January 1, 1995, the date the Company adopted SFAS No. 106, is
being recognized over a 20-year amortization period.

Other
financial information related to the plans was determined by the Company’s
independent actuaries as of January 3, 2004, December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001,
respectively. The following provides a reconciliation of the accrued benefit obligation

The
postretirement benefit obligation was computed using the following discount rates as determined by the
Company's actuaries as of January 1 of each applicable year.



Discount rate

6.25%

6.75%

The health care cost trend rate was assumed to be 15.0% for 2003,
14.0% for 2004, 12.5% for 2005, 11.5% for 2006, 10.0% for 2007, 9.5% for 2008 and 5.0% to
8.5% for 2009 and thereafter.

If
the health care cost were increased 1% for all future years the accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation would have increased by $2,588 as of January 3, 2004. The effect
of this change on the combined service and interest cost would have been an increase of
$153 for 2003. If the health care cost were decreased 1% for all future years the accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation would have decreased by $2,538 as of January 3, 2004. The effect of
this change on the combined service and interest cost would have been a decrease of $127
for 2003.

The
Company reserves the right to change or terminate the benefits or contributions at any
time. The Company also continues to evaluate ways in which it can better manage these
benefits and control costs. Any changes in the plan or revisions to assumptions that
affect the amount of expected future benefits may have a significant impact on the amount
of the reported obligation and annual expense.

20.  
          Stock Options:

The
Company maintains a senior executive stock option plan and an executive stock option plan,
or the Option Plans, for key team members of the Company. The Option Plans provide for the
granting of non-qualified stock options. All options terminate on the seventh anniversary
of the grant date. Shares authorized for grant under the senior executive and the
executive stock option plans are 3,420 and 7,200, respectively, at December 28, 2002.
Subsequent to January 3, 2004, the Company granted 1,188 fixed price options at an exercise
price of $39.31.

The
Company has historically maintained three types of option plans; Fixed Price Service
Options, or Fixed Options, Performance Options, or Performance Options, and Variable
Option plans, or Variable Options. The Fixed Options vest over a three-year period in
three equal installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date. During the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, the board of directors approved an amendment to the
Performance Options and the Variable Options. The amendment accelerated the vesting of the
Performance Options by removing the variable provisions under the plan and established a
fixed exercise price of $9.00 per share for the Variable Options. As a result of the
increase in the Company’s stock price and the above amendment, the Company recorded a
charge of $8,611 in fiscal 2001 to recognize the associated compensation expense.
Accordingly, all options under the above-mentioned plans are considered fixed for
accounting treatment under APB No. 25 as described below.

Additionally,
as a result of the Discount acquisition, the Company converted all outstanding stock
options of Discount with an exercise price greater than $7.50 per share to options to
purchase the Company’s common stock. The Company converted 1,150 options from the
executive stock option plan at a weighted-average exercise price of $19.45 per share.
These options will terminate on the tenth anniversary of the original option agreement
between Discount and the team member. The fair value of the 1,150 converted options to
purchase the Company’s common stock was included in the purchase price of Discount.

As
a result of the recapitalization in fiscal 1998, an existing stockholder received stock
options, referred to as other options, to purchase up to 1,000 shares of common stock. The
stock options are fully vested, nonforfeitable and provided for a $5.00 per share
exercise price, increasing $1.00 per share annually, through the expiration date of April
2005. The fair value of these options, as determined at the grant date were included in
the recapitalization in fiscal 1998 as consideration paid to the existing stockholder. The
other options were completely exercised during fiscal 2003.

Total
option activity was as follows:

For each of the Company’s option grants during fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company granted options
at prices consistent with the market price of its stock on each respective grant date.  Information related to
the Company’s options by range of exercise prices is as follows:

As
permitted under SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” the
Company accounts for its stock options using the intrinsic value method prescribed in
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

ADVANCE AUTO PARTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

January 3, 2004, December 28, 2002, and December 29, 2001

(in thousands, except per share data)

“Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees”, or APB No. 25. Under APB No. 25, compensation cost for stock options is
measured as the excess, if any, of the market price of the Company’s common stock at
the measurement date over the exercise price. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized
compensation expense on the issuance of its Fixed Options because the exercise price
equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date. The excess of the
fair market value per share over the exercise price per share for the Performance Options
and Variable Options, up to the above-mentioned amendment in December 2001, was recorded
as outstanding stock options in additional paid-in capital. The Company recorded
compensation expense related to the Performance Options and Variable Options of $11,735
(including the charge discussed above) in non-cash stock option compensation expense in
the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended

December 29, 2001. No compensation expense was required for the fiscal years ended January 3, 2004
and December 28, 2002.

During
fiscal 2002, the Company established an employee stock purchase plan under which all
eligible team members may purchase common stock at 85% of fair market value (determined
quarterly) through payroll deductions. There are annual limitations on team member
purchases of either $25,000 per team member or ten percent of compensation, whichever is
less. Under the plan, team members purchased 158 and 28 shares in fiscal years 2003 and
2002, respectively. In May 2002, the Company registered 700 shares with the Securities and
Exchange Commission to be issued under the plan.

21.  
          Fair Value of Financial Instruments:

The
carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, bank overdrafts, accounts
payable, borrowings secured by receivables and current portion of long-term debt
approximates fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments. The carrying
amount for variable rate long-term debt approximates fair value for similar issues
available to the Company. The fair value of all fixed rate long-term debt was determined
based on current market prices, which approximated $435,240 (carrying value of $402,733)
at December 28, 2002. There was no fixed rate long-term debt outstanding at January 3,
2004 as a result of the redemption completed in April 2003.

1.   Presentation

These
condensed financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and note disclosures normally
included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted pursuant
to those rules and regulations, although management believes that the disclosures made are
adequate to make the information presented not misleading.

2.   Organization

Advance
Auto Parts, Inc. “the Company” is a holding company, which was the 100%
shareholder of Advance Stores Company, Incorporated (“Stores”) and certain other
subsidiaries during the periods presented. The parent/subsidiary relationship between the
Company and its subsidiaries includes certain related party transactions. These
transactions consist primarily of interest on intercompany advances, dividends, capital
contributions and allocations of certain costs. Deferred income taxes have not been
provided for financial reporting and tax basis differences on the undistributed earnings
of the subsidiaries.

3.   Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements

In
April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, “Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44
and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13 and Technical Corrections.” As a result of
rescinding FASB Statement No. 4, “Reporting Gains Losses from Extinguishment of
Debt,” gains and losses from extinguishment of debt should be classified as
extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria in Accounting Principles Board, or APB,
Opinion No. 30, “Reporting the Results of Operations — Reporting the Effects of
Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring
Events and Transactions.” This statement also amends FASB Statement No. 13,
“Accounting for Leases,” to eliminate an inconsistency between the required
accounting for sale-leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease
modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale-leaseback transactions.
Additional amendments include changes to other existing authoritative pronouncements to
make various technical corrections, clarify meanings or describe their applicability under
changed conditions. The Company adopted SFAS No. 145 during the first quarter of fiscal
2003. For the fiscal years ended 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company recorded losses on the
extinguishment of debt of $7,025, $2,365 and $0, respectively.

Stock Split

On
October 29, 2003, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock split
of the Company’s common stock, effected as a 100% stock dividend. The dividend was
distributed on January 2, 2004 to holders of record as of December 11, 2003 and began
trading on a post-split basis on January 5, 2004. The accompanying condensed Parent
Company balance sheet and condensed Parent Company statements of operations reflect the
effect of the stock split for all years represented.

4.   Long-term Debt

The
Company redeemed all of its current outstanding senior discount debentures in April 2003
through funding provided by Stores.
