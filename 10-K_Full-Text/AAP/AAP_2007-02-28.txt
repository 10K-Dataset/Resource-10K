FORWARD-LOOKING

Certain
        statements in this report are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning
        of
        Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities
        Exchange Act of 1934, which are usually identified by the use of words such

        "forecasts," "plans," "intends," "should" or similar expressions. We intend
        those forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions
        for

Business.

Unless
        the context otherwise requires, “Advance,” “we,” “us,” “our,” and similar terms
        refer to Advance Auto Parts, Inc., its predecessor, its subsidiaries and
        their
        respective operations. Our fiscal year consists of 52 or 53 weeks ending
        on the
        Saturday closest to December 31 of each year. Fiscal 2003 included 53 weeks
        of
        operations. All other fiscal years presented included 52 weeks of
        operations.

Overview

We
        primarily operate within the United States automotive aftermarket industry,
        which includes replacement parts (excluding tires), accessories, maintenance
        items, batteries and automotive chemicals for cars and light trucks (pickup
        trucks, vans, minivans and sport utility vehicles).

We
        currently are the second largest specialty retailer of automotive parts,
        accessories and maintenance items to "do-it-yourself," or DIY, and
“do-it-for-me”, or DIFM, customers in the United States, based on store count
        and sales.

We
          were
          formed in 1929 as Advance Stores Company, Incorporated and operated as
          a
          retailer of general merchandise until the 1980s. During the 1980s, we sharpened
          our focus to target sales of automotive parts and accessories to DIY customers.
          From the 1980s to the present, we have grown significantly as a result
          of strong
          comparable store sales growth, new store openings and strategic acquisitions.

Since
          1996, we have aggressively expanded our sales to DIFM customers through
          our
          commercial delivery program.

The
          Company was incorporated in 2001 in conjunction with the acquisition of
          Discount
          Auto Parts, Inc., or Discount. More recently in 2005, we acquired Autopart
          International, Inc., or AI.

Our
        Internet address is

.
        We make
        available free of charge through our Internet website our annual reports
        on Form
        10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments
        to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act
        of
        1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such
        material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.

Operating
        Segments

We
        conduct our operations in two reportable segments: Advance Auto Parts, or
        AAP,
        and AI. The AAP segment is comprised of our store operations within the United
        States, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands which operate under the trade
        names
“Advance Auto Parts,” “Advance Discount Auto Parts” and “Western Auto.” The AI
        segment consists solely of the operations of Autopart International, which
        continues to operate as an independent, wholly-owned subsidiary.

AAP
        Segment

At
        December 30, 2006, we operated 2,995 stores within the United States, Puerto
        Rico and the Virgin Islands. We operated 2,958 stores throughout 40 states
        in
        the Northeastern, Southeastern and Midwestern regions of the United States.
        These stores operated under the “Advance Auto Parts” trade name except for
        certain stores in the state of Florida, which operated under the “Advance
        Discount Auto Parts” trade name. These stores offer a broad selection of brand
        name and proprietary automotive replacement parts, accessories and maintenance
        items for domestic and imported cars and light trucks, with no significant
        concentration in any specific product area. In addition, we operated 37 stores
        under the “Western Auto” and “Advance Auto Parts” trade names, located primarily
        in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The Western Auto stores offer automotive
        tires and service in addition to automotive parts, accessories and maintenance
        items.

Our
        retail stores are 100% company operated and are divided into geographic areas.
        A
        senior vice president, who is supported by five to six regional vice presidents,
        manages each area of retail stores. Division managers report to the

regional
        vice presidents and have direct responsibility for store operations in a
        specific division, which typically consists of 10 to 14 stores. Depending
        on
        store size and sales volume, each store is staffed by 10 to 20 team members
        under the leadership of a store manager. Our stores generally are open from
        7:30
        a.m. to 9:00 p.m. six days a week and 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. on Sundays and
        most
        holidays to meet the needs of our DIY and DIFM customers. We continue to
        increase the number of our stores which remain open until midnight or in
        some
        cases 24 hours per day.

Commercial
        Sales

In
        addition to the in-store customer service provided to our DIY customers,
        we also
        maintain a commercial sales team dedicated to the development of our commercial
        business and the support of our DIFM customers. Since 1996, we have aggressively
        expanded our sales to DIFM customers through our commercial delivery program.
        Sales to DIFM customers represented approximately 23% of our AAP sales in
        and consisted of sales to both walk-in commercial customers and sales delivered
        to our commercial customers’ place of business, including independent garages,
        service stations and auto dealers. At December 30, 2006, we had 2,439 AAP
        stores
        with commercial delivery programs, or 81% of total AAP stores.

A
        vice
        president has the responsibility of the strategic growth of the commercial
        program through the development of commercial programs and commercial marketing
        and merchandising initiatives with the continued focus on getting our DIFM
        customers to use us as their “first call” supplier. Additionally, each of our
        four area senior vice presidents has a director of commercial sales that
        concentrates solely on strategic and tactical commercial sales growth
        opportunities. Each director leads four to five area commercial sales managers.
        Division commercial sales managers report directly to our area commercial
        sales
        managers and, similar to our retail division managers, they are directly
        responsible for commercial sales and operations in each division. We also
        target
        DIFM customers through our commercial marketing efforts in all our retail
        stores, including those that do not offer a delivery service.

Store
        Systems

Our
        store
        based information systems, which are designed to improve the efficiency of
        our
        operations and enhance customer service, are comprised of proprietary
        point-of-sale, or POS, electronic parts catalog, or EPC, store-level inventory
        management and standard operating procedure, or SOP, systems. Additionally,
        we
        support our store-level operations with a proprietary labor scheduling system
        known as management planning and training, or MPT. These systems are tightly
        integrated and together provide real-time, comprehensive information to store
        and merchandising personnel, resulting in improved customer service levels,
        team
        member productivity and in-stock availability.

Point-of-Sale

.
          Our POS
          system, or APAL, is in all of our stores operating under the “Advance Auto
          Parts”, "Advance Discount Auto Parts” and “Western Auto” trade names.
          Information maintained by APAL is used to formulate pricing, marketing
          and
          merchandising strategies and to replenish inventory accurately and rapidly.
          APAL
          is designed to improve customer checkout time and decrease the time required
          to
          train newly hired team members. In addition, APAL provides additional customer
          purchase history, which may be used for customer demographic
          analysis.

Electronic
          Parts Catalog

.
          Our
          enhanced EPC system, which is fully integrated with APAL, is a software
          system
          that enables our store team members to identify millions of application
          uses for
          automotive parts and accessories. The EPC system enables store team members
          to
          assist our customers in their parts selection and ordering based on year,
          make,
          model and engine type of their vehicles. Our centrally based EPC data management
          system enables us to reduce the time needed to exchange data with our vendors
          and ultimately catalog and deliver updated, accurate product information.
          If a
          hard-to-find part or accessory is not available at one of our stores, the
          EPC
          system can determine whether the part is carried and in-stock through our
          PDQ

Ò

system. Available
          parts
          and accessories are then ordered electronically from another store, LAW,
          PDQ

Ò

or
          Master PDQ

Ò

with
          immediate confirmation of price, availability and estimated delivery
          time.

Our
        EPC
        system also contains enhanced search engines and user-friendly navigation
        tools
        that enhance our team members’ ability to look up any needed parts as well as
        additional products the customer needs to complete their automotive repair
        project. While we believe this generally leads to an increase in average
        sales
        per transaction, we believe these components will enhance our customers’
shopping experience with us and help them accurately complete the repair
        job the
        first time, saving them time and money. Additionally, information about a
        customer's automobile can be entered into a permanent customer database that
        can
        be accessed immediately whenever the customer visits or telephones one of
        our
        stores.

Store-Level
        Inventory Management System

.
        Our
        store-level inventory management system provides real-time inventory tracking
        at
        the store level. With the store-level system, store team members can check
        the
        quantity of on-hand inventory for any SKU, adjust stock levels for select
        items
        for store specific events, automatically process returns and defective
        merchandise, designate SKUs for cycle counts and track merchandise transfers.

Standard
        Operating Procedures.

Our
        SOP
        system is a web-based, electronic data management system that allows our
        team
        members instant and quick access to any of our standard operating procedures
        through a comprehensive on-line search function.

Store
        Support Center

Merchandising

Virtually
          all of our merchandise is selected and purchased for our stores by team
          members
          at our centralized store support center in Roanoke, Virginia. In 2006,
          we
          purchased merchandise from over 400 vendors, with no single vendor accounting
          for more than 6% of purchases. Our purchasing strategy involves negotiating
          multi-year agreements with certain vendors, which allows us to achieve
          more
          favorable terms and pricing.

Our
        merchandising team is currently led by a group of seven senior professionals,
        who have an average of 22 years of automotive purchasing experience and 27
        years
        in retail. The merchandising team is skilled in sourcing high quality products
        globally and maintaining consistent inventory levels. The merchandising team
        has
        developed strong vendor relationships in the industry and, in a collaborative
        effort with our vendor partners, utilizes a highly effective category management
        process. We believe this process, which develops a customer focused business
        plan for each merchandise category, improves comparable store sales, gross
        margin and inventory turns.

Our
          merchandising strategy is to carry a broad selection of high quality brand
          name
          automotive parts and accessories such as Bosch

          Castrol

          which
          generates DIY customer traffic and also appeals to commercial customers.
          In
          addition to these branded products, we stock a wide selection of high quality
          proprietary products that appeal to value conscious customers. These lines
          of
          merchandise include everything from chemical and wash-and-wax products
          to tools,
          batteries, parts and interior automotive accessories under the names of

Sales
        of
        replacement parts account for a majority of our net sales and typically generate
        higher gross margins than maintenance items or general accessories. We customize
        our replacement part mix based on a merchandising program designed to optimize
        inventory mix at each individual store. The custom assortment is based on
        that
        store's historical and projected sales mix coupled with regionally specific
        customer needs.

Supply
        Chain

Our
        supply chain consists of centralized inventory management and transportation
        functions which support a logistics network of distribution centers,
        PDQ

®

warehouses and stores. Our inventory management team utilizes a replenishment
        system, or E-3, to monitor the distribution center, PDQ

®

warehouse and store inventory levels and order additional product when
        appropriate while streamlining costs associated with the handling of that
        product. E-3 utilizes the most up-to-date information from our point-of-sale
        system as well as inventory movement forecasting based upon history, sales
        trends by SKU, seasonality and demographic shifts in demand. E-3 combines
        these
        factors with service level goals, vendor lead times and cost of inventory
        assumptions to determine the timing and size of purchase orders. A significant
        portion of our purchase orders are sent via electronic data interchange,
        with
        the remainder being sent by computer generated e-mail or facsimile.

Our
        transportation team utilizes a transportation management system for efficiently
        managing incoming shipments to the distribution centers and stores. Benefits
        from this system include reduced vendor to distribution center freight costs,
        visibility of purchase orders and shipments for the entire supply chain,
        a
        reduction in distribution center inventory, or safety stock, due to consistent
        transit times, decreased third party freight and billing service costs,
        decreased distribution center to store freight costs and higher store in-stock
        position.

We
        currently operate eight distribution centers. All of these distribution centers
        are equipped with our distribution management system, or DCMS. Our DCMS provides
        real-time inventory tracking through the processes of receiving, picking,
        shipping and replenishing at our distribution centers. The DCMS, integrated
        with


Table
            of Contents

technologically
          advanced material handling equipment,
          significantly reduces warehouse and distribution costs, while

improving
          efficiency. This equipment includes carousels, “pick-to light” systems, robotic
          picking, radio frequency technology, voice technology and automated sorting
          systems. Through the continued implementation of our supply chain initiatives
          we
          expect to further increase the efficient utilization of our distribution
          capacity. We believe our current capacity will allow us to support in excess
          of
          3,400 stores. Subsequent to December 30, 2006, the Company announced its
          plan to
          build a new distribution center in Indiana scheduled to open in mid-2008.

We
          currently offer over 58,000 SKUs to substantially support all of our retail
          stores via our 13 stand-alone PDQ® warehouses and/or our eight distribution
          centers (all of which stock PDQ

®

items).
          Stores have visibility to inventory in their respective facilities and
          can place
          orders to these facilities, or as an alternative, through an online ordering
          system to virtually any of the other facilities. Ordered parts are delivered
          to
          substantially all stores on a same day or next day basis through our dedicated
          PDQ

®

trucking
          fleet and third party carriers. Store inventories are replenished from
          our eight
          distribution centers. In addition, we operate a PDQ

®

warehouse that stocks over 50,000 incremental SKUs of harder-to-find automotive
          parts and accessories. This facility is known as the "Master PDQ

®

"
          warehouse and utilizes existing PDQ

®

distribution infrastructure and/or third party arrangements to provide
          next day
          service to substantially all of our stores.

Advertising

We
          have
          an extensive advertising program designed to communicate our merchandise
          offerings, product assortment, competitive prices, free services and commitment
          to customer service. The program is focused on establishing Advance Auto
          Parts
          as the solution for a customer's automotive needs. We utilize a mix of
          media
          that reinforces our brand image, including television, radio, print, promotional
          signage and outdoor media, plus our proprietary in-store television network
          and
          internet site.

Our
          advertising plan is a brand-building program built around television and
          radio
          advertising. The plan is supported by print and in-store signage. Our television
          advertising is a combination of national and regional media in both sports
          and
          entertainment programming. Radio advertising, which is used as a supplementary
          medium, generally airs during peak drive times. We also sponsor sporting
          events,
          racing teams and other events at all levels in a grass-roots effort to
          positively impact individual communities, including Hispanic and other
          ethnic
          communities, to create awareness and drive traffic for our stores.

Since
          early 2003, we supported our new advertising campaign, “We’re ready in Advance”
throughout all of our media. We believe this advertising campaign differentiates
          Advance Auto Parts in the customer’s mind by positioning us as both a source for
          brand name auto parts and accessories at low prices and as a resource for
          expert
          advice and useful tips to help customers keep their vehicles running smoothly.
          The campaign includes creative and compelling television and radio commercials
          designed to drive sales and build an enduring, positive image of Advance
          Auto
          Parts as a special place to shop.

Since
          2004, we have built upon the campaign through an integrated consumer education
          program. This program is intended to build our image as not only the source
          for
          product, but also the best resource for vehicle maintenance information.
          Our
          free brochure kiosk displaying "We're ready with answers" and our free
          monthly
          video clinic broadcasts on Advance TV, our exclusive in-store how-to network,
          are just two elements of this growing program. We believe we will differentiate
          our stores from our competitors' by providing our customers valuable information
          regarding "why-to" and "how-to" perform regular maintenance on their vehicles,
          in order to enhance their vehicles' performance, reliability, safety and
          appearance. Our goal with this initiative is to continue our long-term
          brand
          building success, increase customer loyalty and expand our customer
          base.

AI
          Segment

We
          acquired AI in September 2005. The acquisition, which included 61 stores
          throughout New England and New York, a distribution center and AI’s wholesale
          distribution business, complements our growing presence in the DIFM market
          in
          the Northeast.

AI’s
          business primarily serves the commercial market from its store locations.
          In
          addition, its North American  Sales Division services warehouse
          distributors and jobbers throughout North America. We believe AI provides
          a


Table
              of Contents

high
          level of service to its commercial customers by providing quality parts,
          unsurpassed customer service and efficient parts delivery. As a result
          of its
          extensive sourcing network, AI is able to serve its customers in search
          of
          replacement parts for both domestic and imported cars and light trucks
          with a
          greater focus on imported parts. The vast majority of AI’s product is sold under
          it proprietary brand. The AI stores offer an average of 9,500

SKUs
          with access to an additional 14,000

unique
          SKUs through its logistics network.

At
          December 30, 2006, we operated 87 stores under the “Autopart International”
trade name in the following states throughout the Northeast:

                            the 62 new stores in 2005, 61 stores were acquired in
                            September 2005 as a
                            result of our AI acquisition

.

Seasonality

Our
          business is somewhat seasonal in nature, with the highest sales occurring
          in the
          spring and summer months. In addition, our business can be affected by
          weather
          conditions. While unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as
          elective maintenance is deferred during such periods, extremely hot or
          cold
          weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail at an
          accelerated rate.

Team
          Members

At
          February 26, 2007, we employed 25,489

full-time team members and 18,283

part-time team members. Our workforce consisted of 87

%
          of our
          team members employed in store-level operations, 9

%
          employed in distribution and 4

%
          employed in our corporate offices. We have never experienced any labor
          disruption and are not party to any collective bargaining agreements. We
          believe
          that our team member relations are good.

We
          allocate substantial resources to the recruiting, training and retention
          of team
          members. Our performance management process allows us to align each team
          member’s goals with our corporate strategic goals. We believe this program
          provides us with a well-trained, productive workforce that is committed
          to high
          levels of customer service and assures a qualified team to support future
          growth.

Trade
          Names, Service Marks and Trademarks

We
          own a
          number of trade names and own and have federally registered several service
          marks and trademarks, including “Advance Auto Parts,” “Western Auto,” “Parts
          America,” “Autopart International” and “PDQ” for use in connection with the
          automotive parts retailing business. In addition, we own and have registered
          a
          number of trademarks for our proprietary products. We believe that these
          trade
          names, service marks and trademarks are important to our merchandising
          strategy.
          We do not know of any infringing uses that would materially affect the
          use of
          these trade names and marks, and we actively defend and enforce
          them.

Competition

Our
        primary competitors are both national and regional retail chains of automotive
        parts stores, including AutoZone, Inc., O'Reilly Automotive, Inc., CSK Auto
        Corporation and The Pep Boys-Manny, Moe & Jack, discount stores and mass
        merchandisers that carry automotive products, wholesalers or jobber stores,
        including those associated with national parts distributors or associations,
        such as NAPA and Carquest, independent operators and automobile dealers that
        supply parts. We believe that chains of automotive parts stores that, like
        us,
        have multiple locations in one or more markets, have competitive advantages
        in
        customer service, marketing, inventory selection, purchasing and distribution
        as
        compared to independent retailers and jobbers that are not part of a chain
        or
        associated with other retailers or jobbers. The principal competitive factors
        that affect our business include store location, availability, customer service
        and product offerings, quality and price.

Environmental
        Matters

We
        are
        subject to various federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations
        relating to the operation of our business, including those governing recycling
        of batteries and used lubricants, and regarding ownership and operation of
        real
        property. We handle hazardous materials as part of our operations, and our
        customers may also use hazardous materials on our properties or bring hazardous
        materials or used oil onto our properties. We currently provide collection
        and
        recycling programs for used automotive batteries and used lubricants at all
        of
        our stores as a service to our customers. Pursuant to agreements with third
        party vendors, used batteries and lubricants are collected by our team members,
        deposited into vendor supplied containers or pallets and stored by us until
        collected by the third party vendors for recycling or proper disposal. Persons
        who arrange for the disposal, treatment or other handling of hazardous or
        toxic
        substances may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation at any affected
        disposal, treatment or other site affected by such substances.

We
        own
        and lease real property. Under various environmental laws and regulations,
        a
        current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for
        the
        cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under
        or in
        such property. These laws often impose joint and several liability and may
        be
        imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was
        responsible for, the release of such hazardous or toxic substances. Other
        environmental laws and common law principles also could be used to impose
        liability for releases of hazardous materials into the environment or work
        place, and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real
        properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure
        to
        released hazardous substances. From time to time, we receive notices from
        the
        Environmental Protection Agency and state environmental authorities indicating
        that there may be contamination on properties we own, lease or operate or
        may
        have owned, leased or operated in the past or on adjacent properties for
        which
        we may be responsible. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not
        had a
        material impact on our operations to date.

Growth
        Strategy

Our
        growth strategies consist of the following:

Increase
        Our Average Sales per Store

.
        In
        2006, our average sales per AAP store reached an industry leading level of
        $1.55
        million per store. We plan to continue increasing our average sales per store
        by, among other things: (1) improving store execution with a focus on customer
        service; (2) execution of our category management program; (3) continued
        maturation of our sales initiatives for our DIY customers including local
        purchase ordering, factory direct ordering, salvage body parts and our custom
        mix (store specific merchandise assortment); (4) the implementation of our
        store remodeling program, with now more than 65% of our chain remodeled and
        targeting a total of 150 AAP stores to be remodeled annually; (5) consistent
        growth and execution of our commercial program, including optimization of
        delivery vehicles; (6) enhanced merchandising and marketing programs and
        (7)
        focus on making our supply chain more responsive.

Expand
        Our Operating Margin.

In
        addition to driving operating margin expansion through increased average
        sales
        per store and continued comparable store sales growth, we will continue to
        focus
        on increasing margins by: (1) improving our purchasing efficiencies with
        vendors; (2) utilizing our supply chain infrastructure and existing distribution
        network to optimize our inventory mix and maximize distribution capacity;
        (3)
        controlling our operating


Table
            of Contents

expenses,
        including an examination of both corporate and store-level and (4) continuing
        to
        implement our category management and custom mix initiatives and increase
        direct
        importing, including the expansion of our private label and proprietary brands
        in our AAP stores.

Increase
          Free Cash Flow.

We
          have
          generated free cash flow over the last five years. Our strategy is to invest
          back into our business to drive further progress towards our four financial
          goals. We look to deploy additional cash in the most optimal way to increase
          shareholder value, which has included stock repurchases and selective
          acquisitions and more recently cash dividends.

Increase
            Return on Invested Capital.

We
            believe we can increase our return on invested capital by increasing
            our average
            sales per store and our margins. We believe we can also increase our
            return on
            invested capital by leveraging our supply chain initiatives to increase
            sales
            faster than inventory growth, implementing a lower cost store remodel
            program
            and selectively expanding our store base primarily in existing markets.
            Based on
            our experience, such in-market openings provide higher returns on our
            invested
            capital by enabling us to leverage our distribution infrastructure, marketing
            expenditures and local management resources. We intend to open 200 to
            210 AAP
            and AI stores primarily in existing markets in 2007.

Industry

The
            United States automotive aftermarket industry is generally grouped into
            two
            major categories: DIY and DIFM. According to the Automotive Aftermarket
            Industry
            Association, or AAIA, the DIY category represents an approximate $35
            billion
            market with sales to consumers who maintain and repair vehicles themselves.
            Per
            the AAIA, the DIFM category represents an approximate $75 billion market
            with
            sales to professional installers, such as independent garages, service
            stations
            and auto dealers. DIFM parts and services are typically offered to vehicle
            owners who are less inclined to repair their vehicles themselves. The
            DIFM
            category includes an approximate $36 billion market which includes dealer
            purchases directly from the original equipment manufacturers.

We
          believe the United States automotive aftermarket industry will benefit
          from
          several favorable trends, including the:

·

increasing
                      number and age of vehicles in the United States, increasing
                      number of
                      miles driven annually, and increasing number of cars coming
                      off of
                      warranty, particularly previously leased vehicles;

·

higher
                      cost of replacement parts as a result of technological changes
                      in recent
                      models of vehicles and increasing number of light trucks and
                      sport utility
                      vehicles that require more expensive parts, resulting in higher
                      average
                      sales per customer;

·

continued
                        consolidation of automotive aftermarket
                        retailers;

·

move
                        to higher priced premium parts, which offer enhanced features,
                        benefits
                        and/or warranties; and

·

market
                        share growth opportunities for specialty retailers relative
                        to other
                        channels selling similar
                        merchandise.

Item
            1A. Risk Factors.

Risks
          Relating to Our Business

We
          may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy, including
          increasing comparable store sales, enhancing our margins and increasing
          our
          return on invested capital, which could adversely affect our business,
          financial
          condition and results of operations.

We
          have
          implemented numerous initiatives to increase comparable store sales, enhance
          our
          margins and increase our return on invested capital in order to increase
          our
          earnings and cash flow. If these initiatives are unsuccessful, or if we
          are
          unable to implement the initiatives efficiently and effectively, our business,
          financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Successful
          implementation of our business strategy also depends on factors specific
          to the
          retail automotive parts industry and numerous other factors that may be
          beyond
          our control. Adverse changes in the following factors


Table
              of Contents

could
        undermine our business strategy:

·

general
                        economic conditions and conditions in our local markets,
                        which could
                        reduce our sales;

·

the
                          competitive environment in the automotive aftermarket parts
                          and
                          accessories retail sector that may force us to reduce prices
                          beyond our
                          normal control or increase promotional spending;

·

changes
                            in the automotive aftermarket parts manufacturing industry,
                            such as
                            consolidation, which may disrupt or sever one or more
                            of our vendor
                            relationships;

·

our
                            ability to anticipate and meet changes in consumer preferences
                            for
                            automotive products, accessories and services in a timely
                            manner;
                            and

·

our
                        continued ability to hire and retain qualified personnel,
                        which depends in
                        part on the types of recruiting, training, compensation and
                        benefit
                        programs we adopt or
                        maintain.

We
          will not be able to expand our business if our growth strategy is not
          successful, which could negatively impact our financial results.

We
          have
          increased our store count significantly from 1,567 stores at the end of
          1998 to
          3,082 stores at December 30, 2006. We intend to continue to expand our
          base of
          stores as part of our growth strategy, primarily by opening new stores.
          There
          can be no assurance that the implementation of this strategy will be successful.
          The actual number of new stores to be opened and their success will depend
          on a
          number of factors, including, among other things:

·

our
                              ability to manage the expansion and hire, train and
                              retain qualified sales
                              associates;

·

the
                              availability of potential store locations in highly
                              visible,
                              well-trafficked areas; and

·

the
                                negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms
                                for new
                                locations.

There
          can
          be no assurance that we will be able to open and operate new stores on
          a timely
          or sufficiently profitable basis or that opening new stores in markets
          we
          already serve will not harm existing store profitability or comparable
          store
          sales. The newly opened and existing stores' profitability will depend
          on our
          ability to properly merchandise, market and price the products required
          in their
          respective markets.

Furthermore,
          we may acquire stores or businesses from, make investments in, or enter
          into
          strategic alliances with, companies that have stores or distribution networks
          in
          our current markets or in areas into which we intend to expand our presence.
          Any
          future acquisitions, investments, strategic alliances or related efforts
          will be
          accompanied by risks, including:

·

the
                        difficulty of identifying appropriate strategic partners
                        or acquisition
                        candidates;

·

the
                          difficulty of assimilating and integrating the operations
                          of the
                          respective entities;

·

the
                            potential disruption to our ongoing business and diversion
                            of our
                            management's attention;

·

the
                            inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures
                            and
                            policies; and

·

the
                            impairment of relationships with team members and customers
                            as a result of
                            changes in management.

We
          cannot
          assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any
          other
          problems encountered with these acquisitions, investments, strategic alliances
          or related efforts.

If
          overall demand for products sold by our stores slows, our business, financial
          condition and results of operations will suffer.

Overall
          demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may
          slow for
          any number of reasons, including:

·

the
                            weather, as vehicle maintenance may be deferred during
                            periods of
                            unfavorable weather;

·

the
                              economy, as during periods of good economic conditions,
                              more of our DIY
                              customers may pay others to repair and maintain their
                              cars instead of
                              working on their own cars. In periods of declining
                              economic conditions,
                              both DIY and DIFM customers may defer vehicle maintenance
                              or repair;
                              and

·

the
                                decline of the average age of vehicles, miles driven
                                or number of cars on
                                the road may result in
                                a


Table
              of Contents

reduction
                                    in the demand for our product
                                    offerings.

If
            any of
            these factors cause overall demand for the products we sell to decline,
            our
            business, financial condition and results of operations will suffer.

We
            depend on the services of many qualified team members and may not be
            able to
            attract and retain such qualified team members.

Our
            success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and
            experience
            of our many team members. At February 26

,
            2007,
            we employed 43,772

team
            members. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our current
            qualified team members as well as attract and retain additional qualified
            team
            members that may be needed in the future. Our ability to maintain an
            adequate
            number of qualified team members is highly dependent on an attractive
            and
            competitive compensation and benefits package. If we fail to maintain
            such a
            package, our customer service and execution levels could suffer by reason
            of a
            declining quality of our workforce, which could adversely affect our
            financial
            condition and results of operations.

If
            we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the
            automotive
            aftermarket industry, we could lose customers and our revenues may decline.

The
              sale
              of automotive parts, accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive
              in
              many ways, including location, price, name recognition and customer
              service. We
              compete in both the DIY and DIFM categories of the automotive aftermarket
              industry, and primarily with national and regional retail automotive
              parts
              chains, discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive
              products,
              wholesalers or jobber stores, independent operators and automobile
              dealers that
              supply parts. These competitors and the level of competition vary by
              market.
              Some of our competitors may possess advantages over us in certain markets
              we
              share, including a greater amount of marketing activities, a larger
              number of
              stores, longer operating histories, greater name recognition or larger
              and more
              established customer bases. Our response to these competitive disadvantages
              may
              require us to reduce our prices beyond our normal control or increase
              our
              promotional spending, which would lower revenue and profitability.
              Competitive
              disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines
              or require
              us to discontinue current product offerings or change some of our current
              operating strategies. If we do not have the resources or expertise
              or otherwise
              fail to develop successful strategies to address these competitive
              disadvantages, we could lose customers and our revenues may decline.

Disruptions
            in our relationships with vendors or in our vendors' operations could
            increase
            our cost of goods sold.

Our
            business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with
            our
            vendors and upon the vendors' ability or willingness to sell quality
            products to
            us at favorable prices and terms. Many factors outside of our control
            may harm
            these relationships and the ability or willingness of these vendors to
            sell us
            products on favorable terms. For example, financial or operational difficulties
            that some of our vendors may face may increase the cost of the products
            we
            purchase from them or the ability for us to source product from them.
            In
            addition, the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers
            may
            disrupt or end our relationship with some vendors, and could lead to
            less
            competition and, consequently, higher prices.

Because
            we are involved in litigation from time to time, and are subject to numerous
            laws and governmental regulations, we could incur substantial judgments,
            fines,
            legal fees and other costs.

We
            are
            sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers, employees
            or
            other third parties for various actions. From time to time, we are involved
            in
            litigation involving claims related to, among other things, breach of
            contract,
            tortious conduct, employment discrimination, asbestos exposure, real
            estate
            matters and product defects. The damages sought against us in some of
            these
            litigation proceedings are substantial. Although we maintain liability
            insurance
            for some litigation claims, if one or more of the claims greatly exceeds
            our
            coverage limits or our insurance policies do not cover a claim, it could
            have a
            material adverse affect on our business and operating results.

                of Contents

Additionally,
              we are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and governmental
              regulations relating to employment matters, environmental protection
              and
              building and zoning requirements. If we fail to comply with

existing or
              future laws or regulations, we may be subject to governmental or judicial
              fines
              or sanctions. In addition, our capital expenses could increase due
              to
              remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant
              with any existing or future laws or regulations.

Risks
            Relating to Our Financial Condition

The
            covenants governing our revolving credit facility impose restrictions
            on us.

The
            terms
            of our revolving credit facility impose operating and financial restrictions
            on
            us and our subsidiaries and require us to meet certain financial tests.
            These
            restrictions may also have a negative impact on our business, financial
            condition and results of operations by significantly limiting or prohibiting
            us
            from engaging in certain transactions, including:

·

incurring
                            or guaranteeing additional indebtedness;

·

making
                              capital expenditures and other investments;

·

incurring
                                liens on our assets and engaging in sale-leaseback
                                transactions;

·

issuing
                                or selling capital stock of our subsidiaries;

·

transferring
                                or selling assets currently held by us;

·

engaging
                          in transactions with affiliates;

·

entering
                          into any agreements that restrict dividends from our subsidiaries;
                          and

·

engaging
                          in mergers or acquisitions.

The
            failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under
            our
            revolving credit facility. Furthermore, our revolving credit facility
            contains
            certain financial covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio and a
            minimum
            coverage ratio, which, if not maintained by us, will cause us to be in
            default
            under our revolving credit facility. Any of these defaults, if not waived,
            could
            result in the acceleration of all of our debt, in which case the debt
            would
            become immediately due and payable. If this occurs, we may not be able
            to repay
            our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if new financing
            were
            available, it may be on terms that are less favorable or otherwise not
            acceptable to us.

Legal
          Proceedings.

We
        currently and from time to time are involved in litigation incidental to
        the
        conduct of our business, including litigation arising from claims of employment
        discrimination or other types of employment matters as a result of claims
        by
        current and former employees. Although we diligently defend against these
        claims, we may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these and other
        lawsuits, and may enter into settlement agreements, if we believe settlement
        is
        in the best interests of our shareholders. The damages claimed against us
        in
        some of these proceedings are substantial. Although the amount of liability
        that
        may result from these matters cannot be ascertained, we do not currently
        believe
        that, in the aggregate, they will result in liabilities material to our
        consolidated financial condition, future results of operations or cash flow.

Our
        Western Auto subsidiary, together with other defendants including automobile
        manufacturers, automotive parts manufacturers and other retailers, has been
        named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging injury as a result of exposure
        to
        asbestos-containing products. We and some of our other subsidiaries also
        have
        been named as defendants in many of these lawsuits. The plaintiffs have alleged
        that these products were manufactured, distributed and/or sold by the various
        defendants. To date, these products have included brake and clutch parts
        and
        roofing materials. Many of the cases pending against us or our subsidiaries
        are
        in the early stages of litigation. The damages claimed against the defendants
        in
        some of these proceedings are substantial. Additionally, some of the automotive
        parts manufacturers named as defendants in these lawsuits have declared
        bankruptcy, which will limit plaintiffs’ ability to recover monetary damages
        from those defendants. Although we diligently defend against these claims,
        we
        may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these and other lawsuits,
        and
        may enter into settlement agreements, if we believe settlement is in the
        best
        interests of our shareholders. We also believe that most of these claims
        are at
        least partially covered by insurance. Based on discovery to date, we do not
        believe the cases currently pending will have a material adverse effect on
        us.
        However, if we were to incur an adverse verdict in one or more of these claims
        and were ordered to pay damages that were not covered by insurance, these
        claims
        could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial
        position and liquidity. If the number of claims filed against us or any of
        our
        subsidiaries alleging injury as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing
        products increases substantially, the costs associated with concluding these
        claims, including damages resulting from any adverse verdicts, could have
        a
        material adverse effect on our operating results, financial position and
        liquidity in future periods.

The
            closing price of our common stock on February 26, 2007 was $38.73. The
            table
            gives effect to our three-for-two stock split effectuated in the form
            of a 50%
            stock dividend distributed on September 23, 2005, as trading began on
            a
            post-split basis on September 26, 2005. At February 26, 2007, there were
            holders of record of our common stock.

On
            February 15, 2006, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend,
            the first in our history. The $0.06 per share quarterly cash dividend
            has been
            declared in each quarter of fiscal 2006. Any payments of dividends in

            consolidated financial and other data at December 30, 2006 and December
            31, 2005
            and for the three years ended December 30, 2006 have been derived from

            years
            ended January 3, 2004 and December 28, 2002 have been derived from our

                    or 53 weeks
                    ending on the Saturday nearest to December 31. All fiscal years
                    presented
                    are 52 weeks, with the exception of 2003, which consists of 53
                    weeks.

The
                      statement of operations data for each of the years presented
                      reflects the

                    to be
                    closed at December 29, 2001 as a result of the Discount

Basic and diluted shares outstanding
                    for each
                    of the years presented gives effect to a 3-for-2 stock split
                    effectuated
                    by us in the form of a 50% stock dividend distributed on September
                    23,
                    2005 and a 2-for-1 stock split effectuated by us in the form
                    of a 100%
                    stock dividend distributed on January 2, 2004.

Inventory
                      turnover is calculated as cost of sales divided by the average
                      of
                      beginning and ending inventories. The fiscal 2003 cost of sales
                      excludes
                      the effect of the 53

rd

week in the amount of $34.3 million.

(8)

Inventory per store is calculated
                    as ending
                    inventory divided by ending store count. For fiscal 2003, ending
                    inventory
                    used in this calculation excludes certain inventory related to
                    the
                    wholesale distribution segment. The wholesales distribution segment,
                    which
                    was discontinued in fiscal 2003,

consisted of independently owned and operated dealer locations,
                    for which
                    the Company supplied merchandise inventory.

(9)

Accounts
                      payable to inventory ratio is calculated as ending accounts
                      payable
                      divided by ending inventory. Beginning in fiscal 2004, as a
                      result of our
                      new vendor financing program, we aggregate financed vendor
                      accounts
                      payable with accounts payable to calculate our accounts payable
                      to
                      inventory ratio.

(10)

Net
                      working capital is calculated by subtracting current liabilities
                      from
                      current assets.

(11)

Net
                      debt includes total debt and bank overdrafts, less cash and
                      cash
                      equivalents.

Comparable store sales is calculated
                    based on
                    the change in net sales starting once a store has been open for
                    complete accounting periods (each period represents four weeks).
                    Relocations are included in comparable


Table

                      sales from the original date of opening. We do not include
                      net sales from
                      the 37 Western Auto retail stores in our comparable store calculation
                      as a
                      result of their unique product offerings, including automotive
                      service and
                      tires.

We
                      also exclude the net sales from the AI stores from our comparable
                      store
                      sales.

In
                      2003, the comparable store sales calculation included sales
                      from our

rd

week compared to our first week of operation in 2003 (the comparable
                      calendar week). In 2004, as a result of the 53

rd

week in 2003, the comparable store sales calculation excluded
                      week one of
                      sales from 2003.

(13)

Closed
                      stores in 2002 include 133 stores closed as part of the integration
                      of the
                      Discount operations.

Total
                      store square footage excludes the square footage of the stores

(15)

Average
                      net sales per store is calculated as net sales divided by the
                      average of
                      beginning and ending number of stores for the respective period.
                      The
                      fiscal 2006 and 2005 calculation excludes the net sales and
                      stores from
                      the AI segment. The fiscal 2003 net sales exclude the effect
                      of the

rd

week in the amount of $63.0 million.

(16)

Average
                      net sales per square foot is calculated as net sales divided
                      by the
                      average of the beginning and ending total store square footage
                      for the
                      respective period. The fiscal 2006 and 2005 calculation excludes
                      the net
                      sales and square footage from the AI segment. The fiscal 2003
                      net sales
                      exclude the effect of the 53

The

            such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results
            and

            this report.

Our
              fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest December 31 of each year,
              which results
              in an extra week every six years (our next 53-week fiscal year is 2009).
              Our
              first quarter consists of 16 weeks, and the other three quarters consist
              of 12
              weeks.

Introduction

We
            primarily operate within the United States automotive aftermarket industry,
            which includes replacement parts (excluding tires), accessories, maintenance
            items, batteries and automotive chemicals for cars and light trucks (pickup
            trucks, vans, minivans and sport utility vehicles). We currently are
            the second
            largest specialty retailer of automotive parts, accessories and maintenance
            items to “do-it-yourself,” or DIY, customers in the United States, based on
            store count and sales. At December 30, 2006, we operated 3,082 stores
            throughout
            40 states.

We
            operate in two reportable segments: Advance Auto Parts, or AAP, and Autopart
            International, or AI. The AAP segment is comprised of our store operations
            within the United States, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands which operate
            under
            the trade names “Advance Auto Parts,” “Discount Advance Auto Parts” and “Western
            Auto.” At December 30, 2006, we operated 2,995 stores in the AAP segment, of
            which 2,958 stores operated under the trade names “Advance Auto Parts” and
“Discount Advance Auto Parts” throughout 40 states in the Northeastern,
            Southeastern and Midwestern regions of the United States. These stores
            offer
            automotive replacement parts, accessories and maintenance items, with
            no
            significant concentration in any specific product area. In addition,
            we operated
            37 stores under the “Western Auto” and “Advance Auto Parts” trade names, located
            primarily in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The Western Auto stores
            offer
            automotive tires and service in addition to automotive parts, accessories
            and
            maintenance items.

At
            December 30, 2006, we operated 87 stores in the AI segment under the
“Autopart
            International” trade name. We acquired AI in September 2005, and AI operates as
            an independent, wholly-owned subsidiary. AI’s business primarily serves the
            commercial market from its store locations. In addition, its North American
            Sales Division services warehouse distributors and jobbers throughout
            North
            America.

The
            following table sets forth the total number of new, closed and relocated
            stores
            and stores with commercial delivery programs during fiscal 2006, 2005
            and 2004.
            We lease approximately 80% of our stores.

Management
              Overview

W

e
                recorded earnings per diluted share of $2.16 in fiscal 2006 compared
                to $2.13
                for fiscal 2005. These results were primarily driven by increased
                sales and
                higher gross margin dollars offset by an increase in certain fixed
                operating
                expenses. Although sales did not meet our expectation for 2006, our
                average
                sales per store did reach the industry leading level of $1.55 million
                per store.
                Additionally, our operating results for fiscal 2006 include the recognition
                of
                $0.11 of share-based compensation expense per diluted share required
                by the
                adoption of

Statement
                of Financial Accounting Standard, or SFAS,

No.
                (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment," or SFAS No. 123R, on January
                1,
                2006.

We
              believe the macroeconomic environment negatively impacted our business
              throughout much of 2006 and resulted in weakening trends in our 2006
              results
              compared to 2005. We believe our customers have been adversely impacted
              by
              rising energy prices, higher insurance and interest rates, and larger
              required
              minimum payments on their credit card balances, which limit their current
              ability to spend.

We
              have
              established a high priority of examining our operating expenses, including
              both
              corporate and store-level, in light of our sales trends. We believe
              we can
              continue to be more efficient in our corporate-level expenses by optimizing
              a
              number of job functions, examining discretionary expenses and re-evaluating
              all
              third party service providers. Second, we continue to examine our non-sales
              activities in our stores and the impact of those activities on our
              operating
              expenses due to the exponential impact that small changes can have
              on a large
              chain of stores such as rolling out energy-management systems to a
              significant
              number of our stores. In addition, we are evaluating a number of administrative
              procedures performed by our store team members in an effort to better
              optimize
              their time.

We
              believe our 2006 results do reflect the progress made on the following
              key
              initiatives that focus specifically on driving higher sales per
              store:

·

Improving
                                store execution with a focus on customer
                                service;

                                          importing;

·

Continued
                                    implementation of our 2010 store remodeling program
                                    at a more selective
                                    pace now that more than 65% of our chain has
                                    been
                                    remodeled;

·

Our
                                      focus on making our supply chain more responsive
                                      and improving our
                                      in-stock position;

·

Consistent
                            growth and execution of our commercial program, including
                            the optimization
                            of delivery vehicles;

                            focus on recruiting, training and retaining high-performing
                            team members,
                            especially those who are ASE certified and/or bilingual;
                            and

·

Enhanced
                            merchandising and marketing
                            programs.

Additionally,
              we

believe
              the factors that favorably impact our industry continue to remain strong.
              Customers can only defer necessary maintenance on their automobiles
              for so long,
              and we continue to educate customers about the value of performing
              certain types
              of maintenance and enhancements. Government data recently revealed
              that
              consumers are driving their automobiles more, which leads to a greater
              need for
              maintenance. The growing population of light trucks and sport utility
              vehicles
              are also beginning to hit the average age where we believe they will
              need
              certain repairs, including overall more expensive, replacement parts.

We
              believe the combination of these favorable industry dynamics along
              with the
              continued execution of our key business initiatives along with our
              more recent
              effort to examine operating expenses will allow us to achieve each
              of the
              following g

oals:

1.

Raising
                          average sales per store;

2.

Expanding
                          operating margin;

3.

Increasing
                          free cash flow; and

4.

Increasing
                          return on invested capital.

Key
              2006 Milestones

The
              following key milestones occurred during 2006:

·

We
                                  opened our 3,000

th

store;

·

In
                                    the AAP segment, we surpassed the $1 billion
                                    mark in commercial
                                    sales;


Table
                    of Contents

·

We
                                        completed the refinancing of our previous
                                        secured credit facility to an
                                        unsecured revolving credit

facility;
                                        and

·

On
                                        February 15, 2006, our Board of Directors
                                        declared a quarterly cash
                                        dividend, the first in our
                                        history.

Refinancing

On
              October 5, 2006, we entered into a new $750 million unsecured five-year
              revolving credit facility. This new facility replaced the term loans
              and
              revolver under our previous secured credit facility. Initial proceeds
              from this
              revolving loan were used to repay $434 million of principal outstanding
              on the
              term loans and revolver under our previous credit facility. As a result of
              the improved borrowing costs under the new facility, we anticipate
              pre-tax
              interest expense savings of more than $2.5 million annually. In conjunction
              with
              this refinancing, we wrote-off existing deferred financing costs related
              to our
              previous term loans and revolver. The write-off of these costs of $1.9
              million
              was combined with a related gain on settlement of interest rate swaps
              of $2.9
              million for a net gain on extinguishment of debt of $1.0 million.

Stock
              Repurchase Program

During
              fiscal 2006, we repurchased 3.7 million shares of common stock at an
              aggregate
              cost of $136.6 million, or an average price of $37.12 per share, excluding
              related expenses. Our stock repurchase program, as authorized by our
              Board of
              Directors in fiscal 2005, authorizes us to repurchase up to $300 million
              of our
              common stock plus related expenses. The program allows us to repurchase
              our
              common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions
              from
              time to time in accordance with the requirements of the Securities
              and Exchange
              Commission.

As
              of
              December 30, 2006, we had $104.0 million, excluding related expenses,
              remaining
              for future stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program.

Commercial
              Program

As
              indicated in the preceding operating results table, our commercial
              program
              produced solid revenues in our AAP stores during fiscal 2006. We attribute
              this
              performance to the execution of our commercial plan, which consists
              of:

·

Targeting
                                    commercial customers with a hard parts
                                    focus;

·

Targeting
                                        commercial customers who need access to a
                                        wide selection of
                                        inventory;

·

Moving
                                      inventory closer to our commercial customers
                                      to ensure quicker
                                      deliveries;

·

Growing
                            our market share of the commercial market through internal
                            growth and
                            selected acquisitions;

·

Providing trained parts
                          experts to assist
                          commercial customers’ merchandise selections;

·

Shifting
                            commercial delivery vehicles or other commercial resources
                            to store
                            locations where they can be most productive; and

·

Providing
                            credit solutions to our commercial customers through
                            our commercial credit
                            program.

Commercial
              sales represented approximately 25% of our consolidated total sales
              for the
              fiscal year compared to almost 22% in fiscal 2005, including AI. At
              December 30,
              2006, we operated commercial programs in 82% of our stores, including
              the 87 AI
              stores, up from approximately 78% at the end of the prior fiscal year.
              We
              continued to approach our goal of operating commercial programs in
              approximately
              85% of our AAP store base. Due to AI’s sole focus on the commercial business,
              virtually all of their sales are to commercial customers.

We
              believe we have the opportunity to grow our commercial business for
              the
              foreseeable future through the continued execution of our commercial
              plan and
              growth in our commercial programs. We believe the acquisition of AI
              supplements
              our commercial growth due to AI’s established delivery programs and knowledge of
              the commercial industry, particularly for foreign makes and models
              of vehicles.

Share-Based
              Payments

On
              January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No.
              123R
              replaces SFAS No. 123 and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 and subsequently
              issued
              stock option related guidance. We elected to use the modified-prospective
              method
              of implementation. Under this transition method, share-based compensation
              expense


Table
                  of Contents

for
              fiscal year ended 2006 included compensation expense for all share-based
              awards
              granted subsequent to January

1,
              based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the
              provisions
              of SFAS No. 123R, and compensation expense for all share-based awards
              granted
              prior to but unvested as of January 1, 2006 based on the grant-date
              fair value
              estimated in accordance with original provisions of SFAS No. 123.

We
              use
              the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value all options and straight-line
              method to amortize this fair value as compensation cost over the requisite
              service period. Total share-based compensation expense included in
              selling,
              general and administrative expenses in our statements of operations
              for the
              fiscal years ended 2006 was $19.1 million. The related income tax benefit
              was
              $7.1 million. We recognized $0.4 and $0.5 million of share-based compensation
              expense in accordance with APB No. 25 for the fiscal years ended December
              31,
              2005 and January 1, 2005. On a pro forma basis, share-based compensation
              was
              $0.09 and $0.05 per diluted share for the fiscal years ended December
              31, 2005
              and January 1, 2005, respectively. In accordance with the modified-prospective
              transition method of SFAS No. 123R, we have not restated prior periods.

As
              a
              result of adopting SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006, our earnings before
              income
              tax expense and net earnings for the fiscal year ended December 30,
              2006, were
              $18.8 million and $11.7 million lower, respectively, than if we had
              continued to
              account for share-based compensation under APB No. 25. The related
              impact in
              2006 to basic and diluted earnings per share is $0.11 for the fiscal
              year ended
              December 30, 2006.

As
              of
              December 30, 2006, we have $26.3 million of unrecognized compensation
              expense
              related to non-vested fixed stock options we expect to recognize over
              a weighted
              average period of 1.8 years.

AI
              Acquisition

The
              Company finalized the allocation of the purchase price of the assets
              acquired
              and liabilities assumed of Autopart International during the third
              quarter of
              fiscal 2006. We acquired AI in September 2005. The acquisition, which
              included
              61 stores throughout New England and New York, a distribution center
              and AI’s
              wholesale distribution business, complements our growing presence in
              the
              Northeast. AI serves the growing commercial market in addition to warehouse
              distributors and jobbers. The acquisition was accounted for under the
              purchase
              method of accounting. Accordingly, AI’s results of operations have been included
              in our consolidated statement of operations since the acquisition date.
              The
              total purchase price of $87.6 million primarily consisted of $74.9
              million paid
              upon closing and an additional $12.5 million of contingent consideration
              paid in
              March 2006 based upon AI satisfying certain earnings before interest,
              taxes,
              depreciation and amortization targets met through December 31, 2005.
              The
              completion of the purchase price allocation resulted in the recognition
              of $17.6
              million in goodwill and $29.0 million of identifiable intangible assets.
              Furthermore, an additional $12.5 million is contingently payable based
              upon the
              achievement of certain synergies through fiscal 2008, which will be
              reflected in
              the statement of operations as earned. We recognized additional cost
              of sales of
              $3.1 million in fiscal 2006 due to such synergies.

Hurricane
              and Fire Impact

During
              the second half of fiscal 2005, Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma
              impacted our
              operations throughout the states of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi
              and
              Texas. At the time these storms hit, we operated approximately 750
              stores
              throughout these states. Over 70% of these locations experienced some
              kind of
              physical damage and even more suffered sales disruptions. Additionally,
              we
              believe we experienced sales disruptions resulting from the economic
              impact of
              increased fuel prices on our customer base throughout all of our markets
              immediately following these hurricanes. We also incurred and recognized
              incremental expenses associated with compensating our team members
              for scheduled
              work hours for which stores were closed and food and supplies provided
              to our
              team members and their families. While these sales disruptions and
              related
              incremental expenses are not recoverable from our insurance carrier,
              the
              insurance coverage provides for the recovery of physical damage at
              cost, damaged
              merchandise at retail values and damaged capital assets at replacement
              cost.
              Additionally, during fiscal 2005 we lost two store locations due to
              fire.

For
              fiscal 2005, we estimated and reflected in earnings $0.1 million of
              insurance
              recoveries, net of deductibles, for the fixed costs of all damage.
              A portion of
              these recoveries included the settlement with our insurance carrier
              for the
              retail value of certain damaged inventory. In fiscal 2006, we lost
              one store
              location due to fire and received additional recoveries as we settled
              additional
              hurricane claims for

damaged
              inventory at retail value and for damaged capital assets at replacement
              value.
              Accordingly, earnings for fiscal 2006 reflected $1.4 million of

insurance
              recoveries, net of deductibles.

Critical
              Accounting Policies

Our
              financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
              policies
              generally accepted in the United States of America. Our discussion
              and analysis
              of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these
              financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements
              requires the
              application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates
              and
              judgments by our management. Our estimates and judgments are based
              on currently
              available information, historical results and other assumptions we
              believe are
              reasonable. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

The
              preparation of our financial statements included the following significant
              estimates.

Vendor
              Incentives

We
              receive incentives from vendors as a result of purchasing and promoting
              their
              products through a variety of programs, including cooperative advertising
              allowances, volume rebates and other promotional incentives. We account
              for
              vendor incentives in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force, or
              EITF, No.
              02-16, “Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain
              Consideration Received from a Vendor.” Many of the incentives are under
              long-term agreements (terms in excess of one year), while others are
              negotiated
              on an annual basis. Cooperative advertising allowances and volume rebates
              are
              earned based on inventory purchases and initially recorded as a reduction
              to
              inventory. The deferred amounts are included as a reduction to cost
              of sales as
              the inventory is sold.

We
              recognize other promotional incentives earned under long-term agreements
              as a
              reduction to cost of sales. These incentives are recognized based on
              the
              cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated net purchases
              over
              the life of the agreement. Our margins could be impacted positively
              or
              negatively if actual purchases or results from any one year differ
              from our
              estimates; however, the impact over the life of the agreement would
              be the same.
              Short-term incentives (terms less than one year) are recognized as
              a reduction
              to cost of sales over the course of the agreements.

Amounts
              received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected
              as
              deferred revenue. Management's estimate of the portion of deferred
              revenue that
              will be realized within one year of the balance sheet date is included
              in other
              current liabilities. Earned amounts that are receivable from vendors
              are
              included in receivables except for that portion expected to be received
              after
              one year, which is included in other assets.

Inventory
              Reserves

We
              establish reserves for inventory shrink, as an increase to our cost
              of sales,
              for our stores and distribution centers based on our extensive and
              frequent
              cycle counting program. Our estimates of these shrink reserves depend
              on the
              accuracy of the program, which is dependent on compliance rates of
              our
              facilities and the execution of the required procedures. We evaluate
              the
              accuracy of this program on an ongoing basis and believe it provides
              reasonable
              assurance for the established reserves. If estimates regarding our
              cycle
              counting program are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains
              that could
              be material.

We
              have
              recorded reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories based
              on
              current inventory levels and historical analysis of product sales and
              current
              market conditions. The nature of our inventory is such that the risk
              of
              obsolescence is minimal and excess inventory has historically been
              returned to
              our vendors for credit. We provide reserves where less than full credit
              is
              expected from a vendor or where we anticipate that items will be sold
              at retail
              prices that are less than recorded cost. We develop these estimates
              based on the
              determination of return privileges with vendors, the level of credit
              provided by
              the vendor and management’s estimate of the discounts to recorded cost, if any,
              required by market conditions. Future changes by vendors in their policies
              or
              willingness to accept returns of excess inventory could require us
              to revise our
              estimates of required reserves for excess and obsolete inventory and
              result in a
              negative impact on our consolidated statement of operations. A 10%
              difference in
              actual inventory reserves at December 30, 2006 would have affected
              net income by
              approximately $1.9 million.

Warranty
              Reserves

Our
              vendors are primarily responsible for warranty claims. We are responsible
              for
              merchandise sold under warranty which is not covered by vendor warranties
              (primarily batteries). We record a reserve for future warranty claims
              as an
              increase in our cost of sales based on current sales of the warranted
              products
              and historical claim experience. If claims experience differs from
              historical
              levels, revisions in our estimates may be required, which could have
              an impact
              on our consolidated statement of operations. A 10% change in the warranty
              reserves at December 30, 2006 would have affected net income by approximately
              $0.8 million for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2006.

Self-Insured
              Reserves

We
              are
              self-insured for general and automobile liability, workers' compensation
              and the
              health care claims of our team members, although we maintain stop-loss
              coverage
              with third-party insurers to limit our total liability exposure. A
              reserve for
              liabilities associated with these losses is established for claims
              filed and
              claims incurred but not yet reported using actuarial methods followed
              in the
              insurance industry and our historical claims experience. While we do
              not expect
              the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates,
              our
              self-insurance reserves and corresponding selling, general and administrative
              expenses could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly
              from
              historical trends and actuarial assumptions. A 10% change in our self-insurance
              liabilities at December 30, 2006 would have affected net income by
              approximately
              $4.4 million for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2006.

Leases
              and Leasehold Improvements

We
              lease
              certain store locations, distribution centers, office space, equipment
              and
              vehicles. We account for our leases under the provisions of SFAS No.
              13,
“Accounting for Leases,” and subsequent amendments which require that leases be
              evaluated and classified as operating leases or capital leases for
              financial
              reporting purposes. Certain leases contain rent escalation clauses,
              which are
              recorded on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the lease
              with the
              difference between the rent paid and the straight-line rent recorded
              as a
              deferred rent liability. Lease incentive payments received from landlords
              are
              recorded as deferred rent liabilities and are amortized on a straight-line
              basis
              over the lease term as a reduction in rent. In addition, leasehold
              improvements
              associated with these operating leases are amortized over the shorter
              of their
              economic lives or the respective lease terms. The term of each lease
              is
              generally the initial term of the lease unless external economic factors
              were to
              exist such that renewals potentially provided for in the lease are
              reasonably
              assured to be exercised. In those instances the renewal period would
              be included
              in the lease term for purposes of establishing an amortization period
              and
              determining if such lease qualified as a capital or operating lease.

Impairment
              of Long-Lived Assets

We
              primarily invest in property and equipment in connection with the opening
              and
              remodeling of stores and in computer software and hardware. We periodically
              review our store locations and estimate the recoverability of our assets,
              recording an impairment charge, if necessary, when we decide to close
              the store
              or otherwise determine that future undiscounted cash flows associated
              with those
              assets will not be sufficient to recover the carrying value. This determination
              is based on a number of factors, including the store’s historical operating
              results and cash flows, estimated future sales growth, real estate
              development
              in the area and perceived local market conditions that can be difficult
              to
              predict and may be subject to change. In addition, we regularly evaluate
              our
              computer-related and other long-lived assets and may accelerate depreciation
              over the revised useful life if the asset is expected to be replaced
              or has
              limited future value. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed
              of, the cost
              and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from
              the
              accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income for
              that period.
              Our impairment loss calculations require management to apply judgment
              in
              estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting
              useful
              lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the
              risk
              inherent in future cash flows. If actual results are not consistent
              with our
              assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and
              asset fair
              values, we may be exposed to additional impairment losses that could
              be material
              to our results of operations.

                  of Contents

Tax
              Reserves

The
              determination of our income tax liabilities is based upon the tax code,
              regulations and pronouncements of the taxing jurisdictions in which
              we do
              business. Our income tax returns are periodically examined by those
              jurisdictions. These examinations include, among other things, auditing
              our
              filing positions, the timing of deductions and allocation of income
              among the
              various jurisdictions. At any particular time, multiple years are subject
              to
              examination by various taxing authorities.

In
              evaluating our income tax positions, we record reserves for potential
              exposures.
              These contingency reserves are adjusted in the period actual developments
              give
              rise to such change. Those developments could be, but are not limited
              to;
              settlement of tax audits, expiration of the statute of limitations,
              and the
              evolution of tax code and regulations, along with varying application
              of tax
              policy and administration within those jurisdictions.

These
              contingency reserves contain uncertainties because management is required
              to
              make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate exposures associated
              with our
              various filing positions. Although management believes that the judgments and
              estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ and the company
              may be
              exposed to gains or losses that could be material. To the extent that
              actual
              results differ from our estimates, the effective tax rate in any particular
              period could be materially affected. Favorable tax developments would
              be
              recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of
              resolution.
              Unfavorable tax developments would require an increase in our effective
              tax rate
              and a possible use of cash in the period of resolution.

Share-Based
              Payments

We
              have a
              share-based compensation plan, which includes fixed stock options and
              deferred
              stock units, or DSUs. We account for our share-based compensation plans
              as
              prescribed by the fair value provisions of SFAS No. 123R. We determine
              the fair
              value of our stock options at the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes
              option-pricing model. The DSUs are awarded at a price equal to the
              market price
              of our underlying stock on the date of the grant. The option-pricing
              model and
              generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make
              assumptions
              and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards. These
              assumptions and judgments include the expected life of stock options,
              expected
              stock price volatility, future employee stock option exercise behaviors
              and the
              estimate of stock option forfeitures. We do not believe there is a
              reasonable
              likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates
              or
              assumptions we use to determine stock-based compensation expense. However,
              if

actual
              results are different from these assumptions, the share-based compensation
              expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative
              of the
              actual economic cost of the share-based compensation. In addition,
              significant
              changes in these assumptions could materially impact our share-based
              compensation expense on future awards.

A 10%
              change in our share-based compensation expense for the fiscal year
              ended
              December 30, 2006 would have affected net income by approximately $1.2
              million
              for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2006.

Net
              Sales

Net
              sales
              consist primarily of comparable store sales and new store net sales.
              We
              calculate comparable store sales based on the change in net sales starting
              once
              a store has been opened for 13 complete accounting periods. We include
              relocations in comparable store sales from the original date of opening.
              We
              exclude net sales from the 37 Western Auto retail stores from our comparable
              store sales as a result of their unique product offerings. We also
              exclude the
              net sales from the AI stores from our comparable store sales.

Our
              fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to December 31 and consists
              of 52 or 53
              weeks. Our 2004 fiscal year began on January 4, 2004 and consisted
              of 52 weeks,
              while our 2003 fiscal year began on December 29, 2002 and consisted
              of 53 weeks.
              The extra week of operations in fiscal 2003 resulted in our fiscal
              consisting of non-comparable calendar weeks to fiscal 2003. To create
              a
              meaningful comparable store sales measure for fiscal 2004, we have
              compared the
              calendar weeks of 2004 to the corresponding calendar weeks of fiscal
              2003.
              Accordingly, our calculation of comparable stores sales for fiscal
              2004 excludes
              week one of operations from fiscal 2003.

Cost
              of Sales

Our
              cost
              of sales consists of merchandise costs, net of incentives under vendor
              programs,
              inventory shrinkage and warehouse and distribution expenses. Gross
              profit as a
              percentage of net sales may be affected by variations in our product
              mix, price
              changes in response to competitive factors and fluctuations in merchandise
              costs
              and vendor programs. We seek to avoid fluctuation in merchandise costs
              and
              instability of supply by entering into long-term purchasing agreements
              with
              vendors when we believe it is advantageous.

Selling,
              General and Administrative Expenses

Selling,
              general and administrative expenses consist of store payroll, store
              occupancy
              (including rent), advertising expenses, other store expenses and general
              and
              administrative expenses, including salaries and related benefits of
              store
              support center team members, store support center administrative office
              expenses, data processing, professional expenses and other related
              expenses.

Consolidated
              Results of Operations

The
              following table sets forth certain of our operating data expressed
              as a
              percentage of net sales for the periods indicated.

Fiscal
              2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005

Net
              sales
              for 2006 were $4,616.5 million, an increase of $351.5 million, or 8.2%,
              over net
              sales for 2005. The net sales increase was due to an increase in comparable
              store sales of 2.1%, contributions from the 190 AAP stores opened within
              the
              last year and sales from AI. AI, which was acquired in September 2005,
              produced
              sales of $111.1 million in 2006 compared to $30.3 million for the partial
              period
              in 2005. The comparable store sales increase was driven by an increase
              in
              average ticket sales and customer traffic in our DIFM business and
              an increase
              in average ticket sales by our DIY customers offset by a decrease in
              DIY
              customer count. In addition, we believe our DIFM sales have increased
              as a
              result of the continued execution of our commercial plan as discussed
              previously
              in the Commercial Program.

Gross
              profit for 2006 was $2,201.2 million, or 47.7% of net sales, as compared
              to
              $2,014.5 million, or 47.2% of net sales, in 2005. The increase in gross
              profit
              as a percentage of sales reflects the positive impact of our ongoing
              category
              management initiatives, including improved procurement costs and a
              positive
              shift in sales mix, and logistics efficiencies.

                                          including rent and depreciation, as a result
                                          of low comparative sales
                                          growth; and

                                        programs, including workers’ compensation, auto liability and general
                                        liability.

Additionally,
              AI contributed approximately 0.2% of selling, general and administrative
              expenses as a result of the reinvestment of working capital to accelerate
              their
              new store growth.

Interest
              expense for 2006 was $36.0 million, or 0.8% of net sales, as compared
              to $32.4
              million, or 0.7% of net sales, in 2005. The increase in interest expense
              is a
              result of both higher average outstanding debt levels and borrowing
              rates as
              compared to fiscal 2005. In addition, other income for fiscal 2006
              decreased as
              a result of less interest income associated with lower cash balances
              throughout
              the year.

Income
              tax expense for 2006 was $138.6 million, as compared to $144.2 million for
              2005. Our effective income tax rate was 37.5% and 38.1% for 2006 and
              2005,
              respectively.

We
              generated net income of $231.3 million, or $2.16 per diluted share,
              for 2006, as
              compared to $234.7 million, or $2.13 per diluted share, for 2005. As
              a
              percentage of sales, net income for 2006 was 5.0%, as compared to 5.5%
              for 2005.
              Our

earnings
              per diluted share results reflect the impact on both earnings and the
              diluted
              share count of implementing FAS 123R as further explained in this management’s
              discussion and analysis and in the notes to our financial statements
              contained
              elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

Fiscal
              2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004

Net
              sales
              for 2005 were $4,265.0 million, an increase of $494.7 million, or 13.1%,
              over
              net sales for 2004. The net sales increase was due to an increase in
              comparable
              store sales of 8.7%, contributions from the 151 new stores opened within
              the
              last year and sales from acquired operations. The comparable store
              sales
              increase was driven by an increase in average ticket sales and a slight
              increase
              in customer traffic.

Gross
              profit for 2005 was $2,014.5 million, or 47.2% of net sales, as compared
              to
              $1,753.4 million, or 46.5% of net sales, in 2004. The increase in gross
              profit
              as a percentage of sales reflects continued benefits realized from
              our category
              management program in the form of better margins on key product categories
              and
              increased incentives under our vendor programs and supply chain
              efficiencies.

Selling,
              general and administrative expenses were $1,606.0 million, or 37.6%
              of net
              sales, for 2005, as compared to $1,424.6 million, or 37.8% of net sales,
              for
              2004. For fiscal 2005, we experienced a decrease in selling, general
              and
              administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales resulting from
              our ability
              to leverage our strong comparable store sales and lower self-insurance
              expense
              partially offset by higher fuel and energy costs.

Interest
              expense for 2005 was $32.4 million, or 0.7% of net sales, as compared
              to $20.1
              million, or 0.5% of net sales, in 2004. The increase in interest expense
              is a
              result of both higher average outstanding debt levels and borrowing
              rates as
              compared to fiscal 2004.

Income
              tax expense for 2005 was $144.2 million, as compared to $117.7 million for
              2004. This increase in income tax expense primarily reflects our higher
              earnings. Our effective income tax rate was 38.1% and 38.5% for 2005
              and 2004,
              respectively.

We
              generated net income of $234.7 million, or $2.13 per diluted share,
              for 2005, as
              compared to $188.0  million, or $1.66 per diluted share, for 2004. As a
              percentage of sales, net income for 2005 was 5.5%, as compared

to
              5.0%
              for 2004.

                          distributed on September 23,

Liquidity
                and Capital Resources

Overview
              of Liquidity

Our
              primary cash requirements include the purchase of inventory, capital
              expenditures, payment of cash dividends and contractual obligations.
              In
              addition, we have used available funds to repurchase shares of common
              stock
              under our stock repurchase program and to pay quarterly cash dividends
              beginning
              in 2006. We have funded these requirements primarily through cash generated
              from
              operations supplemented by borrowings under our credit facilities as
              needed. We
              believe funds generated from our expected results of operations, available
              cash
              and cash equivalents and available borrowings under our revolving credit
              facility will be sufficient to fund our primary obligations for the
              next fiscal
              year.

At
              December 30, 2006, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $11.1
              million, a
              decrease of $29.6 million compared to fiscal year-end 2005. Our cash
              and cash
              equivalents balance decreased primarily due to the repurchase of common
              stock,
              dividends paid to our shareholders and an overall net increase in working
              capital during 2006 as compared to 2005.

At
              December 30, 2006, we had outstanding indebtedness consisting of borrowings
              of
              $477.2 million under our revolving credit facility, an increase of
              $38.4 million
              from 2005. Additionally, we had $66.8 million in letters of credit
              outstanding,
              which reduced our cash availability under the revolving credit facility
              to
              $206.4 million.

On
              February 15, 2006, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash
              dividend,
              the first in our history. We paid quarterly dividends of $0.06 per
              share to
              stockholders of record for each of our quarters during 2006. Subsequent
              to
              December 30, 2006, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend
              of $0.06
              per share to be paid on April 6, 2007 to all common stockholders of
              record as of
              March 23, 2007.

Capital
              Expenditures

Our
              primary capital requirements have been the funding of our continued
              store
              expansion program, including new store openings and store acquisitions,
              store
              relocations and remodels, inventory requirements, the construction
              and upgrading
              of distribution centers, the development and implementation of proprietary
              information systems and our acquisitions.

Our
                capital expenditures were $258.6 million in 2006. These amounts included
                costs
                related to new store openings, the upgrade of our information systems
                and
                remodels and relocations of existing stores. During fiscal 2006,
                we opened 215
                AAP and AI stores, remodeled 189 AAP stores and relocated 47 AAP
                stores. In
                addition, we also made a $12.5 million contingent payment in 2006
                related to the
                acquisition of Autopart International.

Our
                future capital requirements will depend in large part on the number
                of and
                timing for new stores we open or acquire within a given year and
                the number of
                stores we relocate or remodel. During 2007, we anticipate adding
                200 to
                210 new AAP and AI stores, remodeling 150 AAP stores and relocating 35
                AAP
                stores. Our new AAP stores, if

                  of Contents

leased,
                require capital expenditures of approximately $0.2 million per store.
                Our
                remodeled stores generally require capital expenditures of approximately
                $0.1
                million per store, which reflects a forty percent reduction from
                2006 levels. We
                believe that we can spend less in certain areas of our remodel program
                while
                continuing to benefit from an increase in sales from the remodeled
                stores. In
                2007, we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately
                $250.0
                million to $270.0 million, inclusive of approximately $30.0 million for the
                construction of our new Midwest distribution center scheduled to
                open in
                mid-2008.

Additionally,
                our new AAP stores require an inventory investment of approximately
                $0.2 million
                per store, net of vendor payables. A portion of the inventory investment
                is held
                at a distribution facility. Pre-opening expenses, consisting primarily
                of store
                set-up costs and training of new store team members, average approximately
                $0.02
                million per store and are expensed when incurred.

Vendor
              Financing Program

Historically,
              we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers that help
              finance
              inventory growth, and we believe that we will be able to continue financing
              much
              of our inventory growth through such extended payment terms. In fiscal
              2004, we
              entered into a short-term financing program with a bank for certain
              merchandise
              purchases. In substance, the program allows us to borrow money from
              the bank to
              finance purchases from our vendors. This program allows us to reduce
              further our
              working capital invested in current inventory levels and finance future
              inventory growth. Our new revolving credit facility does not restrict
              availability under this program. At December 30, 2006, $127.5 million
              was
              payable to the bank by us under this program.

Stock
              Repurchase Program

During
              the third quarter of fiscal 2005, our Board of Directors authorized
              a program to
              repurchase up to $300 million of our common stock plus related expenses.
              The
              program replaced the remaining portion of a previous repurchase program.
              The
              program allows us to repurchase our common stock in the open market
              or in
              privately negotiated transactions from time to time in accordance with
              the
              requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission. As of December
              30, 2006,
              we had repurchased a total of 5.2 million shares of common stock under
              the
              program, at an aggregate cost of $196.0 million, or an average price
              of $37.63
              per share, excluding related expenses. At December 30, 2006, we had
              $104.0
              million, excluding related expenses, available for future stock repurchases
              under the stock repurchase program.

During
              fiscal 2006, we retired 5.1 million shares of common stock which were
              previously
              repurchased under the $300 million stock repurchase program.

During
              fiscal 2005, we retired 7.1 million shares of common stock, of which
              0.1 million
              shares were repurchased under the current stock repurchase plan, and
              7.0 million
              shares were repurchased under our previous program at an aggregate
              cost of
              $189.2 million, or an average price of $26.91 per share, excluding
              related
              expenses.

Deferred
              Compensation and Postretirement Plans

We
              maintain a non-qualified deferred compensation plan established for
              certain of
              our key team members. This plan provides for a minimum and maximum
              deferral
              percentage of the team member base salary and bonus, as determined
              by our
              Retirement Plan Committee. We fund the plan liability by remitting
              the team
              members’ deferrals to a Rabbi Trust where these deferrals are invested in
              certain life insurance contracts. Accordingly, the cash surrender value
              on these
              contracts is held in the Rabbi Trust to fund the deferred compensation
              liability. At December 30, 2006, the liability related to this plan
              was $3.4
              million, all of which is current.

We
              provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible
              retired
              team members through our postretirement plan. At December 30, 2006,
              our accrued
              benefit cost related to this plan was $10.5 million. The plan has no
              assets and
              is funded on a cash basis as benefits are paid/incurred. The discount
              rate that
              we utilize for determining our postretirement benefit obligation is
              actuarially
              determined. The discount rate utilized at December 30, 2006 and December
              31,
              2005 was 5.5% and 5.5%, respectively. We reserve the right to change
              or
              terminate the benefits or contributions at any time. We also continue
              to
              evaluate ways in which we can better manage these

benefits
              and control costs. Any changes in the plan or
              revisions to assumptions that affect the amount of expected future
              benefits may
              have a significant impact on the amount of the reported obligation
              and annual
              expense.

Effective
              second quarter of 2004, we amended the postretirement plan to exclude
              outpatient
              prescription drug benefits to Medicare eligible retirees effective
              January 1,
              2006. Due to this negative plan amendment, our accumulated postretirement
              benefit obligation was reduced by $7.6 million, resulting in an unrecognized
              negative prior service cost in the same amount. The unrecognized negative
              prior
              service cost is being amortized over the 13-year estimated remaining
              life
              expectancy of the plan participants.

$37.8
                                              million increase in cash flow, primarily resulting from the reduction

We
                      lease certain store locations, distribution centers, office
                      space,
                      equipment and vehicles. Our property leases generally contain
                      renewal and
                      escalation clauses and other leases concessions. These provisions
                      are
                      considered in our calculation of our minimum lease payments
                      which are
                      recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the applicable
                      lease
                      term. In accordance with SFAS No. 13, “Accounting for Leases,” as amended
                      by SFAS No. 29, “Determining Contingent Rental,” any lease payments that
                      are based upon an existing index or rate, are included in our
                      minimum
                      lease payment calculations.

For
                      the purposes of this table, purchase obligations are defined
                      as agreements
                      that are enforceable and legally binding, a term of greater
                      than one year
                      and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or
                      minimum
                      quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price
                      provisions;
                      and the approximate timing of the transaction. Our open purchase
                      orders
                      are based on current inventory or operational needs and are
                      fulfilled by
                      our vendors within short periods of time. We currently do not
                      have minimum
                      purchase commitments under our vendor supply agreements nor
                      are our open
                      purchase orders for goods and services binding agreements.
                      Accordingly, we
                      have excluded open purchase orders from this table. The purchase
                      obligations consist of certain commitments for training and
                      development.
                      This agreement expires in March 2008.

Primarily
                      includes employee benefits accruals and deferred income taxes
                      for which no
                      contractual payment schedule exists.

Long
              Term Debt

On
              October 5, 2006, we entered into a new $750.0 million unsecured five-year
              revolving credit facility with our subsidiary, Advance Stores Company,
              Incorporated, serving as the borrower. This new facility replaced the
              term loans
              and revolver under our previous credit facility. Proceeds from this
              revolving
              loan were used to repay $433.8 million of principal outstanding on
              the term
              loans and revolver under our previous credit facility. In conjunction with
              this refinancing, we wrote-off existing deferred financing costs related
              to our
              previous term loans and revolver. The $1.9 million write-off of these
              costs was
              combined with a related gain on settlement of interest rate swaps of
              $2.9
              million for a net gain on extinguishment of debt of $1.0 million.

Additionally,
              the new facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit with
              a sub-limit
              of $300 million and swingline loans in an amount not to exceed $50
              million. We
              may request that the total revolving commitment be increased by an
              amount not
              exceeding $250 million during the term of the credit agreement. Voluntary
              prepayments and voluntary reductions of the revolving balance are permitted
              in
              whole or in part, at our option, in minimum principal amounts as specified
              in
              the new revolving credit facility.

As
              of
              December 30

,
              2006,
              we had borrowed $476.8 million under the revolver and had $66.8 million
              in
              letters of credit outstanding, which reduced availability under the
              revolver to
              $206.4 million. At December 30, 2006, we also have interest rate swaps
              in place
              that effectively fix our interest rate exposure on approximately 50%
              of our
              debt. These interest rate swaps are further discussed in our market
              risk
              analysis.

                  of Contents

The
              interest rates on the borrowings under the new
              revolving credit facility will be based, at our option, on an adjusted
              LIBOR
              rate, plus a margin, or an alternate base rate, plus a margin. After
              an initial
              interest period, we may elect to convert a particular borrowing to
              a different
              type. The initial margin is 0.75% and 0.0% per annum for the adjusted
              LIBOR and
              alternate base rate borrowings, respectively. A commitment fee will
              be charged
              on the unused portion of the revolver, payable in arrears. The initial
              commitment fee rate is 0.150% per annum. Under the terms of the new
              revolving
              credit facility, the interest rate spread and commitment fee will be
              based on
              our credit rating. The

revolving
              credit facility terminates on October 5, 2011.

The
              revolving credit facility is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by
              Advance
              Auto Parts, Inc. The facility contains covenants restricting the ability
              of us
              and our subsidiaries to, among other things, (1) create, incur or assume
              additional debt (including hedging arrangements), (2) incur liens or
              engage in
              sale-leaseback transactions, (3) make loans and investments, (4) guarantee
              obligations, (5) engage in certain mergers, acquisitions and asset
              sales, (6)
              engage in transactions with affiliates, (7) change the nature of our
              business
              and the business conducted by its subsidiaries and (8) change our holding
              company status. We are required to comply with financial covenants
              with respect
              to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum coverage ratio. The new revolving
              credit facility also provides for customary events of default, including
              non-payment defaults, covenant defaults and cross-defaults to our other
              material
              indebtedness.

In
              2004,
              we wrote-off existing deferred financing costs as a result of refinancing
              our
              outstanding term loans. The write-off of these costs combined with
              the related
              refinancing costs incurred to set up the new revolving credit facility
              resulted
              in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.8 million in the accompanying
              consolidated statements of operations for the year ended January 1,
              2005. During
              fiscal 2004, prior to the refinancing of our credit facility, we repaid
              $105.0
              million in debt prior to its scheduled maturity. In conjunction with
              these
              partial repayments, we wrote-off deferred financing costs in the amount
              of $0.4
              million, which is classified as a loss on extinguishment of debt in
              the
              accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended
              January 1,
              2005.

We
              are
              required to comply with financial covenants in the revolving credit
              facility
              with respect to (a) a maximum leverage ratio and (b) a minimum interest
              coverage
              ratio. We were in compliance with the above covenants under the revolving
              credit
              facility at December 30, 2006.

Credit
              Ratings

At
              December 30, 2006, we had a credit rating from Standard & Poor’s of BB+ and
              a credit rating of Ba1 from Moody’s Investor Service. The current pricing grid
              used to determine our borrowing rates under our revolving credit facility
              is
              based on such credit ratings. If these credit ratings decline, our
              interest
              expense may increase. Conversely, if these credit ratings improve,
              our interest
              expense may decrease.

New
              Accounting Pronouncements

In
              February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for
              Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.” SFAS No. 159 permits entities to
              choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items
              at fair
              value. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November
              15,
              2007. We are currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 159.

In
                September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for
                Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment
                of FASB
                Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R).” SFAS No. 158 requires recognition of
                the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit postretirement
                plans as
                an asset or liability in the statement of financial position and
                to recognize
                changes in that funded status in comprehensive income in the year
                in which the
                changes occur. SFAS No. 158 also requires measurement of the funded
                status of a
                plan as of the date of the statement of financial position. We adopted
                the
                recognition provisions of SFAS No. 158 on December 30, 2006 and recorded
                a
                reduction to the liability of $5.4 million and an impact to other
                comprehensive
                income of $3.3 million, net of tax. SFAS No. 158 is effective for
                the
                measurement date provisions for fiscal years ending after December
                15, 2008. We
                are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the measurement provisions
                of
                SFAS No. 158.

In
              September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, staff
              issued
              Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, “Considering the Effects of Prior Year
              Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
              Statements,” or SAB 108. SAB 108 was issued in order to eliminate the diversity
              in practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement
              misstatements. SAB 108 requires that registrants quantify errors using
              both a
              balance sheet and income statement approach and evaluate whether either
              approach
              results in a misstated amount that, when all relevant quantitative
              and
              qualitative factors are considered, is material. SAB 108 is effective
              for
              financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after
              November 15, 2006. We adopted SAB 108 for the year ended December 30,
              2006 with no impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of
              operations or cash flows.

In
              September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.”
SFAS No. 157 clarifies the definition of fair value, establishes a
              framework for
              measuring fair value, and expands the disclosures on fair value measurements.
              SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
              2007. We are currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 157.

In
              July
              2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in
              Income Taxes,” or FIN 48.  FIN 48 clarifies the accounting and reporting
              for income taxes recognized in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for
              Income Taxes.” The interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and
              measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition, measurement,
              presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected
              to be
              taken in income tax returns. FIN 48 is

effective
              for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We will adopt the
              provisions of FIN 48 as of December 31, 2006. Accordingly, we estimate
              a
              cumulative effect adjustment will be recorded to reduce our retained
              earnings by
              an amount less than $8 million

upon
              initial adoption.

In
              March

006,
              the
              FASB’s Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, released Issue 06-3, “How Sales
              Taxes Collected From Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities
              Should
              Be Presented in the Income Statement,” or EITF 06-3. A consensus was reached
              that entities may adopt a policy of presenting sales taxes in the income
              statement on either a gross or net basis. If taxes are significant,
              an entity
              should disclose its policy of presenting taxes and the amount of taxes
              if
              reflected on a gross basis in the income statement. EITF 06-3 is effective
              for
              periods beginning after December 15, 2006. We present sales net of
              sales taxes
              in our consolidated statement of operations

and
              do
              not anticipate changing our policy as a result of EITF 06-3.

In
              March
              2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156, “Accounting for Servicing of Financial
              Assets - an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140.” SFAS No. 156 amends SFAS
              No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and
              Extinguishments of Liabilities,” with respect to the accounting for separately
              recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities. SFAS No. 156
              is effective
              for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006. We do not expect the
              adoption of SFAS No. 156 to have a material impact on our financial
              condition,
              results of operations or cash flows.

In
              February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, “Accounting for Certain Hybrid
              Financial Instruments - an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and
              140.” This
              statement simplifies accounting for certain hybrid instruments currently
              governed by SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
              Activities,” or SFAS No. 133, by allowing fair value remeasurement of hybrid
              instruments that contain an embedded derivative that otherwise would
              require
              bifurcation. SFAS No. 155 also eliminates the guidance in SFAS No.
              Implementation Issue No. D1, “Application of Statement 133 to Beneficial
              Interests in Securitized Financial Assets,” which provides such beneficial
              interests are not subject to SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 155 amends SFAS
              No. 140,
“

Accounting
              for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments
              of
              Liabilities - a Replacement of FASB Statement No. 125,”

by
              eliminating the restriction on passive derivative instruments that
              a qualifying
              special-purpose entity may hold. SFAS No. 155 is effective for financial
              instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of our fiscal year
              2007. We
              do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 155 to have a material impact
              on our
              financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Quantitative
                and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
                Risks.

We
              are
              exposed to cash flow risk due to changes in interest rates with respect
              to our
              long-term debt. Our long-term debt currently consists of borrowings
              under a
              revolving credit facility and is primarily vulnerable to movements
              in the LIBOR
              rate. While we cannot predict the impact interest rate movements will
              have on
              our debt, exposure to rate changes is managed through the use of hedging
              activities. At December 30, 2006 approximately $225 million of our
              bank debt was
              fixed in accordance with the interest rate swaps described below.

Our
              future exposure to interest rate risk is mitigated as a result of entering
              into
              four new interest rate swap agreements in October 2006 on an aggregate
              of $225
              million of debt under our revolving credit facility. These interest
              rate swaps
              replaced the previously outstanding swaps settled as a result of our
              refinancing
              in October 2006.

The
            first
            swap fixed our LIBOR rate at 4.9675% on $75 million of debt for a term
            of 60
            months, expiring in October 2011. The second swap fixed our LIBOR rate
            at
            4.9680% on $50 million of debt for a term of 60 months, expiring in October
            2011. The third swap fixed our LIBOR rate at 4.9800% on $50 million of
            debt for
            a term of 60 months, expiring in October 2011. The fourth swap fixed
            our LIBOR
            rate at 4.9650% on $50 million of debt for a term of 60 months, expiring
            in
            October 2011.

The
            table
            below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest
            rates
            on our long-term debt outstanding at December 30, 2006, by expected maturity
            dates. Additionally, the table includes the notional amounts of our hedged
            debt
            and the impact of the anticipated average pay and receive rates of our
            interest
            rate swaps through their maturity dates. Expected maturity dates approximate
            contract terms. Weighted average variable rates are based on implied
            forward
            rates in the yield curve at December 30, 2006. Implied forward rates
            should not
            be considered a predictor of actual future interest rates.

MANAGEMENT’S
            REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL
            REPORTING

Management
            of Advance Auto Parts, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) is responsible
            for
            establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
            reporting.
            The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
            under the supervision of the Company’s principal executive officer and principal
            financial officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
            of
            financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s financial statements
            for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally
            accepted in the United States of America.

Our
            internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures
            that
            (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
            accurately
            and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
            the
            Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
            as
            necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
            with
            accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
            and
            that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in
            accordance
            with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3)
            provide
            reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
            acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a
            material effect on the financial statements.

As
            of
            December 30, 2006, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
            internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established
            in

Internal
            Control - Integrated Framework

issued
            by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
            (COSO).
            Based on this assessment, management has determined that the Company’s internal
            control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2006 is effective.
            Because
            of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting,
            including the possibility of collusion or improper management override
            of
            controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented
            or
            detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
            effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future
            periods
            are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because
            of
            changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
            or
            procedures may deteriorate.

Deloitte
            & Touche LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm
            who audited the Company’s consolidated financial statements, has issued an
            attestation report on management’s assessment of the Company’s internal control
            over financial reporting as of December 30, 2006 which is included on
            page F-3
            herein.

REPORT
            OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
            FIRM

To
            the
            Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Advance
            Auto Parts, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Roanoke,
            Virginia

We
            have
            audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Advance Auto
            Parts, Inc.
            and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 30, 2006 and December 31,
            2005,
            and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders'
            equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
            December
            30, 2006. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
            management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial
            statements based on our audits.

We
            conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
            Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
            we plan
            and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
            financial
            statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
            on a
            test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
            statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
            used and
            significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
            financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide
            a
            reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
            our
            opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
            material
            respects, the financial position of Advance Auto Parts, Inc. and subsidiaries
            as
            of December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, and the results of their
            operations
            and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
            December
            30, 2006, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
            in the
            United States of America.

As
              discussed in Notes 2, 17 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements,
              in
              2006 the Company changed its method of accounting for share-based payments
              to
              conform to Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No.
              (R),

Share-Based Payment

,
              and
              changed its method of accounting for other postretirement benefits
              to conform to
              FASB Statement No. 158,

Employers’
              Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans,
              an
              amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132
              (R).

We
            have
            also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
            Accounting
            Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company's internal
            control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2006, based on the
            criteria
            established in

Internal
            Control—Integrated Framework

issued
            by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
            and our
            report dated February 27, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on management's
            assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over
            financial
            reporting and an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's
            internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT

To
            the
            Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Advance
            Auto Parts, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Roanoke,
            Virginia

We
            have
            audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management's
            Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Advance Auto
            Parts,
            Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained effective internal control
            over
            financial reporting as of December 30, 2006, based on criteria established
            in

Internal
            Control—Integrated Framework

issued
            by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
            The
            Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
            over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
            of internal
            control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
            opinion on
            management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
            internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
            conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
            Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
            we plan
            and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
            internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
            respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
            over
            financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating
            the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
            such
            other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
            believe
            that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A
            company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by,
            or
            under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal
            financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
            by the
            company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide
            reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
            and the
            preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
            with
            generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
            financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
            to
            the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
            fairly
            reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
            (2)
            provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
            to
            permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
            accepted
            accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
            are
            being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
            of
            the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
            or timely
            detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
            assets that could have a material effect on the financial
            statements.

Because
            of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting,
            including the possibility of collusion or improper management override
            of
            controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented
            or
            detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
            effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future
            periods
            are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because
            of
            changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
            or
            procedures may deteriorate.

In
            our
            opinion, management’s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal
            control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2006, is fairly stated,
            in
            all material respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal
            Control—Integrated Framework

issued
            by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
            Also in
            our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
            internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2006, based
            on the
            criteria established in

Internal
            Control—Integrated Framework

issued
            by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
            Commission.

We
            have
            also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
            Accounting
            Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements
            as of and
            for the year ended December 30, 2006 of the Company and our report dated
            February 27, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial
            statements
            and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the Company's adoption
            of new
            accounting standards.

2.
            Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:

Accounting
            Period

The
            Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of December,
            which
            results in an extra week every six years (the next 53 week fiscal year
            is 2009).
            All other fiscal years presented include 52 weeks of operations.

Principles
            of Consolidation

The
            consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
            and its
            wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and
            transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use
            of Estimates

The
            preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
            generally accepted in the United States of America requires management
            to make
            estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
            and
            liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
            the date
            of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
            expenses
            during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cost
            of Sales and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

The
            following table illustrates the primary costs classified in each major
            expense
            category:

(in
                thousands, except per share data)

Cash,
            Cash Equivalents and Bank Overdrafts

Cash
            and
            cash equivalents consist of cash in banks and money market funds with
            original
            maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts consist of net outstanding
            checks not yet presented to a bank for settlement.

Vendor
            Incentives

The
              Company receives incentives in the form of reductions to amounts owed
              and/or
              payments from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances,
              volume
              rebates and other promotional considerations. The Company accounts
              for vendor
              incentives in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF,
              No. 02-16,
“Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration
              Received from a Vendor.” Many of the incentives are under long-term agreements
              (terms in excess of one year), while others are negotiated on an annual
              basis.
              Cooperative advertising allowances and volume rebates are earned based
              on
              inventory purchases and initially recorded as a reduction to inventory.
              The
              deferred amounts are included as a reduction to cost of sales as the
              inventory
              is sold. Total deferred vendor incentives in inventory is $35,393 and
              $33,175 at
              December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively.

The
            Company recognizes other promotional incentives earned under long-term
            agreements as a reduction to cost of sales. These incentives are recognized
            based on the cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated
            net
            purchases over the life of the agreement. The Company's margins could
            be
            impacted positively or negatively if actual purchases or results from
            any one
            year differ from its estimates; however, the impact over the life of
            the
            agreement would be the same. Short-term incentives (terms less than one
            year)
            are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the course of the
            agreements.

Amounts
            received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected
            as
            deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Management's
            estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within
            one
            year of the balance sheet date has been included in other current liabilities
            in
            the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Total deferred revenue
            is $8,006
            and $12,529 at December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively.
            Earned
            amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in receivables,
            net on the
            accompanying consolidated balance sheets, except for that portion expected
            to be
            received after one year, which is included in other assets, net on the
            accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Preopening
            Expenses

Preopening
            expenses, which consist primarily of payroll and occupancy costs, are
            expensed
            as incurred.

Income
            Taxes

The
            Company uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance
            with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 109, “Accounting
            for Income Taxes.” Under the liability method, deferred income taxes are
            determined based upon enacted tax laws and rates applied to the differences
            between the financial statements and tax bases of assets and
            liabilities.

Advertising
            Costs

The
            Company expenses advertising costs as incurred in accordance with the
            American
            Institute of Certified Public Accountant’s Statement of Position, or SOP, 93-7,
“Reporting on Advertising Costs.” Gross advertising expense incurred was
            approximately $97,215, $95,702 and $86,821 in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004,
            respectively.

Warranty
              Costs

The
              Company's vendors are primarily responsible for warranty claims. Warranty
              costs
              relating to merchandise (primarily batteries) sold under warranty,
              which are not
              covered by vendors' warranties, are estimated based on the

Revenue
                Recognition and Trade Receivables

The
            Company recognizes merchandise revenue at the point of sale to customers.
            The
            majority of sales are made for cash and credit with no recourse; however,
            the
            Company extends credit to certain commercial customers through a third-party
            provider of private label credit cards. In August 2005, the Company began
            using
            a new third party to process its private label credit card transactions
            subsequent to the sale of its existing credit card portfolio. Under the
            new
            arrangement, receivables under the private label credit card program
            are
            generally transferred to a third-party provider with no recourse. The
            Company
            will continue to transfer a limited amount of receivables with recourse.
            The
            Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts on receivables sold
            with
            recourse based upon factors related to credit risk of specific customers,
            historical trends and other information. Receivables sold with recourse
            are
            accounted for as a secured borrowing. Receivables and the related secured
            borrowings under the private label credit card were $610 and $587 at
            December
            30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, and are included in accounts
            receivable and other current liabilities, respectively, in the accompanying
            consolidated balance sheets.

Sales
            Returns and Allowances

The
            Company’s accounting policy for sales returns and allowances consists of
            establishing reserves for estimated returns at the time of sale. The
            Company
            estimates returns based on current sales levels and the Company’s historical
            return experience on a specific product basis.

Share-Based
            Payments

Prior
            to
            January 1, 2006, the Company accounted for its share-based compensation
            plans as
            prescribed by Accounting Principles Board, or APB, Opinion No. 25, “Accounting
            for Stock Issued to Employees,” or APB No. 25. The Company recorded no
            compensation cost in its statement of operations prior to fiscal 2006
            for its
            fixed stock option grants as the exercise price equaled the fair market
            value of
            the underlying stock on the grant date. In addition, the Company did
            not
            recognize compensation expense for its employee stock purchase plan since
            it
            qualified as a non-compensatory plan under Section 423 of the Internal
            Revenue
            Code of 1986, as amended. The

December
                  30, 2006, December 31, 2005 and January 1, 2005

(in
                  thousands, except per share data)

Company
              did recognize an insignificant amount of share-based compensation expense
              related to the grant of deferred stock units to its Board of Directors.

On
              January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of

SFAS

No.
              (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment," or SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R
              replaces
              SFAS No. 123 and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 and subsequently issued
              stock
              option related guidance. The Company elected to use the modified-prospective
              method of implementation. Under this transition method, share-based
              compensation
              expense for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2006 included compensation
              expense for all share-based awards granted subsequent to January 1,
              2006 based
              on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions
              of SFAS
              No. 123R, and compensation expense for all share-based awards granted
              prior to
              but unvested as of January 1, 2006 based on the grant-date fair value
              estimated
              in accordance with original provisions of SFAS No. 123.

The
            Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value all options
            and the
            straight-line method to amortize this fair value as compensation cost
            over the
            requisite service period. Total share-based compensation expense included
            in
            selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated
            statements of operations for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2006
            was
            $19,052. The related income tax benefit was $7,145. The Company recognized
            $363
            and $494 of share-based compensation expense in accordance with APB No.
            25 for
            the fiscal years ended December 31, 2005 and January 1, 2005, respectively.
            In
            accordance with the modified-prospective transition method of SFAS No.
            123R, the
            Company has not restated prior periods.

As
            a
            result of adopting SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006, the Company’s earnings
            before income tax expense and net earnings for the fiscal year ended
            December
            30, 2006, were $18,767 and $11,730 lower, respectively, than if the Company
            had
            continued to account for share-based compensation under APB No. 25. The
            related
            impact in 2006 to basic and diluted earnings per share is $0.11 for the
            fiscal
            year ended December 30, 2006.

In
            November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 123R-3 “Transition
            Election Related to Accounting for Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment
            Awards.”
We elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in the
            FASB Staff
            Position for calculating the tax effects of stock-based compensation.
            The
            alternative transition method includes simplified methods to determine
            the
            beginning balance of the additional paid-in capital (APIC) pool related
            to the
            tax effects of stock-based compensation, and to determine the subsequent
            impact
            on the APIC pool and the statement of cash flow of the tax effects of
            stock-based awards that were fully vested and outstanding upon the adoption
            of
            SFAS No. 123R.

Prior
            to
            the adoption of SFAS No.123R, the Company reported the benefit of tax
            deductions
            in excess of recognized stock compensation expense, or excess tax benefits,
            resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash inflows
            in its
            consolidated statements of cash flows. In accordance with SFAS No.123R,
            the
            Company revised its statement of cash flows presentation prospectively
            to
            include these excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options
            as
            financing cash inflows rather than operating cash inflows. Accordingly,
            for the
            fiscal year ended December 30, 2006, the Company reported $5,272 of excess
            tax
            benefits as a financing cash inflow.

The
            following table reflects the impact on net income and earnings per share
            as if
            the Company had applied the fair value based method of recognizing share-based
            compensation costs as prescribed by SFAS No. 123 for the fiscal years
            ended
            December 31, 2005 and January 1, 2005, respectively.

Hedge
            Activities

The
            Company utilizes interest rate swaps to limit its cash flow risk on its
            variable
            rate debt. In connection with the refinancing of its credit facility
            in October
            2006, the Company entered into four new interest rate swap agreements
            on an
            aggregate of $225,000 of debt under its revolving credit facility. The
            Company
            settled its previous three interest rate swaps, and accordingly, recognized
            income of $2,873 resulting from the reclassification of the previously
            unrealized gain from other comprehensive income. As of December 30, 2006,
            the
            detail for the new individual swaps is as follows:

·

The
                                                    first swap fixed the Company’s LIBOR rate at 4.9675% on $75,000
                                                    of debt
                                                    for a term of 60 months, expiring
                                                    in October
                                                    2011.

·

The
                                                      second swap fixed the Company’s LIBOR rate at 4.9680% on
                                                      $50,000 of debt
                                                      for a term of 60 months, expiring
                                                      in October
                                                      2011.

·

The
                                                      third swap fixed the Company’s LIBOR rate at 4.9800% on
                                                      $50,000 of debt
                                                      for a term of 60 months, expiring
                                                      in October
                                                      2011.

·

The
                                    fourth swap fixed the Company’s LIBOR rate at 4.9650% on $50,000 of debt
                                    for a term of 60 months, expiring in October
                                    2011.

In
            accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
            Activities,” the fair value of the Company’s outstanding hedges is recorded as
            an asset or liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
            at
            December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively. The Company uses
            the
“matched terms” accounting method as provided by Derivative Implementation Group
            Issue No. G9, “Assuming No Ineffectiveness When Critical Terms of the Hedging
            Instrument and the Hedge Transaction Match in a Cash Flow Hedge” for the
            interest rate swaps. Accordingly, the Company has matched the critical
            terms of
            each hedge instrument to the

            debt. Therefore, the Company has recorded all adjustments to the fair
            value of
            the hedge instruments in accumulated other comprehensive income through
            the
            maturity date of the applicable hedge arrangement. The fair value at
            December
            30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, was an unrecognized gain
            of $156
            and $3,090 on the swaps. Any amounts received or paid under these hedges
            will be
            recorded in the statement of operations as earned or incurred.

Based
            on
            the estimated current and future fair values of the hedge arrangements
            at
            December 30, 2006, the Company estimates amounts currently included in
            accumulated other comprehensive income that will be reclassified to earnings
            in
            the next 12 months will consist of a net loss of $104 associated with
            the
            interest rate swaps.

Goodwill
            and Other Intangible Assets

In
            accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” the
            Company tests goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment
            at
            least on an annual basis. Testing for impairment is a two-step process
            as
            prescribed in SFAS No. 142. The first step is a review for potential
            impairment,
            while the second step measures the amount of impairment, if any. The
            Company has
            elected to complete its annual impairment test as of the first day of
            its fourth
            quarter. An impairment loss would be recognized when the assets’ fair value is
            below their carrying value. For fiscal 2006, our impairment analysis
            yielded no
            impairment.

Valuation
            of Long-Lived Assets

The
            Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets under the
            provisions of SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
            Long-Lived Assets.” SFAS No. 144 requires the review for impairment of
            long-lived assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
            that the
            carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable and exceeds its
            fair
            value.

Significant
            factors, which would trigger an impairment review, include the
            following:

Significant
                                    changes in how assets are used or are planned

                                    used.

When
            such
            an event occurs, the Company estimates the future cash flows expected
            to result
            from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. These impairment
            evaluations involve estimates of asset useful lives and future

cash
            flows. If the undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the
            carrying
            amount of the asset and the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its
            fair value,
            an impairment loss is recognized. Management utilizes an expected present
            value
            technique, which uses a risk-free rate and multiple cash flow scenarios
            reflecting the range of possible outcomes, to estimate fair value of
            the asset.
            Actual useful lives and cash flows could differ from those estimated
            by
            management using these techniques, which could have a material affect
            on our
            results of operations, financial position or liquidity. There were no
            reductions
            to the carrying amounts currently assigned to the Company’s long-lived assets
            during fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Financed
            Vendor Accounts Payable

In
            fiscal
            2004, the Company entered into a short-term financing program with a
            bank
            allowing it to extend its payment terms on certain merchandise purchases.
            The
            substance of the program is for the Company to borrow money from the
            bank to
            finance purchases from vendors. The Company records any discount given
            by the
            vendor to the value of its inventory and accretes this discount to the
            resulting
            short-term payable to the bank through interest expense over the extended
            term.
            At December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, $127,543 and $119,351, respectively,
            was payable to the bank by the Company under this program and is included
            in the
            accompanying consolidated balance sheets as Financed Vendor Accounts
            Payable.

Lease
            Accounting

The
            Company leases certain store locations, distribution centers, office
            space,
            equipment and vehicles, some of which are with related parties. Initial
            terms
            for facility leases are typically 10 to 15 years, followed by additional
            terms
            containing renewal options at 5 year intervals, and may include rent
            escalation
            clauses. The total amount of the minimum rent is expensed on a straight-line
            basis over the initial term of the lease unless external economic factors
            exist
            such that renewals are reasonably assured, in which case the Company
            would
            include the renewal period in its amortization period.

In
            those
            instances the renewal period would be included in the lease term for
            purposes of
            establishing an amortization period and determining if such lease qualified
            as a
            capital or operating lease.

In
            addition to minimum fixed rentals, some leases provide for contingent
            facility
            rentals. Contingent facility rentals are determined on the basis of a
            percentage
            of sales in excess of stipulated minimums for certain store facilities
            as
            defined in the individual lease agreements. Most of the leases provide
            that the
            Company pay taxes, maintenance, insurance and certain other expenses
            applicable
            to the leased premises and include options to renew. Management expects
            that, in
            the normal course of business, leases that expire will be renewed or
            replaced by
            other leases.

Closed
            Store Liabilities

The
            Company continually reviews the operating performance of its existing
            store
            locations and closes certain locations identified as under performing.
            Closing
            an under performing location has not resulted in the elimination of the
            operations and associated cash flows from the Company’s ongoing operations as
            the Company transfers those operations to another location in the local
            market.
            The Company maintains closed store liabilities that include liabilities
            for
            these exit activities and liabilities assumed through past acquisitions
            that are
            similar in nature but recorded by the acquired companies prior to acquisition.

New
            provisions established for closed store liabilities include the present
            value of
            the remaining lease obligations and management’s estimate of future costs of
            insurance, property tax and common area maintenance reduced by the present
            value
            of estimated revenues from subleases and lease buyouts and are established
            by a
            charge to selling, general and administrative costs in the accompanying
            consolidated statements of operations at the time the facilities actually
            close.

From
            time
            to time these estimates require revisions that affect the amount of the
            recorded
            liability. This change in estimate relates primarily to changes in assumptions
            associated with the revenue from subleases. The effect of changes in
            estimates
            for the closed store liabilities is netted with new provisions and included
            in
            selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated
            statements of operations. Closed store liabilities are recorded in accrued
            expenses (current portion) and other long-term liabilities (long-term
            portion)
            in the

New
            Accounting Pronouncements

In
            February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for
            Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.” SFAS No. 159 permits entities to
            choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items
            at fair
            value. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November
            15,
            2007. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No.
            159.

In
            September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for
            Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment
            of FASB
            Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R).” SFAS No. 158 requires recognition of
            the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit postretirement
            plans as
            an asset or liability in the statement of financial position and to recognize
            changes in that funded status in comprehensive income in the year in
            which the
            changes occur. SFAS No. 158 also requires measurement of the funded status
            of a
            plan as of the date of the statement of financial position. The Company
            adopted
            the recognition provisions of SFAS No. 158 on December 30, 2006 and recorded
            a
            reduction to the liability of $5,357 and increase to other comprehensive
            income
            of $3,316, net of tax (see Note 17). SFAS No. 158 is effective for the
            measurement date provisions for fiscal years ending after December 15,
            2008. The
            Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the measurement
            provisions of SFAS No. 158.

In
            September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, staff
            issued
            Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, “Considering the Effects of Prior Year
            Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
            Statements,” or SAB 108.

SAB
            was issued in order to eliminate the diversity in practice surrounding
            how
            public companies quantify financial statement misstatements.

SAB 108
            requires that registrants quantify errors using both a balance sheet
            and income
            statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in a
            misstated
            amount that, when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are
            considered, is material. SAB 108 is effective for financial statements
            covering
            the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. The Company adopted
            SAB 108 for the year ended December 30, 2006 with no impact on its
            consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash
            flows.

In
            September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.”
SFAS No. 157 clarifies the definition of fair value, establishes a framework
            for
            measuring fair value, and expands the disclosures on fair value measurements.
            SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
            2007. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No.
            157.

In
            July
            2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in
            Income Taxes,” or FIN 48.  FIN 48 clarifies the accounting and reporting
            for income taxes recognized in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for
            Income Taxes.” The interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and
            measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition, measurement,
            presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected
            to be
            taken in income tax returns. FIN 48 is

effective
            for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company will adopt
            the provisions of FIN 48 as of December 31, 2006. Accordingly, the Company
            estimates a cumulative effect adjustment will be recorded to reduce its
            retained
            earnings by an amount less than $8,000 upon initial adoption.

In
            March
            2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156, “Accounting for Servicing of Financial
            Assets - an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140.” SFAS No. 156 amends SFAS
            No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and
            Extinguishments of Liabilities,” with respect to the accounting for separately
            recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities. SFAS No. 156 is
            effective
            for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006. The Company does not
            expect the adoption of SFAS No. 156 to have a material impact on its
            financial
            condition, results of operations or cash flows.

In
            February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, “Accounting for Certain Hybrid
            Financial Instruments - an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140.” This
            statement simplifies accounting for certain hybrid instruments currently
            governed by SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
            Activities,”

by
            eliminating the restriction on passive derivative instruments that a
            qualifying
            special-purpose entity may hold. SFAS No. 155 is effective for financial
            instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of our fiscal year
            2007. The
            Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 155 to have a material
            impact
            on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

3.
            Acquisitions:

On
            September 14, 2005, the Company acquired Autopart International, Inc.,
            or AI.
            The acquisition, which included 61 stores throughout New England and
            New York, a
            distribution center and AI’s wholesale distribution business, complements the
            Company’s growing presence in the Northeast. AI serves the growing commercial
            market in addition to warehouse distributors and jobbers.

The
              acquisition has been accounted for under the provisions of SFAS No.
              141,
“Business Combinations”, or SFAS No. 141. The total purchase price of $87,626
              primarily consisted of $74,940 paid upon closing and an additional
              $12,500 of
              contingent consideration paid in March 2006 based upon AI satisfying
              certain
              earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization targets
              through
              December 31, 2005. Furthermore, an additional $12,500 is payable upon
              the
              achievement of certain merchandise cost reduction synergies through
              fiscal 2008.
              In accordance with SFAS No. 141, this additional payment does not represent
              contingent consideration and will be reflected in the statement of
              operations
              when considered probable and estimable. The Company recognized $3,114
              in cost of
              goods sold due to such synergies for the year ended December 30,
              2006.

During
            the third quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company finalized the allocation
            of the
            purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company
            allocated $29,000 to intangible assets based on a valuation study. A
            portion of
            these intangible assets are subject to amortization and are being amortized
            over
            their estimated useful lives ranging from 5 to 10 years using straight-line
            methods. Remaining adjustments to the fair value of assets and liabilities
            acquired primarily included inventory and deferred income taxes. Accordingly,
            the Company’s initial goodwill balance was adjusted down to $17,625 as a result
            of these adjustments, all of which is deductible for tax purposes. The
            following
            table summarizes the final allocation of amounts assigned to assets acquired
            and
            liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition:

            Catastrophic Losses and Insurance Recoveries:

During
            the second half of fiscal 2005, the Company suffered losses resulting
            from
            Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma as well as two stores damaged by fire.
            The
            Company estimated and recognized the fixed costs of these events including
            the
            write-off of damaged merchandise at cost, damaged capital assets at net
            book
            value and required repair costs. Moreover, these hurricanes caused significant
            sales disruptions primarily from store closures, stores operating on
            limited
            hours and lower sales trends due to evacuations. The Company also incurred
            and
            recognized incremental expenses associated with compensating team members
            for
            scheduled work hours for which stores were closed and food and supplies
            provided
            to team members and their families. While these costs and sales disruptions
            were
            not recoverable from the Company’s insurance carrier, the Company did maintain
            property insurance against the fixed costs of the related physical damage
            including the recovery of damaged merchandise at retail values and damaged
            capital assets at replacement cost. Prior to December 31, 2005, the Company
            and
            the insurance carrier settled in full a claim for the retail value of
            certain
            merchandise inventory damaged by Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma. The Company
            evaluated and recognized a receivable for the recovery of these fixed
            costs, net
            of deductibles. The following table represents the net impact of certain
            insured
            fixed costs less recoveries as reflected in the selling, general and
            administrative line of the accompanying consolidated statement of operations
            for
            the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005. At December 30, 2006 and December
            31,
            2005, two and seven stores, respectively remain closed as a result of
            these
            events.

                                      disruptions.

During
            the year ended December 30, 2006, the Company lost one store location
            due to
            fire and received additional recoveries as the Company settled additional
            hurricane claims for damaged inventory at retail value and for damaged
            capital
            assets at replacement value. Accordingly, earnings for the year ended
            December
            30, 2006 reflected $1,388 of insurance recoveries, net of
            deductibles.

The
            Company expects to recognize additional recoveries in future quarters
            primarily
            representing the remaining retail value of damaged merchandise and the
            replacement value of damaged capital assets not previously settled.

6.
            Discontinued Operations:

In
            fiscal
            2003, the Company discontinued the supply of merchandise to its Wholesale
            Distribution Network, or Wholesale. Wholesale consisted of independently
            owned
            and operated dealer locations, for which the Company supplied merchandise
            inventory. This component of the Company’s business operated in the Company’s
            previously reported wholesale segment. For the fiscal year ended January
            1,
            2005, the operating results related to the discontinued wholesale business
            were
            minimal as a result of recognizing an estimate of exit costs in fiscal
            2003.

In
            August
            2005, the Company began using a new third party provider to process its
            private
            label credit card transactions related to its commercial business. In
            conjunction with this transition, the Company sold the credit card portfolio
            for
            proceeds totaling $33,904. Accordingly, the Company’s previously recorded
            receivable balance recognized under SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and
            Servicing of Financial Assets”, of $34,684 and the corresponding allowance for
            doubtful accounts of $2,580 were reduced to zero. Additionally, the Company
            repaid its borrowings previously secured by these trade receivables;
            the overall
            impact was a benefit of $1,800 recorded as a reduction of bad debt expense
            in
            selling, general and administrative expenses.

            Inventories, net

Inventories
            are stated at the lower of cost or market, cost being determined using
            the
            last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method for approximately 93% of inventories
            at both
            December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005. Under the LIFO method, the Company’s
            cost of sales reflects the costs of the most currently purchased inventories
            while the inventory carrying balance represents the costs relating to
            prices
            paid in prior years. The Company’s costs to acquire inventory have been
            generally decreasing in recent years as a result of its significant growth.
            Accordingly, the cost to replace inventory is less than the LIFO balances
            carried for similar product. As a result of the LIFO method and the ability
            to
            obtain lower product costs, the Company recorded a reduction to cost
            of sales of
            $9,978 for fiscal year ended 2006, an increase in cost of sales of $526
            for
            fiscal year ended 2005 and a reduction to cost of sales of $11,212 for
            fiscal
            year ended 2004.

The
            remaining inventories are comprised of product cores, which consist of
            the
            non-consumable portion of certain parts and batteries and are valued
            under the
            first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method. Core values are included as part
            of our
            merchandise costs and are either passed on to the customer or returned
            to the
            vendor. Additionally, these products are not subject to the frequent
            cost
            changes like our other merchandise inventory, thus, there is no material
            difference from applying either the LIFO or FIFO valuation methods.

The
            Company capitalizes certain purchasing and warehousing costs into inventory.
            Purchasing and warehousing costs included in inventory, at FIFO, at December
            30,
            2006 and December 31, 2005, were $95,576 and $92,833, respectively. Inventories
            consist of the following:

December

Inventory
            quantities are tracked through a perpetual inventory system. The Company
            uses a
            cycle counting program in all distribution centers, Parts Delivered Quickly
            warehouses, or PDQs, Local Area Warehouses, or LAWs, and retail stores
            to ensure
            the accuracy of the perpetual inventory quantities of both merchandise
            and core
            inventory.

The
            Company establishes reserves for estimated shrink based on historical
            accuracy
            and effectiveness of the cycle counting program. The Company also establishes
            reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories based on current
            inventory levels and the historical analysis of product sales and current
            market
            conditions. The nature of the Company’s inventory is such that the risk of
            obsolescence is minimal and excess inventory has historically been returned
            to
            the Company’s vendors for credit. The Company provides reserves when less than
            full credit is expected from a vendor or when liquidating product will
            result in
            retail prices below recorded costs. The Company’s reserves against inventory for
            these matters were $31,376 and $22,825 at December 30, 2006 and December
            31,
            2005, respectively.

9.
            Property and Equipment:

Property
            and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures
            for maintenance and repairs are charged directly to expense when incurred;
            major
            improvements are capitalized. When items are sold or retired, the related
            cost
            and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, with any
            gain or
            loss reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.

Depreciation
            of land improvements, buildings, furniture, fixtures and equipment, and
            vehicles
            is provided over the estimated useful lives, which range from 2 to 40
            years, of
            the respective assets using the straight-line method.

Depreciation
            of building and leasehold improvements is provided over the shorter of

            original useful lives of the respective assets or the term of the lease
            using

            term of
            the lease unless external economic factors exist such that renewals are
            reasonably assured in which case, the renewal period would be included
            in the
            lease term for purposes of establishing an amortization period. Depreciation
            expense was $138,064, $119,938 and $104,877 for the fiscal years ended
            2006,

On
            October 5, 2006, the Company entered into a new $750,000 unsecured five-year
            revolving credit facility with Advance Stores Company, Incorporated,
            a
            subsidiary of the Company, serving as the borrower. This new facility
            replaced
            the Company’s term loans and revolver under the previous credit facility.
            Proceeds from this revolving loan were used to repay $433,775 of principal
            outstanding on the Company’s term loans and revolver under its previous
            credit facility. In conjunction with this refinancing, the Company wrote-off
            existing deferred financing costs related to the Company’s previous term loans
            and revolver. The write-off of these costs of $1,887 was combined with
            a related
            gain on settlement of interest rate swaps of $2,873 for a net gain on
            extinguishment of debt of $986.

Additionally,
            the new revolving credit facility provides for the issuance of letters
            of credit
            with a sub limit of $300,000 and swingline loans in an amount not to
            exceed
            $50,000. The Company may request that the total revolving commitment
            be
            increased by an amount not exceeding $250,000 during the term of the
            credit
            agreement. Voluntary prepayments and voluntary reductions of the revolving
            balance are permitted in whole or in part, at the Company’s option, in minimum
            principal amounts as specified in the new revolving credit facility.

As
            of
            December 30

,
            2006,
            the Company had borrowed $476,800 under the revolver and had $66,768
            in letters
            of credit outstanding, which reduced availability under the new revolver
            to
            $206,432. In addition to the letters of credit, the Company maintains
            approximately $2,527 in surety bonds issued by its insurance provider
            primarily
            to utility providers and the departments of revenue for certain states.
            These
            letters of credit and surety bonds generally have a term of one year
            or
            less.

The
            interest rates on borrowings under the new revolving credit facility
            will be
            based, at the Company’s option, on an adjusted LIBOR rate, plus a margin, or an
            alternate base rate, plus a margin. After an initial interest period,
            the
            Company may elect to convert a particular borrowing to a different type.
            The
            initial margin is 0.75% and 0.0% per annum for the adjusted LIBOR and
            alternate
            base rate borrowings, respectively. A commitment fee will be charged
            on the
            unused portion of the revolver, payable in arrears. The initial commitment
            fee
            rate is 0.150% per annum. Under the terms of the new revolving credit
            facility,
            the interest rate spread and commitment fee will be based on the Company’s
            credit rating. The revolving credit facility terminates on October 5,
            2011.

The
            new
            revolving credit facility is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by
            Advance
            Auto Parts, Inc. The facility contains covenants restricting the ability
            of the
            Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things, (1) create, incur
            or assume
            additional debt (including hedging arrangements), (2) incur liens or
            engage in
            sale-leaseback transactions, (3) make loans and investments, (4) guarantee
            obligations, (5) engage in certain mergers, acquisitions and asset sales,
            (6)
            engage in transactions with affiliates, (7) change the nature of the
            Company’s
            business and the business conducted by its subsidiaries and (8) change
            the
            holding company status of the Company. The Company is required to comply
            with
            financial covenants with respect to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum
            coverage ratio. The new revolving credit facility also provides for customary
            events of default, including non-payment defaults, covenant defaults
            and
            cross-defaults to the Company’s other material indebtedness.

In
            fiscal
            2004, the Company wrote-off existing deferred financing costs as a result
            of
            refinancing its outstanding term loans. The write-off of these costs
            combined
            with the related refinancing costs incurred to set up the credit facility
            resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $2,818 in the accompanying
            consolidated statements of operations for the year ended January 1, 2005.
            During
            fiscal 2004, prior to the refinancing of its credit facility, the Company
            repaid
            $105,000 in debt prior to its scheduled maturity. In conjunction with
            these
            partial repayments, the Company wrote-off deferred financing costs in
            the amount
            of $412, which is classified as a loss on extinguishment of debt in the
            accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended
            January 1,
            2005.

The
            Company was in compliance with the above covenants under the revolving
            credit
            facility at December 30, 2006.

At
            December 30, 2006, the aggregate future annual maturities of long-term
            debt are

            Stock Repurchase Program:

During
            fiscal 2005, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase
            up to $300,000 of the Company’s common stock plus related expenses. The program,
            which became effective August 15, 2005, replaced the remaining portion
            of a
            previous stock repurchase program. The program allows the Company to
            repurchase
            its common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions
            from
            time to time in accordance with the requirements of the Securities and
            Exchange
            Commission. As of December 30, 2006, the Company had repurchased a total
            of
            5,209 shares of common stock under the program, at an aggregate cost
            of
            $196,013, or an average price of $37.63 per share, excluding related
            expenses.
            At December 30, 2006, the Company had $103,987, excluding related expenses,
            available for future stock repurchases under the stock repurchase
            program.

During
            fiscal 2006, the Company retired 5,117 shares of common stock which were
            previously repurchased under the Company’s current stock repurchase
            program.

Deferred
            income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years
            of
            differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their
            financial
            reporting amounts at each period-end, based on enacted tax laws and statutory
            income tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are
            expected
            to affect taxable income. Deferred income taxes reflect the net income
            tax
            effect of temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities
            for
            financial reporting purposes and for income tax reporting purposes. Net
            deferred
            income tax balances are comprised of the following:

At
            December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, the Company has cumulative net
            deferred
            income tax liabilities of $67,662 and $72,087, respectively. The gross
            deferred
            income tax assets also include state net operating loss carryforwards,
            or NOLs,
            of approximately $1,752 and $1,579, respectively. These NOLs may be used
            to
            reduce future taxable income and expire periodically through fiscal year
            2024.
            Due to uncertainties related to the realization of certain deferred tax
            assets
            for NOLs in various jurisdictions, the Company recorded a valuation allowance
            of
            $1,174 as of December 30, 2006 and $1,104 as of December 31, 2005. The
            amount of
            deferred income tax assets realizable, however, could change in the near
            future
            if estimates of future taxable income are changed.

The
            Company currently has certain years that are open to audit by the Internal
            Revenue Service. In addition, the Company has certain years that are
            open for
            audit by various state and foreign jurisdictions for income taxes and
            sales, use
            and excise taxes. In management's opinion, any amounts assessed will

            Lease Commitments:

The
            Company leases certain store locations, distribution centers, office
            space,
            equipment and vehicles. Initial terms for facility leases are typically
            10 to 15
            years, followed by additional terms containing renewal options at 5 year
            intervals, and may include rent escalation clauses. The total amount
            of the
            minimum rent is expensed on a straight-line basis over the initial term
            of the
            lease unless external economic factors exist such that renewals are reasonably
            assured, in which case the Company would include the renewal period in
            its
            amortization period. In addition to minimum fixed rentals, some leases
            provide
            for contingent facility rentals. Contingent facility rentals are determined
            on
            the basis of a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated minimums for
            certain
            store facilities as

            pays taxes, maintenance, insurance and certain other expenses applicable
            to the
            leased premises and include options to renew. Management expects that,

16.
            Contingencies:

In
            the
            case of all known contingencies, the Company accrues for an obligation,
            including estimated legal costs, when it is probable and the amount is
            reasonably estimable. As facts concerning contingencies become known
            to the
            Company, the Company reassesses its position with respect to accrued
            liabilities
            and other potential exposures. Estimates that are particularly sensitive
            to
            future change include tax and legal matters, which are subject to change
            as
            events evolve, and as additional information becomes available during
            the
            administrative and litigation process.

The
            Company’s Western Auto subsidiary, together with other defendants including
            automobile manufacturers, automotive parts manufacturers and other retailers,
            has been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging injury as a result
            of
            exposure to asbestos-containing products. The Company and some of its
            subsidiaries also have been named as defendants in many of these lawsuits.
            The
            plaintiffs have alleged that these products were manufactured, distributed
            and/or sold by the various defendants. To date, these products have included
            brake and clutch parts and roofing materials. Many of the cases pending
            against
            the Company or its subsidiaries are in the early stages of litigation.
            The
            damages claimed against the defendants in some of these proceedings are
            substantial. Additionally, some of the automotive parts manufacturers
            named as
            defendants in these lawsuits have declared bankruptcy, which will limit
            plaintiffs’ ability to recover monetary damages from those defendants. Although
            the Company diligently

defends
            against these claims, the Company may enter into discussions regarding
            settlement of these and other lawsuits, and may enter into settlement
            agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interests of the
            Company’s
            shareholders. The Company believes that most of these claims are at least
            partially covered by insurance. Based on discovery to date, the Company
            does not
            believe the cases currently pending will have a material adverse effect
            on the
            Company’s operating results, financial position or liquidity. However, if the
            Company was to incur an adverse verdict in one or more of these claims
            and was
            ordered to pay damages that were not covered by insurance, these claims
            could
            have a material adverse affect on its operating results, financial position
            and
            liquidity. If the number of claims filed against the Company or any of
            its
            subsidiaries alleging injury as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing
            products increases substantially, the costs associated with concluding
            these
            claims, including damages resulting from any adverse verdicts, could
            have a
            material adverse effect on its operating results, financial position
            or
            liquidity in future periods.

The
            Company is involved in various types of legal proceedings arising from
            claims of
            employment discrimination or other types of employment matters as a result
            of
            claims by current and former employees. The damages claimed against the
            Company
            in some of these proceedings are substantial; however, because of the
            uncertainty of the outcome of such legal proceedings and because the
            Company’s
            liability, if any, arising from such legal matters, including the size
            of any
            damages awarded if plaintiffs are successful in litigation or any negotiated
            settlement, could vary widely, the Company cannot reasonably estimate
            the
            possible loss or range of loss which may arise. The Company is also involved
            in
            various other claims and legal proceedings arising in the normal course
            of
            business. Although the final outcome of these legal matters cannot be
            determined, based on the facts presently known, it is management’s opinion that
            the final outcome of such claims and lawsuits will not have a material
            adverse
            effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or
            liquidity.

The
            Company is self-insured for general and automobile liability, workers'
            compensation and the health care claims of its team members although
            the Company
            maintains stop-loss coverage with third-party insurers to limit its total
            liability exposure. Liabilities associated with these losses are calculated
            for
            claims filed and claims incurred but not yet reported at the Company's
            estimate
            of their ultimate cost based upon analyses of historical data, demographic
            and
            severity factors and periodic valuations provided by third-party actuaries.
            Management monitors new claims and claim development as well as negative
            trends
            related to the claims incurred but not reported in order to assess the
            adequacy
            of the Company’s insurance reserves. While the Company does not expect the
            amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from its estimates, the
            self-insurance reserves could be affected if future claim experience
            differs
            significantly from the historical trends and the actuarial
            assumptions.

The
            Company accrues for tax contingencies when it is probable that a liability
            to a
            taxing authority has been incurred and the amount of the contingency
            can be
            reasonably estimated, based on past experience. The Company’s tax contingency
            reserve is adjusted for changes in circumstances and additional uncertainties,
            such as significant amendments to existing tax law, both legislated and
            concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems. The Company had
            a tax contingency reserve of $6,415 and $7,588 at December 30, 2006 and
            December
            31, 2005, respectively. It is the opinion of the Company’s management that the
            possibility is remote that costs in excess of those reserved for will
            have a
            material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position, results of
            operations or liquidity. The Company’s accounting for income tax contingencies
            will change subsequent to December 30, 2006 upon the adoption of FIN
            48.

The
              Company has entered into employment agreements with certain team members
              that
              provide severance pay benefits under certain circumstances after a
              change in
              control of the Company or upon termination of the team member by the
              Company.
              The maximum contingent liability under these employment agreements
              is
              approximately $5,590 and $1,617 at December 30, 2006 and December 31,
              2005,
              respectively, of which nothing has been accrued.

              Benefit Plans:

401(k)
              Plan

The
              Company maintains a defined contribution team member benefit plan,
              which covers
              substantially all team members after one year of service and who have
              attained
              the age of twenty-one. The plan allows for team member salary

deferrals,
              which are matched at the Company’s discretion. Company contributions were
              $7,726, $6,779 and $6,752 in fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004,
              respectively.

Deferred
            Compensation

During
            the third quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company established an unqualified
            deferred compensation plan for certain team members. The Company has
            accounted
            for the unqualified deferred compensation plan in accordance with EITF
            97-14,
“Accounting for Deferred Compensation Arrangements Where Amounts Earned
            Are Held
            in a Rabbi Trust and Invested.” The liability related to the former Discount
            deferred compensation plan, which was terminated in May 2002, was merged
            into
            the new plan. This plan provides for a minimum and maximum deferral percentage
            of the team member’s base salary and bonus, as determined by the Retirement Plan
            Committee. The Company establishes and maintains a deferred compensation
            liability for this plan. The Company funds this liability by remitting
            the team
            member’s deferrals to a Rabbi Trust where these deferrals are invested in
            certain life insurance contracts. Accordingly, any change in the cash
            surrender
            value on these contracts, which are held in the Rabbi Trust to fund the
            deferred
            compensation liability, is recognized in the Company’s consolidated statement of
            operations. At December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005 these liabilities
            were
            $3,402 and $2,693, respectively.

Postretirement
            Plan

The
            Company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for
            eligible
            retired team members through a postretirement plan, or the Plan. These
            benefits
            are subject to deductibles, co-payment provisions and other limitations.
            The
            Plan has no assets and is funded on a cash basis as benefits are paid.
            During
            the second quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company amended the Plan to exclude
            outpatient prescription drug benefits to Medicare eligible retirees effective
            January 1, 2006. Due to this plan amendment, the Company's accumulated
            postretirement benefit obligation was reduced by $7,557, resulting in
            an
            unrecognized prior service cost in the same amount. The unrecognized
            prior
            service cost is being amortized over the 13-year estimated remaining
            life
            expectancy of the plan participants as allowed under SFAS No. 106, “Employers
            Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions.”

Other
            financial information related to the plans was determined by the Company’s
            independent actuaries. The measurement date used by the actuaries was
            October 31
            of each fiscal year. The following provides a reconciliation of the accrued
            benefit obligation included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying
            consolidated balance sheets, recorded and the funded status of the plan
            as of
            December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005:

            9.5% for 2009, 8.5% for 2010, 8.0% for 2011, 7.0% for 2012 and 5.0% to
            6.0% for
            2013 and thereafter. If the health care cost were increased 1% for all
            future
            years the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation would have increased
            by
            $285 as of December 30, 2006. The effect of this change on the combined
            service
            and interest cost would have been an increase of $26 for 2006. If the
            health
            care cost were decreased 1% for all future years the accumulated postretirement
            benefit obligation would have decreased by $258 as of December 30, 2006.
            The
            effect of this change on the combined service and interest cost would
            have been
            a decrease of $25 for 2006.

The
            postretirement benefit obligation and net periodic postretirement benefit
            cost
            was computed using the following weighted average discount rates as determined

The
            Company expects plan contributions to completely offset benefits paid.
            The
            following table summarizes the Company's expected benefit payments (net

The
            Company reserves the right to change or terminate the benefits or contributions
            at any time. The Company also continues to evaluate ways in which it
            can better
            manage these benefits and control costs. Any changes in the plan or revisions
            to
            assumptions that affect the amount of expected future benefits may have
            a
            significant impact on the amount of the reported obligation, annual expense
            and
            projected benefit payments.

The
            Company adopted SFAS No. 158 on December 30, 2006. As a result, the Company
            recorded an actuarial gain to accumulated other comprehensive income,
            net of
            tax, and recognized previously unamortized prior service cost that had
            not yet
            been included in net periodic postretirement benefit cost as of December
            30,
            2006. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 had no impact on net income, but increased
            comprehensive income by $3,316, net of tax. The table below shows the
            incremental effect of applying SFAS No. 158 on individual line items
            in the
            Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 30, 2006:

At
            December 30, 2006, the net unrealized gain on the postretirement plan
            consists
            of an unrealized gain of $5,951 related to prior service cost and an
            unrealized
            net loss of $594 related to actuarial losses. Approximately $581 of the
            unrealized gain related to prior service cost is expected to be recognized
            as a
            component of net periodic postretirement benefit cost in fiscal
            2007.

18.
            Share-Based Compensation Plans:

The
            Company has share-based compensation plans as allowed under its long-term
            incentive plan, or LTIP, which includes fixed stock options and deferred
            stock
            units, or DSUs. The stock options authorized to be granted are non-qualified
            stock options and terminate on the seventh anniversary of the grant date.
            Additionally, the stock options vest over a three-year period in equal
            installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date and
            contain no
            post-vesting restrictions other than normal trading black-out periods
            prescribed
            by the Company’s corporate governance policies. The Company grants DSUs annually
            to its Board of Directors as provided for in the Advance Auto Parts,
            Inc.
            Deferred Stock Unit Plan for Non-Employee Directors and Selected Executives,
            or
            the DSU Plan. Each DSU is equivalent to one share of common stock of
            the
            Company. The DSUs are immediately vested upon issuance but are held on
            behalf of
            the director until he or she ceases to be a director. The DSUs are then
            distributed to the director following his or her last date of service.
            Additionally, the DSU Plan provides for the deferral of compensation
            as earned
            in the form of an annual retainer for board members and wages for certain
            highly
            compensated employees of the Company. These deferred stock units are
            settled in
            common stock with the participants at a future date or over a specified
            time
            period as elected by the participants in accordance with the DSU
            Plan.

The
            aggregate intrinsic value in the preceding table is based on the Company’s
            closing stock price of $35.56 as of the last trading day of the period
            ended
            December 30, 2006. The aggregate intrinsic value of options (the amount
            by which
            the market price of the stock on the date of exercise exceeded the exercise
            price of the option) exercised during the fiscal years ended December
            30, 2006,
            December 31, 2005 and January 1, 2005, was $14,001, $77,611 and $60,793,
            respectively. As of December 30, 2006, there was $26,304 of unrecognized
            compensation expense related to non-vested fixed stock options that is
            expected
            to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.8 years.

The
            weighted average fair value of stock options granted during the fiscal
            years
            ended December 30, 2006, December 31, 2005 and January 1, 2005, was $10.68,
            $10.54 and $8.28 per share, respectively. The fair value of each stock
            option
            was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
            model
            with the following weighted average assumptions:

The
                      risk-free interest rate is based on a U.S. Treasury constant
                      maturity
                      interest rate whose term is consistent with the expected life
                      of the
                      Company’s stock options.

The
                      Company declared its first ever cash dividend beginning in
                      its first
                      quarter of 2006.

(4)

Expected
                      volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s common
                      stock for the period consistent with the expected life of the
                      Company’s
                      stock options.

(5)

The
                      expected life of the Company’s stock options represents the estimated
                      period of time until exercise and is based on historical experience
                      of
                      such awards.

The
            Company granted seven and six DSUs in fiscal years 2006 and 2005, respectively
            at a weighted average fair value of $38.35 and $39.65, respectively.
            The DSUs
            are awarded at a price equal to the market price of the Company’s underlying
            stock on the date of the grant. For fiscal years 2006 and 2005, respectively,
            the Company recognized a total of $285 and $237, on a pre-tax basis,
            in
            compensation expense related to these DSU grants.

Additionally,
            the DSU Plan provides for the deferral of compensation as earned in the
            form of
            an annual retainer for board members and wages for certain highly compensated
            employees of the Company. These deferred stock units are payable to the
            participants at a future date or over a specified time period as elected
            by the
            participants in accordance with the DSU Plan.

A
            total
            of 8,620 of shares were originally authorized under the LTIP. At December
            30,
            2006, there are 4,565 shares currently available for future issuance
            under the
            LTIP. The Company issues new shares of common stock upon exercise of
            stock
            options. Subsequent to December 30, 2006, the Company granted 1,440 stock
            appreciation rights to be settled in the Company’s common stock at a conversion
            price of $38.03 and 143 shares of restricted stock at a price of
            $38.03.

The
            Company also offers an employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP. Through
            2005 all
            eligible employees, or team members, could elect to have a portion of
            compensation paid in the form of Company stock in lieu of cash calculated
            at 85%
            of fair market value at the beginning or end of the quarterly purchase
            period
            whichever was lower. Effective January 1, 2006, the ESPP was amended
            such that
            eligible team members may purchase common stock at 95% of fair market
            value at
            the date of purchase. There are annual limitations on team member elections
            of
            either $25 per team member or ten percent of compensation, whichever
            is less.
            Under the plan, team members acquired 90, 110 and 177 shares in fiscal
            years
            2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. At December 30, 2006, there were 1,461
            shares
            available to be issued under the plan.

19.
            Fair Value of Financial Instruments:

The
            carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, bank overdrafts,
            accounts payable, borrowings secured by receivables and current portion
            of
            long-term debt approximates fair value because of the short maturity
            of those
            instruments. The carrying amount for variable rate long-term debt approximates
            fair value for similar issues available to the Company. The Company’s interest
            rate swaps are presented at fair value as stated in its accounting policy
            on
            hedge activities (Note 2).

20.
            Segment and Related Information:

The
              Company has the following two reportable segments: Advance Auto Parts,
              or AAP,
              and AI. The AAP segment is comprised of store operations within the
              United
              States, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands which operate under the
              trade names
“Advance Auto Parts,” “Discount Advance Auto Parts” and “Western Auto.” These
              stores offer a broad selection of brand name and proprietary automotive
              replacement parts, accessories and maintenance items for domestic and
              imported
              cars and light trucks, with no significant concentration in any specific
              product
              area.

The
              AI
              segment consists solely of the operations of Autopart International,
              which
              continues to operate as an independent, wholly-owned subsidiary. AI’s business
              serves the growing commercial market in addition to warehouse distributors
              and
              jobbers located throughout the Northeastern region of the United States.
              The
              Company acquired AI in September 2005.

The
            Company evaluates each of its segment’s financial performance based on net sales
            and operating profit for purposes of making decisions and allocating
            resources.
            The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those
            described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note
            2.

The
            following table summarizes financial information for each of the Company's
            business segments for the years ended December 30, 2006 and December 31,
            2005, respectively.

We
            have
            audited the consolidated financial statements of Advance Auto Parts,
            Inc. and
            subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005,
            and
            for each of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2006 (which
            report
            expresses an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and includes
            an
            explanatory paragraph regarding the Company’s adoption of new accounting
            standards), management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s
            internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2006, and
            the
            effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
            December 30, 2006, and have issued our reports thereon dated February
            27, 2007;
            such consolidated financial statements and reports are included elsewhere
            in
            this Form 10-K. Our audits also included the consolidated financial statement
            schedules of the Company listed in Item 15(a)(2). These consolidated
            financial
            statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
            responsibility is to express an opinion based on our audits. In our opinion,
            such consolidated financial statement schedules, when considered in relation
            to
            the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present
            fairly, in
            all material respects, the information set forth therein.

1.
                    Presentation

These
                    condensed financial statements have been prepared pursuant to
                    the rules and
                    regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain
                    information and
                    note disclosures normally included in annual financial statements
                    prepared in
                    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
                    United States of
                    America have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules
                    and regulations,
                    although management believes that the disclosures made are adequate
                    to make the
                    information presented not misleading.

2.
                    Organization

Advance
                    Auto Parts, Inc. (“the Company”) is a holding company, which was the 100%
                    shareholder of Advance Stores Company, Incorporated and its subsidiaries
                    ("Stores") during the periods presented. The parent/subsidiary
                    relationship
                    between the Company and Stores includes certain related party
                    transactions.
                    These transactions consist primarily of interest on intercompany
                    advances,
                    dividends, capital contributions and allocations of certain costs.
                    Deferred
                    income taxes have not been provided for financial reporting and
                    tax basis
                    differences on the undistributed earnings of the subsidiaries.

The
                    Company fully and unconditionally guarantees the revolving credit
                    facility of
                    Stores.

3.
                    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Accounting
                    Period

The
                    Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of
                    December, which
                    results in an extra week every six years. All fiscal years presented
                    include 52
                    weeks of operations.

New
                    Accounting Pronouncements

In
                    February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for
                    Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.” SFAS No. 159 permits entities to
                    choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other
                    items at fair
                    value. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
                    November 15,
                    2007. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of SFAS
                    No.
                    159.

In
                    September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.”
SFAS No. 157 clarifies the definition of fair value, establishes
                    a framework for
                    measuring fair value, and expands the disclosures on fair value
                    measurements.
                    SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
                    2007. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of SFAS
                    No.
                    157.

In
                    July
                    2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in
                    Income Taxes,” or FIN 48.  FIN 48 clarifies the accounting and reporting
                    for income taxes recognized in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
“Accounting for
                    Income Taxes.” The interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and
                    measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition,
                    measurement,
                    presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken
                    or expected to be
                    taken in income tax returns. FIN 48 is

effective
                    for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company does not
                    expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on its
                    financial
                    condition, results of operations or cash flows as the Company
                    utilizes the
                    separate return method of allocating income taxes to the separate
                    financial
                    statements of the consolidated entity.

                    Disclosures.
