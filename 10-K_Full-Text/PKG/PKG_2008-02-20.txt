General

Packaging Corporation of America (we, us, our, "PCA" or the "Company") is the sixth largest producer of containerboard and corrugated products in the United
States in terms of production capacity. With 2007 net sales of $2.3 billion, PCA produced approximately 2.4 million tons of containerboard, of which about 80% was consumed in PCA's
corrugated products manufacturing plants, 12% was sold to domestic customers and 8% was sold to the export market. Our corrugated products manufacturing plants sold about 31.2 billion square
feet (BSF) of corrugated products.

In 2007, we produced 1.5 million tons of kraft linerboard at our mills located in Counce, Tennessee and Valdosta, Georgia, and 0.9 million tons of
semi-chemical corrugating medium at our mills located in Tomahawk, Wisconsin and Filer City, Michigan. We currently lease the cutting rights to approximately 102,000 acres of
timberland located near our Counce and Valdosta mills. We also have supply agreements on approximately 370,000 acres of timberland.

Our
corrugated products manufacturing plants produce a wide variety of corrugated packaging products, including conventional shipping containers used to protect and transport
manufactured goods, multi-color boxes, and displays with strong visual appeal that help to merchandise the packaged product in retail locations. In addition, we are a large producer of meat boxes and
wax-coated boxes for the agricultural industry.

Corporate Developments

On April 12, 1999, Pactiv Corporation, formerly known as Tenneco Packaging Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Tenneco Inc., sold its
containerboard and corrugated products business to PCA, an entity formed by Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC, a private equity investment firm.

On
January 28, 2000, PCA became a publicly traded company with the initial public offering of its common stock.

In
December 2005, PCA Holdings LLC, an entity organized and controlled by Madison Dearborn, sold 17,825,000 shares of PCA common stock in a secondary offering. Concurrent
with the closing of the secondary offering, we purchased 4,500,000 shares of common stock directly from PCA Holdings LLC at the same net price per share received by PCA Holdings LLC in the
secondary offering. During 2006 and 2007, PCA Holdings LLC distributed its remaining ownership in us through a series of distributions to the respective general and limited partners of Madison
Dearborn Capital Partners III, L.P. (MDCP III) and a fund affiliated with MDCP III.

Corrugated products plants tend to be located in close proximity to customers to minimize freight costs. The U.S. corrugated products industry consists of
approximately 645 companies and 1,355 plants.

Containerboard,
which includes both linerboard and corrugating medium, is the principal raw material used to manufacture corrugated products. Linerboard is used as the inner and outer
facings, or liners, of corrugated products. Corrugating medium is fluted and laminated to linerboard in corrugator plants to produce corrugated sheets. The sheets are subsequently printed, cut, folded
and glued in corrugator plants or sheet plants to produce corrugated products.

Containerboard
may be manufactured from both softwood and hardwood fibers, as well as from recycled fibers from used corrugated and waste from converting operations. Kraft linerboard is
made predominantly from softwoods like pine. Semi-chemical corrugating medium is made from hardwoods such as oak. The finished paper product is wound into large rolls, which are slit to
size as required and shipped to converters.

PCA Operations and Products

Our two linerboard mills can manufacture a broad range of linerboard grades ranging from 26 lb. to 96 lb. Our two semi-chemical
corrugating medium mills can manufacture grades ranging in weight from 21 lb. to 47 lb. All four of our mills have completed an extensive independent review process to become
ISO 9002 certified. ISO 9002 is an international quality certification that verifies a facility maintains and follows stringent procedures for manufacturing, sales and customer service.

The
following four paragraphs describe our four containerboard mills' annual practical maximum capacity, 2007 actual production and production capabilities.

Counce.

Our Counce, Tennessee mill is one of the largest linerboard mills in the United States. Its
production capacity is approximately 1,007,000 tons per year. In 2007, the mill produced 1,028,000 tons of kraft linerboard on its two paper machines. Counce's actual production in 2007
exceeded its capacity due to a production mix consisting of a lower percentage of lightweight linerboard. The mill produces a broad range of basis weights from 26 lb. to 90 lb. The mill
also produces a variety of performance and specialty grades of linerboard.

Valdosta.

Our Valdosta, Georgia mill is a kraft linerboard mill that has a production capacity of
approximately 474,000 tons per year. In 2007, the mill's single paper machine produced 479,000 tons of kraft linerboard. Valdosta's actual production slightly exceeded its capacity due
to a lower percentage of lightweight linerboard production.Valdosta produces linerboard ranging from 33 lb. to 90 lb.


Tomahawk.

Our Tomahawk, Wisconsin mill is one of the largest semi-chemical corrugating medium mills
in the United States, with production capacity of 581,000 tons per year on three paper machines. In April 2005, we completed the indefinite closure of our number three paper machine at Tomahawk
and currently operate the remaining two paper machines, which have a combined production capacity of 516,000 tons. In 2007, the mill produced 517,000 tons of corrugating medium. Tomahawk
produces a
broad range of basis weights from 23 lb. to 40 lb. and a variety of performance and specialty grades of corrugating medium.

Filer City.

Our Filer City, Michigan mill is a semi-chemical corrugating medium mill with
a production capacity of 413,000 tons on three paper machines. In 2007, the mill produced 422,000 tons of corrugating medium. Filer City's actual production exceeded its capacity due to
a reduction in downtime required for maintenance activities and a related increase in productivity. Filer City produces corrugating medium grades ranging in basis weight from 23 lb. to
40 lb.

We
operate 67 corrugated manufacturing operations, a technical and development center, five regional graphic design centers, a rotogravure printing operation and a complement of
packaging supplies and distribution centers. Of the 67 manufacturing facilities, 40 operate as combining operations, commonly called corrugated plants, that manufacture corrugated sheets and finished
corrugated containers. The remaining 27 manufacturing facilities, commonly called sheet plants, purchase combined sheets primarily produced at PCA's combining operations and manufacture finished
corrugated containers.

We
have corrugated manufacturing operations in 26 states in the U.S., with no manufacturing facilities outside of the continental U.S. Each corrugated plant, for the most part, serves a
market radius that typically averages 150 miles. Our sheet plants are generally located in close proximity to our larger corrugated plants, which enables us to offer additional services and
converting capabilities such as small volume and quick turnaround items.

We
produce a wide variety of products ranging from basic corrugated shipping containers to specialized packaging, such as wax-coated boxes for the agriculture industry. We
also have multi-color printing capabilities to make high-impact graphics boxes and displays that offer customers more attractive packaging.

Timberland

Wood fiber is a key raw material for the production of containerboard. To access wood fiber, we currently lease the cutting rights to approximately
102,000 acres of timberland located near our Counce and Valdosta mills. Virtually all of the acres under cutting rights agreements are located within 100 miles of these two mills, which
lowers wood transportation costs and provides a secure source of wood fiber. These leased cutting rights agreements have average remaining terms of approximately 15 years.

During
1999 and 2000, PCA sold about 800,000 acres of timberland. As part of the timberland sale agreements, we entered into supply arrangements covering about
600,000 acres of the total acres sold.
In 2005, the supply agreement related to our Valdosta mill on approximately 200,000 acres was terminated through a mutual agreement because lower cost pulpwood was available in closer proximity
to the mill. We currently have in place supply agreements covering about 370,000 of the 800,000 acres sold. The majority of the acreage under supply agreement is located in close proximity to
our Counce mill. We currently hold an approximate 29% equity ownership interest in approximately 55,000 acres owned by Southern Timber Venture, LLC. This acreage is located
primarily in southern Georgia and northern Florida, near our Valdosta, Georgia mill, and includes both timberlands and higher beneficial use properties.


In
addition to the timberland we manage ourselves, our Forest Management Assistance Program provides professional forestry assistance to private timberland owners to improve harvest
yields and to optimize their harvest schedule. We have managed the regeneration of approximately 125,000 acres by supplying pine seedlings. In exchange for our expertise, we are given the right
of first refusal over timber sales from those lands. These private lands include over 165,000 acres of timberland. We expect to harvest approximately 80,000 cords of wood from these
forests annually.

PCA
also participates in the Sustainable Forestry Initiative. This initiative is aimed at ensuring the long-term health and conservation of America's forestry resources.
Activities include limiting tree harvest sizes, replanting harvest acreage, participating in flora and fauna research and protecting water streams.

Solid Wood Facilities

We own and operate one sawmill located in Ackerman, Mississippi. During 2007, the Ackerman sawmill sold 53 million board feet of lumber used in the
building products and furniture industries. We also have an air-dry yard operation in Burnsville, Mississippi that holds newly cut lumber while it dries.

Sales and Marketing

Our corrugated products are sold through a direct sales and marketing organization. We have sales representatives and a sales manager at each corrugated
manufacturing operation who serve local and regional accounts. We also have corporate account managers who serve large national accounts at
multiple customer locations. Additionally, our graphic design centers maintain an on-site dedicated graphics sales force. General marketing support is located at our corporate
headquarters.

Our
containerboard sales group is responsible for the sale of linerboard and corrugating medium to our corrugated plants, to other domestic customers and to the export market. This group
handles order processing for all shipments of containerboard from our mills to our corrugated plants. These personnel also coordinate and execute all containerboard trade agreements with other
containerboard manufacturers. In addition to direct sales and marketing personnel, we utilize support personnel who are new product development engineers, product graphics and design specialists.
These individuals are located at both the corrugated plants as well as the graphic design centers.

Distribution

Our corrugated products are usually delivered by truck due to our large number of customers and their demand for timely service. Shipping costs represent a
relatively high percentage of our total costs due to the high bulk of corrugated products. As a result, our converting operations typically service customers within a 150 mile radius.

Containerboard
produced in our mills is shipped by rail or truck. Rail shipments represent about 60% to 65% of the tons shipped and the remaining 35% to 40% by truck. Our individual
mills do not own or maintain outside warehousing facilities. We use some third-party warehouses for short-term storage.

Customers

PCA's corrugated products group sells to over 9,600 customers in over 17,700 locations. About two-thirds of our corrugated products
customers are regional and local accounts, which are broadly diversified across industries and geographic locations. The remaining one-third of our customer base consists primarily of
national accounts, or those customers with a national presence. These customers typically purchase corrugated products from several of our box plants throughout the United States.


Major Raw Materials Used

Fiber supply.

Fiber is the single largest cost in the manufacture of containerboard. PCA consumes
both wood fiber and recycled fiber in its containerboard mills. We have no 100% recycled mills, or those mills whose fiber consumption consists solely of recycled fiber. To reduce our fiber costs, we
have invested in processes and equipment to ensure a high degree of fiber flexibility. Our mills have the capability to shift a portion of their fiber consumption between softwood, hardwood and
recycled sources. All of our mills, other than our Valdosta mill, can utilize some recycled fiber in their containerboard production. Our ability to use various types of virgin wood and recycled fiber
helps mitigate the impact of changes in the prices of various fibers. Our corrugated manufacturing operations generate recycled fiber as a by-product from the manufacturing process, which
is shipped to our mills directly or through trade agreements. During 2007, our containerboard mills consumed approximately 606,000 tons of recycled fiber, or about 22% of the total fiber in our
containerboard produced in 2007. Our corrugated converting operations generated approximately 205,000 tons of recycled fiber in 2007. As a result, PCA was a net recycled fiber buyer of
401,000 tons, or approximately 16% of the total fiber in our containerboard produced in 2007.

Energy supply.

Energy at the mills is obtained through purchased electricity or through various
fuels, which are converted to steam or electricity on-site. Fuel sources include coal, natural gas, oil, internally produced and purchased bark and by-products of the
containerboard manufacturing and pulping process. These fuels are burned in boilers to produce steam. Steam turbine generators are used to produce electricity. To reduce our mill energy cost, we have
invested in processes and equipment to ensure a high level of purchased fuel flexibility. In recent history, natural gas and fuel oil have exhibited higher costs per thermal unit and more price
volatility than coal and bark. During 2007, 11.9 million MMBTU's (million British thermal units), or approximately 73% of our mills' purchased fuel needs, were from purchased bark and coal,
historically our two lowest cost purchased fuels. For the same period, our mills consumed about 1.5 million MMBTU's of natural gas (9% of the mills' total purchased fuels) and
2.5 million MMBTU's of oil (15% of the mills' total purchased fuels). Our two kraft linerboard mills at Counce and Valdosta generate more than two-thirds of their fuel requirements
from their own by-products.

PCA's
corrugated plants each have a boiler that produces steam which is used by the corrugator. The majority of these boilers burn natural gas, although some also have the ability to
burn fuel oil. During 2007, PCA's corrugated products plants consumed approximately 2.1 million MMBTU's of natural gas.

The
following table shows PCA's purchased fuel consumption by fuel type for 2007:

Approximately 42% of the electricity consumed by our four mills is generated on-site. Our mills purchase approximately 9,290,000 CkWh (hundred kilowatt hours)
annually, or the equivalent of 3.2 million MMBTU's. PCA's corrugated products plants purchase about 2,400,000 CkWh annually, or the equivalent of 0.8 million MMBTU's.

Competition

According to industry sources, corrugated products are produced by about 645 U.S. companies operating approximately 1,355 plants. Most corrugated products
are custom manufactured to the customer's specifications. Corrugated producers generally sell within a 150-mile radius of their plants and compete with other corrugated producers in their
local market. In fact, the Fibre Box Association tracks industry data by 47 distinct market regions.

The
larger, multi-plant integrated companies may also solicit larger, multi-plant customers who purchase for all of their facilities on a consolidated basis. These customers are often
referred to as national or corporate accounts.

Corrugated
products businesses seek to differentiate themselves through pricing, quality, service, design and product innovation. We compete for both local and national account business
and we compete against producers of other types of packaging products. On a national level, our competitors include International Paper Company, Koch Industries, Inc., Smurfit-Stone Container
Corporation, Temple-Inland Inc. and Weyerhaeuser Company. However, with our strategic focus on local and regional accounts, we believe we compete as much with the smaller, independent
converters as with the larger, integrated producers.

Our
principal competitors with respect to sales of our containerboard sold to external customers are a number of large, diversified paper companies, including International Paper
Company, Koch Industries, Inc., Smurfit-Stone Container Corporation, Temple-Inland Inc. and Weyerhaeuser Company, as well as other regional manufacturers. Containerboard is generally
considered a commodity-type product and can be purchased from numerous suppliers.

Employees

As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately 8,350 employees. Approximately 2,400 of these employees were salaried and approximately 5,950 were
hourly. Approximately 75% of our hourly employees are represented by unions. The majority of our unionized employees are represented primarily by the United Steel Workers (USW), the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT), and the International Association of Machinists (IAM).

Contracts
for unionized employees at our containerboard mills expire between September 2008 and June 2012. Contracts for unionized corrugated plant employees expire between December 2007
and November 2012. We are currently in negotiations to renew or extend any union contracts that have recently expired or are expiring in the near future.

During
2007, we experienced no work stoppages. In 2001, we experienced a one-month strike at our Filer City mill with the USW. The strike was settled, and the mill's current
agreement expires in April 2009. Prior to this incident we, and our predecessors, had experienced no instances of significant work stoppages in the previous 15 years. We believe we have
satisfactory relations with our employees.

Environmental Matters

Compliance with environmental requirements is a significant factor in our business operations. We commit substantial resources to maintaining environmental
compliance and managing environmental risk. We are subject to, and must comply with, a variety of federal, state and local environmental laws,


particularly
those relating to air and water quality, waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater. The most significant of these laws affecting us are:

1.

Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)

2.

Clean
Water Act (CWA)

3.

Clean
Air Act (CAA)

4.

The
Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know-Act (EPCRA)

5.

Toxic
Substance Control Act (TSCA)

6.

Safe
Drinking Water Act (SDWA)

We
believe that we are currently in material compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations. Because environmental regulations are constantly evolving, we
have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs to maintain compliance with these and other environmental laws. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we spent approximately
$19.4 million to comply with the requirements of these and other environmental laws. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the costs of environmental compliance were
approximately $17.5 million and $15.8 million, respectively. We work diligently to anticipate and budget for the impact of applicable environmental regulations, and do not currently
expect that future environmental compliance obligations will materially affect our business or financial condition.

In
1998, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized a Clean Air and Water Act commonly referred to as the Cluster Rules. The Cluster Rules govern allowable
discharges of air and water pollutants at all pulp and paper mill operations. As a result, PCA and its competitors were required to incur costs to ensure compliance with these rules. We completed all
of our projects related to Cluster Rule requirements in 2006 and, as a result, do not anticipate any further capital expenditures related to ensuring compliance with the Cluster Rules. From 1997
through 2006, we spent approximately $39.2 million to ensure compliance with the Cluster Rule requirements. Total capital costs for environmental matters were $4.5 million for 2007. We
currently estimate 2008 environmental capital expenditures will be $3.2 million.

As
is the case with any industrial operation, we have in the past incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or groundwater contamination. From 1994 through 2007, remediation
costs at our mills and converting plants totaled about $3.2 million. We do not believe that any ongoing remedial projects are material in nature. As of December 31, 2007, we maintained
an environmental reserve of $7.4 million, which includes funds relating to on-site landfill and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and anticipated remedial projects. Of the
$7.4 million reserve, $4.1 million relates to
our landfill obligations, which are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." We believe these reserves are adequate.

We
could also incur environmental liabilities as a result of claims by third parties for civil damages, including liability for personal injury or property damage, arising from releases
of hazardous substances or contamination. We are not aware of any material claims of this type currently pending against us.

As
a part of the April 12, 1999 transactions, Pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with pre-closing offsite waste
disposal. Pactiv also retained environmental liability for a closed landfill located near the Filer City mill.

As
of this filing, we believe that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental expenditures above the $7.4 million accrued as of December 31, 2007 will have a
material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Industry Risks

Industry Earnings Cyclicality

—Imbalances of supply and demand for containerboard affect the price at
which we can sell containerboard and, as a result, could result in lower selling prices and earnings.

The price of containerboard could fall if the supply of containerboard available for sale in the market exceeds the demand. The demand for containerboard is
driven by market needs for containerboard in the United States and abroad to manufacture corrugated shipping containers. Market needs or demand are driven by both global and U.S. business conditions.
If supply exceeds demand, prices for containerboard could decline, resulting in decreased earnings and cash flow.

From
time to time, we have taken downtime (or slowbacks) at some of our mills to balance our production of containerboard with the market demand for our containerboard, and we may
continue to do so in the future. Some of our competitors have also temporarily closed or reduced production at their containerboard mills, some of which could reopen and increase production capacity.
This could result in a supply and demand imbalance and cause prices to fall.


Competition

—The intensity of competition in the containerboard and corrugated packaging industry combined with the commodity
nature of containerboard could result in downward pressure on pricing, which could lower earnings.

PCA operates in an industry that is highly competitive, with no single containerboard or corrugated packaging producer having a dominant position. Containerboard
cannot generally be differentiated by producer, which tends to intensify price competition. The corrugated packaging industry is also sensitive to price fluctuations, as well as other factors
including innovation, design, quality and service. To the extent that one or more competitors are more successful with respect to any key competitive factor, our business could be adversely affected.
Our products also compete, to some extent, with various other packaging materials, including products made of paper, plastics, wood and various types of metal. The intensity of containerboard
competition and the commodity nature of containerboard, plus the intensity of corrugated packaging competition, could lead to a reduction in our market share as well as lower prices for our products,
both of which could reduce our earnings.

Company Risks

Cost of Wood Fiber

—Dependence on external wood fiber sources could lead to higher costs and lower
earnings for PCA.

PCA has supply agreements at market prices for wood fiber to be consumed at three of our four mills on about 370,000 acres of timberland. In addition to these
supply agreements, PCA also secures wood fiber from various other sources at market prices.

Because
we do not own any timberlands, we are more vulnerable to changes in availability of wood fiber in areas adjacent to our mills than those of our competitors who do own timberlands
in areas adjacent to their mills, and therefore could face higher wood fiber costs than those competitors, both in terms of the cost of the wood fiber itself as well as the transportation costs to get
the wood fiber to our mills. The price for wood fiber has historically fluctuated on a cyclical basis and has often depended on a variety of factors over which we have no control, including
environmental and conservation regulations, natural disasters and the weather.

Any
increase in wood fiber costs could cause our manufacturing costs to increase and our earnings to decrease to a greater extent than those of our competitors who own their own
timberlands.

Cost of Recycled Fiber

—An increase in the cost of recycled fiber could increase our containerboard manufacturing costs and
lower our earnings.

PCA purchases recycled fiber for use at three of its four containerboard mills. PCA currently purchases, net of recycled fiber generated at its box plants,
approximately 400,000 tons of recycled fiber per year.

The
increase in demand of products manufactured, in whole or in part, from recycled fiber, on a global basis, has caused an occasional tightening in the supply of recycled fiber. These
periods of supply and demand imbalance have tended to create significant price volatility. During 2007, recycled fiber costs increased by 56%, or $40 per ton, compared to 2006, resulting in higher
operating costs. Periods of above average recycled fiber costs and overall price volatility may continue, which could result in earnings volatility.

Cost of Purchased Energy

—An increase in the cost of purchased energy, particularly natural gas and oil, could lead to higher
manufacturing costs, resulting in reduced earnings.

PCA has the capability to use various types of purchased fuels in its manufacturing operations, including coal, bark, natural gas and oil. Energy prices, in
particular prices for oil and natural gas, have fluctuated dramatically in the past and have risen substantially in recent years. These fluctuations


impact
our manufacturing costs and result in earnings volatility. If energy prices rise, our production costs will increase, which will lead to higher manufacturing costs and reduced earnings.

Material Disruption of Manufacturing—

A material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from
meeting customer demand, reduce our sales and/or negatively impact our results of operation and financial condition.

Our business depends on continuous operation of our facilities, particularly at our mills. Any of our manufacturing facilities, or any of our machines within an
otherwise operational facility, could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including unscheduled maintenance outages; prolonged power failures; an equipment failure; explosion of a
boiler; labor difficulties; natural catastrophes; terrorism; governmental regulations; and other operational problems. For example, we
experienced an unplanned 2


/


day outage at our Counce linerboard mill in October 2007, resulting in 11,000 tons of lost production at a cost of approximately $7.4 million
($4.7 million net of tax). In December, we received $2.4 million ($1.5 million net of tax) in business interruption insurance proceeds. Any material disruption of a primary
facility could lead to higher costs and reduced earnings and harm our ability to produce and sell products and service our customers.

Environmental Matters

—PCA may incur significant environmental liabilities with respect to both past and future operations.

We are subject to, and must comply with, a variety of federal, state and local environmental laws, particularly those relating to air and water quality, waste
disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater. Because environmental regulations are constantly evolving, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs to maintain compliance
with those laws. Please see Item 1. "Business—Environmental Matters" for certain estimates of expenditures we expect to make for environmental compliance in the next few years.
Although we have established reserves to provide for future environmental liability, these reserves may not be adequate.

Investment Risks

Market Price of our Common Stock

—The market price of our common stock may be volatile, which could
cause the value of your investment to decline.

Securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political
conditions, could reduce the market price of our common stock in spite of our operating performance. In addition, our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and
investors, and in response, the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly.

Item 1B.    UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

*

In
April, 2005, we shut down our number three paper machine at our Tomahawk mill after resuming operations on our number one paper machine at our Filer City mill. Shutting down the
number three machine (out of 3 total) at Tomahawk reduces our total productive capacity by 65,000 tons at Tomahawk from 581,000 tons to 516,000 tons and reduces our total
containerboard mill system capacity from 2,475,000 tons to 2,410,000 tons. This action was based on market conditions and productivity and could change if market conditions or
productivity levels change going forward.

We
currently own our four containerboard mills and 44 of our corrugated manufacturing operations (37 corrugated plants and seven sheet plants). We also own one sawmill, an
air-drying yard, one warehouse and miscellaneous other property, which includes sales offices and woodlands forest management offices. These sales offices and woodlands forest management
offices generally have one to four employees and serve as administrative offices. PCA leases the space for three corrugated plants, 20 sheet plants, five regional design centers, a technical and
development center, and numerous other distribution centers, warehouses and facilities. The equipment in these leased facilities is, in virtually all cases, owned by PCA, except for forklifts and
other rolling stock which are generally leased.

We
lease the cutting rights to approximately 102,000 acres of timberland located near our Valdosta mill (84,000 acres) and our Counce mill (18,000 acres). These
cutting rights agreements have average remaining terms of approximately 15 years.

We
currently lease space for our corporate headquarters in Lake Forest, Illinois. The lease for the Lake Forest, Illinois facility is a short term, facility use agreement lease with
automatic renewal rights. Specifically, this lease is a continuous month-to-month lease with unlimited automatic renewals entitling either party the right to terminate the
lease with at least 8 months notice. We currently believe that our owned and leased space for facilities and properties are sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable
future.

Item 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

PCA is a party to various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business. These legal actions cover a broad variety of claims spanning our entire
business. As of the date of this filing, we believe it is not reasonably possible that the resolution of these legal actions will, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on
our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Item 4.    SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders in the fourth quarter of 2007.

Item 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion of historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the
notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this report.

Overview

PCA is the sixth largest producer of containerboard and corrugated products in the United States, based on production capacity. We operate four containerboard
mills and 67 corrugated products manufacturing plants throughout the United States. Approximately 80% of the containerboard tons produced at our mills are consumed in our corrugated products
manufacturing plants. The remaining 20% is sold to domestic customers or the export market. We produce a wide variety of corrugated products ranging from basic corrugated shipping containers to
specialized packaging such as wax-coated


boxes
for the agriculture industry. We also have multi-color printing capabilities to make high-impact graphics boxes and displays that offer our customers more attractive packaging.

In
analyzing our operating performance, we focus on the following factors that affect our business and are important to consider when reviewing our financial and operating results:

•

corrugated
products demand;

•

corrugated
products and containerboard pricing;

•

containerboard
inventories; and

•

cost
trends and volatility for our major costs, including wood and recycled fiber, purchased fuels, electricity, labor and fringe benefits, and transportation costs.

The
market for containerboard is generally subject to changes in the U.S. economy. Historically, supply and demand, as well as industry-wide inventory levels, have influenced
prices of containerboard. In addition to U.S. shipments, approximately 10% of domestically-produced containerboard has been exported for use in other countries.

Reported
industry shipments of corrugated products decreased 1.4% during 2007 compared to 2006. During this same period, industry containerboard inventory levels remained at historically
low levels, with inventory at the end of December 2007 at its second lowest level in the past 25 years, on a weeks-of-supply basis. Industry publications reported prices for linerboard and
corrugating medium increased $40 per ton in August 2007, and with that increase, ended 2007 at $40 per ton higher than year end 2006.

The
cost to manufacture containerboard is dependent, in large part, on the costs of wood fiber, recycled fiber, purchased fuels, electricity, labor, and fringe benefits. While energy and
other costs are significant in the manufacture of corrugated products, labor and fringe benefits make up the largest component of corrugated products' manufactured costs besides the cost of
containerboard.

PCA's
average cost for purchased fuels was slightly lower in 2007 compared to 2006, while transportation and electricity costs increased from prior year levels. Recycled fiber costs were
higher throughout 2007 than they were in 2006 and averaged about 56% above 2006 levels. Wood fiber costs increased in the fourth quarter of 2007 and specifically pine pulpwood costs ended the year
about 8% higher than pine pulpwood costs in December 2006, while hardwood pulpwood costs were essentially unchanged compared to December 2006.

For
the year ended December 31, 2007, PCA achieved significantly higher earnings compared to the prior year. The improved earnings were primarily driven by increased product
pricing for both containerboard and corrugated products, reflecting the full realization of previously announced price increases. Corrugated product sales volumes remained steady throughout the year
as total volume was just 0.3% below our last year's all-time record volume. We also set a record for containerboard export shipments, which were 25.1% above 2006. Partially offsetting
these positive factors were higher recycled fiber costs, higher labor and fringe benefits costs, including medical, pension and incentive compensation costs, and higher transportation costs.

We
expect our earnings in the first quarter 2008 to be lower than our earnings in the fourth quarter 2007 of $0.42 per diluted share, primarily due to planned mill maintenance outages at
both of our linerboard mills in Counce, Tennessee and Valdosta, Georgia. We also typically incur higher energy and fiber costs in the first quarter due to colder weather and certain timing-related
benefit costs are highest in the first quarter.

Net Sales

Net sales increased by $129.0 million, or 5.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 from the year ended December 31, 2006. Net sales
increased primarily due to increased sales prices of corrugated products and containerboard and higher sales volumes of containerboard to third parties compared to 2006.

Total
corrugated products volume sold decreased 0.3% to 31.2 billion square feet in 2007 compared to 31.3 billion square feet in 2006. On a comparable shipment-per-workday
basis, corrugated products sales volume decreased 1.1% in 2007 from 2006. Shipments-per-workday is calculated by dividing our total corrugated products volume during the year
by the number of workdays within the year. The larger percentage decrease on a shipment-per-workday basis was due to the fact that 2007 had two more workdays (251 days), those days not falling
on a weekend or holiday, than 2006
(249 days). Containerboard sales volume to external domestic and export customers increased 12.3% to 541,000 tons for the year ended December 31, 2007 from 482,000 tons in
2006.

Income from Operations

Income from operations increased by $67.6 million, or 29.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31,
2006. The increase in income from operations was primarily attributable to higher sales prices and volume ($120.1 million), partially offset by increased costs for recycled fiber
($16.8 million), wage increases for hourly and salaried personnel ($16.8 million), medical, pension, benefit and incentive costs ($6.3 million), transportation costs
($5.4 million), wood fiber costs ($3.1 million) and the impact of a fourth quarter 2007 unplanned outage at the Counce, Tennessee linerboard mill ($5.0 million, net of insurance
recovery).

Gross
profit increased $81.1 million, or 18.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 from the year ended December 31, 2006. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales
increased from 20.3% of net sales in 2006 to 22.7% of net sales in the current year primarily due to the increased sales prices described previously.

Selling
and administrative expenses increased $10.6 million, or 6.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 from the comparable period in 2006. The increase was primarily
the result of increased salary and incentive compensation expense ($6.3 million) and related fringe benefit costs ($1.7 million), increased travel and entertainment expenses
($1.1 million) and higher warehousing costs due to customer requirements ($0.8 million).


Corporate
overhead for the year ended December 31, 2007, increased $4.4 million, or 8.7%, from the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily
attributable to higher salary, incentive and related benefit expenses ($2.8 million) and increased information technology infrastructure costs ($1.2 million).

Other
expense, net, decreased $0.5 million, or 5.5% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease was primarily due
to a $0.8 million gain on the sale of land in the third quarter and other individually insignificant items.

Interest Expense, Net and Income Taxes

Interest expense, net of interest income, decreased by $5.6 million, or 18.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2006, primarily as a result of increased income earned on PCA's cash equivalents due to higher cash balances.

PCA's
effective tax rate was 36.5% for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 35.8% for the year ended December 31, 2006. For both 2007 and 2006, tax rates were higher than
the federal statutory rate of 35.0% due to state income taxes.

Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005

Net Sales

Net sales increased by $193.3 million, or 9.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 from the year ended December 31, 2005. Net sales
increased primarily due to increased sales prices and volumes of corrugated products and containerboard compared to 2005.

Total
corrugated products volume sold increased 0.4% to 31.3 billion square feet in 2006 compared to 31.2 billion square feet in 2005. On a comparable shipment-per-workday
basis, corrugated products sales volume increased 0.8% in 2006 from 2005. The larger percentage increase on a shipment-per-workday basis was due to the fact that 2006 had one less workday
(249 days), those days not falling on a weekend or holiday, than 2005 (250 days). Containerboard sales volume to external domestic and export customers increased 15.6% to
482,000 tons for the year ended December 31, 2006 from 417,000 tons in 2005.


Income from Operations

Income from operations increased by $109.8 million, or 94.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. Included in income from
operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 is income of $14.0 million, net of expenses, consisting of two dividends paid to PCA by Southern Timber Venture, LLC (STV).

Excluding
the dividends from STV, income from operations increased $123.8 million in 2006 compared to 2005. The $123.8 million increase in income from operations was
primarily attributable to higher sales prices and volume as well as improved mix of business ($195.6 million), partially offset by increased costs related to transportation
($18.9 million), energy, primarily purchased fuels and electricity ($18.3 million), wage increases for hourly and salaried personnel ($16.9 million), medical, pension and other
benefit costs ($9.9 million), and incentive compensation ($6.5 million).

Gross
profit increased $137.1 million, or 44.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 from the year ended December 31, 2005. Gross profit as a percentage of net
sales increased from 15.4% of net sales in 2005 to 20.3% of net sales in the current year primarily due to the increased sales prices described previously.

Selling
and administrative expenses increased $12.3 million, or 8.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 from the comparable period in 2005. The increase was primarily
the result of increased salary and incentive compensation expense ($8.2 million) and related fringe benefit costs ($1.4 million), and higher warehousing costs due to customer
requirements ($2.0 million).

Corporate
overhead for the year ended December 31, 2006, increased $3.1 million, or 6.5%, from the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily
attributable to higher incentive compensation expense ($2.6 million) and other individually insignificant items.

Other
expense, net, decreased $2.1 million, or 20.1% for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. The decrease was primarily
due to a $3.1 million decrease in expenses related to the disposals of property, plant and equipment as part of planned disposals in
connection with capital projects. Partially offsetting the decrease in fixed asset disposal expense was higher legal expenses ($0.5 million) and increased losses on disposals of storeroom items
($0.4 million).

Interest Expense, Net and Income Taxes

Interest expense, net of interest income, increased by $3.1 million, or 11.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the full year 2005,
primarily as a result of higher interest expense on our variable rate debt due to higher interest rates.

PCA's
effective tax rate was 35.8% for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 40.2% for the year ended December 31, 2005. The lower tax rate in 2006 is primarily due to a
larger domestic manufacturer's deduction and a reduction in the Texas state tax rate. For both years 2006 and 2005, tax rates were higher than the federal statutory rate of 35.0% due to state income
taxes.

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities increased $53.5 million, or 21.7% to $300.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared
to the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of higher net income in 2007 as previously described and lower
requirements for operating assets and liabilities of $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. During 2007, PCA's cash taxes paid for both
federal and state income taxes were $105.5 million, or 39.4% of income before taxes of $267.9 million, compared to PCA's effective tax rate of 36.5% in 2007. The Company expects the 2008
cash tax rate for both federal and state income tax payments to be in line with the effective tax rate of about 37%.

Requirements
for operating assets and liabilities were lower by $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006, primarily driven by
favorable year over year changes in accounts receivable ($35.3 million) and accounts payable ($20.6 million), partially offset by unfavorable year over year changes in accrued
liabilities ($32.6 million), inventories ($5.0 million) and higher 2007 pension contributions ($12.1 million).

Net
cash provided by operating activities increased $3.9 million, or 1.6% to $246.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2005. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of higher net income in 2006 as previously described, primarily offset by higher
requirements for operating assets and liabilities of $39.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005, a lower deferred tax provision of
$35.9 million due to the utilization of a federal net operating loss carry forward in 2005, and the required reclassification of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation expense
from operating activities to financing activities in accordance with the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006. The excess tax benefits increased cash provided by operating
activities by $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. During 2006, PCA's cash taxes paid for both federal and state income taxes were $65.1 million, or 33.4% of income
before taxes of $194.7 million, compared to PCA's effective tax rate of 35.8% in 2006.

The
higher requirements for operating assets and liabilities were driven by unfavorable year over year changes in accounts receivable ($55.5 million) primarily due to increased
sales prices of corrugated products and containerboard in the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 and accounts payable ($18.4 million), partially offset by
favorable year over year changes in inventories ($6.6 million) and accrued liabilities ($26.6 million).

Investing Activities

Net cash used for investing activities increased by $19.2 million, or 20.5%, to $113.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared
to the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily related to higher additions to property, plant and equipment of $25.2 million and lower proceeds from disposals of
property, plant and equipment of $1.7 million in 2007 compared to 2006,


partially
offset by the absence of any acquisitions in 2007, the cost of which totaled $4.3 million in 2006, lower additions to other long term assets of $2.4 million in 2007 and
proceeds from the sale of a 2


/


% interest in STV for $1 million during the fourth quarter of 2007.

Net
cash used for investing activities decreased by $67.6 million, or 41.9%, to $93.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2005. The decrease was primarily related to lower cost of acquisitions of businesses of $44.4 million in 2006, a decrease in additions to property, plant and equipment of
$37.1 million in 2006 compared to the same period in 2005, partially offset by the $15.0 million in STV dividends received in 2005.

As
of December 31, 2007, PCA had commitments for general purpose capital expenditures of $58.3 million. PCA believes cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund
these commitments.

Financing Activities

Net cash used for financing activities totaled $120.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $17.1 million, or 16.6%,
from the comparable period in 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to $30.5 million in repurchases of PCA common stock in 2007, partially offset by additional proceeds from the
issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options of $12.6 million during 2007 compared to 2006.

Net
cash used for financing activities totaled $103.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, a decrease of $78.4 million, or 43.1%, from the comparable period
in 2005. The decrease was primarily attributable to the repurchase of 4,500,000 shares of PCA common stock from PCA Holdings LLC for $93.1 million in December of 2005, partially offset
by $8.9 million in additional long-term debt payments during 2006 compared to 2005, and $8.2 million in additional dividends paid on PCA's common stock during 2006 compared
to 2005.

At
December 31, 2007, PCA holds an approximately 29% equity ownership interest in STV. In 2005, PCA received dividends from STV of $15.0 million. PCA did not receive any
dividends in 2007 or 2006.

On
November 29, 2000, PCA established an on-balance sheet securitization program for its trade accounts receivable. To effectuate this program, PCA formed a
wholly-owned limited purpose subsidiary, Packaging Credit Company, LLC, or PCC, which in turn formed a wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote, special-purpose subsidiary, Packaging Receivables
Company, LLC, or PRC, for the purpose of acquiring receivables from PCC. Both of these entities are included in the consolidated financial statements of PCA. Under this program, PCC purchases
on an ongoing basis substantially all of the receivables of PCA and sells such receivables to PRC. PRC and lenders established a $150.0 million receivables-backed revolving credit facility
through which PRC obtains funds to purchase receivables from PCC. The receivables purchased by PRC are and will be solely the property of PRC. In the event of a liquidation of PRC, the creditors of
PRC would be entitled to satisfy their claims from PRC's assets prior to any distribution to PCC or PCA. Credit available under the receivables credit facility is on a borrowing-base
formula. As a result, the full amount of the facility may not be available at all times. On October 5, 2007, PCA renewed the receivables credit facility for an additional one-year
term, expiring on October 3, 2008. As of December 31, 2007, $109.0 million was outstanding and $41.0 million was available for additional borrowing under the receivables
credit facility. The highest outstanding principal balance under the receivables credit facility during 2007 was $109.0 million.

On
July 7, 2003, PCA entered into an unsecured senior credit facility that provides for a $100.0 million revolving credit facility, including a $35.0 million
subfacility for letters of credit, and a $50.0 million term loan. The senior credit facility expires in 2008. PCA's total borrowings under the


senior
credit facility as of December 31, 2007 consisted of $20.0 million of term loans. PCA intends to repay the term loans in full, and enter into a new revolving credit facility in
2008.

On
July 21, 2003, PCA closed its offering and private placement of $150.0 million of 4


/


% five-year notes and $400.0 million of


/


% ten-year notes. The five-year notes are due August 1, 2008, and the ten-year notes are due August 1, 2013. PCA intends to
refinance the five-year notes in 2008.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2007 that would require disclosure under
SEC FR-67, "Disclosure in Management's Discussion and Analysis About Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations."

The above table excludes unamortized debt discount of $2.0 million at December 31, 2007 and interest payments on debt outstanding.
As PCA will be refinancing the revolving credit facility and the 4


/


% senior notes in 2008 and as the interest rates on 19% of PCA's debt are variable, PCA does not include projected
interest payments in the above table. PCA currently does not have any projections for future pension contributions beyond 2008 due to the new funding requirements of the Pension Protection Act, which
the Company is currently evaluating.

The
operating lease commitments, capital commitments, purchase commitments and letters of credit are not reflected on PCA's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2007. See
Notes 8 and 11 to the audited consolidated financial statements for additional information.

As
of December 31, 2007, the Company's expected payment for significant contractual obligations excludes $9.4 million of obligations for unrecognized tax benefits because
the Company cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement for such liability. See Note 13 to the audited consolidated financial statements for additional
information.

PCA's
primary sources of liquidity are net cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under PCA's revolving credit facility, and additional borrowings under PCA's receivables
credit facility. As of December 31, 2007, PCA had $121.6 million in unused borrowing capacity under its existing credit agreements due to the impact on this borrowing capacity of
$19.4 million of outstanding letters of credit. Currently, PCA's primary uses of cash are for capital expenditures, debt service, declared


common
stock dividends and common stock repurchases, which it expects to be able to fund from these sources.

The
following table provides the outstanding balances and the weighted average interest rates as of December 31, 2007 for PCA's outstanding term loan, the revolving credit

The above table excludes unamortized debt discount of $2.0 million at December 31, 2007. It also excludes from the projected annual
cash interest payments, the non-cash income from the annual amortization of the $27.0 million received in July 2003 from the settlement of the treasury locks related to the
five- and ten- year notes. The amortization is being recognized over the terms of the five- and ten-year notes and is included in interest expense, net.

The
revolving credit facility is available to fund PCA's working capital requirements, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The term loan must be repaid in July
2008. The revolving credit facility will terminate in July 2008. The receivables credit facility will terminate in October 2008.

The
instruments governing PCA's indebtedness contain financial and other covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of PCA and its subsidiaries to:

•

enter
into sale and leaseback transactions,

•

incur
liens,

•

enter
into certain transactions with affiliates, or

•

merge
or consolidate with any other person or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of PCA.

These
limitations could limit corporate and operating activities.

In
addition, we must maintain minimum net worth, maximum leverage and minimum interest coverage ratios under the senior credit facility. A failure to comply with the restrictions
contained in the senior credit facility could lead to an event of default, which could result in an acceleration of such indebtedness. Such an acceleration would also constitute an event of default
under the notes indentures and the receivables credit facility.

PCA
currently expects to incur capital expenditures of $110.0 million to $120.0 million in 2008. These capital expenditures will be used primarily for maintenance capital,
cost reduction, business growth and environmental compliance.

PCA
believes that its net cash generated from operating activities, available cash reserves and, as required, borrowings under its committed credit facilities and available capital
through access to capital markets will be adequate to meet its current and future liquidity and capital requirements, including payments of any declared common stock dividends. As its debt or credit
facilities become due, PCA


will
need to repay, extend or replace such facilities, which will be subject to future economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond PCA's control.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to, and must comply with, a variety of federal, state and local environmental laws, particularly those relating to air and water quality, waste
disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater. The most significant of these laws affecting us are:

•

Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)

•

Clean
Water Act (CWA)

•

Clean
Air Act (CAA)

•

The
Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know-Act (EPCRA)

•

Toxic
Substance Control Act (TSCA)

•

Safe
Drinking Water Act (SDWA)

We
believe that we are currently in material compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations. Because environmental regulations are constantly evolving, we
have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs to maintain compliance with these and other environmental laws. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we spent approximately
$19.4 million to comply with the requirements of these and other environmental laws. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the costs of environmental compliance were
approximately $17.5 million and $15.8 million, respectively.

In
addition, the Cluster Rules govern allowable discharges of air and water pollutants at all pulp and paper mill operations, including those at the Counce, Filer City, Valdosta and
Tomahawk mills. We have completed all of our projects to ensure compliance with the Cluster Rules and as of this filing, we believe that it is not reasonably possible that future expenditures related
to Cluster Rule compliance will have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

As
is the case with any industrial operation, we have, in the past, incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or groundwater contamination, as required by the federal
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as the federal "Superfund" law, and analogous state laws. Cleanup requirements arise with respect to properties we
currently own or operate, former facilities and off-site facilities where we have disposed of hazardous substances. Under the terms of the contribution agreement, Pactiv has agreed to
retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with pre-closing off-site waste disposal. Pactiv has also retained environmentally impaired real
property in Filer City, Michigan unrelated to current mill operations.

Because
liability for remediation costs under environmental laws is strict, meaning that liability is imposed without fault, joint and several, meaning that liability is imposed on each
party without regard to contribution, and retroactive, we could receive notifications of cleanup liability in the future and this liability could be material. From 1994 through 2007, remediation costs
at our mills and corrugated plants totaled approximately $3.2 million. As of December 31, 2007, we maintained an environmental reserve of $7.4 million relating to
on-site landfills and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and anticipated remedial projects. Total capital costs for environmental matters were $4.5 million for 2007 and we
currently estimate 2008 environmental capital expenditures will be $3.2 million. As of this filing, we believe that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental expenditures above
the $7.4 million accrued as of December 31, 2007 will have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.


Critical Accounting Policies

Management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those
related to the valuation of accounts receivable, inventories, intangible assets including goodwill, long-lived assets, pensions and other postretirement benefits, income taxes, contingencies and
litigation and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of
which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions.

We
believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. For a further
discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.

Accounts Receivable—Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Customer Deductions

We evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based upon a combination of factors. In circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer's
inability to meet its financial obligations to us (e.g., bankruptcy filings, substantial downgrading of credit sources), we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce
the net recorded receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. For all other customers, we recognize reserves for bad debts consisting of 0.3% for amounts less than 90 days
past due their contractual terms and 30% for amounts more than 90 days past due their contractual terms based on our historical collection experience. If our collection experience deteriorates
(i.e., higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer's ability to meet its financial obligations to us), our estimates of the recoverability of
amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount.

The
customer deductions reserve represents the estimated amount required for customer returns, allowances and earned discounts. Based on our experience, customer returns, allowances and
earned discounts have averaged 1.0% of our gross selling price. Accordingly, we reserve 1.0% of our open customer accounts receivable balance for these items.

As
of December 31, 2007, the balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve was $2.9 million, compared to $3.8 million at December 31, 2006. Bad debt
expense in 2007 was $0.1 million, compared to $3.2 million in 2006. The decrease of $3.1 million was primarily attributable to a $1.8 million decrease in expense related to
customers who had filed for bankruptcy during 2006 and a decrease of $0.9 million in connection with specific customers that were reserved for at the 90% level of their accounts receivable
balance as of December 31, 2007. For the year ended December 31, 2006, bad debt expense was $3.2 million compared to $2.7 million in 2005. The increase of
$0.5 million was primarily attributable to an increase of $0.4 million recorded in connection with specific customers that were reserved for at the 90% level of their accounts receivable
balance as of December 31, 2006.

Inventories

We record our inventories at the lower of cost or market and include all costs directly associated with manufacturing products: materials, labor and manufacturing
overhead. The estimated market value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, reductions in the
carrying value of inventories may be


required.
Raw materials, work in process and finished goods valued using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") cost method comprised 64% and 63% of inventories at current cost at
December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Supplies and materials inventories are valued using a moving average cost.

Pension and Postretirement Benefits

The Company accounts for defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plans in accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions," SFAS
No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions" and SFAS No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
Plans—An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)."

One
of the principal assumptions used to calculate net periodic pension cost is the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The expected long-term rate
of return on plan assets may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets in any given year. Over time, however, the expected
long-term rate of return on plan assets is designed to approximate the actual long term returns.

The
discount rate assumptions used to calculate net periodic pension and postretirement costs reflect the rates available on high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments on
September 30 of each year. The rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used to calculate net periodic pension cost and is determined by us based upon annual reviews.

For
postretirement health care plan accounting, we review external data and our own historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rate assumption.

Environmental Liabilities

PCA accounts for its retirement obligations related to its landfills under SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," which requires
legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets to be recognized at their fair value at the time that the obligations are incurred. Upon initial recognition of a
liability, that cost is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and amortized to expense over the useful life of the asset.

The
potential costs for various environmental matters are uncertain due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible cleanup costs, the complexity and evolving nature of
governmental laws and regulations and their interpretations, and the timing, varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup technologies. Liabilities recorded for environmental contingencies
are estimates of the probable costs based upon available information and assumptions. Because of these uncertainties, however, our estimates may change. We believe that any additional costs identified
as further information becomes available would not have a material effect on our financial statements.

In
connection with the sale to PCA of the containerboard and corrugated products business of Pactiv Corporation in April 1999, Pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former
facilities and all sites associated with off-site waste disposal prior to April 12, 1999. Pactiv also retained the environmental liability for a closed landfill located near the
Filer City mill.

Revenue Recognition

PCA recognizes revenue as title to the products is transferred to customers. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales. Shipping and handling
billings to a customer are included in net sales. In addition, PCA offers volume rebates to certain of its customers. The total cost of these programs is estimated and accrued as a reduction to net
sales at the time of the respective sale.


Impairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair
value. Recoverability of goodwill is determined by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the
fair value, the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of its goodwill to determine if a write-down to fair value is necessary.

Long-lived
assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any long-lived
asset may not be fully recoverable. In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability
would be performed. If an evaluation were required, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset (or group of assets) would be compared to the asset's (or group of assets')
carrying amount to determine if a write-down to fair value is required.

Stock-Based Compensation

PCA has one stock-based employee compensation plan. Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for our stock option plan under the recognition and measurement
provisions of Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related Interpretations, as permitted by SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation." No stock-based compensation cost was recognized in the statements of income prior to January 1, 2006 as all stock options granted under the plan had an exercise price
equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. However, prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), stock-based compensation cost had
been included in pro forma disclosures in the financial statement footnotes for periods prior to January 1, 2006.

Effective
January 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment," using the modified-prospective-transition method.
Under that transition method, stock-based compensation cost recognized includes: (a) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not vested as of January 1,
2006, based on the grant date fair value, estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, and (b) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted subsequent
to January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R).

PCA
uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of each option grant as of the date of grant. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility
of our common stock. The expected life of the option is estimated using historical data pertaining to option exercises and employee terminations. Separate groups of employees that have similar
historical exercise behavior are considered separately for estimating the expected life. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant.

Income Taxes

PCA's annual tax rate is determined based on income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial
reporting purposes. Tax law requires some items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the annual tax rate in the
financial statements is different than the rate reported on PCA's tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the tax return, and some differences
are temporary, reversing over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.


Inherent
in determining the annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Significant management judgments are
required for the following items:

•

Management
reviews PCA's deferred tax assets for realizability. Valuation allowances are established when management believes that it is more likely than not that some
portion of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision.

•

PCA
establishes accruals for uncertain tax contingencies when, despite the belief that PCA's tax return positions are fully supported, PCA believes that an uncertain tax
position does not meet the recognition threshold of FASB Interpretation ("FIN") No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes." The tax contingency accruals are adjusted in light of
changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, the expiration of the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine a tax return, case law and emerging
legislation. While it is difficult to predict the final outcome or timing of resolution for any particular tax matter, PCA believes that the accruals reflect the likely outcome of known tax
contingencies in accordance with FIN No. 48.

Item 7A.    QUANTITIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

PCA is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market value of its financial instruments. PCA periodically enters into derivatives in
order to minimize these risks, but not for trading purposes. As of December 31, 2007, PCA was not a party to any derivative instruments.

As
the interest rates on approximately 81% of PCA's debt are fixed, a one percent increase in interest rates related to variable rate debt would have resulted in an increase in interest
expense and a corresponding decrease in income before taxes of $1.3 million annually. In the event of a change in interest rates, management could take actions to mitigate its exposure to the
change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in PCA's financial structure.

Item 8.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

The response to this item is included in a separate section of this report beginning on page F-1, which is incorporated by reference herein.

Item 9.    CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES

None.

Item 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Controls and Procedures

PCA maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that are designed to
provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in PCA's filings under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to PCA's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Prior
to filing this report, PCA completed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of PCA's management, including PCA's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial


Officer,
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of PCA's disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2007. The evaluation of PCA's disclosure controls and procedures
included a review of the controls' objectives and design, PCA's implementation of the controls and the effect of the controls on the information generated for use in this report. Based on this
evaluation, PCA's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that PCA's disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31,
2007.

During
the quarter ended December 31, 2007, there were no changes in internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, PCA's internal control over financial reporting.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

PCA's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act
Rule 13a-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company's assets; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are
being made only with proper authorizations; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, PCA's internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated,
can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide
absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.

PCA's
management, under the supervision of and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the Company's internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria for effective control over financial reporting described in "Internal Control—Integrated Framework" issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, PCA's management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31,
2007, based on the specified criteria.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Packaging
Corporation of America

Board of Directors and Stockholders

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Packaging Corporation of America (the "Company") as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated
statements of income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule
listed in the index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Packaging Corporation of America at
December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As
discussed in Notes 2, 4 and 6 to the financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for uncertainty in income taxes and major maintenance activities
effective January 1, 2007, changed its method of accounting for stock-based compensation effective January 1, 2006, and changed its method of accounting for pension and postretirement
benefits effective December 31, 2006, respectively.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Packaging Corporation of America's internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission and our report dated February 15, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Packaging
Corporation of America

Board of Directors and Stockholders

We
have audited Packaging Corporation of America's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Packaging Corporation of America's management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in Management's Report
on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, Packaging Corporation of America maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the
COSO criteria.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Packaging Corporation of
America as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2007, and our report dated February 15, 2008, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Packaging Corporation of America

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2007

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS

Packaging Corporation of America ("PCA" or the "Company") was incorporated on January 25, 1999. On April 12, 1999, PCA acquired the containerboard
and corrugated packaging products business of Pactiv Corporation ("Pactiv"), formerly known as Tenneco Packaging Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Tenneco Inc. PCA had no operations
from the date of incorporation on January 25, 1999 to April 11, 1999.

The
Company is comprised of mills and corrugated manufacturing operations. The mill operations (the "Mills") consist of two kraft linerboard mills located in Counce, Tennessee, and
Valdosta, Georgia, and two medium mills located in Filer City, Michigan, and Tomahawk, Wisconsin. The Company leases the cutting rights to approximately 102,000 acres of timberland as of
December 31, 2007. The Mills transfer the majority of their containerboard produced to PCA's corrugated products plants.

PCA's
corrugated manufacturing operations consist of 67 plants, with 40 operating as combining operations, or corrugated plants, and 27 as sheet plants; a technical and development
center; five graphic design centers; a rotogravure printing operation and a complement of packaging supplies and distribution centers. All plants are located in the continental United States.
Corrugated plants combine linerboard and medium into sheets that are converted into corrugated shipping containers, point-of-sale graphics packaging,
point-of-purchase displays and other specialized packaging. Sheet plants purchase sheets primarily from PCA corrugated products plants to use in the finished corrugated
products converting process. The corrugated manufacturing operations sell to diverse customers primarily in North America.

As
of December 31, 2007, PCA had approximately 8,350 employees. Approximately 2,400 of these employees were salaried and approximately 5,950 were hourly. Approximately 75% of its
hourly employees are represented by unions. The majority of its unionized employees are represented primarily by the United Steel Workers (USW), the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT), and
the International Association of Machinists (IAM).

Contracts
for unionized employees at PCA's containerboard mills expire between September 2008 and June 2012. Contracts for unionized corrugated plant employees expire between December
2007 and November 2012. The Company is currently in negotiations to renew or extend any union contracts that have recently expired or are expiring in the near future.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements of PCA include all majority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The Company
has one joint venture that is accounted for under the equity method.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

F-8

Packaging Corporation of America

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

December 31, 2007

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include all cash balances and highly liquid investments with a maturity, when acquired, of three months or less. Cash equivalents are
stated at cost, which approximates market.

Accounts Receivable

The collectibility of PCA's accounts receivable is based upon a combination of factors. In circumstances where a specific customer is unable to meet its financial
obligations to PCA (e.g., bankruptcy filings, substantial downgrading of credit sources), a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recorded receivable
to the amount the Company reasonably believes will be collected. For all other customers, reserves for bad debts are recognized consisting of 0.3% for amounts less than 90 days past due their
contractual terms and 30% for amounts more than 90 days past due their contractual terms based on historical collection experience. If collection experience deteriorates (i.e., higher
than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer's ability to meet its financial obligations to us), the estimate of the recoverability of amounts due could be
reduced by a material amount.

The
customer deductions reserve represents the estimated amount required for customer returns, allowances and earned discounts. Based on the Company's experience, customer returns,
allowances and earned discounts have averaged 1.0% of gross selling price. Accordingly, PCA reserves 1.0% of its open customer accounts receivable balance for these items.

At
December 31, 2007 and 2006, the allowance for doubtful accounts was $2.9 million and $3.8 million, respectively. Also offsetting the accounts receivable balance
at December 31, 2007 and 2006, were reserves for customer deductions of $2.7 million and $2.6 million, respectively.

Inventories

With the exception of inventories at PCA's Chicago corrugated products plant, which was acquired in 2004, raw materials, work in process and finished goods are
valued using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") cost method. Inventories at the Chicago plant are valued at the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") cost method.
Supplies and materials are valued using a moving average cost. All inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and include all costs directly associated with manufacturing products:
materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. Inventories valued using the LIFO method comprised 64% and 63%, or $162.6 million and $151.0 million, of the total inventory before the LIFO
reserve, of $255.1 million and $239.3 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

is computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Assets under capital leases are depreciated on the
straight-line method over the term of the lease. The following lives are used for the various categories of assets:

Buildings and land improvements

5 to 40 years

Machinery and equipment

3 to 25 years

Trucks and automobiles

3 to 10 years

Furniture and fixtures

3 to 20 years

Computers and hardware

3 to 7 years

Leasehold improvements

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

The
amount of depreciation expense was $144.6 million, $150.0 million and $151.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

The Company has capitalized certain intangible assets, primarily customer lists and relationships, covenants not to compete, and goodwill, based on their
estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. Amortization is provided for customer lists and relationships on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from six to 40 years.
Covenants not to compete are amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective agreements. Goodwill, which amounted to $37.2 million as of both December 31,
2007 and 2006, respectively, is not being amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets." The Company performs the impairment tests in the fourth quarter or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value.
Recoverability of goodwill is determined by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair
value, the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of its goodwill to determine if a write-down to fair value is necessary. The Company
concluded that no impairment of goodwill existed at the time of the annual impairment tests in 2007, 2006 and 2005.

Other Long-Term Assets

PCA has capitalized certain costs related to obtaining its financing. These costs are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method over
the terms of the senior credit facility and senior notes, which range from five to ten years. Unamortized deferred financing costs were $1.9 million and $2.6 million as of
December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

PCA
leases the cutting rights to approximately 102,000 acres of timberland and capitalizes the annual lease payments and reforestation costs associated with these leases. These costs are
recorded as depletion when timber is harvested and used in PCA's business operations or sold to customers. Capitalized long-term lease costs were $21.5 million and
$21.0 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The amount of depletion expense was $1.5 million, $2.2 million and $3.3 million for the years ended
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

PCA
capitalizes certain costs related to the purchase and development of software which is used in its business operations. The costs attributable to these software systems are amortized
over their estimated useful lives based on various factors such as the effects of obsolescence, technology and other economic factors. Net capitalized software costs were $0.9 million and
$1.1 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Software amortization expense was $0.4 million, $1.1 million and $2.4 million for the years ended
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment in accordance with provisions of SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of
recoverability would be performed. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset (or group of assets) would be compared to the asset's (or group
of assets') carrying amount to determine if a write-down to fair value is required. The Company concluded that no impairment of long-lived assets, with the exception of the
impairment due to plant closures included in Note 14, existed in 2007, 2006 and 2005.

Pension and Postretirement Benefits

One of the principal assumptions used to calculate net periodic pension cost is the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The expected
long-term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets in any given year. Over time, however, the
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is designed to approximate the actual long term returns.

The
discount rate assumptions used to calculate net periodic pension and postretirement cost reflect the rates available on high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments on
September 30th of each year. The rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used to calculate net periodic pension cost and is determined by the Company based upon
annual reviews.

For
postretirement health care plan accounting, the Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rate
assumption.

Asset Retirement Obligations

The Company accounts for its retirement obligations related to its landfills under SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," which
requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets to be recognized at their fair value at the time that the obligations are incurred. Upon initial recognition
of a liability, that cost is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and amortized to expense over the useful life of the asset.

Income Taxes

PCA utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby it recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of
temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets will be reduced by a valuation allowance if, based
upon management's estimates, it is more likely than not, that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in a future period. The estimates utilized in the recognition of deferred tax
assets are subject to revision in future periods based on new facts or circumstances.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue as title to the products is transferred to customers. Shipping and handling billings to a customer are included in net sales.
Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales. In addition, the Company offers volume rebates to certain of its customers. The total cost of these programs is estimated and accrued as a
reduction to net sales at the time of the respective sale.

Research and Development

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. The amount charged to expense was $7.6 million, $6.9 million, and $6.8 million for
the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Interest Expense, Net

Interest expense, net includes interest income of $9.5 million, $4.8 million, and $5.2 million and amortization of the treasury lock proceeds
received in July 2003 of $3.1 million each year in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

Industry Agreements

PCA regularly trades containerboard with other manufacturers primarily to reduce shipping costs. Containerboard trade agreements are a long-standing
industry practice. These agreements are entered into on an annual basis, in which both parties agree to ship an identical number of tons to each other within the agreement period. These agreements
minimize transportation cost by allowing each party's containerboard mills to ship containerboard to the other party's closest corrugated products plant. PCA tracks each shipment to ensure that the
other party's shipments to the Company match its shipments to them during the agreement period. Such transfers are possible because containerboard is a commodity product with no distinguishing product
characteristics. These transactions are accounted for at carrying value, and sales are not recorded as the transactions do not represent the culmination of an earnings process. The transactions are
recorded into inventory accounts, and no income is recorded until such inventory is converted to a finished product and sold to an end-use customer.

Segment Information

PCA is engaged in one line of business: the integrated manufacture and sale of packaging materials, boxes and containers for industrial and consumer markets. No
single customer accounts for more than 10% of total net sales.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

The Company records its derivatives in accordance with SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." The Statement requires
the Company to recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet at fair value. It further provides criteria for derivative instruments to be designated as fair
value, cash flow or foreign currency hedges and establishes respective accounting standards for reporting changes in the fair value of the derivative

F-13

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

instruments.
The gains or losses resulting from adjusting the derivative instruments to fair value are recorded in net income or accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("OCI"), as appropriate.

The
Company has historically used derivative instruments to manage interest costs and the risk associated with changing interest rates. The Company's objectives for holding derivatives
are to minimize the risks using the most effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impacts of these exposures. As of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company was not a party to any
derivative instruments.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141(R), "Business
Combinations." SFAS No. 141(R) significantly changes the accounting for and reporting of business combination transactions in consolidated financial statements. These significant changes
include (1) recognition of 100% of the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests of acquired businesses, even if 100% of the business has not been
acquired; (2) recognition of contingent consideration arrangements and preacquisition gain and loss contingencies at their acquisition-date fair values; (3) capitalization of
research and development assets acquired at acquisition-date fair value; (4) recognition of acquisition-related transaction costs as expense when incurred; and
(5) recognition of acquisition-related restructuring cost accruals only if the criteria in SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities," are met as of
the acquisition date. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. Early adoption is not permitted. To the extent the Company makes an acquisition
after December 31, 2008, SFAS No. 141(R) will impact the Company's accounting for such acquisition.

In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities—Including an Amendment of FASB Statement
No. 115." This Statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. Most of the provisions of SFAS No. 159 apply only to
entities that elect the fair value option. However, the amendments to SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments In Debt and Equity
Securities," apply to all entities with available-for-sale and trading securtities. SFAS No. 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entity's first fiscal year that
begins after November 15, 2007. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal year that begins on or before November 15, 2007, provided that an entity also elects to apply
the provisions of SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements." Currently, the Company does not plan to adopt the fair value option for any of its financial instruments.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements
No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)." SFAS No. 158 requires plan sponsors of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans (collectively, "postretirement benefit plans") to
recognize the funded status of their postretirement benefit plans in the statement of financial position, measure the fair value of plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the fiscal
year end statement of financial position, and provide additional disclosures. These requirements were effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006, with the exception of the
requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the

F-14

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

plan
sponsor's fiscal year-end. This requirement is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. On December 31, 2006, the Company adopted the recognition and
disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158. The Company is assessing the remaining provision of SFAS No. 158 to determine the impact that the adoption of those provisions may have on its
results of operations.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements." SFAS No. 157 clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market
participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. Under the standard, fair value
measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. This Statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company does not expect
the adoption of this Statement on January 1, 2008 to have a material impact on its financial statements.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") No. AUG AIR-1, "Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities." This FSP prohibits the use of the
accrue-in-advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities in annual and interim financial reporting periods and is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2006. Prior to the adoption of this FSP, the Company determined its planned maintenance costs for the year and amortized these costs ratably throughout the year. On
January 1, 2007, the Company began accounting for its planned major maintenance activities in accordance with FSP No. AUG AIR-1 using the deferral method. The implementation of FSP
No. AUG AIR-1 will not have any impact on the Company's year end financial position or full year results of operations and cash flows as all maintenance costs incurred have been and
continue to be expensed in the fiscal year in which the maintenance activity occurs. In accordance with FSP No. AUG AIR-1, the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash
flows for each quarter of 2006 were adjusted to apply the FSP retrospectively. The following financial statement line items as of and for the three-month period ended December 31, 2006 were
adjusted as follows:

In
June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation ("FIN") No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes," an interpretation of SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes," to create a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a
tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties,
accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN No. 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company adopted FIN No. 48 on
January 1, 2007.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

As
a result of the implementation of FIN No. 48, PCA recognized a $5.1 million decrease to reserves for uncertain tax positions and an increase to the beginning balance of
retained earnings on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2007. After adoption on January 1, 2007, the Company had $8.8 million total gross unrecognized tax
benefits excluding interest. Of this total, $6.5 million (net of the federal benefit for state taxes) would impact the effective tax rate if recognized.

PCA's
continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. After adoption of FIN No. 48 on January 1, 2007,
the Company had accrued interest of $1.0 million gross or $0.6 million net and no reserve for penalties.

4. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

In October 1999, the Company adopted a long-term equity incentive plan, which provides for grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock and performance awards to directors, officers and employees of PCA, as well as others who engage in services for PCA. Option awards granted to directors, officers and employees have
contractual lives of seven or ten years. Options granted to officers and employees vest ratably over a three- or four-year period, whereas options granted to directors vest immediately.
The plan, which will terminate on October 19, 2009, provides for the issuance of up to 6,550,000 shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2007, options or restricted stock for
5,819,699 shares have been granted. Forfeitures are added back to the pool of shares of common stock available to be granted at a future date.

Prior
to January 1, 2006, the Company accounted for its equity incentive plan under the recognition and measurement provisions of Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion
No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related Interpretations, as permitted by "SFAS" No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." No stock option-based
compensation cost was recognized in the statements of income prior to January 1, 2006 as all stock options granted under the plan had an exercise price equal to the market value of the
underlying common stock on the date of

F-16

Packaging Corporation of America

4. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION (Continued)

grant.
Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment," using the modified-prospective-transition method.
Under that transition method, stock compensation cost recognized in 2007 and 2006 includes: (a) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not vested as of
January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, and (b) compensation cost for all share-based payments
granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). Results for prior periods have not been
restated.

Prior
to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company presented all tax benefits of deductions resulting from share-based payment arrangements as operating cash flows in the
statements of cash flows. SFAS No. 123(R) requires the cash flows resulting from the tax benefits from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for those share awards
(excess tax benefits) to be classified as financing cash flows.

Stock-based
compensation expense recognized in the statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was as follows:

The
above pro forma disclosure is provided for the year ended December 31, 2005 because employee stock options were not accounted for using the fair-value method
during that period.

The
Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of each option grant as of the date of grant. Expected volatilities are based on historical
volatility of the Company's common stock. The expected life of the option is estimated using historical data pertaining to option exercises and employee terminations. Separate groups of employees that
have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for estimating the expected life. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of
grant. The estimated weighted-average fair values of and related assumptions for options granted were as follows:

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $14,189,000 and $7,936,000, respectively. As of
December 31, 2007, there was $2,016,000 of total unrecognized compensation costs related to non-vested stock option awards granted under the Company's equity incentive plan. That
cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.0 years.

During
2003, the Company began granting shares of restricted stock to certain of its employees and directors. Restricted stock awards granted to employees vest at the end of a three- or
four-year period, whereas restricted stock awards granted to directors vest at the end of a six-month period. The fair value of restricted stock is determined based on the
closing price of the Company's common stock on the grant date. The Company generally recognizes compensation expense associated with restricted stock awards ratably over their vesting periods. As
PCA's Board of Directors has the ability to accelerate vesting of restricted stock upon an employee's retirement, the Company accelerates the recognition of compensation expense for certain employees
approaching normal retirement age. A summary of the Company's restricted stock activity follows:

January 1, 2003, PCA adopted a mirror-image pension plan for eligible hourly employees to succeed the Pactiv pension plan in which PCA hourly employees had participated
though December 31, 2002. The PCA pension plan for hourly employees recognizes service earned under both the PCA plan and the prior Pactiv plan. Benefits earned under the PCA plan are reduced
by retirement benefits earned under the Pactiv plan through December 31, 2002. All assets and liabilities associated with benefits earned through December 31, 2002 for hourly employees
and retirees of PCA were retained by the Pactiv plan.

Effective
May 1, 2004, PCA adopted a grandfathered pension plan for certain salaried employees who had previously participated in the Pactiv pension plan pursuant to the above
mentioned human resource agreement. The benefit formula for the new PCA pension plan for salaried employees is comparable to that of the Pactiv plan except that the PCA plan uses career average base
pay in the benefit formula in lieu of final average base pay. The PCA pension plan for salaried employees recognizes service earned under both the PCA plan and the prior Pactiv plan. Benefits earned
under the PCA plan are reduced by retirement benefits earned under the Pactiv plan through April 30, 2004. All assets and liabilities associated with benefits earned through April 30,
2004 for salaried employees and retirees of PCA were retained by the Pactiv plan.

PCA
maintains a nonqualified unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan ("SERP"), which augments pension benefits for eligible executives (excluding the Company's CEO) earned under
the PCA pension plan for salaried employees. Benefits are determined using the same formula as the PCA pension plan but in addition to counting career average base pay, the SERP also recognizes
bonuses and any pay earned in excess of IRS qualified plan compensation limits. Benefits earned under the SERP are reduced by benefits paid from the PCA pension plan and any prior qualified pension
and SERP benefits earned under the Pactiv plan.

PCA
also maintains a nonqualified unfunded executive retirement benefit for the Company's CEO which will provide a supplemental pension benefit calculated on the basis of the following
formula: (annual salary + bonus) × (years of service) × (0.0167), where "years of service" equals years of service with
PCA + five years. The benefit is payable in a lump sum, upon separation from service.

PCA
also provides certain medical benefits for retired salaried employees and certain medical and life insurance benefits for certain hourly employees. For salaried employees, the plan
covers employees retiring from PCA on or after attaining age 58 who have had at least 10 years of full-time service with PCA after attaining age 48. For hourly employees, the
postretirement medical coverage, where applicable, is available according to the eligibility provisions in effect at the employee's work location. Per the human resources agreement referred to above,
Pactiv retained the liability relating to retiree medical and life benefits for PCA employees who had retired on or before April 12, 1999 or who were eligible to retire within two years of that
date. On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted a new plan design for salaried employees incorporating annual dollar limits in determining the maximum amount of employer contributions made
towards the total cost of postretirement medical coverage.

6. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS (Continued)

Adoption of SFAS No. 158

On December 31, 2006, the Company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158. SFAS No. 158 required the Company to
recognize the funded status (i.e., the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation) of its pension and postretirement plans in the December 31,
2006 balance sheet, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. The adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income at adoption represents the net
unrecognized actuarial losses and unrecognized prior service costs, all of which were previously netted against the plans' funded status in the Company's balance sheet pursuant to the provisions of
SFAS No. 87. These amounts will be subsequently recognized as net periodic pension cost pursuant to the Company's historical accounting policy for amortizing such amounts. Further, actuarial
gains and losses that arise in subsequent periods and are not recognized as net
periodic pension cost in the same periods will be recognized as a component of other comprehensive income. These amounts will be subsequently recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost on
the same basis as the amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income at the adoption of SFAS No. 158.

Included
in accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31, 2007 and 2006 are the following amounts that have not yet been recognized in net periodic pension cost:
unrecognized prior service costs of $31.5 million ($19.1 million net of tax) and $31.5 million ($19.1 million net of tax), respectively, and unrecognized actuarial losses
of $1.9 million ($1.2 net of tax) and $8.6 million ($5.2 million net of tax), respectively. The pre-tax amounts of prior service cost and actuarial loss included in
accumulated other comprehensive income and recognized in net periodic pension cost for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $2.7 million ($1.6 million net of tax) and
$0.3 million ($0.2 million net of tax), respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company expects to recognize in net periodic pension cost $2.9 million
($1.7 million net of tax) of prior service cost and $0.4 million ($0.2 million net of tax) of actuarial loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income at
December 31, 2007.

The
Company makes pension plan contributions that are sufficient to fund its actuarially determined costs, generally equal to the minimum amounts required by the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act (ERISA). However, from time to time, the Company may make discretionary contributions in excess of the required minimum amounts. Pension plans' assets were invested in the
following classes of securities at September 30, 2007 and 2006:

Percentage

of Fair Value



Equity securities


%

Debt securities


%


%

Other


%


%

In
2007, PCA retained the services of a professional advisor to oversee our pension investments and provide recommendations regarding investment strategy. The percentage of fair value at
September 30, 2007, reflects the apportionment of pension investments based on the investment strategy in place at that time. PCA's overall strategy and related apportionments between equity
and debt securities may change from time to time based on market conditions, external economic factors and the funding status of the plans.

The
return on pension plan assets reflects the expected long-term rates of return for the categories of investments currently held in the plan as well as anticipated returns
for additional contributions made in the future. The expected long-term rate of return is adjusted when there are fundamental changes in expected returns on the plan investments.

The
discount rate assumptions used to calculate the present value of pension and postretirement benefit obligations reflect the rates available on high-quality, fixed-income
debt instruments on September 30 of each year. The rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used for pension accounting and is determined by the Company based upon annual
reviews.

6. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS (Continued)

In
determining net pension and postretirement benefit costs, we have elected to amortize prior service cost on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period
of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans. A 10% corridor is used to determine the amount of the unrecognized net gain or loss to be amortized. The excess, if any, of the unrecognized
net gain or loss over 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets is amortized over the average remaining service period until retirement for
active participants and included in the net periodic benefit cost.

As
of September 30, 2007, the Company assumed health care cost trend rates for its postretirement benefit plans were 7.50% for 2008, 7.00% for 2009, 6.50% for 2010, 6.00% for
2011, 5.50% for 2012 and 5.00% for 2013 and thereafter. As of September 30, 2006, the Company assumed health care cost trend rates were 9.00% for 2007, 8.00% for 2008, 7.00% for 2009, 6.00% for
2010 and 5.00% for 2011 and thereafter. As of September 30, 2005, the Company assumed health care cost trend rates for its postretirement benefit plans were 8.00% in 2006, 7.00% in 2007, 6.00%
in 2008, and 5.00% in 2009 and thereafter.

Increasing
the assumed health care cost trend rate by one percentage point would increase the 2007 postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $1.3 million and would
increase the 2007 net postretirement benefit cost by approximately $0.2 million. Decreasing the assumed health care cost
trend rate by one percentage point would decrease the 2007 postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $1.1 million and would decrease the 2007 net postretirement benefit cost by
approximately $0.2 million.

On

subfacility for letters of credit, and a $50.0 million term loan. The senior credit facility expires in 2008. PCA intends to repay the term loan in full, and enter into a new revolving credit
agreement in 2008.

On
July 21, 2003, PCA closed its offering and private placement of $150.0 million of 4

% ten-year senior notes. The five-year notes are due August 1, 2008, and the ten-year notes are due August 1, 2013. PCA intends to
refinance the five-year notes in 2008.

The
instruments governing PCA's indebtedness contain covenants that limit the ability of PCA and its subsidiaries to enter into sale and leaseback transactions, incur liens, enter into
certain transactions with affiliates, merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company. The senior credit facility also
requires PCA to comply with certain financial covenants, including meeting a minimum interest coverage ratio, a maximum leverage ratio, and minimum net worth levels. A failure to comply with these
restrictions could lead to an event of default, which could result in an acceleration of such indebtedness. At December 31, 2007, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.

As
of December 31, 2007, annual principal maturities for debt, excluding unamortized debt discount, are: $279.2 million in 2008 and $400.0 million in 2013.

Interest
payments in connection with the Company's debt obligations for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, amounted to $38.0 million, $38.2 million,
and $35.8 million, respectively.

On
November 29, 2000, the Company established an on-balance sheet securitization program for its trade accounts receivable. To effectuate this program, the Company
formed a wholly owned limited purpose subsidiary, Packaging Credit Company, LLC ("PCC"), which in turn formed a wholly owned, bankruptcy-remote, special-purpose subsidiary, Packaging
Receivables Company, LLC ("PRC"), for the purpose of acquiring receivables from PCC. Both of these entities are included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. Under this
program, PCC purchases on an ongoing basis substantially all of the receivables of the Company and sells such receivables to PRC. PRC and lenders established a $150.0 million receivables-backed
revolving credit facility ("Receivables Credit Facility") through which PRC obtains funds to purchase receivables from PCC. The receivables purchased by PRC are and will be solely the property of PRC.
In the event of liquidation of PRC, the creditors of PRC would be entitled to satisfy their claims from PRC's assets prior to any distribution to PCC or the Company. Credit available under the
receivables credit facility is on a borrowing-base formula. As a result, the full amount of the facility may not be available at all times. At December 31, 2007,
$109.0 million was outstanding and $41.0 million was available for
additional borrowing under the receivables credit facility. The highest outstanding principal balance under the receivables credit facility during 2007 was $109.0 million. On October 5,
2007, PCA renewed the receivables credit facility for an additional one-year term, expiring on October 3, 2008. The Company expects to renew this credit facility in 2008.

The
fair value of the term loan and the receivables credit facility approximates their carrying amount due to the variable interest-rate feature of the instruments. The fair
values of the senior notes are based on quoted market prices. The fair value of the other debt was determined to not be materially different from the carrying amount.

10. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY (Continued)

On
December 21, 2005, the Company completed a secondary offering of its common stock pursuant to a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
December 9, 2005. The selling stockholder, PCA Holdings LLC, sold 17,825,000 shares of common stock of the Company, which included 2,325,000 shares pursuant to the underwriters' exercise
in full of their over-allotment option. All of these shares were sold at an initial price to the public market of $21.50 per share, and the selling stockholder received proceeds, net of
the underwriting discount, of $20.69 per share. The Company did not sell any shares in, or receive any proceeds from, the secondary offering.

Concurrent
with the closing of the secondary offering on December 21, 2005, the Company entered into a common stock repurchase agreement with PCA Holdings LLC. Pursuant to
the repurchase agreement, the Company purchased 4,500,000 shares of common stock directly from PCA Holdings LLC at the
initial price to the public net of the underwriting discount, for $20.69 per share, the same net price per share received by PCA Holdings LLC in the secondary offering. These shares were
retired on December 21, 2005.

11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Capital Commitments

The Company had authorized capital expenditures of approximately $58.3 million and $48.5 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively, in connection with the expansion and replacement of existing facilities and equipment.

Operating Leases

PCA leases space for certain of its facilities and cutting rights to approximately 102,000 acres of timberland under long-term leases. The Company
also leases equipment, primarily vehicles and rolling stock, and other assets under long-term leases generally of three years. The minimum lease payments under non-cancelable
operating leases with lease terms in excess of one year are as follows:

Litigation

PCA is a party to various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. These legal actions cover a broad variety of claims spanning our entire
business. As of the date of this filing, we believe it is not reasonably possible that the resolution of these legal actions will, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on
our financial position, or results of operations or cash flows.

Environmental Liabilities

In 1998, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized a Clean Air and Water Act commonly referred to as the Cluster Rules. The Cluster Rules
govern allowable discharges of air and water pollutants at all pulp and paper mill operations. As a result, PCA and its competitors were required to incur costs to ensure compliance with these rules.
The Company completed all of the projects related to Cluster Rule requirements in 2006 and, as a result, does not anticipate any further capital expenditures related to compliance with Cluster Rules.
From 1997 through 2006, the Company spent approximately $39.2 million to ensure compliance with Cluster Rule requirements. Total capital expenditures for environmental matters were
$4.5 million for 2007. The Company currently estimates 2008 environmental capital expenditures will be approximately $3.2 million.

The
potential costs for various environmental matters are uncertain due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible cleanup costs, the complexity and evolving nature of
governmental laws and regulations and their interpretations, and the timing, varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup technologies. From 1994 through 2007, remediation costs at the
Company's mills and corrugated plants totaled about $3.2 million. As of December 31, 2007, the Company maintained an environmental reserve of $7.4 million relating to
on-site landfills (see Note 12) and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and anticipated remedial projects. Liabilities recorded for environmental contingencies are estimates of
the probable costs based upon available information and assumptions. Because of these uncertainties, PCA's estimates may change. As of the date of this filing, the Company believes that it is not
reasonably possible that future environmental expenditures and

asset
retirement obligations above the $7.4 million accrued as of December 31, 2007, will have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

In
connection with the sale to PCA of its containerboard and corrugated products business, Pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with
pre-closing off-site waste disposal and all environmental liabilities related to a closed landfill located near our Filer City mill.

12. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

Asset retirement obligations consist primarily of landfill capping and closure and post-closure costs. PCA is legally required to perform capping and
closure and post-closure care on the landfills at each of our mills. In accordance with SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," PCA recognizes the fair value of
a these liabilities as an asset retirement obligation for each landfill and capitalizes that cost as part of the cost basis of the related asset. The liability is accreted to its estimated fair value
over time, and the related assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. Upon settlement of the liability, PCA will recognize a gain or loss for any difference
between the settlement amount and the recorded liability.

13. INCOME TAXES (Continued)

Cash
payments for income taxes were $105.5 million, $65.1 million and $10.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

As
of December 31, 2007, the Company had no federal net operating loss carry forwards and had gross state and local net operating loss carry forwards of approximately
$59.3 million with various expiration dates.

During
the third quarter of 2007, the statute of limitations for the tax year 2001 expired. Also, the Federal examination of the tax year 2004 was concluded. As a result of these events,
the reserve for uncertain tax positions was decreased by $1.0 million gross or $0.8 million net of the federal benefit for state taxes. At December 31, 2007, PCA had
$9.4 million unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest. Of this total, $6.9 million (net of the federal benefit for state taxes) would impact the effective tax rate if recognized.

During
the year ended December 31, 2007, PCA recorded $0.6 million gross or $0.4 million net in its statement of income, increasing the accrual for interest to
$1.6 million gross or $1.0 million net at December 31, 2007. No accrual for penalties was made.

PCA
and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income taxes, as well as income taxes of multiple state and city jurisdictions. A federal examination of the tax years 2002 and 2004
have been concluded. The tax years 2003, 2005 and 2006 remain open to federal examination. In major state jurisdictions, tax
years 2002-2006 remain open for examination. PCA does not expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next 12 months.

14. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND OTHER SEVERANCE

In July 2007, the Company closed a corrugated products plant. The charges related to the closure were recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 146, "Accounting
for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities," which requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. In
connection with the shutdown of this plant, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges, including severance, of $0.9 million during the third quarter of 2007.

In
August 2006, the Company informed impacted employees that it would close a corrugated products plant by September 30, 2006. In connection with the closing of this plant, the
Company sold the equipment and the building for cash proceeds of $1.6 million and recorded a pre-tax loss of

$0.3 million.
The Company also recorded severance expenses of $0.5 million and wrote off $0.2 million of assets, primarily intangible assets during the third quarter of 2006.

In
August 2005, the Company informed impacted employees that it would close a corrugated products plant by December 31, 2005. In connection with the shutdown of the corrugated
products plant, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $1.7 million during 2005 and $0.3 million during 2006. On November 3, 2006, PCA sold the building
for cash proceeds of $0.4 million and recorded a pre-tax gain of $0.4 million.

15. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, PCA owns an approximately 29% and 31


/


% interest, respectively, in Southern Timber Venture, LLC
("STV"). At December 31, 2007 and 2006, PCA had not guaranteed the debt of STV and has no future funding requirements. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, there is no carrying value of the
Company's investment in STV under the equity method. PCA received dividends from STV of $15.0 million ($14.0 million net of direct expenses) in 2005. PCA did not receive any dividends
from STV in 2007 or 2006.

In
April 2005 and December 2004, STV sold to other parties approximately 90,000 acres and 150,000 acres, respectively, of timberland previously owned and managed by STV that were under
the supply agreement with PCA. STV will continue to manage the timberlands for the new buyers. In connection with the sale, PCA entered into new supply agreements with the buyers related to the
acreage sold and continues to buy pulpwood from both STV and the buyers. After both sales, STV

currently
owns approximately 55,000 acres of land, including timberlands and higher beneficial use properties, located primarily in southern Georgia and northern Florida.

Currently,
PCA purchases pulpwood directly from STV for its Valdosta mill in accordance with the terms of a fiber supply agreement between the two companies which expires
December 31, 2017. The price of pulpwood in this agreement is based upon the fair market value of pulpwood and is adjusted annually for any changes in market value. PCA purchased
$3.2 million and $3.3 million of pulpwood for its Valdosta, Georgia mill from STV during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. PCA purchased $4.1 million of pulpwood
for its Counce, Tennessee and Valdosta, Georgia mills from STV during the year ended December 31, 2005.

In
December 2007, PCA sold a portion of its interest in STV for $1.0 million and recognized a pre-tax gain of $1.0 million.

16. ACQUISITIONS

During the second quarter of 2006, PCA acquired a sheet plant in Miami, Florida for $4.3 million, which expanded the Company's presence in southern
Florida. The purchase method of accounting was used to account for the acquisition. Goodwill of $2.9 million (which is deductible for income tax purposes) was recorded in connection with the
acquisition. Net sales and total assets of the plant acquired were not material. Operating results of the plant subsequent to the date of acquisition are included in the Company's operating results.

During
the second quarter of 2005, PCA acquired a full line corrugated plant in Jackson, Mississippi, a specialty sheet plant in St. Louis, Missouri, and a graphics packaging and
display manufacturing plant in Olive Branch, Mississippi for $48.7 million. These plants expanded PCA's presence in geographic markets where PCA did not have any plant locations. The purchase
method of accounting was used to account for the acquisition of these plants. Goodwill of $30.5 million (which is deductible for income tax purposes) and $2.4 million of intangible
assets were recorded in connection with the acquisition. The intangible assets include customer lists and relations. Net sales and total assets of the plants acquired were not material. Operating
results of the plants subsequent to the date of acquisition are included in the Company's operating results.

17. DIVESTITURES

On November 16, 2006, PCA sold its Fulton, Mississippi sawmill and received $0.7 million in proceeds and recognized a $0.3 million
pre-tax gain. In 2006, through the date of the sale of the

facility,
the sawmill had net sales of $5.7 million. The sawmill had net sales of $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005.

18. BUSINESS INTERRUPTION INSURANCE RECOVERY

On
October 24, 2007, PCA's Counce, Tennessee mill incurred a major, unplanned outage due to a total mill power failure. The mill was down for 2


/


days and
experienced operational difficulties through the end of the month. This outage resulted in about 11,000 tons of lost production as well as significant additional operating costs of $7.4 million
($4.7 million net of tax). In December 2007, the Company received $2.4 million ($1.5 million net of tax) in business interruption insurance proceeds. The amount of the
loss, net of the insurance recovery, is included in cost of sales in the statement of income. The insurance proceeds are included in net cash provided by operating activities in the statement of cash
flows.
