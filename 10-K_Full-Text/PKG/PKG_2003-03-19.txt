INDEX


PART I

Item 1. BUSINESS

General

Packaging Corporation of America, or PCA, is the sixth
largest producer of containerboard and corrugated products in the United
States, based on production capacity as reported in the Pulp & Paper 2002 North American Fact Book. With
2002 net sales of $1.7 billion, PCA produced about 2.2 million tons
of containerboard, about 80% of which was consumed in our corrugated products
manufacturing plants, and shipped about 27.5 billion square feet (BSF) of
corrugated products.

Containerboard
Production and Corrugated Shipments

In 2002, we produced about 1.4 million tons of
kraft linerboard at our mills located in Counce, Tennessee and Valdosta,
Georgia. We also produced about 0.8 million tons of semi-chemical
corrugating medium at our mills located in Tomahawk, Wisconsin and Filer City,
Michigan. We currently lease the cutting rights to approximately 140,000 acres
of timberland located near our Counce and Valdosta mills. We also have supply
agreements on about 600,000 of the 800,000 acres of timberland we sold during
1999 and 2000.

Our converting operations produce a wide variety of
corrugated packaging products, including conventional shipping containers used
to protect and transport manufactured goods. We also produce multi-color
boxes and displays with strong visual appeal that help to merchandise the
packaged product in retail locations. Finally, we are a large producer of meat
boxes and wax-coated boxes for the agricultural industry.

Corporate Developments

On April 12, 1999, Pactiv Corporation, formerly
known as Tenneco Packaging Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of
Tenneco Inc., sold its containerboard and corrugated products business to
PCA, an entity formed by Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC, a private equity
investment firm, in January 1999, for $2.2 billion, consisting of
$246.5 million in cash, the assumption of $1,760.0 million of debt
incurred by Pactiv immediately prior to the contribution, and a 45% common
equity interest in PCA valued at $193.5 million. PCA Holdings LLC, an
entity organized and controlled by Madison Dearborn, acquired the remaining 55%
common equity interest in PCA for $236.5 million in cash, which was used
to finance in part the transactions.

The financing of the transactions consisted of (1) borrowings
under a new $1,469.0 million senior credit facility for which J.P. Morgan
Securities Inc. and BT Alex. Brown Incorporated (the predecessor to
Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown) were co-lead arrangers, (2) the offering of
$550.0 million of 9


/


% senior subordinated notes
due 2009, and $100.0 million of 12


/


% senior
exchangeable preferred stock due 2010, (3) a cash equity investment of
$236.5 million by PCA Holdings LLC and (4) an equity investment by
Pactiv valued at $193.5 million. As required by their terms, the
$550.0 million of senior subordinated notes and $100.0 million of
senior exchangeable preferred stock issued in the April 12, 1999
transactions were exchanged for publicly registered securities in the same
amounts in a registered exchange offer completed in October 1999.


The senior credit facility was entered into to finance
in part the transactions and to pay related fees and expenses and to provide
future borrowings to PCA for general corporate purposes, including working
capital. The senior credit facility initially consisted of three term loan
facilities in an original aggregate principal amount of $1,219.0 million
and a revolving credit facility with up to $250.0 million in availability.
Effective December 14, 1999, PCA elected to reduce its availability under
the revolving credit facility from $250.0 million to $150.0 million.

On January 28, 2000, PCA became a publicly-traded
company with the initial public offering of its common stock. In the offering,
Pactiv sold 35,000,000 shares and PCA sold 11,250,000 new shares of common
stock, both at an offering price of $12.00 per share. PCA used its net proceeds
to redeem all of the outstanding senior exchangeable preferred stock on March 3,
2000.

PCA completed the refinancing of its
$735.0 million senior secured debt and $150.0 million senior secured
revolving credit facility on June 29, 2000. Completion of the refinancing
eliminated a $226.5 million term loan, and reduced PCA’s average effective
interest rate on its senior secured term debt by approximately 100 basis
points. PCA’s total borrowings under the senior credit facility as of December 31,
2002 consisted of $79.0 million of term loans. No amounts were outstanding
under the senior revolving credit facility as of that date.

On November 29, 2000, PCA established an
on-balance sheet securitization program for its trade accounts receivable. To
effectuate this program, PCA formed a wholly-owned limited purpose
subsidiary, Packaging Credit Company, LLC, or PCC, which in turn formed a
wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote, special-purpose subsidiary,
Packaging Receivables Company, LLC, or PRC, for the purpose of acquiring
receivables from PCC. Both of these entities are included in the consolidated
financial statements of PCA. Under this program, PCC purchases on an ongoing
basis all of the receivables of PCA and sells such receivables to PRC. PRC and
lenders established a $150.0 million receivables-backed revolving
credit facility through which PRC obtains funds to purchase receivables from
PCC. The receivables purchased by PRC are and will be solely the property of
PRC. In the event of a liquidation of PRC, the creditors of PRC would be
entitled to satisfy their claims from PRC’s assets prior to any distribution to
PCC or PCA. Credit available under the receivables credit facility is on a
borrowing-base formula. As a result, the full amount of the facility may not be
available at all times. As of December 31, 2002, $113.0 million was
outstanding and $37.0 million was available for additional borrowing under
the receivables credit facility. The highest outstanding principal balance
under the receivables credit facility during fiscal 2002 was
$126.0 million.

During 2001, Pactiv sold approximately 6,160,240
shares of PCA common stock, which represented its remaining ownership interest.

Converting plants tend to be located in close
proximity to customers to minimize freight costs. The corrugated products
industry consists of approximately 675 companies in the United States.

Containerboard, which includes both linerboard and
corrugating medium, is the principal raw material used to manufacture
corrugated products. Linerboard is used as the inner and outer facings, or
liners, of corrugated products. Corrugating medium is fluted and laminated to
linerboard in corrugator plants to produce corrugated sheets. The sheets are
subsequently printed, cut, folded and glued in corrugator plants or sheet
plants to produce corrugated products.

Containerboard may be manufactured from both softwood
and hardwood fibers, as well as from recycled fibers from used corrugated and
waste from converting operations. Kraft linerboard is made predominantly from
softwoods like pine. Semi-chemical corrugating medium is made from hardwoods
such as oak. The finished paper product is wound into large rolls, which are
slit to size as required by converters, and shipped to them.

Linerboard is made in a range of grades or basis
weights. The most commonly used basis weight of linerboard is 35 lb., although
linerboard is produced in weights that vary from under 26 lb. to over 90 lb.
Basis weight represents the weight in pounds per thousand square feet of
linerboard. Producers also market linerboard by performance characteristics,
appearance and color. The following table describes different product weight,
performance and color characteristics:

Historically, pricing for containerboard has reflected
changes in containerboard supply as well as changes in demand.

PCA Operations and
Products

Our two linerboard mills can manufacture a broad range
of linerboard grades ranging from 26 lb. to 96 lb. Our two semi-chemical
corrugating medium mills can manufacture grades ranging in weight from 21 lb.
to 47 lb. All four of our mills have completed an extensive independent review
process to become ISO 9002 certified. ISO 9002 is an international quality
certification that verifies a facility maintains and follows stringent
procedures for manufacturing, sales and customer service.

Counce.

Our
Counce, Tennessee mill is one of the largest linerboard mills in the United
States. Its production capacity is approximately 980,000 tons per year. In
2002, we produced approximately 966,000 tons of kraft linerboard on two paper
machines at Counce. We produced a broad range of basis weights from 31 lb.
to 90 lb. The mill also produces a variety of performance and specialty
grades of linerboard including high-ring crush and wet strength.


Valdosta.

Our
Valdosta, Georgia mill is a kraft linerboard mill that has a production
capacity of approximately 406,000 tons per year. In 2002, our single paper
machine at Valdosta produced approximately 425,000 tons of kraft linerboard. Linerboard
production for 2002 exceeded the stated capacity of the mill due to an
unusually high percentage of middleweight production. Valdosta produces light
to middleweight linerboard ranging from 35 lb. to 56 lb., and heavyweight/super
heavyweight linerboard ranging from 61 lb. to 90 lb.

Tomahawk.

Our
Tomahawk, Wisconsin mill is the second largest corrugating medium mill in the
United States with production capacity of 547,000 tons per year. In 2002, we
produced approximately 533,000 tons of semi-chemical corrugating medium on three
paper machines, one of which is among the largest corrugating medium machines
in the world. These machines produce a broad range of basis weights from 23 lb.
to 40 lb. Our Tomahawk mill also produces a variety of performance and
specialty grades of corrugating medium. This includes high ring crush, wet
strength, tare weight and super heavyweight.

Filer City.

Our
Filer City, Michigan mill is a semi-chemical corrugating medium mill currently
operating with two machines with a production capacity of 292,000 tons. In
2002, we produced approximately 281,000 tons of corrugating medium. In July 1998,
we shut down one machine at Filer City. Mill production capacity at Filer City
is 362,000 tons a year if we run all three paper machines. Filer City produces
a range of corrugating medium grades in basis weights from 23 lb. to 40 lb.

We operate 64 corrugated manufacturing operations, a
technical and development center, five regional graphic design centers, a
rotogravure printing operation and a complement of packaging supplies and
distribution centers. Of the 64 manufacturing facilities, 39 operate as
combining operations that manufacture corrugated sheets and finished corrugated
containers. The remaining 25 manufacturing facilities purchase combined sheets
and manufacture finished corrugated containers. The five graphic design centers
are located in Cincinnati, Ohio; Dallas, Texas; Cranbury, New Jersey;
Salisbury, North Carolina and South Gate, California.

Our corrugated manufacturing operations are spread
throughout the United States. Each corrugator plant serves a market radius that
typically averages 150 miles. Our sheet plants are generally located in close proximity
to our larger corrugator plants which enables us to offer additional services
and converting capabilities such as small volume and quick turnaround items.

We produce a wide variety of products ranging from
basic corrugated shipping containers to specialized packaging such as
wax-coated boxes for the agriculture industry. We also have multi-color
printing capabilities to make high-impact graphics boxes and displays that
offer customers more attractive packaging.

Timberland

We currently lease the cutting rights to approximately
140,000 acres of timberland located near our Counce and Valdosta mills.
Virtually all of the acres under cutting rights agreements are located within
100 miles of our mills, which results in lower wood transportation costs and provides
a secure source of wood fiber. Most of these leased cutting rights agreements
have terms with over 15 years remaining.

During 1999 and 2000, PCA sold about 800,000 acres of
timberland. As part of the timberland sale agreements, we entered into supply
arrangements covering about 600,000 acres of the total acres sold. We also
retained a one-third equity ownership interest in 385,000 acres sold to
Southern Timber Venture, LLC in November 2000.

In addition to the timberland we manage ourselves, our
Forest Management Assistance Program provides professional forestry assistance
to private timberland owners to improve harvest yields and to optimize their
harvest schedule. We have managed the regeneration of approximately 120,000
acres by supplying pine seedlings. In exchange for our expertise, we are given
the right of first refusal over timber


sales from those lands.
These private lands include over 210,000 acres of timberland. We expect to
harvest approximately 85,000 cords of wood from these forests annually.

PCA also participates in the Sustainable Forestry
Initiative, which is organized by the American Forest and Paper Association.
This initiative is aimed at ensuring the long-term health and conservation of
America’s forestry resources. Activities include limiting tree harvest sizes,
replanting harvest acreage, participating in flora and fauna research and
protecting water streams.

Solid Wood and Recycling Facilities

We own three sawmills located in Ackerman and Fulton,
Mississippi and Selmer, Tennessee. During 2002, these three sawmills sold
approximately 115 million board feet of lumber used to make furniture and
building products. We also have an air-dry yard operation in Burnsville,
Mississippi that holds newly cut lumber while it dries.

We also operate two paper recycling centers, one in
Jackson, Tennessee and one in Nashville, Tennessee. These recycling centers
collect old corrugated containers, newspapers and other paper that provide a
source of recycled fiber to our nearby Counce mill.

Sales and Marketing

Our corrugated products are sold through a direct
sales and marketing organization. Sales representatives and a sales manager at
each converting operations facility serve local and regional accounts.
Corporate account managers serve large national accounts at multiple customer
locations. Additionally, our graphic design centers maintain an on-site
dedicated graphics sales force. General marketing support is located at our
corporate headquarters.

Our containerboard sales group is responsible for the
sale of linerboard and corrugating medium to our corrugator plants, to other
domestic customers and to the export market. This group handles order
processing for all shipments of containerboard from our mills to our corrugator
plants. These personnel also coordinate and execute all containerboard trade
agreements with other containerboard manufacturers.

In addition to direct sales and marketing personnel,
we utilize support personnel that are new product development engineers and
product graphics and design specialists. These individuals are located at both
the corrugator plants as well as the graphic design centers.

Distribution

Our corrugated products are usually delivered by truck
due to our large number of customers and their demand for timely service. Shipping
costs represent a relatively high percentage of our total costs due to the high
bulk of corrugated products. As a result, our converting operations typically
service customers within a 150 miles radius.

Containerboard produced in our mills is shipped by
rail or truck. Our individual mills do not own or maintain outside warehousing
facilities. We do use some third-party warehouses for short-term storage.

Customers

PCA’s corrugated products group sells to over 8,300
customers in over 14,600 locations. About 70% of our corrugated products
customers are regional and local accounts, which are broadly diversified across
industries and geographic locations. The remaining 30% of our customer base
consists primarily of national accounts, or those customers with a national
presence. These customers typically purchase corrugated products from several
of our box plants throughout the United States.


In 2002, our corrugated products plants consumed
approximately 1,752,000 tons, or 80% of our mills’ containerboard production.
Of the remaining 20% of our containerboard mill production that we did not
consume at our own converting operations, about 12% of the tons was sold to
domestic customers, and about 8% of the tons was sold to export customers.

Major Raw Materials Used

Fiber supply.

Fiber
is the single largest cost in the manufacture of containerboard. PCA consumes
both wood fiber and recycled fiber in our containerboard mills. We have no 100%
recycled mills, or those mills whose fiber consumption consists solely of
recycled fiber. To reduce our fiber costs, we have invested in processes and
equipment to ensure a high degree of fiber flexibility. Our mills have the
capability to shift a portion of their fiber consumption between softwood,
hardwood and recycled sources. With the exception of our Valdosta mill, our
other mills can utilize some recycled fiber in their containerboard production.
Our ability to use various types of virgin and recycled fiber helps mitigate
the impact of changes in the prices of various fibers. Our corrugated products
plants generate recycled fiber as a by-product from the manufacturing process,
which is sold to our mills directly or through trade agreements. During 2002,
our containerboard mills consumed approximately 554,000 tons of recycled fiber,
of which about 198,000 tons was generated from our own box plants, resulting in
net recycled consumption of 356,000 tons, or 16% of our total fiber
requirements.

Energy supply.

Energy
at the mills is obtained through purchased electricity or through various
fuels, which are converted to steam or electricity on-site. Fuel sources
include coal, natural gas, oil, internally produced and purchased bark and
by-products of the containerboard manufacturing and pulping process. These
fuels are burned in boilers to produce steam. Steam turbine generators are used
to produce electricity. To reduce our mill energy cost, we have invested in
processes and equipment to ensure a high level of purchased fuel flexibility.
Historically, natural gas and fuel oil have shown more price volatility than
coal and purchased bark. During 2002, 11.8 million M


BTU’s (million
BTU’s), or approximately 70% of our mills purchased fuel needs, were from
purchased bark and coal, historically our two lowest cost fuels. For the same
period, our mills consumed about 3.0 million M


BTU’s of natural gas
and 1.9 million M


BTU’s of fuel oil.

Our two, kraft linerboard mills at Counce and Valdosta
generate approximately 65% to 70% of their fuel requirements from their own
by-products. Approximately 45% to 50% of the electricity consumed by our four
mills is generated on-site.

PCA’s corrugated products combining plants each have a
boiler that produces steam which is used by the corrugator. The majority of
these boilers burn natural gas, although some also have the ability to burn
fuel oil. During 2002, PCA’s corrugated products plants consumed approximately
2.1 million M


BTU’s of natural gas.

Competition

Corrugated products are produced by about 675 U.S.
companies operating approximately 1,425 plants. Most corrugated products are
custom manufactured to the customer’s specifications. Corrugated producers
generally sell within a 150-mile radius of their plants and compete with other
corrugated producers in their local market. In fact, the Fibre Box Association
tracks industry data by 47 distinct market regions.

The larger, multi-plant integrated companies may
also solicit larger, multi-plant customers who purchase for all of their
facilities on a consolidated basis. These customers are often referred to as
national or corporate accounts.

Corrugated products businesses seek to differentiate
themselves through pricing, quality, service, design and product innovation. We
compete for both local and national account business and we compete


against producers of other
types of packaging products. On a national level, our competitors include
Georgia-Pacific Corporation, International Paper Company, Smurfit-Stone
Container Corporation, Temple-Inland Inc. and Weyerhaeuser Company. However,
with our strategic focus on local and regional accounts, we believe we compete
as much with the smaller, independent converters as with the larger, integrated
producers.

Our principal competitors with respect to our
containerboard produced but not consumed at our own corrugated products plants
are a number of large, diversified paper companies, including Georgia-Pacific
Corporation, International Paper Company, Smurfit-Stone Container
Corporation, Temple-Inland Inc. and Weyerhaeuser Company, as well as
other regional manufacturers. Containerboard is generally considered a
commodity-type product and can be purchased from numerous suppliers.

Employees

As of December 31, 2002, we had approximately
7,900 employees. Approximately 2,200 of these employees were salaried and
approximately 5,700 were hourly. Approximately 75% of our hourly employees are
represented by unions. Our unionized employees are represented primarily by the
Paper, Allied Industrial, Chemical, Energy Workers International Union, the
International Association of Machinists, the Graphic Communications
International Union and the United Steel Workers of America (USWA).

The contract for our unionized mill employees at our
Valdosta, Georgia kraft linerboard mill expires in September 2003.
Contracts for unionized mill employees at our three remaining containerboard
mills expire between October 2005 and June 2007. Contracts for
unionized converting plant employees expire between February 2003 and November 2008.
We are currently in negotiations to renew or extend any union contracts that
have recently expired or are expiring in the near future.

During 2002 we experienced no work stoppages. In 2001,
we experienced a one-month strike at our Filer City mill with the USWA. The
strike was settled, and the mill’s current agreement expires in May 2006.
Prior to this incident we had experienced no instances of significant work stoppages in
the previous 15 years. We believe we have satisfactory relations with our
employees.

Environmental Matters

Compliance with environmental requirements is a
significant factor in our business operations. We commit substantial resources
to maintaining environmental compliance and managing environmental risk. We are
subject to, and must comply with, a variety of federal, state and local
environmental laws, particularly those relating to air and water quality, waste
disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater. We believe that
we are currently in material compliance with all applicable environmental rules and
regulations. Because environmental regulations are constantly evolving, we have
incurred, and will continue to incur, costs to maintain compliance with those
laws. We work diligently to anticipate and budget for the impact of applicable
environmental regulations and do not currently expect that future environmental
compliance obligations will materially affect our business or financial
condition.

In April 1998, the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) finalized a new Clean Air and Water Act commonly
referred to as the Cluster Rules, which govern all pulp and paper mill
operations, including those at our mills. Over the next several years, the
Cluster Rules will affect our allowable discharges of air and water
pollutants. As a result, PCA and its competitors are required to incur costs to
ensure compliance with these new rules. From 1997 through 2002, we spent
approximately $30.3 million on Cluster Rule compliance to meet Clean
Air Act requirements. Total capital costs for environmental matters, including
Cluster Rule compliance, were $4.3 million for 2002. We currently
estimate 2003 environmental capital expenditures will be $14.7 million, of
which $4.4 million of the


expenditures are to meet
Cluster Rule requirements. Our current spending projections to complete
all Cluster Rule compliance requirements at our four mills is about
$14.4 million from 2003 to 2005.

As is the case with any industrial operation, we have
in the past incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or
groundwater contamination. From 1994 through 2002, remediation costs at our
mills and converting plants totaled about $2.9 million. We do not believe
that any on-going remedial projects are material in nature. As of December 31,
2002, we maintained an environmental reserve of $3.7 million, which
includes funds relating to onsite landfill and surface impoundments as well as
on-going and anticipated remedial projects. We believe these reserves are
adequate.

We could also incur environmental liabilities as a
result of claims by third parties for civil damages, including liability for
personal injury or property damage, arising from releases of hazardous
substances or contamination. We are not aware of any material claims of this
type currently pending against us.

As a part of the April 12, 1999 transactions,
Pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites
associated with pre-closing offsite waste disposal. Pactiv also retained
environmental liability for a closed landfill located near the Filer City mill.

2,225,000 tons for our total mill containerboard system.

Each of the mills is
currently subject to a mortgage held by Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New
York on behalf of the lenders under the senior credit facility.

In addition to our mills,
we own 42 corrugated products plants. We also own three sawmills, an air-drying
yard, one recycling facility, one warehouse and miscellaneous other property,
which includes sales offices and woodlands forest management offices. These
sales offices and woodlands forest management offices generally have one to
four employees and serve as administrative offices. We lease 22 corrugated
products plants, five regional design centers, one recycling facility and
numerous other distribution centers, warehouses and facilities. PCA has one
leased property, a warehouse and assembly center, outside of the continental
United States in Nogales, Mexico. All of our owned real property is subject to
a first priority mortgage held by Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York on
behalf of the lenders under the senior credit facility.

We lease the cutting
rights to approximately 140,000 acres of timberland located near our Counce and
Valdosta mills. Most of these cutting rights agreements have terms with over
15 years remaining.

We currently lease
our executive and administrative offices in Lake Forest, Illinois under a lease
expiring in January 2005. We currently believe that our facilities and
properties are sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the
foreseeable future.

Item 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On May 14,
1999, PCA was named as a defendant in a Consolidated Class Action
Complaint which alleged a civil violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.
The suit, captioned

Winoff Industries, Inc.
v. Stone Container Corporation

, MDL No. 1261 (E.D. Pa.), names
us as a defendant based solely on the allegation that PCA is successor to the
interests of Tenneco Packaging Inc. and Tenneco Inc., both of which
were also named as defendants in the suit, along with nine other linerboard
manufacturers. The complaint alleges that the defendants, during the period October 1,
1993 through November 30, 1995, conspired to limit the supply of
linerboard, and that the purpose and effect of the alleged conspiracy was
artificially to increase prices of corrugated containers. The plaintiffs have
moved to certify a class of all persons in the United States who purchased
corrugated containers directly from any defendant during the above period, and
seek treble damages and attorneys’ fees on behalf of the purported class. The
Court granted plaintiffs’ motion on September 4, 2001, but modified the
proposed class to exclude those purchasers who purchased corrugated containers
pursuant to contracts in which the price was “not tied to the price of
linerboard”. The Court’s class certification decision was affirmed by the Court
of Appeals for the Third Circuit on September 5, 2002. The case is currently
set for trial in April, 2004. We believe that the plaintiffs’ allegations have
no merit and intend to defend against the suit vigorously. We do not believe
that the


outcome
of this litigation should have a material adverse effect on our financial
position, results of operations, or cash flow.

PCA is also party
to various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business. These
legal actions cover a broad variety of claims spanning our entire business. We
believe that the resolution of these legal actions will not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or
results of operations.

Under the terms of the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness, we
are restricted in the amount of dividends we can pay on our common stock.

No equity securities of PCA were sold by PCA during
fiscal year 2002 which were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933.


Stock Repurchase Program

On May 16,

Item 6.

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

The following table sets forth the selected historical
financial and other data of PCA and the containerboard and corrugated products
business of Pactiv Corporation (the “Group”). The selected historical financial
and other data as of and for the years ended December 31, 1998, and for
the period from January 1, 1999 to April 11, 1999, was derived from
the audited combined financial statements of the Group. The historical
financial data as of December 31, 1999 and for the period from April 12,
1999 to December 31, 1999, and for the years ended December 31, 2000,
2001and 2002 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial
statements of PCA included elsewhere in this report. The information contained
in the following table also should be read in conjunction with “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and
the historical consolidated financial statements of PCA including the notes thereto,
contained elsewhere in this report.


1)

There
was no activity for PCA from January 25, 1999, its date of inception,
through April 11, 1999.

2)

Earnings per share through April 11, 1999 has been
calculated using the historical earnings of the Group and the number of common
shares resulting from the closing of the acquisition on April 12, 1999
(94,600,000 common shares after giving effect to the 220-for-one stock split).
For the PCA historical period from April 12, 1999 to December 31,
1999, earnings available to common stockholders includes a reduction for $9,296
of preferred stock dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2000,
earnings available to common stockholders includes reductions of $2,371 of
preferred stock dividends and $16,266 for the redemption of PCA’s 12 3/8%
preferred stock. PCA did not declare any dividends on its common shares in 1999,
2000, 2001 or 2002.

For all periods presented through April 11, 1999,
basic and diluted earnings per share are the same because there are no potentially
dilutive securities. For the PCA historical period from April 12, 1999 to
December 31, 1999 and for the years ended December 31, 2000, 2001 and
2002 diluted earnings per share includes the dilutive effect of outstanding
options. This dilutive effect is calculated using the treasury stock method.

3)

Total long-term obligations include long-term debt, the
current maturities of long-term debt and redeemable preferred stock. The amount
excludes amounts due to Pactiv or other Tenneco affiliates as part of the
Group’s interdivision account or other financing arrangement.


Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion of historical results of
operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the
audited financial statements and the notes thereto which appear elsewhere in
this report.

Overview

In connection with the April 12, 1999
transactions, PCA acquired the containerboard and corrugated products business
of Pactiv Corporation (the “Group”), formerly known as Tenneco
Packaging Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Tenneco, Inc. The Group
operated prior to April 12, 1999 as a division of Pactiv, and not as a
separate, stand-alone entity. From its formation in January 1999 and
through the closing of the acquisition on April 12, 1999, PCA did not have
any significant operations.

The April 12, 1999 acquisition was accounted for
using historical values for the contributed assets. Purchase accounting was not
applied because, under the applicable accounting guidance, a change of control
was deemed not to have occurred as a result of the participating veto rights
held by Pactiv after the closing of the transactions under the terms of the
stockholders agreement entered into in connection with the transactions.

General

Containerboard demand is dependent upon both domestic
demand for corrugated products and linerboard export activity.

According to Pulp & Paper Week, after giving
effect to price changes in 2002, average mid-point prices in December 2002
for linerboard and corrugating medium, East, were 4% higher than December 2001
prices.

Pulp & Paper Week, in its February 17,
2003 publication, reported that average prices for linerboard and corrugating
medium decreased $10 per ton, or 2%, and $15 per ton, or 4%, respectively,
compared to December 2002 levels. The March 17, 2003 Pulp &
Paper Week publication reported that prices remained unchanged from February 2003
levels.


Results of Operations

The historical
results of operations of PCA are set forth below:

Year Ended December 31,
2002 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2001

Net Sales

Net sales decreased by $54.1 million, or 3.0%,
for the year ended December 31, 2002 from the year ended December 31,
2001. The decrease was primarily the result of decreased sales prices of
corrugated products and containerboard, partially offset by increased corrugated
products volume and slightly higher volume of containerboard sold to third
parties.

Total corrugated products volume increased 3.5% to
27.5 billion square feet in 2002 compared to 26.5 billion square feet
in 2001. On a comparable shipment-per-workday basis, corrugated products volume
increased 3.9% in 2002 from 2001. The larger percentage increase was due to the
fact that 2001 had one more workday, those days not falling on a weekend or
holiday, than 2002. Containerboard volume to external domestic and export customers
increased 11.4% to 477,000 tons for the year ended December 31, 2002 from 428,000
tons in the comparable period of 2001. Our total containerboard mill production
in 2002 was 2,204,000 tons compared to 2,125,000 tons in 2001.

According to Pulp & Paper Week, average
industry mid-point linerboard and semi-chemical medium prices for 42 lb.
Liner-East and 26 lb. Medium-East, which are representative benchmark grades,
were $426 and $383, respectively, per ton in 2002. This compares to $444 and
$404, respectively, per ton in 2001. With respect to box prices, PCA realized
an additional $9 per ton increase in October after implementing $10 per
ton increases in both August and September.

In November 2002, Pulp & Paper Week reported
that average linerboard prices for 42 lb. Liner-East decreased $5 per ton to
$435 per ton. The same publication reported that prices for 26 lb. Medium-East,
semi-chemical medium remained unchanged for the month at $395 per ton. Pulp &
Paper Week reported no changes in linerboard or medium prices in December.

Income Before Interest Expense and Income Taxes
(Operating Income)

Operating income decreased by $104.2 million, or
41.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to 2001. The decrease
was primarily the result of decreased sales prices, which reduced operating
income by $97.8 million, plus increased costs for recycled fiber at our
containerboard mills,


higher medical costs and
increased depreciation expense. These items were only partially offset by increased
corrugated products and containerboard volume.

PCA did not record any material benefit related to
changes in accounting treatment of goodwill in 2002. Goodwill amortization was not
material for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001.

Gross profit decreased $91.4 million, or 21.9%,
for the year ended December 31, 2002 from the year ended December 31,
2001. Gross profit as a percentage of sales declined from 23.3% of sales in 2001
to 18.8% of sales in the current year primarily due to the sales price
decreases described above.

Corporate overhead for the year ended December 31,
2002, increased by $0.4 million, or 1.1%, from the year ended December 31,
2001.

Selling and administrative expenses increased
$8.6 million, or 6.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2002 from the
comparable period in 2001. The increase was primarily the result of increased
salary, medical and other general selling related expenses.

Interest Expense and Income Taxes

Interest expense decreased by $6.4 million, or
8.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2002 from the comparable period in
2001, primarily due to prepayments PCA made in 2001 and 2002 on the term loans
under its senior credit facility and the receivables credit facility.

PCA’s effective tax rate was 37.9% for the year ended December 31,
2002 and 38.7% for the year ended December 31, 2001. The tax rate is
higher than the federal statutory rate of 35.0% due to state income taxes.

Year Ended December 31,
2001 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2000

Net Sales

Net sales decreased by $131.9 million, or 6.9%,
for the year ended December 31, 2001 from the year ended December 31,
2000. The decrease was primarily the result of decreased sales prices, reduced
volume of containerboard sold to third parties, and slightly lower corrugated
products volume.

Total corrugated products volume decreased 1.1% to
26.5 billion square feet in 2001 compared to 26.9 billion square feet
in 2000. On a comparable shipment-per-workday basis, corrugated products volume
decreased 1.5% in 2001 from 2000. The larger percentage decrease was due to the
fact that 2001 had one more workday, those days not falling on a weekend or
holiday, than 2000. Containerboard volume to external domestic and export
customers decreased 16.0% to 428,000 tons for the year ended December 31,
2001 from 509,000 tons in the comparable period of 2000. Our total
containerboard mill production in 2001 was 2,125,000 tons compared to 2,165,000
tons in 2000.

According to Pulp & Paper Week, average
industry mid-point linerboard and semi-chemical medium prices for 42 lb.
Liner-East and 26 lb. Medium-East, which are representative benchmark grades,
were $444 and $404, respectively, per ton in 2001. This compares to $468 and
$446, respectively, per ton in 2000.

Income Before Interest Expense and Income Taxes
(Operating Income)

Operating income decreased by $95.0 million, or
27.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to 2000. The decrease
was the result of decreased sales prices which reduced operating income by
$63.4 million in addition to lower volume of containerboard sold to third
parties, and slightly lower corrugated products volume. Operating income for
2000 excludes a fourth quarter gain on timberland sales of $60.4 million.


Gross profit decreased $85.5 million, or 17.0%,
for the year ended December 31, 2001 from the year ended December 31,
2000. Gross profit as a percentage of sales declined from 26.2% of sales in
2000 to 23.3% of sales in 2001 primarily due to the sales price decreases
described above.

Corporate overhead for the year ended December 31,
2001, increased by $0.1 million, or 0.2%, from the year ended December 31,
2000.

Selling and administrative expenses increased $5.5 million,
or 4.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2001 from the comparable period
in 2000. The increase was primarily the result of increased salary and other
general selling related expenses.

Interest Expense and Income Taxes

Interest expense decreased by $43.7 million, or
37.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2001 from the comparable period in
2000, primarily due to prepayments PCA made on its term loans under the senior
credit facility.

PCA’s effective tax rate was 38.7% for the year ended December 31,
2001 and 39.8% for the year ended December 31, 2000. The tax rate is
higher than the federal statutory rate of 35.0% due to state income taxes.

Liquidity and Capital
Resources

Operating Activities

Cash flow provided by operating activities decreased
$74.3 million, or 23.6%, to $240.0 million, for the year ended December 31,
2002 compared to the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease was
primarily due to lower net income as a result of decreased sales prices of
containerboard and corrugated products, as well as decreased deferred income
taxes and unfavorable changes in working capital. The unfavorable changes in
working capital were primarily driven by higher balances of accounts receivable
related to the strong sales volumes previously described, partially offset by
lower inventory levels and a smaller reduction of the accounts payable balance
than in 2001.

Cash flow provided by operating activities decreased
$26.7 million, or 7.8%, to $314.3 million, for the year ended December 31,
2001 from the comparable period in 2000. The decrease was primarily due to
lower net income and decreased deferred taxes partially offset by a favorable
change in working capital, caused by lower balances of accounts receivable due
to lower sales prices and volumes described previously.

Investing Activities

Cash used for investing activities decreased by
$25.3 million, or 18.7%, to $109.6 million, for the year ended December 31,
2002 compared to the year ended December 31, 2001. The change was primarily
the result of decreased additions to property, plant and equipment and one
business acquisition in the second quarter of 2001.

Cash used for investing activities increased by
$251.8 million, or 215.3%, to $134.9 million, for the year ended December 31,
2001 compared to the year ended December 31, 2000. The change was
primarily attributable to a reduction in proceeds from timberland sales of
$247.9 million.

As of December 31,
2002, PCA had commitments for capital expenditures of $31.3 million. PCA
believes operating cash flow from continuing operations will be sufficient to
fund these commitments.


Financing Activities

Cash used for financing
activities decreased by $23.3 million, or 22.2%, to $81.6 million, for the
year ended December 31, 2002 compared to the year ended December 31,
2001, primarily attributable to decreased prepayments made by PCA on its
various debt agreements and a decrease in expenditures to repurchase PCA common
stock.

Cash used for financing
activities decreased by $355.5 million, or 77.2%, for the year ended December 31,
2001 compared to the year ended December 31, 2000, primarily reflecting
decreased prepayments made by PCA on its various debt agreements.

On January 28, 2000,
PCA became a publicly traded company with an initial public offering of its
common stock. On March 3, 2000, PCA used the net proceeds from the
offering to redeem all of its outstanding shares of 12


/


%
senior exchangeable preferred stock due 2010.

On November 16, 2000,
PCA completed the sale of approximately 385,000 acres of timberland to Southern
Timber Venture, LLC. PCA received $247.9 million in cash and a 33


/


%
equity ownership interest in Southern Timber Venture, LLC. PCA recorded a
pre-tax gain of $60.4 million, and a portion of the gain was not
recognized as a result of PCA’s continuing ownership interest. In
March 2002 PCA received a $2.3 million dividend ($1.4 million,
after-tax) from Southern Timber Venture, LLC.

On November 29,
2000, PCA established an on-balance sheet securitization program for its trade
accounts receivable. To effectuate this program, PCA formed a wholly-owned
limited purpose subsidiary, Packaging Credit Company, LLC, or PCC, which in
turn formed a wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote, special-purpose
subsidiary, Packaging Receivables Company, LLC, or PRC, for the purpose of
acquiring receivables from PCC. Both of these entities are included in the
consolidated financial statements of PCA. Under this program, PCC purchases on
an ongoing basis substantially all of the receivables of PCA and sells such
receivables to PRC. PRC and lenders established a $150.0 million
receivables-backed revolving credit facility through which PRC obtains
funds to purchase receivables from PCC. The receivables purchased by PRC are
and will be solely the property of PRC. In the event of a liquidation of PRC,
the creditors of PRC would be entitled to satisfy their claims from PRC’s
assets prior to any distribution to PCC or PCA. Credit available under the
receivables credit facility is on a borrowing-base formula. As a result, the
full amount of the facility may not be available at all times. As of December 31,
2002, $113.0 million was outstanding and $37.0 million was available
for additional borrowing under the receivables credit facility. The highest
outstanding principal balance under the receivables credit facility during
fiscal 2002 was $126.0 million.

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes PCA’s contractual
obligations at December 31, 2002:


The lease commitments, purchase commitments and
letters of credit are not reflected on PCA’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31,
2002. See Notes 6 and 10 to the audited consolidated financial statements for
additional information.

PCA’s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from
operations and borrowings under PCA’s senior revolving credit facility and
receivables credit facility. As of December 31, 2002, PCA had $187.0
million in unused borrowing capacity under its existing credit agreements. PCA’s
primary uses of cash are for debt service and capital expenditures. PCA expects
to be able to fund its debt service and capital expenditures from these
sources.

The following table
provides the outstanding balance and the weighted average interest rate as of December 31,
2002 for each of PCA’s outstanding term loans, the revolving credit facility
and the receivables credit facility:

(a)  The term loan interest rates reflect
the floor of the interest rate collar agreement that expires in June of
2003 plus the applicable spread. The floor of this agreement was 4.95% at December 31,
2002.

In addition to the term loans and other borrowing
arrangements noted above, PCA has $550.0 million of 9 5/8% senior subordinated
notes callable beginning April 1, 2004 at 104.8125% and due 2009.

The borrowings under the senior revolving credit
facility are available to fund PCA’s working capital requirements, capital
expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The Term Loan A must be repaid
in quarterly installments from September 2004 through 2006. The Term Loan
B must be repaid in quarterly installments from March 2005 through 2007.
The senior revolving credit facility will terminate in 2006. The receivables
credit facility will terminate on November 29, 2003.

Since April 12, 1999, PCA has made prepayments
totaling approximately $1,027.0 million using cash flow from operations of
$516.0 million and proceeds from the sales of timberland of
$511.0 million to permanently reduce its borrowings under the term loans
and variable rate debt.

The instruments
governing PCA’s indebtedness contain financial and other covenants that
restrict, among other things, the ability of PCA and its subsidiaries to:

·

incur additional
indebtedness,

·

pay dividends or make
certain other restricted payments,

·

consummate certain asset
sales,

·

incur liens,

·

enter into certain
transactions with affiliates, or

·

merge or consolidate with
any other person or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of
the assets of PCA.


These limitations could limit corporate and operating
activities.

In addition, we must maintain minimum debt service,
minimum net worth and maximum leverage ratios under the senior credit facility.
A failure to comply with the restrictions contained in the senior credit
facility could lead to an event of default, which could result in an
acceleration of such indebtedness. Such an acceleration would also constitute
an event of default under the notes indenture and the receivables credit
facility.

PCA estimates that it will make approximately
$115.0 million in capital expenditures in 2003. These expenditures will be
used primarily for maintenance capital, cost reduction, business growth, and
environmental compliance.

PCA believes that cash generated from operations will
be adequate to meet its anticipated debt service requirements, capital
expenditures and working capital needs for the next 12 months, and that
cash generated from operations and amounts available under the senior revolving
credit facility will be adequate to meet its anticipated debt service
requirements, capital expenditures and working capital needs for the
foreseeable future. PCA’s future operating performance and its ability to
service or refinance the notes and to service, extend or refinance the credit
facilities will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial,
business and other factors, many of which are beyond PCA’s control.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to, and must comply with, a variety of
federal, state and local environmental laws, particularly those relating to air
and water quality, waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and
groundwater. Because environmental regulations are constantly evolving, we have
incurred, and will continue to incur, costs to maintain compliance with those
laws. In particular, the EPA finalized the Cluster Rules which govern pulp
and paper mill operations, including those at the Counce, Filer City, Valdosta
and Tomahawk mills. Over the next several years, the Cluster Rules will
affect our allowable discharges of air and water pollutants, and require us to
spend money to ensure compliance with those new rules.

As is the case with any industrial operation, we have,
in the past, incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or
groundwater contamination, as required by the federal Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as the
federal “Superfund” law, and analogous state laws. Cleanup requirements arise
with respect to properties we currently own or operate, former facilities and
off-site facilities where we have disposed of hazardous substances. Under the
terms of the contribution agreement, Pactiv has agreed to retain all liability
for all former facilities and all sites associated with pre-closing off-site
waste disposal. Pactiv has also retained environmentally impaired real property
in Filer City, Michigan unrelated to current mill operations.

Because liability for remediation costs under
environmental laws is strict, meaning that liability is imposed without fault,
joint and several, meaning that liability is imposed on each party without
regard to contribution, and retroactive, we could receive notifications of
cleanup liability in the future and this liability could be material. From January 1994
through December 2002, remediation costs at our mills and converting
plants totaled about $2.9 million. As of December 31, 2002, we
maintained an environmental reserve of $3.7 million, which includes funds
relating to onsite landfills and surface impoundments as well as on-going and
anticipated remedial projects. Total capital costs for environmental matters,
including Cluster Rule compliance, were $4.3 million for 2002 and we
currently estimate 2003 environmental capital expenditures will be $14.7 million, of which $4.4 million of the expenditures
are to meet Cluster Rule requirements.


Impact of Inflation

PCA does not believe that inflation has had a material
impact on its financial position or results of operations during the past three
years.

Critical Accounting
Policies

Management’s discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these
financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we
evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories,
intangible assets, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, income taxes,
and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We believe the following critical accounting policies
affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of
our consolidated financial statements. For a further discussion on the
application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 to our
audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.

Accounts Receivable—Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We evaluate the collectibility of our accounts
receivable based upon a combination of factors. In circumstances where we are
aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to
us (e.g., bankruptcy filings, substantial downgrading of credit sources), we
record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net
recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. For
all other customers, we recognize reserves for bad debts consisting of 0.3% for
amounts less than 90 days past due and 30% for amounts more than 90 days
past due based on our historical collection experience. If our collection
experience deteriorates (i.e., higher than expected defaults or an unexpected
material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial
obligations to us), our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could
be reduced by a material amount.

As of December 31, 2002, the balance in the
allowance for doubtful accounts reserve was $5.8 million, compared to
$5.2 million at December 31, 2001. Bad debt expense in 2002 was $3.0
million, compared to $0.7 million in 2001. Of the $2.3 million increase,

$1.7 million was
attributable to three customers that filed for bankruptcy during 2002

.

For the year ended December 31, 2001 bad debt expense
was $0.7 million compared to $5.8 million in 2000. During 2000, $2.8 million of bad debt
expense was attributable to six customers that filed for bankruptcy during the
year.

Inventory

We record our inventory at the lower of cost or
market. The estimated market value is based on assumptions for future demand
and related pricing. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those
projected by management, reductions in the value of inventory may be required. Raw
materials, work in process and finished goods are valued using the lower of
last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) cost or market method. Supplies and materials
inventories are valued using a moving average cost.


Derivatives

We hold derivative financial instruments to hedge our
interest rate risk associated with our variable rate long-term debt. These
derivatives qualify for hedge accounting as discussed in Note 2 to our
audited consolidated financial statements. We do not speculate in derivatives
trading. Hedge accounting results when we designate and document the hedging
relationships involving these derivative instruments. While we intend to
continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting, if hedges do not qualify
as highly effective or if we did not believe that forecasted transactions would
occur, the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be
reflected in earnings.

To hedge interest rate risk, interest rate collars are
used to protect against rising interest rates and simultaneously guarantee
minimum interest rates related to our variable rate debt. These instruments are
valued using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future
cash receipts and cash payments. The cash receipts and cash payments are based
on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observed market
interest rate curves. We have not changed our methods of calculating these fair
values or developing the underlying assumptions. The values of these derivatives
will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as market
conditions change. Information about the fair values, notional amounts, and
contractual terms of these instruments can be found in Notes 6 and 7 to our
audited consolidated financial statements and the section titled “Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.” included elsewhere in this
report.

In addition to the above derivative financial
instruments, we have other contracts covering a portion of our purchases of
natural gas and electricity that have the characteristics of derivatives but
are not required to be accounted for as derivatives. These contracts for the
physical delivery of these items qualify for the normal purchases exception
under SFAS No. 133 as we take physical delivery of the item and use it in
the production process. This exception is an election and, if not elected,
these contracts would be carried on the balance sheet at fair value with
changes in fair value reflected in income. These contracts cover natural gas
and electricity usage at our mills through 2004. At December 31, 2002,
estimated future payments under these contracts amounted to $19.7 million.

Environmental Liabilities

The estimated landfill closure and postclosure maintenance
costs expected to be incurred upon and subsequent to the closing of existing
operating landfill areas are accrued based on the landfill capacity used to
date. Amounts are estimates using current technologies for closure and
monitoring and are not discounted.

The potential costs for various environmental matters
are uncertain due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible cleanup
costs, the complexity and evolving nature of governmental laws and regulations
and their interpretations, and the timing, varying costs and effectiveness of
alternative cleanup technologies. Liabilities recorded for environmental
contingencies are estimates of the probable costs based upon available
information and assumptions. Because of these uncertainties, however, our
estimates may change. We believe that any additional costs identified as
further information becomes available would not have a material effect on our
financial statements.

In connection with the sale to PCA of the
containerboard and corrugated products business of Pactiv Corporation in April 1999,
Pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites
associated with offsite waste disposal prior to April 12, 1999. Pactiv
also retained environmental liability for a closed landfill located near the
Filer City mill.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue as title to the products is
transferred to customers.


Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived
assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be fully recoverable. In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of any long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation
of recoverability would be performed. If an evaluation were required, the
estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be
compared to the asset’s carrying amount to determine if a write-down to fair
value were required.

Goodwill is tested annually for impairment in
accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”

New Accounting Standards

For a description of changes in accounting principles
affecting PCA, see Note 2 to PCA’s audited consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this report.

Item 7A. QUANTITIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

PCA is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes
and changes in the market value of its financial instruments. PCA periodically
enters into derivatives in order to minimize these risks, but not for trading
purposes.

PCA has interest rate collar agreements that protect
against rising interest rates and simultaneously guarantee a minimum interest
rate. The notional amount of these collar agreements was $78.8 million and
$175.0 million as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The
weighted average floor of the interest rate collar agreements was 4.95% and
5.02% as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The weighted average
ceiling of the interest rate collar agreements was 6.75% and 6.85% as of December 31,
2002 and 2001. The interest rate on approximately 41% and 71% of PCA’s
variable-rate debt as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, was
capped. PCA receives payments under the collar agreements if the applicable
interest rate (LIBOR or commercial paper) exceeds the ceiling. Correspondingly,
PCA makes payments under the collar agreements if the applicable interest rate
drops below the floor. In both cases, the amounts received or paid are based
upon the notional amount and the difference between the actual interest rate
and the ceiling or floor rate. At December 31, 2002, the commercial paper
based interest rate collar agreement expired. The remaining interest rate
collar agreement, with a floor of 4.95%, expires June 30, 2003.

As a result of the collar agreements noted above and
the interest rate environment, a one percent increase in interest rates would
result in an increase in interest expense and a corresponding decrease in
income before taxes of approximately $1.1 million and $0.7 million
annually for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. As
of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the weighted average LIBOR was 1.40% and
1.91%, respectively, and the weighted average commercial paper rate was 1.40%
and 1.92%, respectively. The effect of an interest rate change to the fair
market value of the outstanding debt is insignificant. This analysis does not
consider any other impact on fair market value that could exist in such an
interest rate environment. In the event of a change in interest rates,
management could take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change.
However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and
their possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in PCA’s
financial structure.

INDEX TO FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Board of Directors and Shareholders of Packaging
Corporation of America:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Packaging Corporation of America (the “Company”) as of December 31,
2002 and 2001, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in
shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2002. Our audits also included the financial statement
schedule listed in the index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and
schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing
standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of Packaging Corporation of America at December 31, 2002 and
2001, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Also, in
our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly,
in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the audited
consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities,” as amended, on January 1, 2001.

1.  BASIS
OF PRESENTATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS

Packaging Corporation of America (“PCA” or the “Company”)
was incorporated on January 25, 1999 pursuant to the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware. PCA was formed to acquire the containerboard and
corrugated packaging products business (the “Group”) of Pactiv Corporation,
formerly known as Tenneco Packaging Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of
Tenneco Inc. PCA had no operations from the date of incorporation on January 25,
1999 to April 11, 1999.

On April 12, 1999, Pactiv Corporation (“Pactiv”)
sold the Group to PCA for $2.2 billion. The Group is the predecessor to
PCA. The $2.2 billion purchase price paid to Pactiv for the Group
consisted of $246.5 million in cash, the assumption of $1.8 billion
of debt incurred by Pactiv immediately prior to closing, and the issuance of a
45% common equity interest in PCA. PCA Holdings LLC, an entity organized and
controlled by Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC, acquired the remaining 55% common
equity interest in PCA for $236.5 million in cash. These events are
collectively referred to as the “Transactions.” Because significant veto rights
were retained by Pactiv, the carryover basis of accounting was used and no
goodwill was recognized. Fees of $23.8 million were incurred as part of
the Transactions and were recorded as a charge to shareholders’ equity.

On August 25, 1999, PCA Holdings LLC and Pactiv
agreed that the acquisition consideration should be reduced as a result of a
post-closing price adjustment by $20.0 million. On September 23,
1999, Pactiv paid PCA $20.7 million, representing the $20.0 million
adjustment and $0.7 million of interest through the date of payment by
Pactiv.

The Company is comprised of mills and corrugated
products operations. The mill operations (the “Mills”) consist of two kraft
linerboard mills located in Counce, Tennessee, and Valdosta, Georgia, and two
medium mills located in Filer City, Michigan, and Tomahawk, Wisconsin. The
Mills also include two recycling centers located in Nashville and Jackson,
Tennessee. The Company leases the cutting rights to approximately 140,000 acres
of timberland as of December 31, 2002. The Mills transfer the majority of
their output to PCA’s corrugated products operations (“Corrugated”).

PCA’s corrugated manufacturing operations consist of 64
corrugated products plants, a technical and development center, five graphic
design centers, a rotogravure printing operation and a complement of packaging
supplies and distribution centers. All plants are located in North America.
Corrugated products manufacturing plants combine linerboard and medium
(primarily from PCA’s mills) into sheets that are converted into corrugated
shipping containers, point-of-sale graphics packaging, point-of-purchase
displays and other specialized packaging. Our corrugated products manufacturing
plants sell to diverse customers primarily in North America.

As  of
December 31, 2002, we had approximately 7,900 employees. Approximately
2,200 of these employees were salaried and approximately 5,700 were hourly.
Approximately 75% of our hourly employees are represented by unions. Our
unionized employees are represented primarily by the Paper, Allied Industrial,
Chemical, Energy Workers International Union, the International Association of Machinists,
the Graphic Communications International Union and the United Steel Workers of
America (USWA).

The contract for our unionized mill employees at our
Valdosta, Georgia kraft linerboard mill expires in September 2003. Contracts
for unionized mill employees at our three remaining containerboard mills expire
between October 2005 and June 2007. Contracts for unionized
converting plant employees expire

2.  SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements of
Packaging Corporation of America include all majority-owned subsidiaries.
All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The Company has
one joint venture that is carried under the equity method.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts in the financial statements
and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include all cash balances
and highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less. Cash
equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates market.

Accounts Receivable

The collectibility of PCA’s accounts receivable is
based upon a combination of factors. In circumstances where a specific customer
is unable to meet its financial obligations to us (e.g., bankruptcy filings,
substantial downgrading of credit sources), a specific reserve for bad debts is
recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the
amount we reasonably believe will be collected. For all other customers,
reserves for bad debts are recognized consisting of 0.3% for amounts less than
90 days past due and 30% for amounts more than 90 days past due based
on historical collection experience. If collection experience deteriorates
(i.e., higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change
in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us), the
estimate of the recoverability of amounts due could be reduced by a material
amount.

Inventories

Raw materials, work in process and finished goods are
valued using the lower of last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) cost or market method.
Supplies and materials inventories are valued using a moving average cost. All
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventories valued using
the LIFO method comprised 71% and 73% of inventories at current cost at December 31,
2002 and 2001, respectively.

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES (Continued)

The components of
inventories are as follows:

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment and timber and
timberlands are recorded at cost.

Property, plant and equipment by major classification
are as follows:

The amount of interest capitalized related to
construction in progress was approximately $0.4 million, $0.9 million
and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively.

Depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis
over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. The following lives are
used for the various categories of assets:

F-


Packaging Corporation of America

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

December 31, 2002

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES (Continued)

Timber depletion is provided on the basis of timber
cut during the period related to the estimated quantity of recoverable timber.
Assets under capital leases are depreciated on the straight-line method over
the term of the lease.

Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed
as incurred.

Intangible Assets

The Company has capitalized certain intangible assets,
primarily customer lists, covenants not to compete, and goodwill, based on
their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. Amortization is provided
for customer lists on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from 10 to 15
years. Covenants not to compete are amortized on a straight-line basis over the
terms of the respective agreements. Goodwill, which amounted to $1.8 million
and $1.3 million as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, is not
being amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142, “Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets” beginning January 1, 2002. Goodwill
amortization was not material during the years ended December 31, 2000 and
2001.

Other Long-Term Assets

PCA has capitalized certain costs related to obtaining
its financing. These costs are amortized to interest expense using the
effective interest rate method over the terms of the senior credit facility and
senior subordinated notes, which range from four years to seven years.
Unamortized deferred financing costs were $19.2 million and
$23.2 million as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

PCA currently leases the cutting rights to approximately
140,000 acres of timberland and capitalizes the annual lease payments and
reforestation costs associated with these leases. These costs are recorded as
depletion when timber is harvested and used in PCA’s business operations. Capitalized
long-term lease costs were $21.0 million and $23.1 million as of December 31,
2002 and 2001, respectively.

PCA also capitalizes certain costs related to the
purchase and development of software which is used in its business operations.
The costs attributable to these software systems are amortized over their
estimated useful lives based on various factors such as the effects of
obsolescence, technology and other economic factors. Capitalized software costs
were $11.8 million and $12.4 million as of December 31, 2002 and
2001, respectively.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for
impairment in accordance with provisions of SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for
the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” In the event that facts and
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any long-lived assets may be
impaired, an evaluation of recoverability would be performed. If an evaluation
is required, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the
asset would be compared to the asset’s carrying amount to determine if a
write-down to fair value is required.

Goodwill is tested annually for impairment in
accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES (Continued)

Financial Instruments

The Company uses interest rate collar agreements to
manage interest costs and the risk associated with changing interest rates.

Income Taxes

PCA utilizes the liability method of accounting for
income taxes whereby it recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the
future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of
assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
Deferred tax assets will be reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon
management’s estimates, it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred
tax assets will not be realized in a future period. The estimates utilized in
the recognition of deferred tax assets are subject to revision in future
periods based on new facts or circumstances.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue as title to the
products is transferred to customers. Shipping and handling costs are included
in cost of sales. Shipping and handling billings to a customer in a sales
transaction are included in revenue.

Research and Development

Research and development costs are expensed as
incurred. The amount charged to expense was $6.7 million,
$5.5 million, and $3.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2002,
2001 and 2000, respectively.

Freight Trades

PCA regularly trades containerboard with other
manufacturers primarily to reduce shipping costs. The freight trade
transactions are accounted for primarily as transactions in the inventory
accounts; the impact on income is not material.

Segment Information

PCA is primarily engaged in one line of business: the
manufacture and sale of packaging materials, boxes and containers for
industrial and consumer markets. No single customer accounts for more than 10%
of total revenues. PCA’s manufacturing operations are located within the United
States.

Comprehensive Income (Loss)

For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001,
total comprehensive income was $2.2 million more than net income due to
derivative gains and foreign currency translation adjustments, and
$3.0 million less than net income due to derivative losses, respectively.
There was no difference for the year ended December 31, 2000.

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES (Continued)

Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities and Accounting Change

Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 133, “Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended by SFAS No. 137
and SFAS No. 138. The Statement requires the Company to recognize
derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet at
fair value. It further provides criteria for derivative instruments to be
designated as fair value, cash flow or foreign currency hedges and establishes
respective accounting standards for reporting changes in the fair value of the
derivative instruments. The gains or losses resulting from adjusting the
derivative instruments to fair value are recorded in net income or accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI), as appropriate.

The Company recorded a transition adjustment upon
adoption of SFAS No. 133 to recognize its derivative instruments at fair
value and to recognize the effective and ineffective portions of the cash flow
hedges. The effect of this transition adjustment was to decrease reported net
income in the first quarter of 2001 by approximately $0.5 million
($0.8 million pre-tax). The Company also recorded a minimal transition
adjustment in OCI and an increase in noncurrent liabilities of approximately
$0.8 million.

The Company uses derivative instruments to manage interest
costs and the risk associated with changing interest rates. The Company’s
objectives for holding derivatives are to minimize the risks using the most
effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impacts of these exposures. The
Company has one interest rate collar agreement that protects against rising
interest rates and simultaneously guarantees a minimum interest rate. As
interest rates change, the differential paid or received is recognized in
interest expense of the period. Interest rate collar agreements are accounted
for as cash flow hedges.

Derivative losses included in OCI as of December 31,
2002, will be reclassified into earnings over the lives of the collar
agreements, through June 30, 2003.

New Accounting Pronouncements

Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted
SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets,” which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment
or disposal of long-lived assets and supersedes SFAS No. 121, “Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be
Disposed of,” and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30,
“Reporting the Results of Operations” for a disposal of a segment of a
business. The adoption of SFAS No. 144 on January 1, 2002, did not
have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or
results of operations.

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,”
which is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. The
Statement requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of
long-lived assets to be recognized at their fair value at the time that the
obligations are incurred. Upon initial recognition of a liability, that cost
should be capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and allocated to
expense over the useful life of the asset. The Company will adopt the new rules on
asset retirement obligations on January 1, 2003. The adoption of the
Statement is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial
statements.

2.  SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, “Accounting
for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities,” effective for exit or
disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. This Statement
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or
disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 94-3,
“Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other
Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring).”  The adoption of SFAS No. 146
on January 1, 2003, is not expected to have a material impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 45, “Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others.”  This Interpretation elaborates
on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual
financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has
issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the
inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation
undertaken in issuing the guarantee. This Interpretation does not prescribe a
specific approach for subsequently measuring the guarantor’s recognized
liability over the term of the related guarantee. This Interpretation also
incorporates, without change, the guidance in FIN No. 34, “Disclosure of
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others,” which is being superseded. The
initial recognition and initial measurement provisions are applicable on a
prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002.
The disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim
or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. See Note 6, Debt,
for disclosures regarding letters of credit.

In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN No. 46,
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” which addresses the financial
reporting by companies involved with variable interest entities. A variable
interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal
structure used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity
investors with voting rights or (b) has equity investors that do not
provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities.
FIN No. 46 requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a
company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the
variable interest entity’s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the
entity’s residual returns or both. Previously, a company generally included an
entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the
entity through voting interests. The consolidation requirements of FIN No. 46
apply immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31,
2003. Existing variable interest entities must be consolidated in the first
fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The Company
is a 33


/


% owner of Southern Timber Venture, LLC. The
Company is currently evaluating FIN No. 46 to determine if Southern Timber
Venture, LLC is a variable interest entity and if so which, if any, entity is
the primary beneficiary for consolidation purposes.

Also in January 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure,” which
amends SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.”  SFAS No. 148 provides alternative
methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of
accounting for stock-based compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends
the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require more prominent and
more frequent disclosures in financial statements about the effects of
stock-based compensation. SFAS No. 148 is effective for fiscal years
ending after December 15, 2002. See Note 2, Stock-Based Compensation,
for disclosure information.

2.  SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Stock-Based Compensation

PCA entered into management equity agreements in June 1999
with 125 of its management-level employees. These agreements provide for
the grant of options to purchase up to an aggregate of 6,576,460 shares of PCA’s
common stock at $4.55 per share, the same price per share at which PCA Holdings
LLC purchased common stock in the Transactions. The agreement called for these
options to vest ratably over a five-year period, or upon completion of an
initial public offering, full vesting with contractual restrictions on transfer
for a period of up to 18 months following completion of the offering. The
options vested with the initial public offering in January 2000, and the
restriction period ended August, 2001.

In October 1999, the Company adopted a long-term
equity incentive plan, which provides for grants of stock options, stock
appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock and performance awards to
directors, officers and employees of PCA, as well as others who engage in
services for PCA. Option awards granted to officers and employees vest ratably
over a four-year period, whereas option awards granted to directors vest
immediately. Under the plan, which will terminate on June 1, 2009, up to
4,400,000 shares of common stock is available for issuance under the long-term
equity incentive plan.

A summary of the
Company’s stock option activity, and related information for the years ended December 31,
2002, 2001 and 2000 follows:

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES (Continued)

The following table summarizes information for options
outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2002:

As permitted by SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation” and amended by SFAS No. 148, “Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure,” the Company has
elected to account for its stock option plan under Accounting Principles Board
(“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and
adopt the disclosure only provisions of SFAS No. 123 and SFAS No. 148.
Under APB No. 25, no compensation costs are recognized because the number
of options is fixed and the option exercise price is equal to the fair market
price of the common stock on the date of the grant. Under SFAS No. 123,
stock options are valued at the grant date using the Black-Scholes
valuation model and compensation costs are recognized ratably over the vesting
period. Had stock options been accounted for using the fair value method as
recommended in SFAS No. 123, compensation expense would have had the
following pro forma effect on our net income and earnings per share for the
years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000.

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES (Continued)

Black-Scholes option-pricing model
assumptions and fair value for these options are shown in the following table:

The Black-Scholes option valuation model was
developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no
vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation
models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the
expected stock price volatility. Because the Company’s employee stock options
have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and
because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the
fair value estimate, in management’s opinion, the existing models do not
necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee
stock options.

Reclassifications

5.  EMPLOYEE
BENEFIT PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

In connection with the Transactions, PCA and Pactiv
entered into a human resources agreement which, among other items, granted PCA
employees continued participation in the Pactiv pension plan for a period of up
to five years following the closing of the Transactions for an agreed upon fee.
For salaried employees, PCA will pay Pactiv $4.0 million in the first and
second years, $6.0 million in the third year, $8.0 million in the
fourth year, and $10.0 million in the fifth year following the closing
date of the Transactions. For hourly employees, PCA will pay Pactiv
$1.2 million per year through December 31, 2000 and then
$4.5 million per year for two additional years. These amounts can be
adjusted if there are material increases in the pension costs to Pactiv. The
fees paid to Pactiv are expensed ratably throughout the year.

Effective January 1, 2003, PCA adopted a
mirror-image pension plan for eligible hourly employees to succeed the Pactiv
pension plan in which PCA had participated though December 31, 2002. The
new PCA pension plan for hourly employees recognizes service earned under both
the new PCA plan and the prior Pactiv plan. Benefits earned under the PCA plan
are reduced by retirement benefits earned under the Pactiv plan through
December 31, 2002. All assets and liabilities associated with benefits
earned through December 31, 2002 for hourly employees and retirees of PCA
were retained by the Pactiv plan. PCA intends to adopt its own retirement plan
sometime in the future with respect to its salaried employees currently
participating in the Pactiv pension plan.

The Company adopted a supplemental executive
retirement plan in 2000 that provides supplemental pension benefits for certain
executive officers of the Company. Benefits are based upon years of service and
the highest three year average of compensation. The benefit obligation and
pension costs were not significant.

PCA also provides certain medical benefits for retired
salaried employees and certain medical and life insurance benefits for certain
hourly employees. For salaried employees, the plan covers employees retiring
from PCA on or after attaining age 58 who have had at least 10 years of
full-time service with PCA after attaining age 48. For hourly employees, the
postretirement medical coverage, where applicable, is available according to
the eligibility provisions in effect at the employee’s work location. Per the
human resources agreement referred to above, Pactiv retained the liability
relating to retiree medical and life

benefits for PCA employees
who had retired on or before the closing date of the Transactions or who will

Financial data pertaining to the Company’s
postretirement benefit plans follow:

The accrued postretirement benefit cost has been

Company assumed a health care cost trend rate of 5.00%.

Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by one
percentage point would increase the 2002 postretirement benefit obligation by
approximately $1.6 million and would increase the net postretirement  benefit cost by approximately $0.4 million.

On February 1, 2000, the Company adopted two defined
contribution benefit plans that cover all full-time salaried employees and
certain hourly employees at several of the Company’s facilities. Employees can
make voluntary contributions in accordance with the provisions of their
respective plan. The Company expensed $6.9 million, $6.7 million and
$6.1 million for employer contributions during the years ended December 31,
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Additional
information regarding PCA’s variable rate debt before the effects of the
interest rate collars described below, is shown below:

Since April 12, 1999, PCA has made debt
prepayments totaling approximately $1,027.0 million using excess cash and
proceeds from the sale of certain timberlands to permanently reduce its
borrowings under the term loans. As a result of these prepayments, PCA recorded
a charge of $1.0 million ($0.6 million after tax) and
$18.4 million ($11.1 million after tax), respectively, as an early
extinguishment of debt for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. No
quarterly installments will be required under any of the term loans until September 30,
2004.

As of December 31, 2002, annual principal
payments for debt during the next five years are: $113.1 million (2003),
$9.7 million (2004), $36.1 million (2005), $9.6 million (2006),
$23.7 million (2007), and $550.0 million (2008 and thereafter).

Interest payments in connection with the Company’s
debt obligations for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000
amounted to $66.0 million, $73.6 million, and $112.6 million,
respectively.

On June 29, 2000, the Company completed the
refinancing of its senior credit facility. The new refinancing lowered the
Company’s margins over LIBOR on Term Loans A and B and eliminated Term Loan C,
resulting in an average margin reduction of about 100 basis points. The Company
incurred approximately $3.6 million in bank syndication and arrangement
fees, which were rolled into the current debt structure.

On November 29, 2000, the Company established an
on-balance sheet securitization program for its trade accounts receivable. To
effectuate this program, the Company formed a wholly owned limited purpose
subsidiary, Packaging Credit Company, LLC (“PCC”), which in turn formed a
wholly owned, bankruptcy-remote, special-purpose subsidiary,
Packaging Receivables Company, LLC (“PRC”), for the purpose of acquiring
receivables from PCC. Both of these entities are included in the consolidated
financial statements of the Company. Under this program, PCC purchases on an
ongoing basis substantially all of the receivables of the Company and sells
such receivables to PRC. PRC and lenders established a $150.0 million
receivables-backed revolving credit facility (“Receivables Credit
Facility”) through which PRC obtains funds to purchase receivables from PCC.
The receivables purchased by PRC are and will be solely the property of PRC. In
the event of liquidation of PRC, the creditors of PRC would

F-

6.   DEBT
(Continued)

be entitled to satisfy their claims from PRC’s assets
prior to any distribution to PCC or the Company. Credit available under the
receivables credit facility is on a borrowing-base formula. As a result, the
full amount of the facility may not be available at all times. At December 31,
2002, $113.0 million was outstanding and $37.0 million was available
for additional borrowing under the receivables credit facility. The highest
outstanding principal balance under the receivables credit facility during
fiscal 2002 was $126.0 million.

The senior revolving credit facility is (1) jointly
and severally guaranteed by each of PCA’s existing domestic subsidiaries
(excluding Packaging Receivables Company, LLC) and (2) secured by a first
priority lien covering substantially all of the owned timberland, mills, plants
and other facilities and substantially all tangible and intangible personal
property of PCA and its domestic subsidiaries and by a pledge of all of the
capital stock of PCA’s domestic subsidiaries. In addition, the senior credit facility
will also be secured by a pledge of 65% of the capital stock of any first tier
foreign subsidiaries that PCA may acquire or form in the future. PCA’s future
domestic subsidiaries will guarantee the senior credit facility and secure that
guarantee with certain of their real property and substantially all of their
tangible and intangible personal property.

PCA’s various debt agreements contain covenants that
restrict the ability of PCA and its subsidiaries to incur additional
indebtedness, pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments,
consummate certain asset sales, incur liens, enter into certain transactions
with affiliates, or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or
dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company. They also
require PCA to comply with certain financial covenants, including the ratio of
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to
cash interest expense, the ratio of debt to EBITDA, and minimum net worth
levels. A failure to comply with the restrictions contained in the senior
credit facility could lead to an event of default, which could result in an
acceleration of such indebtedness. Such an acceleration would also constitute
an event of default under the notes indenture and the receivables credit
facility. At December 31, 2002, the Company was in compliance with all of
its covenants.

The Company maintains interest rate collar agreements
for its variable rate debt. The interest rate collar agreements protect against
rising interest rates while simultaneously guaranteeing minimum interest rates.
The notional amount of these collars is 
$78.8 million and $175.0 million at December 31, 2002 and
2001, respectively. Approximately 41.0% of PCA’s variable rate debt are capped
at December 31, 2002. The weighted average floor of the interest rate
collar agreements is 4.95% and the weighted average ceiling is 6.75%. On January 14,
2000, PCA terminated $110.0 million of interest rate collar agreements and
received $1.9 million. The senior credit facility provides PCA with the
right to lock-in LIBOR interest rates for any amount of term loans for one,
two, three, or six-month periods. With the approval of the lenders, PCA can
lock-in LIBOR interest rates for either a two-week or twelve-month
period. The receivables credit facility also provides PCA with the right to
lock-in commercial paper interest rates for a one, two, or three-month
period.

The remaining
letters of credit guarantee payment by PCA of various environmental
obligations, including landfills and solid waste programs, workers’
compensation, and equipment leases.

7.   FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS

The carrying and
estimated fair values of PCA’s financial instruments at December 31, 2002
and 2001 were as follows:

7.   FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS (Continued)

Short-Term Assets and Liabilities

The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, notes receivable and accounts payable approximate their carrying
amounts due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments.

Long-Term Debt

The fair value of the senior credit facility and the
receivables credit facility approximates their carrying amount due to the
variable interest-rate feature of the instruments. The fair value of the senior
subordinated notes is based on quoted market prices. The fair values of the
remaining debt were considered to be the same as or were not determined to be
materially different from the carrying amounts.

Interest Rate Collars

The fair values of the interest rate collars are the
amounts at which they could be settled and are estimated by obtaining quotes
from banks.

8.  MANDATORY
REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK

On April 12, 1999, PCA issued 1,000,000 shares of
12.375% senior exchangeable preferred stock, liquidation preference of $100 per
share. Holders of the preferred shares were entitled to receive cumulative
dividends paid in cash or in kind at a rate of 12.375% which were paid
semi-annually. If PCA failed to pay dividends, holders of the preferred stock
were entitled to elect two additional members to PCA’s Board of Directors.
Holders of the preferred stock had no voting rights. The preferred stock ranked
senior to the common stock. 3,000,000 shares were authorized, and 1,058,094
shares were issued and outstanding as of December 31, 1999. PCA incurred
$3.5 million of issuance costs, which were being amortized through 2010 at
which time the preferred stock was required to be redeemed.

PCA used substantially all of the net proceeds from
its initial public offering to redeem all outstanding shares of its 12.375%
senior exchangeable preferred stock due 2010 (1,058,094 shares as of March 3,
2000) at a redemption price of 112.375% of its liquidation preference, plus
accrued and unpaid dividends through March 3, 2000, the date of
redemption. The total paid to redeem the senior exchangeable preferred stock
was $124.4 million, which included $5.5 million of accrued and unpaid
dividends.

9.  SHAREHOLDERS’
EQUITY

In June 1999, PCA entered into management equity
agreements with 125 of its management-level employees. Under these
agreements, PCA Holdings LLC and Pactiv Corporation sold 3,132,800 shares of
common stock to 113 of these employees at $4.55 per share. The stock purchased
under the management equity agreements was subject to vesting. As of August 2001,
the stock was fully vested. The management equity agreements also provide for
the grant of options (see Note 2).

On January 28, 2000, PCA became a publicly traded
company through the initial public offering of its common stock in which Pactiv
Corporation sold 35,000,000 of its 41,160,240 shares of common stock in PCA,
and PCA issued an additional 11,250,000 shares. The net proceeds to PCA were
approximately $126.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and
offering expenses at an initial public offering

price of $12.00 per share.
PCA utilized these proceeds to redeem its senior exchangeable preferred stock
(see Note 8).

On May 16,
2001, the Company announced a $100.0 million common stock repurchase
program. PCA currently expects to continue to repurchase shares from time to
time. Through December 31, 2002, the Company repurchased 4,210,900 shares
of common stock for approximately $71.3 million. Of these shares, 18,800
were held in treasury at December 31, 2002 and were subsequently retired
in February 2003. The remaining shares were retired prior to December 31,
2002.

The Company’s share
repurchases were as follows:

approximately $31.3 million and $44.5 million as of December 31,
2002 and 2001, respectively, in connection with the expansion and replacement
of existing facilities and equipment.

under non-cancelable operating leases with lease terms in excess of one year
are as follows:

Commitments under
capital leases were not significant to the accompanying financial statements.
Total lease expense for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000
was $27.0 million, $26.7 million and $24.7 million,
respectively. These costs are included primarily in cost of goods sold.

Purchase Commitments

The Company has entered into various minimum purchase
agreements to buy energy over periods ranging from one to two years at fixed
prices. Total purchase commitments over the next two years are as follows:

purchase agreements.

Litigation

On May 14, 1999, PCA
was named as a defendant in a Consolidated Class Action Complaint which
alleged a civil violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. The suit,
captioned

Winoff Industries, Inc. v. Stone Container
Corporation

, MDL No. 1261 (E.D. Pa.), names the Company as a
defendant based solely on the allegation that PCA is successor to the interests
of Tenneco Packaging Inc. and Tenneco Inc., both of which were also named as
defendants in the suit, along with nine other linerboard manufacturers. The
complaint alleges that the defendants, during the period October 1, 1993
through November 30, 1995, conspired to limit the supply of linerboard,
and that the purpose and effect of the alleged conspiracy was artificially to
increase prices of corrugated containers. The plaintiffs have moved to certify
a class of all persons in the United States who purchased corrugated containers
directly from any defendant during the

F-

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

10.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
(Continued)

above period, and seek
treble damages and attorneys’ fees on behalf of the purported class. The Court
granted plaintiffs’ motion on September 4, 2001, but modified the proposed
class to exclude those purchasers who purchased corrugated containers pursuant
to contracts in which the price was “not tied to the price of linerboard”. The
Court’s class certification decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for
the Third Circuit on September 5, 2002. The case is currently set for
trial in April 2004. PCA believes that the plaintiffs’ allegations have no
merit and intends to defend against the suit vigorously. PCA does not believe
that the outcome of this litigation should have a material adverse effect on
its financial position, results of operations, or cash flow.

PCA is also party to various legal actions arising in
the ordinary course of business. These legal actions cover a broad variety of
claims spanning our entire business. PCA believes that the resolution of these
legal actions will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material
adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

Environmental Liabilities

The estimated landfill closure and postclosure
maintenance costs expected to be incurred upon and subsequent to the closing of
existing operating landfill areas are accrued based on the landfill capacity
used to date. Amounts are estimates using current technologies for closure and
monitoring and are not discounted.

The potential costs for various environmental matters
are uncertain due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible cleanup
costs, the complexity and evolving nature of governmental laws and regulations
and their interpretations, and the timing, varying costs and effectiveness of
alternative cleanup technologies. From January 1994 through December 2002,
remediation costs at our mills and converting plants totaled about
$2.9 million. As of December 31, 2002, we maintained an environmental
reserve of $3.7 million, which includes funds relating to onsite landfills
and surface impoundments as well as on-going and anticipated remedial projects.
Total capital costs for environmental matters, including Cluster Rule compliance,
were $4.3 million for 2002. Liabilities recorded by the Company for
environmental contingencies are estimates of the probable costs based upon
available information and assumptions. Because of these uncertainties, however,
PCA’s estimates may change. PCA believes that any additional costs identified
as further information becomes available would not have a material effect on
its financial statements.

In the April 12, 1999 transactions, Pactiv agreed to
retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with
pre-closing offsite waste disposal. Pactiv also retained environmental liability
for a closed landfill located near the Filer City mill.

Cash payments for income taxes were $1.2 million,
$23.4 million and $23.7 million for the years ended December 31,
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the
Company had available for income tax purposes approximately $8.7 million and
$12.5 million, respectively, in alternative minimum tax credits which may
be used to offset future taxable income.

12.  RELATED
PARTY TRANSACTIONS

PCA owns a 33


/


% interest in
Southern Timber Venture, LLC (“STV”). At December 31, 2002, PCA had not
guaranteed the debt of STV and has no future funding requirements. The
Company’s investment recorded on its balance sheet at December 31, 2002 is
zero.

PCA purchases pulpwood from STV in accordance with the
terms of a fiber supply agreement between the two companies which expires December 31,
2017. The price of pulpwood in this agreement is based upon the fair market
value of pulpwood and will be adjusted annually for any changes in market value
beginning January 2003. PCA purchased $19.8 million,
$19.7 million and $1.7 million of pulpwood for its Counce, Tennessee
and Valdosta, Georgia mills from STV during the years ended December 31,
2002, 2001 and from November 16, 2000, through December 31, 2000,
respectively.

As Pactiv Corporation sold its remaining interest in
PCA during the first half of 2001, it is no longer considered a related party.
PCA’s sales to Pactiv Corporation, which includes both containerboard and
corrugated products, are included in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements. The net sales to Pactiv Corporation for the years ended December 31,
2001 and 2000 were $92.9 million and $100.5 million, respectively. The
accounts receivable relating to these sales as of December 31, 2001 and
2000 were $9.3 million and $13.3 million, respectively.

PCA and Pactiv entered into a facility use agreement
which provides for PCA’s use of a portion of Pactiv’s headquarters located in
Lake Forest, Illinois and certain building and business services through January 2005.
PCA paid Pactiv $2.0 million, $1.8 million and $2.4 million for the
years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively

13.  RESTRUCTURING
AND OTHER CHARGES

As part of the April 12, 1999 Transactions, the
Company assumed accruals related to a previously recorded restructuring charge
set forth below. This charge was recorded prior to the Transactions following
approval by Tenneco’s Board of Directors of a comprehensive restructuring plan
for all of Tenneco’s operations, including those of the Company. In connection
with this restructuring plan, four corrugated facilities were closed and 109
positions were eliminated.

14.  SALE OF
TIMBERLANDS

On November 16, 2000, PCA completed the sale of
approximately 385,000 acres of timberland to Southern Timber Venture, LLC. The
Company received $247.9 million in cash and a 33

%
equity ownership interest in Southern Timber Venture, LLC. PCA recorded a
pre-tax gain of $60.4 million, and a portion of the gain was not
recognized as a result of PCA’s continuing ownership interest.

In March 2002, PCA received a $2.3 million
dividend ($1.4 million after-tax) from Southern Timber Venture, LLC.

15.  ACQUISITIONS

On May 25, 2001, PCA International, Inc. a
wholly owned subsidiary of PCA, was formed to acquire the assets of Sunbelt
Packaging Services, Inc. for approximately $4.8 million. The
transaction was completed on June 1, 2001. The purchase method of
accounting was used to account for the acquisition. Sales and total assets of
the acquisition were not material.
