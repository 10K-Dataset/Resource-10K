BUSINESS

General

Packaging Corporation of
America, or PCA, is the sixth largest producer of containerboard and corrugated
products in the United States, based on production capacity as reported by PCA
in it’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings and press releases.
With 2006 net sales of $2.2 billion, PCA produced approximately 2.4 million
tons of containerboard, of which about 80% of the tons produced was consumed in
PCA’s corrugated products manufacturing plants, 13% was sold to domestic
customers and 7% was sold to the export market. Our corrugated products
manufacturing plants sold about 31.3 billion square feet (BSF) of
corrugated products.

The 2.4 million tons of containerboard that we
produced in 2006 included 1.5 million tons of kraft linerboard produced at
our mills located in Counce, Tennessee and Valdosta, Georgia, and
0.9 million tons of semi-chemical corrugating medium produced at our mills
located in Tomahawk, Wisconsin and Filer City, Michigan. We currently lease the
cutting rights to approximately 106,000 acres of timberland located near our
Counce and Valdosta mills. We also have supply agreements on approximately 380,000
acres of timberland.

Our converting operations produce a wide variety of
corrugated packaging products, including conventional shipping containers used
to protect and transport manufactured goods, multi-color boxes and displays
with strong visual appeal that help to merchandise the packaged product in
retail locations. In addition, we are a large producer of meat boxes and
wax-coated boxes for the agricultural industry.

Corporate
Developments

On April 12,
1999, Pactiv Corporation, formerly known as Tenneco Packaging Inc., a
wholly owned subsidiary of Tenneco Inc., sold its containerboard and
corrugated products business to PCA, an entity formed by Madison Dearborn
Partners, LLC, a private equity investment firm.

On January 28,
2000, PCA became a publicly traded company with the initial public offering of
its common stock.

On
September 6, 2006, PCA Holdings LLC, an entity organized and controlled by
Madison Dearborn, the record and direct beneficial owner of 21,773,010 shares
of PCA common stock, distributed 5,000,000 shares of PCA common stock to
Madison Dearborn Capital Partners III, L.P. (MDCP III) and a fund
affiliated with MDCP III, which were then distributed pro-rata by the
funds to their respective general and limited partners on that day.  After this transaction, PCA Holdings LLC’s
direct and beneficial ownership in PCA was reduced by 5,000,000 shares to
16,773,010 shares.

On
December 7, 2006, PCA Holdings LLC distributed an additional 5,000,000 shares
of PCA common stock to the general and limited partners of the two funds
mentioned above. PCA Holdings LLC’s direct and beneficial ownership in PCA
was reduced to 11,773,010 shares after this transaction.

Corrugated products plants
tend to be located in close proximity to customers to minimize freight costs.
The U.S. corrugated products industry consists of approximately 635 companies
and 1,360 plants.

Containerboard, which
includes both linerboard and corrugating medium, is the principal raw material
used to manufacture corrugated products. Linerboard is used as the inner and
outer facings, or liners, of corrugated products. Corrugating medium is fluted
and laminated to linerboard in corrugator plants to produce corrugated sheets.
The sheets are subsequently printed, cut, folded and glued in corrugator plants
or sheet plants to produce corrugated products.

Containerboard may be
manufactured from both softwood and hardwood fibers, as well as from recycled
fibers from used corrugated and waste from converting operations. Kraft
linerboard is made predominantly from softwoods like pine. Semi-chemical
corrugating medium is made from hardwoods such as oak. The finished paper
product is wound into large rolls, which are slit to size as required by
converters and shipped to them.

PCA Operations and Products

Our two linerboard mills
can manufacture a broad range of linerboard grades ranging from 26 lb. to 96
lb. Our two semi-chemical corrugating medium mills can manufacture grades
ranging in weight from 21 lb. to 47 lb. All four of our mills have
completed an extensive independent review process to become ISO 9002 certified.
ISO 9002 is an international quality certification that verifies a facility
maintains and follows stringent procedures for manufacturing, sales and
customer service.

The following four
paragraphs describe our four containerboard mills’ annual practical maximum
capacity, 2006 actual production and production capabilities.

Counce.

Our
Counce, Tennessee mill is one of the largest linerboard mills in the United
States. Its production capacity is approximately 991,000 tons per year. In
2006, we produced 1,009,000 tons of kraft linerboard on two paper machines at
Counce. Our actual production at Counce in 2006 exceeded the mill’s capacity
due to a production mix consisting of a lower percentage of lightweight
linerboard. The mill produces a broad range of basis weights from 26 lb.
to 90 lb. The mill also produces a variety of performance and specialty
grades of linerboard.

Valdosta.

Our
Valdosta, Georgia mill is a kraft linerboard mill that has a production
capacity of approximately 472,000 tons per year. In 2006, our single paper
machine at Valdosta produced 478,000 tons of kraft linerboard. Valdosta’s
actual production slightly exceeded its capacity due to a lower percentage of
lightweight linerboard production.Valdosta produces linerboard ranging from 33
lb. to 90 lb.


Tomahawk.

Our
Tomahawk, Wisconsin mill is one of the largest corrugating medium mills in the
United States with production capacity of 580,000 tons per year on three paper
machines. In April, 2005, we completed the indefinite closure of our number
three paper machine at Tomahawk and currently operate the remaining two paper
machines which have a combined production capacity of 515,000 tons. In
2006, we produced 519,000 tons of semi-chemical corrugating medium on two paper
machines at Tomahawk. One of the two paper machines we operate (our number four
paper machine) is among the largest corrugating medium machines in the world.
The Tomahawk mill produces a broad range of basis weights from 23 lb. to 40 lb.
and a variety of performance and specialty grades of corrugating medium.

Filer City.

Our
Filer City, Michigan mill is a semi-chemical corrugating medium mill with a
production capacity of 405,000 tons on three paper machines. In 2006, we
produced 397,000 tons of corrugating medium at Filer City. Filer City produces
corrugating medium grades ranging in basis weight from 23 lb. to 40 lb.

We operate 68 corrugated
manufacturing operations, a technical and development center, five regional
graphic design centers, a rotogravure printing operation and a complement of
packaging supplies and distribution centers. Of the 68 manufacturing
facilities, 40 operate as combining operations, commonly called corrugated
plants, that manufacture corrugated sheets and finished corrugated containers.
The remaining 28 manufacturing facilities, commonly called sheet plants,
purchase combined sheets primarily produced at PCA’s combining operations and
manufacture finished corrugated containers. The five graphic design centers are
located in Fairfield, Ohio; Dallas, Texas; Cranbury, New Jersey; Salisbury,
North Carolina and South Gate, California.

We have corrugated
manufacturing operations in 26 states in the U.S., with no manufacturing
facilities outside of the continental U.S. Each corrugator plant, for the most
part, serves a market radius that typically averages 150 miles. Our sheet plants
are generally located in close proximity to our larger corrugator plants, which
enables us to offer additional services and converting capabilities such as
small volume and quick turnaround items.

We produce a wide variety
of products ranging from basic corrugated shipping containers to specialized
packaging such as wax-coated boxes for the agriculture industry. We also have
multi-color printing capabilities to make high-impact graphics boxes and
displays that offer customers more attractive packaging.

Timberland

We currently lease the
cutting rights to approximately 106,000 acres of timberland located near our
Counce and Valdosta mills. Virtually all of the acres under cutting rights
agreements are located within 100 miles of these two mills, which results in
lower wood transportation costs and provides a secure source of wood fiber.
These leased cutting rights agreements have terms with over 15 years
remaining, on average.

During 1999 and 2000, PCA
sold about 800,000 acres of timberland. As part of the timberland sale
agreements, we entered into supply arrangements covering about 600,000 acres of
the total acres sold. In 2005, the supply agreement related to our Valdosta
mill on approximately 200,000 acres was terminated through a mutual agreement
because lower cost pulpwood was available in closer proximity to the mill. We currently
hold a 31


¤


%
equity ownership interest in approximately 52,000 acres owned by Southern
Timber Venture, LLC (STV). This acreage is located primarily in southern
Georgia and northern Florida, near our Valdosta, Georgia mill, and includes
both timberlands and higher beneficial use (HBU) properties. We currently have
in place supply agreements covering about 380,000 of the 800,000 acres sold.
The majority of the acreage under supply agreement is located in close
proximity to our Counce mill.

In addition to the
timberland we manage ourselves, our Forest Management Assistance Program
provides professional forestry assistance to private timberland owners to
improve harvest yields and to optimize their harvest schedule. We have managed
the regeneration of approximately 125,000 acres by


supplying
pine seedlings. In exchange for our expertise, we are given the right of first
refusal over timber sales from those lands. These private lands include over
210,000 acres of timberland. We expect to harvest approximately 80,000 cords of
wood from these forests annually.

PCA also participates in
the Sustainable Forestry Initiative. This initiative is aimed at ensuring the
long-term health and conservation of America’s forestry resources. Activities
include limiting tree harvest sizes, replanting harvest acreage, participating
in flora and fauna research and protecting water streams.

Solid Wood
Facilities

On November 16, 2006
we sold our Fulton, Mississippi sawmill. In 2006, through the date of the sale
of the facility, the sawmill produced and sold 11 million board feet of
lumber with net sales of $5.7 million.

The remaining sawmill that
we owned and operated in 2006 is located in Ackerman, Mississippi. During 2006,
the Ackerman sawmill sold 99 million board feet of lumber used in the
building products and furniture industries. We also have an air-dry yard operation
in Burnsville, Mississippi that holds newly cut lumber while it dries.

Sales and Marketing

Our corrugated products
are sold through a direct sales and marketing organization. We have sales
representatives and a sales manager at each corrugated manufacturing operation
who serve local and regional accounts. We also have corporate account managers
who serve large national accounts at multiple customer locations. Additionally,
our graphic design centers maintain an on-site dedicated graphics sales force.
General marketing support is located at our corporate headquarters.

Our containerboard sales
group is responsible for the sale of linerboard and corrugating medium to our
corrugated plants, to other domestic customers and to the export market. This
group handles order processing for all shipments of containerboard from our
mills to our corrugator plants. These personnel also coordinate and execute all
containerboard trade agreements with other containerboard manufacturers. In
addition to direct sales and marketing personnel, we utilize support personnel
that are new product development engineers and product graphics and design
specialists. These individuals are located at both the corrugated plants as
well as the graphic design centers.

Distribution

Our corrugated products
are usually delivered by truck due to our large number of customers and their
demand for timely service. Shipping costs represent a relatively high
percentage of our total costs due to the high bulk of corrugated products. As a
result, our converting operations typically service customers within a 150
miles radius.

Containerboard produced in
our mills is shipped by rail or truck. Rail shipments represent about 60% to 65%
of the tons shipped and the remaining 35% to 40% is comprised of truck
shipments. Our individual mills do not own or maintain outside warehousing
facilities. We do use some third-party warehouses for short-term storage.

Customers

PCA’s corrugated products
group sells to over 9,100 customers in over 16,500 locations. About 70% of our
corrugated products customers are regional and local accounts, which are
broadly diversified across industries and geographic locations. The remaining
30% of our customer base consists primarily of national accounts, or those
customers with a national presence. These customers typically purchase
corrugated products from several of our box plants throughout the United
States.


Major Raw Materials Used

Fiber supply.

Fiber
is the single largest cost in the manufacture of containerboard. PCA consumes
both wood fiber and recycled fiber in its containerboard mills. We have no 100%
recycled mills, or those mills whose fiber consumption consists solely of
recycled fiber. To reduce our fiber costs, we have invested in processes and
equipment to ensure a high degree of fiber flexibility. Our mills have the
capability to shift a portion of their fiber consumption between softwood,
hardwood and recycled sources. All of our mills, other than our Valdosta mill,
can utilize some recycled fiber in their containerboard production. Our ability
to use various types of virgin and recycled fiber helps mitigate the impact of
changes in the prices of various fibers. Our corrugated manufacturing
operations generate recycled fiber as a by-product from the manufacturing
process, which is sold to our mills directly or through trade agreements.
During 2006, our containerboard mills consumed approximately 614,000 tons of
recycled fiber, and our corrugated converting operations generated
approximately 212,000 tons of recycled fiber. As a result, PCA was a net
recycled fiber buyer of 402,000 tons, or 17% of PCA’s total fiber requirements.

Energy supply.

Energy
at the mills is obtained through purchased electricity or through various
fuels, which are converted to steam or electricity on-site. Fuel sources
include coal, natural gas, oil, internally produced and purchased bark and
by-products of the containerboard manufacturing and pulping process. These
fuels are burned in boilers to produce steam. Steam turbine generators are used
to produce electricity. To reduce our mill energy cost, we have invested in
processes and equipment to ensure a high level of purchased fuel flexibility.
In recent history, natural gas and fuel oil have exhibited higher costs per
thermal unit and more price volatility than coal and bark. During 2006, 11.5
million MMBTU’s (million BTU’s), or approximately 73% of our mills’ purchased
fuel needs, were from purchased bark and coal, historically our two lowest cost
purchased fuels. For the same period, our mills consumed about 2.0 million
MMBTU’s of natural gas (13% of the mills’ total purchased fuels) and 1.9
million MMBTU’s of oil (12% of the mills’ total purchased fuels). Our two kraft
linerboard mills at Counce and Valdosta generate approximately two-thirds of
their fuel requirements from their own by-products.

PCA’s corrugated plants
each have a boiler that produces steam which is used by the corrugator. The
majority of these boilers burn natural gas, although some also have the ability
to burn fuel oil. During 2006, PCA’s corrugated products plants consumed
approximately 2.1 million MMBTU’s of natural gas.

The
following table shows PCA’s purchased fuel consumption by fuel type for 2006:

Approximately 42% of the
electricity consumed by our four mills is generated on-site. Our mills purchase
approximately 9,230,000 CkWh annually, or the equivalent of 3.2 million
MMBTU’s. PCA’s corrugated products plants purchase about 2,400,000 CkWh annually,
or the equivalent of 0.8 million MMBTU’s.

Competition

According to industry
sources, corrugated products are produced by about 635 U.S. companies operating
approximately 1,360 plants. Most corrugated products are custom manufactured to
the customer’s specifications. Corrugated producers generally sell within a 150-mile
radius of their plants and compete with other corrugated producers in their
local market. In fact, the Fibre Box Association tracks industry data by 47
distinct market regions.

The larger, multi-plant
integrated companies may also solicit larger, multi-plant customers who
purchase for all of their facilities on a consolidated basis. These customers
are often referred to as national or corporate accounts.

Corrugated products
businesses seek to differentiate themselves through pricing, quality, service,
design and product innovation. We compete for both local and national account
business and we compete against producers of other types of packaging products.
On a national level, our competitors include International Paper Company, Koch
Industries, Inc., Smurfit-Stone Container Corporation,
Temple-Inland Inc. and Weyerhaeuser Company. However, with our strategic
focus on local and regional accounts, we believe we compete as much with the
smaller, independent converters as with the larger, integrated producers.

Our principal competitors
with respect to sales of our containerboard produced but not consumed at our
own corrugated products plants are a number of large, diversified paper
companies, including International Paper Company, Koch Industries, Inc.,
Smurfit-Stone Container Corporation, Temple-Inland Inc. and Weyerhaeuser
Company, as well as other regional manufacturers. Containerboard is generally
considered a commodity-type product and can be purchased from numerous
suppliers.

Employees

As of December 31,
2006, we had approximately 8,300 employees. Approximately 2,300 of these
employees were salaried and approximately 6,000 were hourly. Approximately 75%
of our hourly employees are represented by unions. The majority of our
unionized employees are represented primarily by the United Steel Workers
(USW), the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT), and the International
Association of Machinists (IAM).

Contracts for unionized
employees at our containerboard mills expire between June 2007 and June 2012.
Contracts for unionized corrugated plant employees expire between March 2007
and November 2012. We are currently in negotiations to renew or extend any
union contracts that have recently expired or are expiring in the near future.

During 2006, we
experienced no work stoppages. In 2001, we experienced a one-month strike at
our Filer City mill with the USW. The strike was settled, and the mill’s
current agreement expires in April 2009. Prior to this incident we, and
our predecessors, had experienced no instances of significant work stoppages in
the previous 15 years. We believe we have satisfactory employment
relations with our employees.

Environmental Matters

Compliance
with environmental requirements is a significant factor in our business
operations. We commit substantial resources to maintaining environmental
compliance and managing environmental risk.


We are subject to, and must comply with, a variety of federal,
state and local environmental laws, particularly those relating to air and
water quality, waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and
groundwater. The most significant of these laws affecting us are:

1.     Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)

2.     Clean Water Act (CWA)

3.     Clean Air Act (CAA)

4.     The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know-Act (EPCRA)

5.     Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA)

6.     Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA)

We believe that we are
currently in material compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and
regulations. Because environmental regulations are constantly evolving, we have
incurred, and will continue to incur, costs to maintain compliance with these
and other environmental laws. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we
spent approximately $17.5 million to comply with the requirements of these and
other environmental laws. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
the costs of environmental compliance were approximately $15.8 million and $15.1
million, respectively. We work diligently to anticipate and budget for the
impact of applicable environmental regulations, and do not currently expect
that future environmental compliance obligations will materially affect our
business or financial condition.

In April 1998, the
United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized a new Clean Air
and Water Act commonly referred to as the Cluster Rules, which govern all pulp
and paper mill operations, including those at our mills. Over the next several
years, the Cluster Rules will affect our allowable discharges of air and
water pollutants. As a result, PCA and its competitors are required to incur
costs to ensure compliance with these new rules. During 2006, we spent
$1.1 million to complete our projects related to Cluster Rule requirements
at our four mills. As a result, we do not anticipate any further capital
expenditures related to ensuring compliance with the Cluster Rules. From 1997
through 2006, we spent approximately $39.2 million on Cluster Rule compliance
to meet Clean Air Act requirements. Total capital costs for environmental
matters, including Cluster Rule compliance, were $4.8 million for
2006. We currently estimate 2007 environmental capital expenditures will be $8.6 million

.

As is the case with any
industrial operation, we have in the past incurred costs associated with the
remediation of soil or groundwater contamination. From 1994 through 2006,
remediation costs at our mills and converting plants totaled about $3.2 million.
We do not believe that any ongoing remedial projects are material in nature. As
of December 31, 2006, we maintained an environmental reserve of
$6.1 million, which includes funds relating to on-site landfill and
surface impoundments as well as ongoing and anticipated remedial projects. Of
the $6.1 million reserve, $3.5 million is reserved for our landfill
obligations, which are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 143, “Accounting
for Asset Retirement Obligations”. We believe these reserves are adequate.

We could also incur
environmental liabilities as a result of claims by third parties for civil
damages, including liability for personal injury or property damage, arising
from releases of hazardous substances or contamination. We are not aware of any
material claims of this type currently pending against us.

As a part of the April 12,
1999 transactions, Pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former
facilities and all sites associated with pre-closing offsite waste disposal.
Pactiv also retained environmental liability for a closed landfill located near
the Filer City mill.


As of this filing, we
believe that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental
expenditures above the $6.1 million accrued as of December 31, 2006 will have
a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

RISK FACTORS

Some of the statements in
this report and in our 2006 Annual Report to Stockholders, and in particular,
statements found in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations, that are not historical in nature may constitute
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are often identified by the
words “will,” “should,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,”
“hope,” or similar expressions. These statements reflect management’s current
views with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties.
There are important factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from those in forward-looking statements, many of which are beyond
our control. These factors, risks and uncertainties include, but are not
limited to, the factors described below.

Our actual results,
performance or achievement could differ materially from those expressed in, or
implied by, these forward-looking statements, and accordingly, we can give no
assurances that any of the events anticipated by the forward-looking statements
will transpire or occur, or if any of them do so, what impact they will have on
our results of operations or financial condition. In view of these
uncertainties, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these
forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly
revise any forward-looking statements that have been made to reflect the
occurrence of events after the date hereof.

Industry Risks

Industry Earnings Cyclicality

—Imbalances
of supply and demand for containerboard affect the price at which we can sell
containerboard and, as a result, could result in lower selling prices and
earnings.

The price of
containerboard could fall if the supply of containerboard available for sale in
the market exceeds the demand. The demand for containerboard is driven by
market needs for containerboard in the United States and abroad to manufacture
corrugated shipping containers. Market needs or demand are driven by both
global and U.S. business conditions. If supply exceeds demand, prices for
containerboard could decline, resulting in decreased earnings and cash flow.

From time to time, we have
taken downtime (or slowbacks) at some of our mills to balance our production of
containerboard with the market demand for our containerboard, and we may
continue to do so in the future. Some of our competitors have also temporarily
closed or reduced production at their


containerboard
mills, some of which could reopen and increase production capacity. This could
result in a supply and demand imbalance and cause prices to fall.

Competition

—The intensity of
competition in the containerboard and corrugated packaging industry combined
with the commodity nature of containerboard could result in downward pressure
on pricing, which could lower earnings.

PCA operates in an
industry that is highly competitive, with no single containerboard or
corrugated packaging producer having a dominant position. Containerboard cannot
generally be differentiated by producer, which tends to intensify price competition.
The corrugated packaging industry is also sensitive to price fluctuations, as
well as other factors including innovation, design, quality and service. To the
extent that one or more competitors are more successful with respect to any key
competitive factor, our business could be adversely affected. Our products also
compete, to some extent, with various other packaging materials, including
products made of paper, plastics, wood and various types of metal. The
intensity of containerboard competition and the commodity nature of
containerboard, plus the intensity of corrugated packaging competition, could
lead to a reduction in our market share as well as lower prices for our
products, both of which could reduce our earnings.

Company Risks

Cost of Wood Fiber

—Dependence
on external wood fiber sources could lead to higher costs and lower earnings
for PCA.

PCA has supply agreements
at market prices for wood fiber to be consumed at three of our four mills on
about 380,000 acres of timberland. In addition to these supply agreements, PCA
also secures wood fiber from various other sources at market prices.

Because we do not own any
timberlands, we are more vulnerable to changes in availability of wood fiber in
areas adjacent to our mills than those of our competitors who do own
timberlands in areas adjacent to their mills, and therefore could face higher
wood fiber costs than those competitors, both in terms of the cost of the wood
fiber itself as well as the transportation costs to get the wood fiber to our
mills. The price for wood fiber has historically fluctuated on a cyclical basis
and has often depended on a variety of factors over which we have no control,
including environmental and conservation regulations, natural disasters and the
weather.

Any increase in wood fiber
costs could cause our manufacturing costs to increase and our earnings to
decrease to a greater extent than those of our competitors who own their own
timberlands.

Cost of Recycled Fiber

—An
increase in the cost of recycled fiber could increase our containerboard
manufacturing costs and lower our earnings.

PCA purchases recycled
fiber for use at three of its four containerboard mills. PCA currently
purchases, net of recycled fiber generated at its box plants, approximately
400,000 tons of recycled fiber per year.

The increase in demand of
products manufactured, in whole or in part, from recycled fiber, on a global
basis, has caused an occasional tightening in the supply of recycled fiber.
These periods of supply and demand imbalance have tended to create significant
price volatility. Periods of above average recycled fiber costs and overall
price volatility may continue, which could result in earnings volatility.

Cost of Purchased Energy

—An
increase in the cost of purchased energy, particularly natural gas and oil,
could lead to higher manufacturing costs, resulting in reduced earnings.

PCA has the capability to
use various types of purchased fuels in its manufacturing operations, including
coal, bark, natural gas and oil. Energy prices, in particular prices for oil
and natural gas, have fluctuated dramatically in the past and have risen
substantially in recent years. These fluctuations impact


our
manufacturing costs and result in earnings volatility. If energy prices rise,
our production costs will increase, which will lead to higher manufacturing
costs and reduced earnings.

Environmental Matters

—PCA
may incur significant environmental liabilities with respect to both past and
future operations.

We are subject to, and
must comply with, a variety of federal, state and local environmental laws,
particularly those relating to air and water quality, waste disposal and the
cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater. Because environmental regulations
are constantly evolving, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs to
maintain compliance with those laws. In our 2006 Annual Report on Form 10-K
under the caption “Environmental Matters,” we provide certain estimates of
expenditures we expect to make for environmental compliance in the next few
years. Although we have established reserves to provide for future
environmental liability, these reserves may not be adequate.

Restrictions
Imposed by our Senior Credit Facility, the Receivables Revolving Credit
Facility and the Indenture Governing our Notes

—

Our operating flexibility is limited in
certain respects by the covenants in our senior credit facility, the
receivables revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our notes.

Our
senior credit facility, receivables revolving credit facility and the indenture
governing our notes impose restrictions on us that could increase our
vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions by limiting
our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and
industry. Specifically, these restrictions limit our ability, among other
things, to:

·

incur
liens;

·

enter
into certain transactions with affiliates;

·

enter
into sale and leaseback transactions; and

·

merge or consolidate with
any other person or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of
the assets of PCA.

Investment Risks

Potential Impediments to a Change of
Control

—Some of the provisions of our charter documents and
the presence of a large stockholder could discourage acquisition proposals by
third parties and could delay, deter or prevent a change in control.

Our certificate of
incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors, subject to any limitations
prescribed by law, to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series
without stockholder approval. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing
desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and for other
corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a
third party to acquire, or discouraging a third party from seeking to acquire,
a majority of our outstanding voting stock. The presence of a significant
stockholder may also deter a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or
otherwise attempting to obtain control of PCA, even if that might be favorable
to PCA or PCA’s other stockholders.

Market Price of our Common Stock

—

The
market price of our common stock may be volatile, which could cause the value
of your investment to decline.

Securities markets
worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations. This market
volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could
reduce the market price of our common stock in spite of our operating
performance. In addition, our operating results could be below the expectations
of public market analysts and investors, and in response, the market price of
our common stock could decrease significantly.

In
April, 2005, we shut down our number three paper machine at our Tomahawk mill
after resuming operations on our number one paper machine at our Filer City
mill. Shutting down the number three machine (out of 3 total) at Tomahawk
reduces our total productive capacity by 65,000 tons at Tomahawk from 580,000
tons to 515,000 tons and reduces our total containerboard mill system capacity
from 2,448,000 tons to 2,383,000 tons. This action was based on market
conditions and productivity and could change if market conditions or
productivity levels change going forward.

We currently own our four
containerboard mills and 45 of our corrugated manufacturing operations (37
corrugated plants and eight sheet plants). We also own one sawmill, an
air-drying yard, one warehouse and miscellaneous other property, which includes
sales offices and woodlands forest management offices. These sales offices and
woodlands forest management offices generally have one to four employees and
serve as administrative offices. PCA leases the space for three corrugated
plants, 20 sheet plants, five regional design centers, and numerous other
distribution centers, warehouses and facilities. The equipment in these leased
facilities is, in virtually all cases, owned by PCA, except for forklifts and
other rolling stock which are generally leased.

We lease the cutting
rights to approximately 106,000 acres of timberland located near our Valdosta mill
(85,000 acres) and our Counce mill (21,000 acres). Most of these cutting rights
agreements have terms with over 15 years remaining, on average.

We currently lease space
for our corporate headquarters in Lake Forest, Illinois. The lease for the Lake
Forest, Illinois facility is a short term, facility use agreement lease with
automatic renewal rights. Specifically, this lease is a continuous
month-to-month lease with unlimited automatic renewals entitling either party
the right to terminate the lease with at least 8 months notice. We currently
believe that our owned and leased space for facilities and properties are
sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future.

Item 3.

LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS

PCA is a party to various
legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business. These legal
actions cover a broad variety of claims spanning our entire business. As of the
date of this filing, we believe it is not reasonably possible that the
resolution of these legal actions will, individually or in the aggregate, have
a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or
cash flows.

MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion of historical results of
operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the
audited financial statements and the notes thereto which appear elsewhere in
this report.

Overview

PCA
is the sixth largest producer of containerboard and corrugated products in the
United States, based on production capacity. Approximately 80% of the
containerboard tons produced at our mills are consumed in our corrugated
products manufacturing plants. The remaining 20% is sold to domestic customers
or the export market. Besides containerboard, we produce a wide variety of
products ranging from basic corrugated shipping containers to specialized
packaging such as wax-coated boxes for the agriculture industry. We also have
multi-color printing capabilities to make high-impact graphics boxes and
displays that offer our customers more attractive packaging. Our operating
facilities and customers are located primarily in the United States.


In analyzing our operating
performance, we focus on the following factors that affect our business and are
important to consider when reviewing our financial and operating results:

·

corrugated
products demand;

·

corrugated
products and containerboard pricing;

·

containerboard
inventories; and

·

cost
trends and volatility for our major costs, including wood and recycled fiber,
purchased fuels, electricity, labor and fringe benefits, and transportation
costs.

The market for containerboard is generally subject to
changes in the U.S. economy. Historically, supply and demand, as well as
industry-wide inventory levels, have influenced prices of containerboard. In
addition to U.S. shipments, approximately 10% of domestically produced
containerboard has been exported for use in other countries.

Industry supply and demand trends were favorable
throughout 2006. Industry shipments of corrugated products increased 1.3%
during 2006 compared to 2005, on a per workday basis. During this same period,
industry containerboard inventory levels remained at historically low levels,
with inventory at the end of December 2006 at its second lowest level in
the past 25 years, on a weeks of supply basis. Since September 2005,
linerboard prices have increased $120 per ton, or approximately 30%, as
reported by industry publications.

The cost to manufacture containerboard is dependent,
in large part, on the costs of wood fiber, recycled fiber, purchased fuels,
electricity, labor, and fringe benefits. While energy and other costs are
significant in the manufacture of corrugated products, labor and fringe
benefits make up the largest component of corrugated products’ manufactured
costs besides the cost of containerboard.

Costs for purchased fuels rose sharply in the fourth
quarter of 2005 and have remained above the average levels of 2005, but not as
high as the fourth quarter of 2005. Transportation and electricity costs have
also risen due to higher fuel costs. Recycled fiber costs began the year below the
prior year’s levels, increased through the third quarter and ended the year
about 20% above year-end 2005 levels. Wood fiber costs did not change
appreciably compared to 2005.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, PCA achieved
significantly improved earnings compared to the prior year. The improved
earnings were primarily driven by increased product pricing for both
containerboard and corrugated products, reflecting the full realization of
previously announced price increases, and an improvement in product and
customer sales mix. Product sales volumes remained steady throughout the year,
and were 0.8% above our last year’s all-time record volume on a per workday
basis. Partially offsetting the earnings improvement were higher transportation
costs driven, for the most part, by fuel price increases, higher labor and
fringe benefits costs, including medical, pension and incentive compensation
costs, and higher energy costs due to increases in fuel and electricity prices.

We expect our earnings in
the first quarter 2007 to be lower than our earnings in the fourth quarter 2006,
primarily due to planned mill maintenance outages at our linerboard mills in
Counce, Tennessee and Valdosta, Georgia. We also typically incur higher energy
costs in the first quarter due to increased colder weather and somewhat higher
fiber costs related to more difficult logging conditions.

Net Sales

Net sales increased by $193.4 million, or 9.7%,
for the year ended December 31, 2006 from the year ended December 31,
2005. Net sales increased primarily due to increased sales prices and volumes
of corrugated products and containerboard compared to 2005.

Total corrugated products
volume sold increased 0.4% to 31.3 billion square feet in 2006 compared to
31.2 billion square feet in 2005. On a comparable shipment-per-workday
basis, corrugated products sales volume increased 0.8% in 2006 from 2005.
Shipments-per-workday is calculated by dividing our total corrugated products
volume during the year by the number of workdays within the year. The larger
percentage increase on a shipment-per-workday basis was due to the fact that
2006 had one less workday (249 days), those days not falling on a weekend
or holiday, than 2005 (250 days). Containerboard sales volume to external
domestic and export customers increased 15.6% to 482,000 tons for the year
ended December 31, 2006 from 417,000 tons in 2005.

Income from Operations

Income from operations increased by
$109.8 million, or 94.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2006
compared to 2005. Included in income from operations for the year ended December 31,
2005 is income of $14.0 million, net of expenses, consisting of two
dividends paid to PCA by Southern Timber Venture, LLC (STV), the
timberlands joint venture in which PCA owns a 31


¤


% ownership
interest.

Excluding the dividends from STV, income from
operations increased $123.8 million in 2006 compared to 2005. The
$123.8 million increase in income from operations was primarily
attributable to higher sales prices and volume as well as improved mix of
business ($195.6 million), partially offset by increased costs related to
transportation ($18.9 million), energy, primarily purchased fuels and
electricity ($18.3 million), wage increases for hourly and salaried
personnel ($16.9 million), medical, pension and other benefit costs ($9.9 million),
and incentive compensation ($6.5 million).

Gross profit increased $137.1 million, or 44.7%,
for the year ended December 31, 2006 from the year ended December 31,
2005. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from 15.4% of net
sales in 2005 to 20.3% of net sales in the current year primarily due to the
increased sales prices described previously.

Selling and administrative expenses increased
$12.3 million, or 8.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 from the
comparable period in 2005. The increase was primarily the result of increased
salary and


incentive compensation
expense ($8.2 million) and related fringe benefit costs
($1.4 million), and higher warehousing costs due to customer requirements
($2.0 million).

Corporate overhead for the year ended December 31,
2006, increased $3.1 million, or 6.5%, from the year ended December 31,
2005. The increase was primarily attributable to higher incentive compensation
expense ($2.6 million) and other increased costs which were not individually
significant.

Other expense, net,
decreased $2.1 million, or 20.1% for the year ended December 31, 2006
compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. The decrease was primarily
due to a $3.1 million decrease in expenses related to the disposals of
property, plant and equipment as part of planned disposals in connection with capital
projects. Partially offsetting the decrease in fixed asset disposal expense was
higher legal expenses ($0.5 million) and increased losses on disposals of
storeroom items ($0.4 million).

Interest Expense, Net and Income Taxes

Interest expense, net of interest income, increased by
$3.1 million, or 11.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared
to the full year 2005, primarily as a result of higher interest expense on our
variable rate debt due to higher interest rates.

PCA’s effective tax rate
was 35.8% for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 40.2% for the year
ended December 31, 2005. The lower tax rate in 2006 is primarily due to a
larger domestic manufacturer’s deduction and a reduction in the Texas state tax
rate. For both years 2006 and 2005, tax rates were higher than the federal
statutory rate of 35.0% due to state income taxes.

Net Sales

Net sales increased by $103.6 million, or 5.5%,
for the year ended December 31, 2005 from the year ended December 31,
2004. Net sales increased primarily due to increased sales prices and volumes
of corrugated products compared to 2004.

Total corrugated products
volume sold increased 4.2% to 31.2 billion square feet in 2005 compared to
29.9 billion square feet in 2004. On a comparable shipment-per-workday
basis, corrugated products sales volume increased 4.6% in 2005 from 2004.
Excluding PCA’s acquisition of Midland Container in April 2005, corrugated
products volume was 3.0% higher in 2005 than 2004 and up 3.4% compared to 2004
on a shipment-per-workday basis. Shipments-per-workday is calculated by
dividing our total corrugated products volume during the year by the number of
workdays within the year. The larger percentage increase was due to the fact
that 2005 had one less workday (250 days), those days not falling on a
weekend or holiday, than 2004 (251 days). Containerboard sales volume to
external domestic and export customers decreased 12.2% to 417,000 tons for
the year ended December 31, 2005 from 475,000 tons in 2004.


Income from
Operations

Income from operations
decreased by $24.4 million, or 17.3%, for the year ended December 31,
2005 compared to 2004. Included in income from operations for the year ended December 31,
2004 is income of $27.8 million, net of expenses, attributable to a
dividend paid to PCA by STV, the timberlands joint venture in which PCA owns a 31


¤


%
ownership interest. Additionally in 2004, STV purchased a portion of PCA’s
interest in STV which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $2.0 million. Included
in income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 is income
of $14.0 million, net of expenses, due to two additional dividends paid to
PCA by STV.

Excluding the dividends
from STV and the equity sale described above, income from operations decreased
$8.6 million in 2005 compared to 2004. The $8.6 million decrease in
income from operations was primarily attributable to increased costs related to
transportation ($21.1 million), energy, primarily purchased fuels and
electricity ($20.5 million), wood fiber ($10.4 million), annual wage
increases for hourly and salaried personnel ($13.8 million), medical,
pension and other benefit costs ($7.5 million), other corrugated
converting costs, primarily materials and supplies ($4.9 million) and mill
chemicals ($3.9 million). Those cost items were largely offset by increased
sales prices and volume ($74.6 million).

Gross profit increased
$9.1 million, or 3.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2005 from the
year ended December 31, 2004. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales
declined from 15.8% of net sales in 2004 to 15.4% of net sales in the current
year primarily due to the cost increases described above which was almost
entirely offset by improved sales pricing and volume.

Selling and administrative
expenses increased $10.3 million, or 7.6%, for the year ended December 31,
2005 from the comparable period in 2004. The increase was primarily the result
of increased salary and incentive compensation expense ($7.1 million) and
related fringe benefits ($1.7 million), and higher warehousing costs due
to customer requirements ($1.7 million).

Corporate overhead for the
year ended December 31, 2005, increased by $2.9 million, or 6.4%,
from the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily
attributable to higher professional fees primarily related to investor
relations, legal and human resource matters ($1.4 million) and increased
salaries ($1.1 million).

Other expense, net,
increased $4.5 million, or 73.5% for the year ended December 31, 2005
compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily
due to a $3.3 million increase in expenses related to the disposals of
property, plant and equipment as part of planned disposals in connection with
capital projects, and a portion of a corrugated products manufacturing plant’s
closure costs ($1.4 million) which were recorded in other expense, net in
2005.

Interest Expense,
Net and Income Taxes

Interest expense, net of
interest income, decreased by $1.5 million, or 5.0%, for the year ended December 31,
2005 from 2004 primarily as a result of an increase in interest income earned on
our cash equivalents, partially offset by higher interest expense on our
variable rate debt due to higher interest rates.

PCA’s effective tax rate
was 40.2% for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 38.0% for the year
ended December 31, 2004. The higher tax rate in 2005 is due to an increase
in tax accruals recorded for prior years. For both years 2005 and 2004, tax
rates are higher than the federal statutory rate of 35.0% due to state income
taxes.

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities increased
$3.9 million, or 1.6% to $246.6 million for the year ended December 31,
2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in net
cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of higher net
income in 2006 as previously described, primarily offset by higher requirements
for operating assets and liabilities of $39.5 million for the year ended December 31,
2006 compared to the same period in 2005, a lower deferred tax provision of
$35.9 million due to the utilization of a federal net operating loss carry
forward in 2005, and the required reclassification of excess tax benefits related
to share-based compensation expense from operating activities to financing
activities in accordance with the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1,
2006. The excess tax benefits increased cash provided by operating activities
by $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. During 2006, PCA’s
cash taxes paid for both federal and state income taxes were $65.1 million, or
33.4% of book income before taxes of $194.7 million, compared to PCA’s
effective tax rate of 35.8% in 2006. The Company expects the 2007 cash tax rate
for both federal and state income tax payments to be in line with the effective
tax rate of about 37%.

The higher requirements for operating assets and
liabilities were driven by unfavorable year over year changes in accounts
receivable ($55.5 million) primarily due to increased sales prices of
corrugated products and containerboard in the year ended 2006 compared to the
same period in 2005 and accounts payable ($18.4 million), partially offset
by favorable year over year changes in inventories ($6.6 million) and accrued
liabilities ($26.6 million).

Net cash provided by operating activities increased
$27.4 million, or 12.7%, to $242.7 million for the year ended December 31,
2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in net
cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of lower
requirements for operating assets and liabilities of $50.5 million,
partially offset by lower deferred taxes of $25.5 million. The decrease in
deferred taxes was due primarily to the elimination of bonus depreciation which
resulted in substantially lower tax depreciation in 2005 than in 2004, partially
offset by the use of a federal net operating loss carry forward. During 2005,
PCA’s cash taxes paid for both federal and state income taxes were
$10.1 million, or 11.5% of book income before income taxes of
$88.0 million, compared to PCA’s effective tax rate of 40.2% in 2005. The
lower cash tax rate compared to the effective tax rate was primarily the result
of reducing current year taxable income by $68.6 million through available federal
net operating loss carry forwards. As of December 31, 2005, all federal
net operating loss carry forwards have been used. Without the federal net
operating loss carry forwards, PCA would have owed an additional $24.0 million
in federal tax cash payments in 2005.

The lower requirements for
operating assets and liabilities in 2005 were driven by a $13.0 million
payment to Pactiv in January 2004 for a fourth quarter 2003 negotiated
settlement of pension benefits and workers’ compensation liabilities dating
back to April 12, 1999, the date Tenneco Packaging (now Pactiv) sold us to
PCA Holdings LLC. Additionally, PCA paid Pactiv $10.0 million in April 2004
as final payment for PCA’s participation in Pactiv’s salaried pension plan. The
lower requirements in 2005 were also driven


by
favorable changes in accounts receivable ($33.7 million) in 2005 primarily due
to lower selling prices in both corrugated products and containerboard at the
end of 2005 compared to the end of 2004.

Investing Activities

Net cash used for investing activities decreased by
$67.6 million, or 41.9%, to $93.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. The decrease was
primarily related to lower cost of acquisitions of businesses of $44.4 million
in 2006, a decrease in additions to property, plant and equipment of $37.1
million in 2006 compared to the same period in 2005, partially offset by the
$15.0 million in STV dividends received in 2005.

Net cash used for investing activities increased by
$44.7 million, or 38.2%, to $161.5 million for the year ended December 31,
2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was
primarily related to an increase in additions to property, plant and equipment
of $16.7 million in 2005 compared to the same period in 2004, lower joint
venture dividends received from STV of $14.3 million in 2005 compared to
2004, higher cost of acquisitions of businesses of $10.3 million in 2005
and lower proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment and
investments of $3.1 million received in 2005.

As of December 31,
2006, PCA had commitments for general purpose capital expenditures of
$48.5 million. PCA believes cash flow from operations will be sufficient
to fund these commitments.

Financing Activities

Net cash used for financing activities totaled $103.5
million for the year ended December 31, 2006, a decrease of $78.4 million,
or 43.1%, from the comparable period in 2005. The decrease was primarily
attributable to the repurchase of 4,500,000 shares of PCA common stock from PCA
Holdings LLC for $93.1 million in December of 2005, partially offset by
$8.9 million in additional long-term debt payments during 2006 compared to
2005, and $8.2 million in additional dividends paid on PCA’s common stock
during 2006 compared to the same period in 2005.

Net cash used for financing activities totaled
$181.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of
$124.7 million, or 217.9%, from the comparable period in 2004. The
increase was primarily attributable to the repurchase of 4,500,000 shares of
PCA common stock from PCA Holdings LLC for a total of $93.1 million in December 2005,
and $33.1 million in additional dividends paid on PCA’s common stock
during 2005 compared to the same period in 2004.

PCA holds a 31


¤


% equity
ownership interest in STV. In 2005 and 2004, PCA received dividends from STV of
$15.0 million and $29.3 million, respectively. PCA did not receive
any dividends in 2006.

On November 29, 2000, PCA established an
on-balance sheet securitization program for its trade accounts receivable. To
effectuate this program, PCA formed a wholly-owned limited purpose subsidiary,
Packaging Credit Company, LLC, or PCC, which in turn formed a wholly-owned,
bankruptcy-remote, special-purpose subsidiary, Packaging Receivables Company,
LLC, or PRC, for the purpose of acquiring receivables from PCC. Both of these
entities are included in the consolidated financial statements of PCA. Under
this program, PCC purchases on an ongoing basis substantially all of the
receivables of PCA and sells such receivables to PRC. PRC and lenders
established a $150.0 million receivables-backed revolving credit facility
through which PRC obtains funds to purchase receivables from PCC. The
receivables purchased by PRC are and will be solely the property of PRC. In the
event of a liquidation of PRC, the creditors of PRC would be entitled to
satisfy their claims from PRC’s assets prior to any distribution to PCC or PCA.
Credit available under the receivables credit facility is on a borrowing-base
formula. As a result, the full amount of the facility may not be available at
all times. On October 6, 2006, PCA renewed the receivables credit facility
for an additional one-year term, expiring on October 5, 2007. As of December 31,
2006, $109.0 million was outstanding and $41.0 million was available
for additional


borrowing under the
receivables credit facility. The highest outstanding principal balance under the
receivables credit facility during fiscal 2006 was $109.0 million.

On July 7, 2003, PCA entered into a senior
unsecured credit facility that provides for a $100.0 million revolving
credit facility, including a $35.0 million subfacility for letters of
credit, and a $50.0 million term loan. The senior credit facility expires
in 2008. PCA’s total borrowings under the senior credit facility as of December 31,
2006 consisted of $30.0 million of term loans.

On July 21, 2003, PCA
closed its offering and private placement of $150.0 million of 4

The above table excludes unamortized debt discount of
$2.4 million at December 31, 2006 and interest payments on debt
outstanding. PCA currently does not have any projections for future pension
contributions beyond 2007 due to the recent changes in ERISA.

The operating lease commitments, capital commitments, purchase
commitments and letters of credit are not reflected on PCA’s consolidated
balance sheet as of December 31, 2006. See Notes 8 and 11 to the audited
consolidated financial statements for additional information.

PCA’s primary sources of liquidity are net cash provided
by operating activities, borrowings under PCA’s revolving credit facility, and
additional borrowings under PCA’s receivables credit facility. As of December 31,
2006, PCA had $121.6 million in unused borrowing capacity under its
existing credit agreements due to the impact on this borrowing capacity of
$19.4 million of outstanding letters of credit.


Currently, PCA’s primary
uses of cash are for capital expenditures, debt service and declared common
stock dividends, which it expects to be able to fund from these sources.

The
following table provides the outstanding balances and the weighted average
interest rates as of December 31, 2006 for PCA’s outstanding term loan,

The above table excludes unamortized debt discount of
$2.4 million at December 31, 2006. It also excludes from the
projected annual cash interest payments, the non-cash income from the annual
amortization of the $27.0 million received in July 2003 from the
settlement of the Treasury locks related to the five- and ten- year notes. The
amortization is being recognized over the terms of the five- and ten-year notes
and is included in interest expense, net.

The revolving credit facility is available to fund
PCA’s working capital requirements, capital expenditures and other general
corporate purposes. The term loan must be repaid in annual installments in July 2007
through 2008. The revolving credit facility will terminate in July 2008.
The receivables credit facility will terminate in October 2007.

The instruments governing PCA’s indebtedness contain
financial and other covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of
PCA and its subsidiaries to:

·

enter into sale and leaseback transactions,

·

incur liens,

·

enter into certain transactions with
affiliates, or

·

merge or consolidate with any other person or
sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of PCA.

These limitations could limit corporate and operating
activities.

In addition, we must maintain minimum net worth,
maximum leverage and minimum EBITDA to interest ratios under the senior credit
facility. A failure to comply with the restrictions contained in the senior
credit facility could lead to an event of default, which could result in an
acceleration of such indebtedness. Such an acceleration would also constitute
an event of default under the notes indentures and the receivables credit
facility.

PCA currently expects to incur capital expenditures of
$110.0 million to $120.0 million in 2007. These capital
expenditures will be used primarily for maintenance capital, cost reduction,
business growth, and environmental compliance.


PCA believes that its net
cash generated from operating activities, available cash reserves and, as
required, borrowings under its committed credit facilities will be adequate to
meet its current and future liquidity and capital requirements, including
payments of any declared common stock dividends. As its debt or credit
facilities become due, PCA will need to repay, extend or replace such
facilities, which will be subject to future economic conditions and financial,
business and other factors, many of which are beyond PCA’s control.

Environmental
Matters

We are subject to,
and must comply with, a variety of federal, state and local environmental laws,
particularly those relating to air and water quality, waste disposal and the
cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater. The most significant of these
laws affecting us are:

·

Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)

·

Clean
Water Act (CWA)

·

Clean
Air Act (CAA)

·

The
Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know-Act (EPCRA)

·

Toxic
Substance Control Act (TSCA)

·

Safe
Drinking Water Act (SDWA)

We believe that we are currently in material compliance
with these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations. Because
environmental regulations are constantly evolving, we have incurred, and will
continue to incur, costs to maintain compliance with these and other
environmental laws. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we spent
approximately $17.5 million to comply with the requirements of these and
other environmental laws. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
the costs of environmental compliance were approximately $15.8 million and
$15.1 million, respectively.

In addition, the EPA finalized the Cluster Rules which
govern pulp and paper mill operations, including those at the Counce, Filer
City, Valdosta and Tomahawk mills. The Cluster Rules affect our allowable
discharges of air and water pollutants, and require us to spend money to ensure
compliance with these new rules.

As is the case with any industrial operation, we have,
in the past, incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or
groundwater contamination, as required by the federal Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as the
federal “Superfund” law, and analogous state laws. Cleanup requirements arise
with respect to properties we currently own or operate, former facilities and
off-site facilities where we have disposed of hazardous substances. Under the
terms of the contribution agreement, Pactiv has agreed to retain all liability
for all former facilities and all sites associated with pre-closing off-site
waste disposal. Pactiv has also retained environmentally impaired real property
in Filer City, Michigan unrelated to current mill operations.

Because liability for
remediation costs under environmental laws is strict, meaning that liability is
imposed without fault, joint and several, meaning that liability is imposed on
each party without regard to contribution, and retroactive, we could receive
notifications of cleanup liability in the future and this liability could be
material. From 1994 through 2006, remediation costs at our mills and corrugated
plants totaled approximately $3.2 million. As of December 31, 2006,
we maintained an environmental reserve of $6.1 million relating to on-site
landfills and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and anticipated remedial
projects. Total capital costs for environmental matters, including Cluster Rule compliance,
were $4.8 million for 2006 and we currently estimate 2007 environmental
capital expenditures will be $8.6 million. As of this filing, we believe
that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental


expenditures
above the $6.1 million accrued as of December 31, 2006 will have a
material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows.

Impact of Inflation

PCA does not believe that
inflation has had a material impact on its financial position or results of
operations during the past three years.

Critical Accounting
Policies

Management’s discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these
financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we
evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories,
intangible assets, pensions and other postretirement benefits, income taxes,
and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates
under different assumptions or conditions.

We believe the following
critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and
estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. For
a further discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies,
see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in
this report.

Accounts Receivable—Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
and Customer Deductions

We evaluate the collectibility of our accounts
receivable based upon a combination of factors. In circumstances where we are
aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to
us (e.g., bankruptcy filings, substantial downgrading of credit sources), we
record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net
recorded receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. For
all other customers, we recognize reserves for bad debts consisting of 0.3% for
amounts less than 90 days past due their contractual terms and 30% for amounts
more than 90 days past due their contractual terms based on our historical
collection experience. If our collection experience deteriorates (i.e., higher
than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major
customer’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us), our estimates of
the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount.

The customer deductions reserve represents the
estimated amount required for customer returns, allowances and earned
discounts. Based on our experience, customer returns, allowances and earned
discounts have averaged 1.0% of our gross selling price. Accordingly, we
reserve 1.0% of our open customer accounts receivable balance for these items.

As of December 31,
2006, the balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve was $3.8 million,
compared to $3.3 million at December 31, 2005. Bad debt expense in
2006 was $3.2 million, compared to $2.7 million in 2005. The $0.5 million
increased expense

was primarily attributable to an
increase of $0.4 million recorded in connection with specific customers
that were reserved for at the 90% level of their accounts receivable balance as
of December 31, 2006.

For the year
ended December 31, 2005, bad debt expense was $2.7 million compared
to $0.1 million in 2004. The increase of $2.6 million was primarily
attributable to increased expense of $1.2 million related to accounts
receivable amounts that were deemed uncollectable, an increase of $0.7 million
recorded in connection with specific customers that were


reserved
for at the 90% level of their accounts receivable balance as of December 31,
2005 and an increase of $0.4 million related to accounts receivable
amounts that were reserved for at the 30% level because they were over
90 days past due as of December 31, 2005.

Inventories

We record our inventories at
the lower of cost or market and include all costs directly associated with
manufacturing products: materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. The
estimated market value is based on assumptions for future demand and related
pricing. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by
management, reductions in the carrying value of inventories may be required.
Raw materials, work in process and finished goods valued using the last-in,
first-out (“LIFO”) cost method comprised 63% and 66% of inventories at current
cost at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Supplies and materials
inventories are valued using a moving average cost.

Pension and Postretirement Benefits

The Company accounts for defined benefit pension plans
and postretirement plans in accordance with SFAS No. 87, “Employers’
Accounting for Pensions,” SFAS No. 106, “Employers’ Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions” and SFAS No. 158, “Employers’
Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—An
Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)”.

One of the principal assumptions used to calculate net
periodic pension cost is the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized
returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets
in any given year. Over time, however, the expected long-term rate of return on
plan assets is designed to approximate the actual long term returns.

The discount rate assumptions used to calculate net
periodic pension and postretirement costs reflect the rates available on
high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments on September 30 of each year.
The rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used to
calculate net periodic pension cost and is determined by us based upon annual
reviews.

For postretirement health
care plan accounting, we review external data and our own historical trends for
health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rate assumption.

Environmental Liabilities

PCA accounts for its retirement obligations related to
its landfills under SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations,” which requires legal obligations associated with the retirement
of long-lived assets to be recognized at their fair value at the time that the
obligations are incurred. Upon initial recognition of a liability, that cost is
capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and amortized to expense
over the useful life of the asset.

The potential costs for various environmental matters
are uncertain due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible cleanup
costs, the complexity and evolving nature of governmental laws and regulations
and their interpretations, and the timing, varying costs and effectiveness of
alternative cleanup technologies. Liabilities recorded for environmental
contingencies are estimates of the probable costs based upon available
information and assumptions. Because of these uncertainties, however, our
estimates may change. We believe that any additional costs identified as
further information becomes available would not have a material effect on our
financial statements.

In connection with the
sale to PCA of the containerboard and corrugated products business of Pactiv
Corporation in April 1999, Pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all
former facilities and all sites


associated
with off-site waste disposal prior to April 12, 1999. Pactiv also retained
the environmental liability for a closed landfill located near the Filer City
mill.

Revenue Recognition

PCA recognizes revenue as
title to the products is transferred to customers. Shipping and handling costs
are included in cost of sales. Shipping and handling billings to a customer are
included in net sales. In addition, PCA offers volume rebates to certain of its
customers. The total cost of these programs is estimated and accrued as a
reduction to net sales at the time of the respective sale.

Impairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the
fourth quarter or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount may exceed fair value. Recoverability of goodwill is
determined by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying
value, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds
the fair value, the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is
compared to the carrying amount of its goodwill to determine if a write-down to
fair value is necessary.

Long-lived assets other
than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any long-lived asset may not
be fully recoverable. In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of any long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of
recoverability would be performed. If an evaluation were required, the
estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset (or group of
assets) would be compared to the asset’s (or group of assets’) carrying amount
to determine if a write-down to fair value is required.

Stock-Based Compensation

PCA has one stock-based employee compensation plan.
Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for our stock option plan under the
recognition and measurement provisions of Accounting Principles Board (“APB”)
Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related
Interpretations, as permitted by SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation.” No stock option-based employee compensation cost was recognized
in the Statements of Income prior to January 1, 2006 as all stock options
granted under the plan had an exercise price equal to the market value of the
underlying common stock on the date of grant. However, prior to the adoption of
SFAS No. 123(R), stock-based compensation had been included in pro forma
disclosures in the financial statement footnotes for periods prior to January 1,
2006.

Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the fair
value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based
Payment,” using the modified-prospective-transition method. Under that
transition method, stock compensation cost recognized includes: (a) compensation
cost for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not vested as of January 1,
2006, based on the grant date fair value, estimated in accordance with the
original provisions of SFAS No. 123, and (b) compensation cost for
all share-based payments granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on
the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R).

PCA uses the
Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of each
option grant as of the date of grant. Expected volatilities are based on
historical volatility of our common stock. The expected life of the option is
estimated using historical data pertaining to option exercises and employee
terminations. Separate groups of employees that have similar historical
exercise behavior are considered separately for estimating the expected life.
The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the
time of grant.


Income Taxes

PCA’s annual tax rate is determined based on income,
statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax
purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Tax law requires some items to
be included in the tax return at different times than the items reflected in the
financial statements. As a result, the annual tax rate in the financial
statements is different than the rate reported on our tax return. Some of these
differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the tax
return, and some differences are temporary, reversing over time, such as
depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets
and liabilities.

Inherent in
determining the annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans,
planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Significant
management judgments are required for the following items:

·

Management
reviews our deferred tax assets for realizability. Valuation allowances are
established when management believes that it is more likely than not that some
portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes in valuation
allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision.

·

PCA establishes accruals
for certain tax contingencies when, despite the belief that our tax return
positions are fully supported, we believe that certain positions may be
challenged. The tax contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing
facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, the expiration of
the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine a tax
return, case law and emerging legislation. While it is difficult to predict the
final outcome or timing of resolution for any particular tax matter, we believe
that the accruals reflect the likely outcome of known tax contingencies.

Item 7A.

QUANTITIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

PCA is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes
and changes in the market value of its financial instruments. PCA periodically
enters into derivatives in order to minimize these risks, but not for trading
purposes. As of December 31, 2006, PCA was not a party to any derivative
instruments.

As the interest rates on
approximately 80% of PCA’s debt are fixed, a one percent increase in interest
rates related to variable rate debt would have resulted in an increase in
interest expense and a corresponding decrease in income before taxes of
$1.4 million annually. In the event of a change in interest rates,
management could take actions to mitigate its exposure to the change. However,
due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their
possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in PCA’s
financial structure.

Item 9A.

CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES

Controls and
Procedures

PCA maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information
required to be


disclosed in PCA’s filings
under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC
and that such information is

accumulated
and communicated to PCA’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.

Prior to filing this report, PCA completed an
evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of PCA’s
management, including PCA’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of PCA’s disclosure
controls and procedures as of December 31, 2006. The evaluation of PCA’s
disclosure controls and procedures included a review of the controls’
objectives and design, PCA’s implementation of the controls and the effect of
the controls on the information generated for use in this report. Based on this
evaluation, PCA’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that PCA’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable
assurance level as of December 31, 2006.

During the quarter ended December 31,
2006, there were no changes in internal controls over financial reporting that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, PCA’s
internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Report
on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

PCA’s management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is
defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only
with proper authorizations; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, PCA’s internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. A
control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that objectives of the control system are
met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and
instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.

PCA’s management, under the supervision of and with
the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
assessed the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2006, based on criteria for effective control over financial reporting
described in “Internal Control—Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment,
PCA’s management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting
was effective as of December 31, 2006, based on the specified criteria.

Management’s assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting has been audited
by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting
firm, as stated in their report which is included on page F-3 of
this report and incorporated by reference to this item.

REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Packaging Corporation of America

Board of Directors and Stockholders

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Packaging Corporation of America (the “Company”) as of December 31,
2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders’
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2006. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of Packaging Corporation of America at December 31, 2006 and
2005, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation
to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in
Notes 4 and 6 to the financial statements, the Company changed its method
of accounting for stock-based compensation effective January 1,
2006, and its method of accounting for pension and postretirement benefits
effective December 31, 2006, respectively.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Packaging
Corporation of America’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
and our report dated February 16,
2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Packaging Corporation of
America

Board of Directors and Stockholders

We have audited management’s
assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting, that Packaging Corporation of America
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(the COSO criteria). Packaging Corporation of America’s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s
assessment that Packaging Corporation of America maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our
opinion, Packaging Corporation of America maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2006, based on the COSO criteria.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of
Packaging Corporation of America as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the
related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2006, and our report dated February 16, 2007, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

BASIS
OF PRESENTATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS

Packaging Corporation of
America (“PCA” or the “Company”) was incorporated on January 25, 1999. On April 12,
1999, PCA acquired the containerboard and corrugated packaging products
business of Pactiv Corporation (“Pactiv’’), formerly known as Tenneco
Packaging Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Tenneco Inc. PCA had no
operations from the date of incorporation on January 25, 1999 to April 11,
1999.

The Company is comprised
of mills and corrugated manufacturing operations. The mill operations (the “Mills”)
consist of two kraft linerboard mills located in Counce, Tennessee, and
Valdosta, Georgia, and two medium mills located in Filer City, Michigan, and
Tomahawk, Wisconsin. The Company leases the cutting rights to approximately
106,000 acres of timberland as of December 31, 2006. The Mills transfer
the majority of their containerboard produced to PCA’s corrugated products
plants.

PCA’s corrugated
manufacturing operations consist of 68 plants, with 40

operating as combining operations, or
corrugated plants, and 28 as sheet plants; a technical and development center;
five graphic design centers; a rotogravure printing operation and a complement
of packaging supplies and distribution centers. All plants are located in the
continental United States. Corrugated plants combine linerboard and medium into
sheets that are converted into corrugated shipping containers, point-of-sale
graphics packaging, point-of-purchase displays and other specialized packaging.
Sheet plants purchase sheets primarily from PCA corrugated products plants to
use in the finished corrugated products converting process. The corrugated manufacturing
operations sell to diverse customers primarily in North America.

As of December 31,
2006, we had approximately 8,300
employees. Approximately 2,300
of these employees were salaried and approximately 6,000 were hourly. Approximately 75% of our hourly employees are represented by unions. The
majority of our unionized employees are represented primarily by the United
Steel Workers (USW), the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT), and the
International Association of Machinists (IAM).

Contracts
for unionized employees at our containerboard mills expire between June 2007 and
June 2012. Contracts for unionized corrugated plant employees expire
between March 2007 and November 2012. We are currently in
negotiations to renew or extend any union contracts that have recently expired
or are expiring in the near future.

SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of
Consolidation

The accompanying
consolidated financial statements of PCA include all majority-owned
subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The Company
has one joint venture that is accounted for under the equity method.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Cash and Cash
Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents
include all cash balances and highly liquid investments with a maturity, when
acquired, of three months or less. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which
approximates market.

Accounts Receivable

The collectibility of our
accounts receivable is based upon a combination of factors. In circumstances
where a specific customer is unable to meet its financial obligations to us
(e.g., bankruptcy filings, substantial downgrading of credit sources), a
specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the
net recorded receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected.
For all other customers, reserves for bad debts are recognized consisting of
0.3% for amounts less than 90 days past due their contractual terms and
30% for amounts more than 90 days past due their contractual terms based
on historical collection experience. If collection experience deteriorates (i.e.,
higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a
major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us), the estimate
of the recoverability of amounts due could be reduced by a material amount.

The customer deductions
reserve represents the estimated amount required for customer returns,
allowances and earned discounts. Based on our experience, customer returns,
allowances and earned discounts have averaged 1.0% of our gross selling price.
Accordingly, we reserve 1.0% of our open customer accounts receivable balance
for these items.

At December 31, 2006
and 2005, the allowance for doubtful accounts was $3.8 million and
$3.3 million, respectively. Also offsetting the accounts receivable
balance at December 31, 2006 and 2005, were reserves for customer
deductions of $2.6 million and $2.1 million, respectively.

Inventories

With the exception of
inventories at PCA’s Chicago corrugated products plant, raw materials, work in
process and finished goods are valued using the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”)
cost method. Inventories at the Chicago plant are valued at the first-in,
first-out (“FIFO’’) cost method. Supplies and materials are valued using a
moving average cost. All inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market
and include all costs directly associated with manufacturing products:
materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. Inventories valued using the LIFO
method comprised 63% and 66%, or $151.0 million and $153.6 million of
the total inventory before the LIFO reserve of $239.3 million and
$232.1 million as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

The amount of depreciation
expense was $150.0 million, $151.7 million and $151.3 million
for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

The Company has
capitalized certain intangible assets, primarily customer lists and
relationships, covenants not to compete, and goodwill, based on their estimated
fair value at the date of acquisition. Amortization is provided for customer
lists and relationships on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from six
to 40 years. Covenants not to compete are amortized on a straight-line basis
over the terms of the respective agreements. Goodwill, which amounted to
$37.2 million and $34.2 million as of December 31, 2006 and
2005, respectively, is not being amortized but is subject to annual impairment
tests in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” The Company performs the impairment
tests in the fourth quarter or sooner if events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value. Recoverability of
goodwill is determined by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with
its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting
unit exceeds the fair value, the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s
goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of its goodwill to determine if a
write-down to fair value is necessary. The Company concluded that no impairment
of goodwill existed at the time of the annual impairment tests in 2006, 2005
and 2004.

Other Long-Term Assets

PCA has capitalized certain costs related to obtaining
its financing. These costs are amortized to interest expense using the
effective interest rate method over the terms of the senior credit facility and
senior notes, which range from five to ten years. Unamortized deferred
financing costs were $2.6 million and $3.3 million as of December 31,
2006 and 2005, respectively.

PCA leases the cutting rights to approximately 106,000
acres of timberland and capitalizes the annual lease payments and reforestation
costs associated with these leases. These costs are recorded as depletion when
timber is harvested and used in PCA’s business operations or sold to customers.
Capitalized long-term lease costs were $21.0 million and
$19.1 million as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The
amount of depletion expense was $2.2 million, $3.3 million and
$2.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

PCA capitalizes certain
costs related to the purchase and development of software which is used in its
business operations. The costs attributable to these software systems are
amortized over their estimated useful lives based on various factors such as
the effects of obsolescence, technology and other economic factors. Net
capitalized software costs were $1.1 million and $1.4 million as of December 31,
2006 and 2005, respectively. Software amortization expense was
$1.1 million, $2.4 million and $4.0 million for the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets other
than goodwill are reviewed for impairment in accordance with provisions of SFAS
No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.”
In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
any long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability would be
performed. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future undiscounted cash
flows associated with the asset (or group of assets) would be compared to the
asset’s (or group of assets’) carrying amount to determine if a write-down to
fair value is required. The Company concluded that no impairment of long-lived
assets existed in 2006, 2005 and 2004.

Pension and Postretirement Benefits

One of the principal assumptions used to calculate net
periodic pension cost is the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized
returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets
in any given year. Over time, however, the expected long-term rate of return on
plan assets is designed to approximate the actual long term returns.

The discount rate assumptions used to calculate net
periodic pension and postretirement cost  reflect the rates available on high-quality,
fixed-income debt instruments on September 30th of each year. The rate of
compensation increase is another significant assumption used to calculate net
periodic pension cost and is determined by the Company based upon annual
reviews.

For postretirement health
care plan accounting, the Company reviews external data and our own historical trends
for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rate assumption.

Asset Retirement Obligations

The
Company accounts for its retirement obligations related to its landfills under
SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” which
requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets
to be recognized at their fair value at the time that the obligations are
incurred. Upon initial recognition of a liability, that cost is capitalized as
part of the related long-lived asset and amortized to expense over the useful
life of the asset.

Income Taxes

PCA utilizes the liability
method of accounting for income taxes whereby it recognizes deferred tax assets
and liabilities for the future tax consequences of temporary differences
between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in
the financial statements. Deferred tax assets will be reduced by a valuation
allowance if, based upon management’s estimates, it is more likely than not,
that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in a future
period. The estimates utilized in the recognition of deferred tax assets are
subject to revision in future periods based on new facts or circumstances.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes
revenue as title to the products is transferred to customers. Shipping and
handling billings to a customer are included in net sales. Shipping and handling
costs are included in cost of sales. In addition, the Company offers volume
rebates to certain of its customers. The total cost of these programs is
estimated and accrued as a reduction to net sales at the time of the respective
sale.

Research and Development

Research and development
costs are expensed as incurred. The amount charged to expense was
$6.9 million, $6.8 million, and $6.1 million for the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Interest Expense, Net

Interest expense, net
includes interest income of $4.8 million, $5.2 million, and
$1.4 million and amortization of the Treasury lock proceeds received in July 2003
of $3.1 million each year in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

Industry Agreements

PCA regularly trades
containerboard with other manufacturers primarily to reduce shipping costs.
Containerboard trade agreements are a long-standing industry practice. These
agreements are entered into on an annual basis, in which both parties agree to
ship an identical number of tons to each other within the agreement period.
These agreements minimize transportation cost by allowing each party’s
containerboard mills to ship containerboard to the other party’s closest
corrugated products plant. We track each shipment to ensure that the other
party’s shipments to us match our shipments to them during the agreement
period. Such transfers are possible because containerboard is a commodity
product with no distinguishing product characteristics. These transactions are
accounted for at carrying value, and sales are not recorded as the transactions
do not represent the culmination of an earnings process. The transactions are
recorded into inventory accounts, and no income is recorded until such
inventory is converted to a finished product and sold to an end-use customer.

Segment Information

PCA is engaged in one line
of business: the integrated manufacture and sale of packaging materials, boxes
and containers for industrial and consumer markets. No single customer accounts
for more than 10% of total net sales.

Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities

The Company records its
derivatives in accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities.” The Statement requires the Company to
recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the balance
sheet at fair value. It further provides criteria for derivative instruments to
be designated as fair value, cash flow or foreign currency hedges and
establishes respective accounting standards for reporting changes in the fair
value of the derivative instruments. The

F-

2.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

gains or
losses resulting from adjusting the derivative instruments to fair value are
recorded in net income or accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”),
as appropriate.

The
Company has historically

used derivative instruments to manage interest
costs and the risk associated with changing interest rates. The Company’s
objectives for holding derivatives are to minimize the risks using the most
effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impacts of these exposures. As of December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company was not a party to any derivative instruments.

New Accounting
Pronouncements

In September 2006,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued “SFAS” No. 158, “Employers’
Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—an
amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R).”  SFAS No. 158 requires plan sponsors of
defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans (collectively, “postretirement
benefit plans”) to recognize the funded status of their postretirement benefit
plans in the statement of financial position, measure the fair value of plan
assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the fiscal year end statement
of financial position, and provide additional disclosures. These requirements
are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006, with the
exception of the requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as
of the plan sponsor’s fiscal year-end. This requirement is effective for fiscal
years ending after December 15, 2008. On December 31, 2006, the
Company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158.
The effect of adopting SFAS No. 158 on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet
at December 31, 2006 has been included in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements. SFAS No. 158 did not have an effect on the Company’s balance
sheet at December 31, 2005. The Company is assessing the remaining provision of
SFAS No. 158 to determine the impact that the adoption of those provisions
may have on its results of operations. See Note 6 for further discussion of the
effect of adopting SFAS No. 158 on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.

In September 2006,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.”  SFAS No. 157 clarifies the principle
that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would
use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy
that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. Under the
standard, fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within
the fair value hierarchy. This Statement is effective for fiscal years beginning
after November 15, 2007. The Company is assessing SFAS No. 157 and
has not yet determined the impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will
have on its results of operations.

In September 2006,
the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin
(“SAB”) Topic 1N, “Financial Statements - Considering the Effects of Prior Year
Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
Statements” ( SAB 108). SAB 108 provides interpretive guidance on how the
effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be
considered in quantifying a current year misstatement. The SEC staff believes
that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an
income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in
quantifying a misstatement that, when all relevant quantitative and qualitative
factors are considered, is material. SAB 108 was effective for fiscal years
ending after November 15, 2006. The Company’s financial position, results
of operations or cash flows will only be impacted by SAB 108 if it has a prior
year misstatement in its financial statements.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff
Position (“FSP”) No. AUG AIR-1, “Accounting for Planned Major
Maintenance Activities.”  This FSP
prohibits the use of the accrue-in-advance method of accounting for planned
major maintenance activities in annual and interim financial reporting periods
and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The
implementation of FSP No. AUG AIR-1 will not have any impact on the
Company’s financial position or full year results of operations or cash flows.
The Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the
first, second and third quarters of 2006 will be restated to account for the
impact of FSP No. AUG AIR-1 as if it had been adopted on January 1, 2006.

In June 2006, the FASB
issued Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes,” an interpretation of SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,”
to create a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax
positions. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing
a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being
recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on
derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting
in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company will adopt FIN 48
as of January 1, 2007, as required. 
The cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 will be recorded in
retained earnings and other accounts as applicable. The Company expects that
the adoption of FIN 48 will increase retained earnings by $3 million
to $5 million, with a corresponding decrease in long-term liabilities.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

In October 1999, the
Company adopted a long-term equity incentive plan, which provides for grants of
stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and performance
awards to directors, officers and employees of PCA, as well as others who
engage in services for PCA. Option awards granted to officers, employees and
directors have contractual lives of seven or ten years. Options granted to
officers and employees vest ratably over a three- or four-year period, whereas
options granted to directors vest immediately. The plan, which will terminate
on October 19, 2009, provides for the issuance of up to 6,550,000 shares
of common stock. As of December 31, 2006, options or restricted stock for
5,378,982 shares have been granted. Forfeitures are added back to the pool
of shares of common stock available to be granted at a future date.

Prior to January 1,
2006, the Company accounted for its equity incentive plan under the recognition
and measurement provisions of Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related Interpretations, as
permitted by “SFAS” No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” No
stock option-based stock compensation cost was recognized in the Statements of Income
prior to January 1, 2006 as all stock options granted under the plan had
an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on
the date of grant. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair
value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,”
using the modified-prospective-transition method. Under that transition method,
stock compensation cost recognized in 2006 includes: (a) compensation cost
for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not vested as of January 1,
2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the
original provisions of SFAS No. 123, and (b) compensation cost
for all share-based payments granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based
on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of
SFAS No. 123(R). Results for prior periods have not been restated.

As a result of adopting SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1,
2006, the Company’s income before income taxes for the year ended December 31,
2006, was $3,273,000 lower and the Company’s net income for the

F-


Packaging Corporation of America

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION (Continued)

same period was $1,988,000 lower, than if it had
continued to account for share-based compensation under APB No. 25. Basic
and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2006 were
both $0.02 lower than if the
Company had continued to account for share-based compensation under APB No. 25.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the
Company presented all tax benefits of deductions resulting from share-based
payment arrangements as operating cash flows in the Statements of Cash Flows.
SFAS No. 123(R) requires the cash flows resulting from the tax
benefits from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for
those share awards (excess tax benefits) to be classified as financing cash
flows. The excess tax benefit of $2,885,000 classified as a financing cash
inflow for the year ended December 31, 2006 would have been classified as
an operating cash inflow if the Company had not adopted SFAS No. 123(R).

As a result of adopting SFAS No 123(R), unearned
compensation previously recorded in stockholders’ equity was reclassified
against additional paid in capital on January 1, 2006. All stock-based
compensation expense not recognized as of December 31, 2005 and
compensation expense related to post 2005 grants of stock options and
amortization of restricted stock will be recorded directly to additional paid
in capital.

Compensation expense for stock
options and restricted stock recognized in the Statements of Income for the
year ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was as follows:

Note that the above pro forma disclosure is provided
for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 because employee stock
options were not accounted for using the fair-value method during that period.

The Company uses the
Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of each
option grant as of the date of grant. Expected volatilities are based on
historical volatility of the Company’s common stock. The expected life of the
option is estimated using historical data pertaining to option exercises and
employee terminations. Separate groups of employees that have similar
historical exercise behavior are considered separately for estimating the
expected life. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury yields in
effect at the time of grant. The estimated weighted-average fair values of and
related assumptions for options granted were as follows:

respectively. As of December 31, 2006, there was $3,310,000 of total
unrecognized compensation costs related to non-vested stock option awards
granted under the Company’s equity incentive plan. That cost is expected to be
recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years.

During 2003, the Company began
granting shares of restricted stock to certain of its employees and directors.
Restricted stock awards granted to employees vest at the end of a three- or
four-year period, whereas restricted stock awards granted to directors vest at
the end of a six-month period. The fair value of restricted stock is determined
based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. The
Company is recognizing compensation expense associated with restricted stock
awards ratably over their vesting periods. A summary of the Company’s

EMPLOYEE
BENEFIT PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

In connection with the acquisition from Pactiv, PCA
and Pactiv entered into a human resources agreement which, among other items,
granted PCA employees continued participation in the Pactiv pension plan for a
period of up to five years following the closing of the acquisition for an
agreed upon fee.

Effective January 1, 2003, PCA adopted a
mirror-image pension plan for eligible hourly employees to succeed the Pactiv
pension plan in which PCA hourly employees had participated though December 31,
2002. The PCA pension plan for hourly employees recognizes service earned under
both the PCA plan and the prior Pactiv plan. Benefits earned under the PCA plan
are reduced by retirement benefits earned under the Pactiv plan through December 31,
2002. All assets and liabilities associated with benefits earned through December 31,
2002 for hourly employees and retirees of PCA were retained by the Pactiv plan.

Effective May 1, 2004, PCA adopted a
grandfathered pension plan for certain salaried employees who had previously
participated in the Pactiv pension plan pursuant to the above mentioned human
resource agreement. The benefit formula for the new PCA pension plan for
salaried employees is comparable to that of the Pactiv plan except that the PCA
plan uses career average base pay in the benefit formula in lieu of final
average base pay. The PCA pension plan for salaried employees recognizes
service earned under both the PCA plan and the prior Pactiv plan. Benefits
earned under the PCA plan are reduced by retirement benefits earned under the
Pactiv plan through April 30, 2004. All assets and liabilities associated
with benefits earned through April 30, 2004 for salaried employees and
retirees of PCA were retained by the Pactiv plan.

PCA maintains a supplemental executive retirement plan
(“SERP”), which augments pension benefits for eligible executives (excluding
the CEO) earned under the PCA pension plan for salaried employees. Benefits are
determined using the same formula as the PCA pension plan but in addition to
counting

F-

6.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
(Continued)

career average base pay,
the SERP also recognizes bonuses and any pay earned in excess of IRS qualified
plan compensation limits. Benefits earned under the SERP are reduced by
benefits paid from the PCA pension plan and any prior qualified pension and
SERP benefits earned under the Pactiv plan.

PCA also maintains a separate supplemental executive
retirement benefit for its CEO which will provide a supplemental pension
benefit calculated on the basis of the following formula: (annual salary +
bonus) x (years of service) x (0.0167), where “years of service” equals years
of service with PCA + five years. The benefit is payable in a lump sum, upon
separation from service.

PCA also provides certain
medical benefits for retired salaried employees and certain medical and life
insurance benefits for certain hourly employees. For salaried employees, the plan
covers employees retiring from PCA on or after attaining age 58 who have had at
least 10 years of full-time service with PCA after attaining age 48. For
hourly employees, the postretirement medical coverage, where applicable, is
available according to the eligibility provisions in effect at the employee’s
work location. Per the human resources agreement referred to above, Pactiv
retained the liability relating to retiree medical and life benefits for PCA
employees who had retired on or before April 12, 1999 or who were eligible
to retire within two years of that date. On January 1, 2003, the Company
adopted a new plan design for salaried employees incorporating annual dollar
caps in determining the maximum amount of employer contributions made towards the
total cost of postretirement medical coverage.

Adoption of SFAS No. 158

On December 31, 2006, the Company adopted the
recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158.  SFAS No. 158 required the Company to
recognize the funded status (i.e., the difference between the fair value of
plan assets and the projected benefit obligation) of its pension and
postretirement plans in the December 31, 2006 balance sheet, with a
corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of
tax.  The adjustment to accumulated other
comprehensive income at adoption represents the net unrecognized actuarial
losses and unrecognized prior service costs, all of which were previously netted
against the plans’ funded status in the Company’s balance sheet pursuant to the
provisions of SFAS No. 87.  These amounts
will be subsequently recognized as net periodic pension cost pursuant to the
Company’s historical accounting policy for amortizing such amounts.  Further, actuarial gains and losses that
arise in subsequent periods and are not recognized as net periodic pension cost
in the same periods will be recognized as a component of other comprehensive
income.  These amounts will be
subsequently recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost on the same
basis as the amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income at
the adoption of SFAS No. 158.

The incremental effects of adopting the provisions of
SFAS No. 158 on the Company’s balance sheet at December 31, 2006 are presented
in the following table.  The adoption of
SFAS No. 158 had no effect on the Company’s consolidated statement of
income for the year ended December 31, 2006, or for any prior period presented,
and it will not effect the Company’s operating results in future periods.  Had the Company not been required to adopt
SFAS No. 158 at December 31, 2006, it would have recognized an additional
minimum liability pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 87. The effect of
recognizing the additional minimum liability is included in the table below in
the column labeled “Prior to Adopting of SFAS No. 158.”

No pay-related benefits are provided under the hourly
pension plan. PCA uses a September 30 measurement date for all of its
benefit plans.

During
the year ended December 31, 2006, PCA recorded pension plan expense of $22.8 million and made pension
contributions of $22.1 million. PCA currently expects to record pension
plan expense of $22.7 million
in 2007 and make pension contributions of $19.7 million.

Our
funding policy is to contribute to the plans amounts necessary to satisfy the
funding requirements of applicable laws and regulations. Pension plans’ assets
were invested in the following classes of securities at September 30, 2006
and 2005:

Percentage

of Fair Value



Equity securities


%


%

Debt securities


%


%

Other


%


%

Our investment policy is to invest more heavily in
equity securities than debt securities, with a liquidity requirement sufficient
to cover at least three months of benefit payment obligations.

The return on pension plan assets reflects the
expected long-term rates of return for the categories of investments currently
held in the plan as well as anticipated returns for additional contributions
made in the future. The expected long-term rate of return is adjusted when
there are fundamental changes in expected returns on the plan investments.

The discount rate assumptions used to calculate the
present value of pension and postretirement benefit obligations reflect the
rates available on high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments on September 30
of each year. The rate of compensation increase is another significant
assumption used for pension accounting and is determined by the Company based
upon annual reviews.

In determining net pension and postretirement benefit
costs, we have elected to amortize prior service cost on a straight-line basis
over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive
benefits under the plans. A 10% corridor is used to determine the amount of the
unrecognized net gain or loss to be amortized. The excess, if any, of the
unrecognized net gain or loss over 10% of the greater of the projected benefit
obligation or the market-related value of plan assets is amortized over the

average remaining service
period until retirement for active participants and included in the net
periodic benefit cost.

As of September 30, 2006, the Company assumed
health care cost trend rates were 9.00% for 2007, 8.00% for 2008, 7.00% for
2009, 6.00% for 2010 and 5.00% for 2011 and thereafter. As of September 30,
2005, the Company assumed health care cost trend rates for its postretirement
benefit plans were 8.00% in 2006, 7.00% in 2007, 6.00% in 2008, and 5.00% in
2009 and thereafter. As of September 30, 2004, the Company assumed health
care cost trend rates for its postretirement benefit plans were 10.00% for
2005, 9.00% for 2006, 8.00% for 2007, 7.00% for 2008, 6.00% for 2009 and 5.00%
for 2010 and thereafter.

Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by
one percentage point would increase the 2006 postretirement benefit obligation
by approximately $1.2 million and would increase the 2006 net
postretirement benefit cost by approximately $0.2 million. Decreasing the
assumed health care cost trend rate by one percentage point would decrease the
2006 postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $1.1 million and
would decrease the 2006 net postretirement benefit cost by approximately $0.2 million.

DEBT (Continued)

On July 7, 2003, PCA entered into a senior
unsecured credit facility that provides for a $100.0 million revolving credit
facility, including a $35.0 million subfacility for letters of credit, and a
$50.0 million term loan. The senior credit facility expires in 2008.

On July 21, 2003, PCA closed its offering and
private placement of $150.0 million of 4


¤


% five-year
senior notes and $400.0 million of 5


¤


% ten-year senior
notes. On July 22, 2003, PCA used the net proceeds from the offering,
together with the borrowings under the senior credit facility and cash on hand,
to repurchase $546.4 million, or 99.3%, of its then outstanding 9


¤


% senior
subordinated notes. The remaining senior subordinated notes were repurchased on
April 1, 2004 at a premium of $0.2 million.

The instruments governing PCA’s indebtedness contain
covenants that limit the ability of PCA and its subsidiaries to enter into sale
and leaseback transactions, incur liens, enter into certain transactions with
affiliates, merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or otherwise
dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company. They also
require PCA to comply with certain financial covenants, including the ratio of
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to interest
expense, the ratio of debt to total capitalization, and minimum net worth
levels. A failure to comply with these restrictions could lead to an event of
default, which could result in an acceleration of such indebtedness. At December 31,
2006, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.

(2008), $0 (2009-2011) and $400.0 million (2012 and thereafter).

Interest payments in connection with the Company’s
debt obligations for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
amounted to $38.2 million, $35.8 million, and $34.2 million,
respectively.

On November 29, 2000, the Company established an
on-balance sheet securitization program for its trade accounts receivable. To
effectuate this program, the Company formed a wholly owned limited purpose
subsidiary, Packaging Credit Company, LLC (“PCC”), which in turn formed a
wholly owned, bankruptcy-remote, special-purpose subsidiary, Packaging
Receivables Company, LLC (“PRC”), for the purpose of acquiring receivables from
PCC. Both of these entities are included in the consolidated financial
statements of the Company. Under this program, PCC purchases on an ongoing
basis substantially all of the receivables of the Company and sells such
receivables to PRC. PRC and lenders established a $150.0 million
receivables-backed revolving credit facility (“Receivables Credit Facility”)
through which PRC obtains funds to purchase receivables from PCC. The
receivables purchased by PRC

are
and will be solely the property of PRC. In the event of liquidation of PRC, the
creditors of PRC would be entitled to satisfy their claims from PRC’s assets
prior to any distribution to PCC or the Company. Credit available under the
receivables credit facility is on a borrowing-base formula. As a result, the
full amount of the facility may not be available at all times. At December 31,
2006, $109.0 million was outstanding and $41.0 million was available
for additional borrowing under the receivables credit facility. The highest
outstanding principal balance under the receivables credit facility during 2006
was $109.0 million. On October 6, 2006, PCA renewed the receivables
credit facility for an additional one-year term, expiring on October 5,
2007.

STOCKHOLDERS’
EQUITY

On May 16, 2001, the
Company announced a $100.0 million common stock repurchase program. PCA
may continue to repurchase shares from time to time under this program. Through
December 31, 2003, the Company repurchased 5,195,600 shares of common
stock for $88.8 million. All repurchased shares were retired prior to December 31,

.

No shares of common stock
were repurchased under this program in 2006, 2005 or 2004.

On December 21, 2005, the Company completed a
secondary offering of its common stock pursuant to a registration statement
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 9, 2005. The
selling stockholder, PCA Holdings LLC, sold 17,825,000 shares of
common stock of the Company, which included 2,325,000 shares pursuant to
the underwriters’ exercise in full of their over-allotment option. All of these
shares were sold at an initial price to the public market of $21.50 per
share, and the selling stockholder received proceeds, net of the underwriting
discount, of $20.69 per share. The Company did not sell any shares in, or
receive any proceeds from, the secondary offering.

Concurrent with the
closing of the secondary offering on December 21, 2005, the Company
entered into a common stock repurchase agreement with PCA Holdings LLC. Pursuant
to the repurchase agreement, the Company purchased 4,500,000 shares of common
stock directly from PCA Holdings LLC at the initial price to the public net of
the underwriting discount, for $20.69 per share, the same net price per share
received by PCA Holdings LLC in the secondary offering. These shares were
retired on December 21, 2005.

Litigation

PCA is a party to various
legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. These legal actions
cover a broad variety of claims spanning our entire business. As of the date of

these legal actions will, individually or in the aggregate, have a material
adverse effect on our financial position, or results of operations or cash
flows.

COMMITMENTS AND
CONTINGENCIES (Continued)

Environmental Liabilities

In April 1998, the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) finalized a new Clean Air and Water Act commonly
referred to as the Cluster Rules, which govern all pulp and paper mill
operations, including those at our mills. The Cluster Rules affect our
allowable discharges of air and water pollutants. PCA and its competitors are
required to incur costs to ensure compliance with these new rules. During 2006,
PCA spent $1.1 million to complete PCA’s projects related to Cluster Rule
requirements at PCA’s four mills. As a result, the Company does not anticipate
any further capital expenditures related to ensuing compliance with the Cluster
Rules. From 1997 through 2006, we spent approximately $39.2 million on Cluster Rule compliance to meet Clean
Air Act requirements. Total capital costs for environmental matters, including
Cluster Rule compliance, were $4.8 million
for 2006. We currently estimate 2007 environmental capital expenditures will be
$8.6 million

.

The potential costs for various environmental matters
are uncertain due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible cleanup
costs, the complexity and evolving nature of governmental laws and regulations
and their interpretations, and the timing, varying costs and effectiveness of
alternative cleanup technologies. From January 1994 through
December 2006, remediation costs at our mills and corrugated plants
totaled about $3.2 million.
As of December 31, 2006, we maintained an environmental reserve of
$6.1 million relating to on-site landfills (see Note 12) and surface
impoundments as well as ongoing and anticipated remedial projects. Liabilities
recorded for environmental contingencies are estimates of the probable costs
based upon available information and assumptions. Because of these
uncertainties, however, PCA’s estimates may change. As of the date of this
filing, we believe that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental
expenditures and asset retirement obligations above the $6.1 million
accrued as of December 31, 2006, will have a material impact on our
financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

In connection with the
sale to PCA of its containerboard and corrugated products business, Pactiv
agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites
associated with pre-closing off-site waste disposal and all environmental
liabilities related to a closed landfill located near our Filer City mill.

12.

ASSET
RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

Asset retirement
obligations consist primarily of landfill capping and closure and post-closure
costs. PCA is legally required to perform capping and closure and post-closure
care on the landfills. In accordance with SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for
Asset Retirement Obligations,” PCA recognizes the fair value of a these
liabilities as an asset retirement obligation for each landfill and capitalizes
that cost as part of the cost basis of the related asset. The liability is
accreted to its estimated value over time, and the related assets are
depreciated on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. Upon settlement
of the liability, PCA will recognize a gain or loss for any difference between
the settlement amount and the recorded liability.

2005 and 2004, respectively. PCA did not receive any dividends from STV in
2006.

In April 2005 and December 2004, STV sold to
other parties approximately 90,000 acres and 150,000 acres, respectively, of
timberland previously owned and managed by STV that were under the supply
agreement with PCA. STV will continue to manage the timberlands for the new
buyers. In connection with the sale, PCA entered into new supply agreements
with the buyers related to the acreage sold and continues to buy pulpwood from
both STV and the buyers. After both sales, STV currently owns approximately 52,000
acres of land, including timberlands and higher beneficial use properties,
located primarily in southern Georgia and northern Florida.

Currently, PCA purchases
pulpwood directly from STV for its Valdosta mill in accordance with the terms
of a fiber supply agreement between the two companies which expires December 31,
2017. The price of pulpwood in this agreement is

purchased $3.3 million and $4.1 million of pulpwood for its Valdosta,
Georgia mill from STV during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. PCA
purchased $22.6 million of pulpwood for its Counce, Tennessee and
Valdosta, Georgia mills from STV during the year ended December 31, 2004.

In June 2004, PCA sold a portion of its interest
in STV for $2.0 million and recognized a pre-tax gain of $2.0 million.

ACQUISITIONS

During the second quarter of 2006, PCA acquired a
sheet plant in Miami, Florida for $4.3 million. This acquisition expanded
the Company’s presence in southern Florida. The purchase method of accounting
was used to account for the acquisition. Goodwill of $2.9 million (which
is deductible for income tax purposes) was recorded in connection with the
acquisition. Net sales and total assets of the plant acquired were not material.
Operating results of the plant subsequent to the date of acquisition are
included in the Company’s operating results.

During the second quarter of 2005, PCA acquired a full
line corrugated plant in Jackson, Mississippi, a specialty sheet plant in St.
Louis, Missouri, and a graphics packaging and display manufacturing plant in
Olive Branch, Mississippi for $48.7 million. These plants expanded PCA’s
presence in geographic markets where PCA did not have any plant locations. The
purchase method of accounting was used to account for the acquisition of these
plants. Goodwill of $30.5 million (which is deductible for income tax
purposes) and $2.4 million of intangible assets were recorded in
connection with the acquisition. The intangible assets include customer lists
and relations. Net sales and total assets of the plants acquired were not
material. Operating results of the plants subsequent to the date of acquisition
are included in the Company’s operating results.

During the first quarter
of 2004, Packaging Corporation of Illinois, a wholly owned subsidiary of PCA,
acquired a corrugated plant in Chicago, Illinois for $38.4 million. This
acquisition expanded PCA’s capabilities in high quality graphics packaging and
displays and increased PCA’s presence in the Chicago market. The purchase
method of accounting was used to account for the acquisition. Goodwill of

the sawmill had net sales of $5.7 million. The sawmill had net sales of $8.7
million and $10.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and
2004, respectively.

In February 2004, PCA
sold its hardwood sawmill in Selmer, Tennessee and received $1.0 million
in proceeds and recognized a $0.2 million pre-tax gain. In 2004, through
the date of the sale of the facility, the sawmill had net sales of $0.1 million.

Notes to Financial Statements

December 31, 2004 and 2003

NOTE


SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

The Company

—Southern
Timber Venture, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, was formed during 2000 immediately prior to the acquisition of
approximately 388,000 acres of timberland in the Southeastern United States for
$275 million. Its primary purpose is to manage the timberlands and to grow and harvest the timber using state of the
art forest and timber management principles.

Revenue Recognition

—Timber
sales are recognized when legal ownership or the risk of loss passes to the purchaser and the
quantity sold is determinable.
For delivered sales, the risk of loss passes when the timber is delivered to
the customer. Revenues are determined
by multiplying actual harvest
volumes by contractually agreed-upon prices negotiated with the purchasers.
Other sales are recognized when earned.

Revenue from Packaging Corporation of America, a
related

party with
whom the Company has a supply agreement, represented 68% of timber sales in
2004 and 55% in 2003 (see Note 7).

The Company also generates income from the leasing of
hunting rights on the land it owns.

Leases are renewed annually by the
lessees and income is recognized in the period in which it is earned.

Cash Equivalents

—

For purposes of the
statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid debt
instruments purchased with

a

maturity of three
months or less to be cash equivalents.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

—

In the normal course
of business, the Company extends credit to its customers on a short-term basis.
Based upon management’s assessment of the Company’s aging of receivable
balances and each customer’s individual credit quality, no allowance for
doubtful accounts has been made at either fiscal year end 2004 or 2003. If
circumstances change (i.e. an unexpected material adverse change in major customer’s ability to meet
its financial obligations to us), our estimates of the recoverability of
amounts due could be reduced by a material amount and the allowance for
doubtful accounts and related bad expense would increase

by

the same amount.

Estimates

—The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions.
These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the
date of the financial statements
as well
as reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Timber and Timberlands

—Timber
and timberlands are stated at cost less accumulated depletion for timber previously
harvested. The company capitalizes timber and timberland purchases and
reforestation costs and other costs associated with the planting and growing of
timber, such as site preparation, growing or purchases of seedlings, planting,
fertilization, herbicide application and the
thinning of tree stands to improve
growth. Timber carrying costs, such as real
estate taxes, insect control, wildlife control are expensed as incurred.

Costs attributable to timber harvested, or

depletion, are charged against income as
trees are harvested. Depletion rates are determined based on the
relationship between net carrying value of the timber and total timber volume
estimated to be available over the harvest cycle. Net carrying value of the
timber and timberlands is used to compute the gain or loss in connection with real
estate sales.

NOTE


SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Concentrations of Credit Risk

—At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had cash
deposits on hand in financial institutions which
exceeded the financial institution insurable limit provided by the applicable
guarantee agency by $4.6 million
and $4.5 million, respectively.

Fair Value of Financial
Statements

—The carrying amounts for cash
and temporary cash investments approximate their fair values. The carrying
amounts of the Company’s borrowings under its credit facilities and long-term
debt also approximate the fair values based on current rates for similar debt.

NOTE


FACTORS AFFECTING THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS

Factors
Affecting Supply and Demand

—

The

results of
operations of the Company are
and will continue to be affected by cyclical supply and demand factors related to the
forest products industry. The supply of timber is significantly affected by land use management policies of the U.S. government, which in recent years
have limited, and are likely to continue to limit, the amount of timber offered
for sale by certain U.S. government
agencies. Such government agencies historically have been major suppliers of
timber to the U.S.
forest products industry, but timber sales by such
government agencies currently are
at historically low levels. Any reversal
of government land use management policies that substantially increases sales
of timber by U.S.
government agencies could significantly reduce prices for logs, lumber
and other forest products. The demand for logs and manufactured wood products
also has been, and in the future
can be
expected to be, subject to cyclical fluctuations. Such demand is primarily
affected by the level of housing starts, repair and remodeling activity,
industrial wood product use, competition from nonwood products, and the demand
for pulp and paper products. These factors
are subject to fluctuations due to changes in economic conditions,
interest rates, population growth, weather conditions, competitive pressures and other
factors. Any decrease
in the level of industry demand for logs and wood products generally can be expected to result in lower net
sales, operating income and cash flow of the Company.

Harvesting Limitation

—Net
sales, operating income and cash
flow of the Company are
dependent on the confirmed ability of the Company to harvest timber at adequate levels. Weather
conditions, timber growth cycles, and regulatory requirements associated with
protection of wildlife and water
resources may restrict harvesting of the Company’s timberlands. From time to
time, proposals have been made
in state legislatures that would regulate the level of timber harvesting.
Timber harvests also may be affected by various natural factors, including
damage by fire, insect infestation, disease, prolonged drought, severe weather
conditions and other causes. The effects of
such natural disasters may be particularly damaging to young timber.
Although damage from such natural causes usually is localized and affects only
a limited percentage of the timber, there can be no assurance that any damage affecting the Company’s timberlands
will in fact
be so limited.
Consistent with industry practice, the Company does not maintain
insurance coverage with respect to damage to its timberlands. Any of the above factors that
materially limits the ability of the Company to harvest timber could have a
significant adverse impact on the net sales, operating income and cash flow of
the Company.

Committed Product Purchases by Packaging Corporation
of America; Possible inability to develop new markets

—The Company derived approximately 68%
of its net sales for 2004 from sales of timber directly to the Packaging
Corporation of America. For a description of the terms of
sales of timber by the Company to the Packaging Corporation of
America, see Note 7. While management of the Company believes that
there is significant demand for the Company’s timber products from users
other than the

F-


SOUTHERN TIMBER VENTURE, LLC

Notes to Financial Statements

December 31, 2004 and 2003

NOTE


FACTORS
AFFECTING THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS (Continued)

Packaging Corporation of
America, no assurance can be given that such demand will be equivalent to the Company’s
planned

annual harvests. Any excess
supply of timber that results
from the inability of the Company to sell its products to users other than the Packaging Corporation of America could result in lower prices
for the Company’s products, which could have a material adverse effect on the
net sales, operating income and cash flow of the Company.

Environmental Regulations

—The
Company is subject to extensive and changing federal, state and local
environmental laws and regulations, the provisions and enforcement of which are
expected to become more stringent in the
future. The Company is subject to regulation under the Endangered Species Act (the ESA),
the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide
Act, as well as similar state laws
and regulations. Violations of various
statutory and regulatory programs that apply to the Company’s operations can
result in civil penalties, remediation expenses, natural resource damages, potential
injunctions, cease and desist orders, and criminal penalties.

Some environmental statutes impose strict liability,
rendering a person liable for

environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on
the part of such person. There can be no assurance
that such laws or future legislation or administrative or judicial
action with respect to protection of the environment will not adversely affect
the Company.

The ESA and

counterpart state legislation protect species threatened with possible
extinction. A number of species indigenous to the Company’s timberlands have been and in the future may be protected under
these laws. Protection
of endangered
and threatened species may
include restrictions on timber harvesting,
road building and other silvicultural activities on private, federal and
state land
containing the affected species.

NOTE


DIVESTITURES

During the year ended December

31, 2003, the Company sold
approximately 8,000 acres of land for approximately $10.3 million resulting in a recognized gain of approximately
$3.6 million.

In December 2004, the
Company sold approximately 153,000 acres

of timberlands in Mississippi, Tennessee and Alabama
for approximately $158.4 million,
resulting in a gain of
approximately $86.6 million.
Approximately $55.4
million of the proceeds
of the sales were used to reduce the Company’s debt. See Note 7 for discussion of the
affect of the divestiture on the company’s supply agreement.

NOTE


INDEBTEDNESS

During 2001 in connection with the original purchase
of the timberlands by Southern Timber Venture,

LLC, the Company borrowed $120 million of fixed rate notes payable
and $80 million of variable rate notes payable from John Hancock Financial Services. The
unpaid principal balance was $85,000,000 and $140,380,000 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company is subject to a variety of

environmental and pollution control laws and
regulations in all jurisdictions in which it operates. As is the case with other
companies in similar industries, the Company faces exposure from actual or
potential claims and legal
proceedings involving environmental matters. Liability
insurance in effect during the year provides very limited coverage for
environmental matters.

The Company has entered
into

a commitment
to sell approximately 90,000 acres of timberland in Mississippi, Alabama and
Tennessee for approximately $91.4 million in
March 2005. This sale
will reduce the Company’s obligations under a supply agreement which is discussed in the Note 7. The amount of the reduction in supply agreement has not been determined.

sale, the Company is obligated

to supply PCA’s mill in Counce, Tennessee with a minimum of
160,000 tons of softwood per year and a minimum of 10,800 tons of hardwood per
year. The Company’s obligation to supply 100,000 tons of softwood per year to

Prior to the sale
in December 2004, the Company was obligated to supply PCA’s mill in
Counce, Tennessee

with 400,000 to 500,000 tons of softwood per
year and 35,000 to 112,000 tons of hardwood per year.

Based on the terms of the supply agreement, PCA
advances the Company funds quarterly on anticipated purchases from the Company.
The amount of this advance is 40% of anticipated sales for pine and 25% for
hardwood. Amounts advanced to the Company

are reflected in the accompanying balance sheet as a current liability. The supply
agreement also provides a predetermined
price for logs delivered to PCA
mills.

The Company has also entered into a management agreement
with Claw Forestry Services, LLC (Claw), which

is owned by
a member of one of the Company’s members. Under the terms of the management
agreement, the
Company is obligated to
pay Claw a management fee based on $8 per acre per year for timberland under
management. The fee is paid in monthly increments based on one twelfth of the annual
amounts expected to be earned. In exchange for such payment, Claw provides the
Company certain timberland
management services including, but not limited to, the management and marketing
of the Company’s timber products. The Company paid Claw $2,616,291 in 2004 and $2,666,600 in 2003
for management fees.

The Company also paid Claw commissions based on 2% of

paid in 2004 and 2003 were paid to John Hancock.
