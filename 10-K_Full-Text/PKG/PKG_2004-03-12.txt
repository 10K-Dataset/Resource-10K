INDEX


PART I

Item
1.   BUSINESS

General

Packaging Corporation of
America, or PCA, is the sixth largest producer of containerboard and corrugated
products in the United States, based on production capacity as reported in the
Pulp & Paper 2002 North American Fact Book. With 2003 net sales of
$1.7 billion, PCA produced about 2.2 million tons of containerboard,
of which about 80% of the tons produced was consumed in our corrugated products
manufacturing plants, 11% was sold to domestic customers and 9% was sold to the
export market. Our corrugated products manufacturing plants sold about
28.1 billion square feet (BSF) of corrugated products.

Containerboard
Production and Corrugated Shipments

The 2.2 million tons of containerboard that we
produced in 2003 included 1.4 million tons of kraft linerboard produced at
our mills located in Counce, Tennessee and Valdosta, Georgia and
0.8 million tons of semi-chemical corrugating medium produced at our mills
located in Tomahawk, Wisconsin and Filer City, Michigan. We currently lease the
cutting rights to approximately 115,000 acres of timberland located near our
Counce and Valdosta mills. We also have supply agreements on about 600,000 of
the 800,000 acres of timberland we sold during 1999 and 2000.

Our converting operations
produce a wide variety of corrugated packaging products, including conventional
shipping containers used to protect and transport manufactured goods,
multi-color boxes and displays with strong visual appeal that help to
merchandise the packaged product in retail locations. In addition, we are a
large producer of meat boxes and wax-coated boxes for the agricultural
industry.

Corporate
Developments

On April 12, 1999, Pactiv Corporation, formerly
known as Tenneco Packaging Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of
Tenneco Inc., sold its containerboard and corrugated products business to
PCA, an entity formed by Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC, a private equity
investment firm, in January 1999. The business was sold for
$2.2 billion, consisting of $246.5 million in cash and the assumption
of $1,760.0 million of debt incurred by Pactiv immediately prior to the contribution.
Pactiv retained a 45% common equity interest, or 193,500 shares, in PCA valued
at $193.5 million. PCA Holdings LLC, an entity organized and controlled by
Madison Dearborn, acquired the remaining 55% common equity interest, or 236,500
shares, in PCA for $236.5 million in cash, which was used to finance in
part the transactions.

The share amounts discussed above are prior to a
220-for-1 stock split which occurred in October 1999. Including the effect
of the 220-for-1 split, Pactiv received 42,570,000 shares and PCA Holdings, LLC
received 52,030,000 shares.


The financing of
the transactions consisted of (1) borrowings under a new
$1,469.0 million senior credit facility for which J.P. Morgan
Securities Inc. and BT Alex. Brown Incorporated (the predecessor to
Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown) were co-lead arrangers, (2) the offering of
$550.0 million of 9


¤


%
senior subordinated notes due 2009, and $100.0 million of 12


¤


% senior
exchangeable preferred stock due 2010, (3) a cash equity investment of
$236.5 million by PCA Holdings LLC and (4) an equity investment by
Pactiv valued at $193.5 million. As required by their terms, the
$550.0 million of senior subordinated notes and $100.0 million of
senior exchangeable preferred stock issued in the April 12, 1999 transactions
were exchanged for publicly registered securities in the same amounts in a
registered exchange offer completed in October 1999.

The senior credit facility was entered into to finance
in part the transactions and to pay related fees and expenses and to provide
future borrowings to PCA for general corporate purposes, including working
capital. The senior credit facility initially consisted of three term loan
facilities in an original aggregate principal amount of $1,219.0 million
and a revolving credit facility with up to $250.0 million in availability.
Effective December 14, 1999, PCA elected to reduce its availability under
the revolving credit facility from $250.0 million to $150.0 million.

On January 28, 2000, PCA became a publicly traded
company with the initial public offering of its common stock. In the offering,
Pactiv sold 35,000,000 shares and PCA sold 11,250,000 new shares of common
stock, both at an offering price of $12.00 per share. PCA used its net proceeds
to redeem all of the outstanding senior exchangeable preferred stock on March 3,
2000.

PCA completed the refinancing of its
$735.0 million senior secured debt and $150.0 million senior secured
revolving credit facility on June 29, 2000. Completion of the refinancing
eliminated a $226.5 million term loan, and reduced PCA’s average effective
interest rate on its senior secured term debt by approximately 100 basis
points.

On November 29, 2000, PCA established an
on-balance sheet securitization program for its trade accounts receivable. To
effectuate this program, PCA formed a wholly-owned limited purpose subsidiary,
Packaging Credit Company, LLC, or PCC, which in turn formed a wholly-owned,
bankruptcy-remote, special-purpose subsidiary, Packaging Receivables Company,
LLC, or PRC, for the purpose of acquiring receivables from PCC. Both of these
entities are included in the consolidated financial statements of PCA. Under
this program, PCC purchases on an ongoing basis all of the receivables of PCA
and sells such receivables to PRC. PRC and lenders established a
$150.0 million receivables-backed revolving credit facility through which
PRC obtains funds to purchase receivables from PCC. The receivables purchased
by PRC are and will be solely the property of PRC. In the event of a liquidation
of PRC, the creditors of PRC would be entitled to satisfy their claims from PRC’s
assets prior to any distribution to PCC or PCA. Credit available under the
receivables credit facility is on a borrowing-base formula. As a result, the
full amount of the facility may not be available at all times. On October 13,
2003, PCA renewed the receivables credit facility for an additional three-year
term. This facility will terminate on October 10, 2006. As of December 31,
2003, $109.0 million was outstanding and $41.0 million was available
for additional borrowing under the receivables credit facility. The highest
outstanding principal balance under the receivables credit facility during
fiscal 2003 was $113.0 million.

During 2001, Pactiv sold approximately 6,160,240 shares
of PCA common stock, which represented its remaining ownership interest.

On June 23, 2003, PCA launched a tender offer for
any and all of its outstanding $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9


¤


%
senior subordinated notes due 2009. In connection with the tender offer, PCA
also solicited consents to adopt amendments to the indenture under which the 9


¤


%
notes were issued to eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants
and several of the event of default provisions in the indenture. The consent
solicitation expired on July 7, 2003 and the tender offer expired


on July 21, 2003. Holders
of approximately $546.3 million, or 99.3%, in aggregate principal amount of 9


¤


%
notes consented to the proposed amendments and tendered their notes in the
tender offer.

On July 7, 2003, PCA repaid all borrowings under
its then-existing senior credit facility. This facility was replaced with a new
senior unsecured credit facility that provides for a new $100.0 million
revolving credit facility, including a $35.0 million subfacility for letters of
credit, and a new $50.0 million term loan. The new senior credit facility
closed on July 21, 2003, and it expires in 2008. PCA’s total borrowings
under the senior credit facility as of December 31, 2003 consisted of $39.0
million of term loans.

On July 21, 2003, PCA closed its offering and
private placement of $150.0 million of 4


¤


% five-year
notes and $400.0 million of 5


¤


%
ten-year notes. On July 22, 2003, PCA used the net proceeds from the
offering, together with the borrowings under the new senior credit facility and
cash on hand, to purchase $546.4 million, or 99.3%, of its outstanding 9


¤


%
senior subordinated notes that were validly tendered and accepted for payment
in the tender offer that expired at midnight on July 21, 2003. As a result
of these transactions, PCA recorded a one-time charge of approximately $76.6
million ($46.7 million after-tax) in the third quarter of 2003. The $76.6
million charge includes the tender offer premium of $55.9 million and a $17.4
million non-cash charge for the write-off of deferred financing fees due to the
early extinguishment of debt, which are included in interest expense, and fees and
expenses of $3.3 million, which are included in corporate overhead. As required
by their terms, the $150.0 million of 4


¤


% five-year
notes and $400.0 million of 5


¤


%
ten-year notes were exchanged for publicly registered securities in the same
amounts in a registered exchange offer completed in December 2003. The
remaining senior subordinated notes are callable beginning April 1, 2004
at 104.8125%. On March 1, 2004, the Company delivered an irrevocable
notice to the trustee to redeem such notes on April 1, 2004.

On October 13, 2003, PCA announced its intentions
to begin paying a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share, or $0.60 per
share annually, on its common stock. The first quarterly dividend of $0.15 per
share was paid on January 15, 2004 to shareholders of record as of December 15,
2003.

On February 10, 2004
Packaging Corporation of Illinois, a wholly owned subsidiary of Packaging
Corporation of America, acquired the assets of Acorn Corrugated Box Company
(Acorn) for approximately $38 million. Acorn, a producer of high quality
graphics packaging and displays with annual sales of $45 million, is located in
Bedford Park, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, Illinois.

Corrugated products plants tend to be located in close
proximity to customers to minimize freight costs. The corrugated products
industry consists of approximately 650 companies in the United States.

Containerboard, which includes both linerboard and
corrugating medium, is the principal raw material used to manufacture
corrugated products. Linerboard is used as the inner and outer facings, or


liners, of corrugated
products. Corrugating medium is fluted and laminated to linerboard in
corrugator plants to produce corrugated sheets. The sheets are subsequently
printed, cut, folded and glued in corrugator plants or sheet plants to produce
corrugated products.

Containerboard may be manufactured from both softwood
and hardwood fibers, as well as from recycled fibers from used corrugated and
waste from converting operations. Kraft linerboard is made predominantly from
softwoods like pine. Semi-chemical corrugating medium is made from hardwoods
such as oak. The finished paper product is wound into large rolls, which are
slit to size as required by converters and shipped to them.

Linerboard is made in a
range of grades or basis weights. The most commonly used basis weight of linerboard
is 35 lb., although linerboard is produced in weights that vary from under 26
lb. to over 90 lb. Basis weight represents the weight in pounds per thousand
square feet of linerboard. Producers also market linerboard by performance
characteristics, appearance and color.

PCA Operations and
Products

Our two linerboard mills can manufacture a broad range
of linerboard grades ranging from 26 lb. to 96 lb. Our two semi-chemical
corrugating medium mills can manufacture grades ranging in weight from
21 lb. to 47 lb. All four of our mills have completed an extensive
independent review process to become ISO 9002 certified. ISO 9002 is an international
quality certification that verifies a facility maintains and follows stringent
procedures for manufacturing, sales and customer service.

Counce.

Our Counce, Tennessee mill is
one of the largest linerboard mills in the United States. Its production
capacity is approximately 980,000 tons per year. In 2003, we produced 963,000
tons of kraft linerboard on two paper machines at Counce. We produced a broad
range of basis weights from 26 lb. to 90 lb. The mill also produces a
variety of performance and specialty grades of linerboard.

Valdosta.

Our Valdosta, Georgia mill is
a kraft linerboard mill that has a production capacity of approximately 430,000
tons per year. In 2003, our single paper machine at Valdosta produced 425,000
tons of kraft linerboard. Valdosta produces linerboard ranging from 33 lb. to
90 lb.

Tomahawk.

Our Tomahawk, Wisconsin mill
is the second largest corrugating medium mill in the United States with
production capacity of 556,000 tons per year. In 2003, we produced 553,000 tons
of semi-chemical corrugating medium on three paper machines, one of which is
among the largest corrugating medium machines in the world. These machines
produce a broad range of basis weights from 23 lb. to 40 lb. Our Tomahawk mill
also produces a variety of performance and specialty grades of corrugating
medium.

Filer City.

Our Filer City, Michigan mill
is a semi-chemical corrugating medium mill currently operating with two
machines with a production capacity of 292,000 tons. In 2003, we produced
291,000 tons of corrugating medium. In July 1998, we shut down one machine
at Filer City. Mill production capacity at Filer City is 362,000 tons a year if
we run all three paper machines. Filer City produces corrugating medium grades
ranging in basis weight from 23 lb. to 40 lb.

We operate 66 corrugated manufacturing operations, a
technical and development center, five regional graphic design centers, a
rotogravure printing operation and a complement of packaging supplies and
distribution centers. Of the 66 manufacturing facilities, 40 operate as
combining operations, commonly called corrugated plants, that manufacture
corrugated sheets and finished corrugated containers. The remaining 26
manufacturing facilities, commonly called sheet plants, purchase combined
sheets primarily produced at PCA’s combining operations and manufacture finished
corrugated containers. The five graphic design centers are located in
Cincinnati, Ohio; Dallas, Texas; Cranbury, New Jersey; Salisbury, North
Carolina and South Gate, California.


Our corrugated manufacturing operations are spread
throughout the United States. Each corrugator plant serves a market radius that
typically averages 150 miles. Our sheet plants are generally located in close
proximity to our larger corrugator plants, which enables us to offer additional
services and converting capabilities such as small volume and quick turnaround
items.

We produce a wide variety
of products ranging from basic corrugated shipping containers to specialized
packaging such as wax-coated boxes for the agriculture industry. We also have
multi-color printing capabilities to make high-impact graphics boxes and
displays that offer customers more attractive packaging.

Timberland

We currently lease the cutting rights to approximately
115,000 acres of timberland located near our Counce and Valdosta mills.
Virtually all of the acres under cutting rights agreements are located within
100 miles of our mills, which results in lower wood transportation costs and
provides a secure source of wood fiber. Most of these leased cutting rights
agreements have terms with over 15 years remaining.

During 1999 and 2000, PCA sold about 800,000 acres of
timberland. As part of the timberland sale agreements, we entered into supply
arrangements covering about 600,000 acres of the total acres sold. We also
retained a one-third equity ownership interest in 385,000 acres sold to
Southern Timber Venture, LLC in 2000.

In addition to the timberland we manage ourselves, our
Forest Management Assistance Program provides professional forestry assistance
to private timberland owners to improve harvest yields and to optimize their
harvest schedule. We have managed the regeneration of approximately 125,000
acres by supplying pine seedlings. In exchange for our expertise, we are given
the right of first refusal over timber sales from those lands. These private
lands include over 215,000 acres of timberland. We expect to harvest
approximately 85,000 cords of wood from these forests annually.

PCA also participates in
the Sustainable Forestry Initiative, which is organized by the American Forest
and Paper Association. This initiative is aimed at ensuring the long-term
health and conservation of America’s forestry resources. Activities include
limiting tree harvest sizes, replanting harvest acreage, participating in flora
and fauna research and protecting water streams.

Solid Wood Facilities

During 2003, we owned and operated three sawmills
located in Ackerman and Fulton, Mississippi and Selmer, Tennessee. During 2003,
these three sawmills sold 125 million board feet of lumber used to make
furniture and building products. We also have an air-dry yard operation in
Burnsville, Mississippi that holds newly cut lumber while it dries.

On February 2, 2004
we sold our Selmer, Tennessee sawmill. This facility produced and sold 10
million board feet of lumber in 2003 with net sales of $4.5 million.

Sales and Marketing

Our corrugated products are sold through a direct
sales and marketing organization. Sales representatives and a sales manager at
each converting operations facility serve local and regional accounts.
Corporate account managers serve large national accounts at multiple customer
locations. Additionally, our graphic design centers maintain an on-site
dedicated graphics sales force. General marketing support is located at our
corporate headquarters.

Our containerboard sales group is responsible for the
sale of linerboard and corrugating medium to our corrugator plants, to other
domestic customers and to the export market. This group handles order


processing for all
shipments of containerboard from our mills to our corrugator plants. These
personnel also coordinate and execute all containerboard trade agreements with
other containerboard manufacturers.

In addition to direct
sales and marketing personnel, we utilize support personnel that are new
product development engineers and product graphics and design specialists.
These individuals are located at both the corrugator plants as well as the
graphic design centers.

Distribution

Our corrugated products are usually delivered by truck
due to our large number of customers and their demand for timely service.
Shipping costs represent a relatively high percentage of our total costs due to
the high bulk of corrugated products. As a result, our converting operations
typically service customers within a 150 miles radius.

Containerboard produced in
our mills is shipped by rail or truck. Our individual mills do not own or
maintain outside warehousing facilities. We do use some third-party warehouses
for short-term storage.

Customers

PCA’s corrugated products
group sells to over 8,300 customers in over 15,000 locations. About 70% of our
corrugated products customers are regional and local accounts, which are
broadly diversified across industries and geographic locations. The remaining
30% of our customer base consists primarily of national accounts, or those
customers with a national presence. These customers typically purchase
corrugated products from several of our box plants throughout the United
States.

Major Raw Materials
Used

Fiber supply.

Fiber is the single largest
cost in the manufacture of containerboard. PCA consumes both wood fiber and
recycled fiber in our containerboard mills. We have no 100% recycled mills, or
those mills whose fiber consumption consists solely of recycled fiber. To
reduce our fiber costs, we have invested in processes and equipment to ensure a
high degree of fiber flexibility. Our mills have the capability to shift a
portion of their fiber consumption between softwood, hardwood and recycled
sources. With the exception of our Valdosta mill, our other mills can utilize
some recycled fiber in their containerboard production. Our ability to use
various types of virgin and recycled fiber helps mitigate the impact of changes
in the prices of various fibers. Our corrugated products plants generate
recycled fiber as a by-product from the manufacturing process, which is sold to
our mills directly or through trade agreements. During 2003, our containerboard
mills consumed approximately 601,000 tons of recycled fiber and our corrugated
converting operations generated approximately 194,000 tons of recycled fiber.
As a result, PCA was a net recycled fiber buyer of 407,000 tons, or 18% of our
total fiber requirements, an increase of 2% from 2002. The 2% increase in
recycled fiber use was primarily to reduce the use of higher cost wood fiber.

Energy supply.

Energy at the mills is
obtained through purchased electricity or through various fuels, which are
converted to steam or electricity on-site. Fuel sources include coal, natural
gas, oil, internally produced and purchased bark and by-products of the
containerboard manufacturing and pulping process. These fuels are burned in
boilers to produce steam. Steam turbine generators are used to produce
electricity. To reduce our mill energy cost, we have invested in processes and
equipment to ensure a high level of purchased fuel flexibility. Historically,
natural gas and fuel oil have shown more price volatility than coal and
purchased bark. During 2003, 11.9 million M


BTU’s (million BTU’s),
or approximately 70% of our mills’ purchased fuel needs, were from purchased
bark and coal, historically our two lowest cost purchased fuels. For the same
period, our mills consumed about 1.5 million M


BTU’s of natural gas
(9% of the mills’ total purchased fuels) and 2.7 million M


BTU’s of
fuel oil (17% of the mills’ total purchased fuels).


Our two, kraft linerboard mills at Counce and Valdosta
generate approximately 70% of their fuel requirements from their own
by-products. Approximately 45% to 50% of the electricity consumed by our four
mills is generated on-site.

PCA’s corrugated plants
each have a boiler that produces steam which is used by the corrugator. The
majority of these boilers burn natural gas, although some also have the ability
to burn fuel oil. During 2003, PCA’s corrugated products plants consumed
approximately 1.6 million M


BTU’s of natural gas.

Competition

Corrugated products are produced by about 650 U.S.
companies operating approximately 1,400 plants. Most corrugated products are
custom manufactured to the customer’s specifications. Corrugated producers
generally sell within a 150-mile radius of their plants and compete with
other corrugated producers in their local market. In fact, the Fibre Box
Association tracks industry data by 47 distinct market regions.

The larger, multi-plant integrated companies may also
solicit larger, multi-plant customers who purchase for all of their facilities
on a consolidated basis. These customers are often referred to as national or
corporate accounts.

Corrugated products businesses seek to differentiate
themselves through pricing, quality, service, design and product innovation. We
compete for both local and national account business and we compete against
producers of other types of packaging products. On a national level, our
competitors include Georgia-Pacific Corporation, International Paper Company,
Smurfit-Stone Container Corporation, Temple-Inland Inc. and Weyerhaeuser
Company. However, with our strategic focus on local and regional accounts, we
believe we compete as much with the smaller, independent converters as with the
larger, integrated producers.

Our principal competitors
with respect to sales of our containerboard produced but not consumed at our
own corrugated products plants are a number of large, diversified paper
companies, including Georgia-Pacific Corporation, International Paper Company,
Smurfit-Stone Container Corporation, Temple-Inland Inc. and Weyerhaeuser
Company, as well as other regional manufacturers. Containerboard is generally
considered a commodity-type product and can be purchased from numerous
suppliers.

Employees

As of December 31, 2003, we had approximately
7,900 employees. Approximately 2,100 of these employees were salaried and
approximately 5,800 were hourly. Approximately 75% of our hourly employees are
represented by unions. Our unionized employees are represented primarily by the
Paper, Allied Industrial, Chemical, Energy Workers International Union, the
International Association of Machinists, the Graphic Communications
International Union and the United Steel Workers of America (USWA).

The contract for our unionized mill employees at our
Valdosta, Georgia kraft linerboard mill expired in September 2003, and we
are currently operating under the expired contract. Contracts for unionized
mill employees at our three remaining containerboard mills expire between October 2005
and June 2007. Contracts for unionized converting plant employees expire
between June 2004 and August 2009. We are currently in negotiations
to renew or extend any union contracts that have recently expired or are
expiring in the near future.

During 2003 we experienced
no work stoppages. In 2001, we experienced a one-month strike at our Filer City
mill with the USWA. The strike was settled, and the mill’s current agreement
expires in May 2006. Prior to this incident we had experienced no
instances of significant work stoppages in the previous 15 years. We
believe we have satisfactory relations with our employees.


Environmental Matters

Compliance with
environmental requirements is a significant factor in our business operations.
We commit substantial resources to maintaining environmental compliance and
managing environmental risk. We are subject to, and must comply with, a variety
of federal, state and local environmental laws, particularly those relating to
air and water quality, waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and
groundwater. The most significant of these laws affecting us are:

1.     Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)

2.     Clean
Water Act (CWA)

3.     Clean Air
Act (CAA)

4.     The
Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know-Act (EPCRA)

5.     Toxic
Substance Control Act (TSCA)

6.     Safe
Drinking Water Act (SDWA)

We believe that we are currently in material compliance
with these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations. Because
environmental regulations are constantly evolving, we have incurred, and will
continue to incur, costs to maintain compliance with these and other
environmental laws. For the year ended December 31, 2003 we spent
approximately $12.4 million to comply with the requirements of these and other
environmental laws. For the years ended December 31 2002 and 2001 the
costs of environmental compliance were approximately $11.5 million and $11.4
million, respectively. We work diligently to anticipate and budget for the
impact of applicable environmental regulations and do not currently expect that
future environmental compliance obligations will materially affect our business
or financial condition.

In April 1998, the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) finalized a new Clean Air and Water Act commonly
referred to as the Cluster Rules, which govern all pulp and paper mill
operations, including those at our mills. Over the next several years, the
Cluster Rules will affect our allowable discharges of air and water
pollutants. As a result, PCA and its competitors are required to incur costs to
ensure compliance with these new rules. From 1997 through 2003, we spent
approximately $34.3 million on Cluster Rule compliance to meet Clean
Air Act requirements. Total capital costs for environmental matters, including
Cluster Rule compliance, were $16.5 million for 2003. We currently
estimate 2004 environmental capital expenditures will be $10.0 million

,

of which $0.9 million of the expenditures are to meet
Cluster Rule requirements. Our current spending projections to complete
all Cluster Rule compliance requirements at our four mills is about
$12.2 million, which will be spent between 2004 and 2006.

As is the case with any industrial operation, we have
in the past incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or
groundwater contamination. From 1994 through 2003, remediation costs at our
mills and converting plants totaled about $3.1 million. We do not believe
that any on-going remedial projects are material in nature. As of December 31,
2003, we maintained an environmental reserve of $4.3 million, which
includes funds relating to onsite landfill and surface impoundments as well as
on-going and anticipated remedial projects. Of the $4.3 million reserve, $3.3
million is reserved for our landfill obligations, which are accounted for in
accordance with SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations”.
We believe these reserves are adequate.

We could also incur environmental liabilities as a
result of claims by third parties for civil damages, including liability for
personal injury or property damage, arising from releases of hazardous
substances or contamination. We are not aware of any material claims of this
type currently pending against us.


As a part of the April 12, 1999 transactions,
Pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites
associated with pre-closing offsite waste disposal. Pactiv also retained
environmental liability for a closed landfill located near the Filer City mill.

As of this filing, we
believe that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental
expenditures above the $4.3 million accrued as of December 31, 2003 will
have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

292,000 tons, and to 2,258,000 tons for our total mill containerboard system.

We currently own all four containerboard mills and 43 of
our corrugated manufacturing operations. We also own two sawmills, an
air-drying yard, one warehouse and miscellaneous other property, which includes
sales offices and woodlands forest management offices. These sales offices and
woodlands forest management offices generally have one to four employees and
serve as administrative offices. PCA leases the space for two corrugated
plants, 21 sheet plants, five regional design centers, and numerous other
distribution centers, warehouses and facilities. The equipment in these leased
facilities is, in virtually all cases, owned by PCA except for forklifts and
other rolling stock which is generally leased.

We lease the cutting rights to approximately 115,000
acres of timberland located near our Counce and Valdosta mills. Most of these
cutting rights agreements have terms with over 15 years remaining.

We currently lease space
for our executive and administrative offices in Lake Forest, Illinois under a
lease expiring in January 2005. We currently believe that our owned and
leased space for facilities and properties are sufficient to meet our operating
requirements for the foreseeable future.

Item 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On May 14, 1999, PCA was named as a defendant in
two Consolidated Class Action Complaints which alleged a civil violation
of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. The suits, then captioned

Winoff Industries, Inc. v. Stone Container Corporation

,
MDL No. 1261 (E.D. Pa.) and

General Refractories Co.
v. Gaylord Container Corporation

, MDL No. 1261 (E.D. Pa.), name
PCA as a defendant based solely on the allegation that PCA is successor to the
interests of Tenneco Packaging Inc. and Tenneco Inc., both of which were also
named as defendants in the suits, along with nine other linerboard and
corrugated sheet manufacturers. The complaints allege that the defendants,
during the period October 1, 1993 through November 30, 1995,
conspired to limit the supply of linerboard, and that the purpose and effect of
the alleged conspiracy was to artificially increase prices of corrugated
containers and corrugated sheets, respectively. On November 3, 2003,
Pactiv (formerly known as Tenneco Packaging), Tenneco and PCA entered into an
agreement to settle the class action lawsuits. The settlement agreement, which
is subject to court approval, provides for a full release of all claims against
PCA as a result of the class action lawsuits. A hearing is set for March 2004
regarding the settlement. Approximately 160 plaintiffs opted out of the class
and together filed about ten direct action complaints in various federal courts
across the country. All of the opt-out complaints make allegations against the
defendants, including PCA, substantially similar to those made in the class
actions. The settlement agreement does not cover these direct action cases.
These actions have almost all been consolidated as

In re
Linerboard

, MDL 1261 (E.D. Pa.) for pretrial purposes. Fact
discovery is proceeding and is currently set to close September 30, 2004. As
of the date of this filing, we believe it is not reasonably


possible that the outcome
of this litigation will have a material adverse effect on our financial
position or results of operations.

PCA is also party to
various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business. These
legal actions cover a broad variety of claims spanning our entire business. As
of the date of this filing, we believe it is not reasonably possible that the
resolution of these legal actions will, individually or in the aggregate, have
a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

$0.15 per common share payable to shareholders of record as of March 15,
2004 with a payment date of April 15, 2004. The Company expects to pay
regular cash dividends, although there is no assurance as to future dividends
because they depend on future earnings, capital requirements and financial
condition. There are currently no restrictions on the amount of dividends we

SELECTED FINANCIAL
DATA

The
following table sets forth the selected historical financial and other data of
PCA and the containerboard and corrugated products business of Pactiv
Corporation (the “Group” or “Predecessor”). The information contained in the
table should be read in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and the historical
consolidated financial statements of PCA, including the notes thereto,
contained elsewhere in this report.

(1)

There was no activity for PCA from January 25,
1999, its date of inception, through April 11, 1999.

(2)

Earnings per share through April 11, 1999 has been
calculated using the historical earnings of the Predecessor and the number of
common shares resulting from the closing of the acquisition on April 12,
1999 (94,600,000 common shares after giving effect to the 220-for-one stock
split). For the PCA historical period from April 12, 1999 to
December 31, 1999, earnings available to common stockholders includes a
reduction for $9,296 of preferred stock dividends. For the year ended
December 31, 2000, earnings available to common stockholders includes reductions
of $2,371 of preferred stock dividends and $16,266 for the redemption of PCA’s
12 3/8% preferred stock. PCA did not declare any dividends on its common shares
in 1999, 2000, 2001 or 2002.


For the period
January 1 through April 11, 1999, basic and diluted earnings per
share are the same because there are no potentially dilutive securities. For
the PCA historical period from April 12, 1999 to December 31, 1999
and for the years ended December 31, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 diluted earnings
per share includes the dilutive effect, if any, of outstanding options and non-vested
stock. This dilutive effect is calculated using the treasury stock method.

(3)

On October 13,
2003, PCA announced its intentions to begin paying a quarterly cash dividend of
$0.15 per share, or $0.60 per share annually, on its common stock. The first
quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share was paid on January 15, 2004 to
shareholders of record as of December 15, 2003.

(4)

Total long-term
obligations include long-term debt, the current maturities of long-term debt
and redeemable preferred stock. The amount excludes amounts due to Pactiv or
other Tenneco affiliates as part of the Predecessor’s interdivision account or
other financing arrangement.

(5)    In accordance with SFAS No. 145, the
early extinguishment of debt that was classified as extraordinary for the years
2000 ($11,060,000) and 2001 ($609,000) in PCA’s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2002, was reclassified to income (loss)
before cumulative effect of accounting change.

Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion
of historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in
conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto which
appear elsewhere in this report.

Overview

In connection with the April 12,
1999 transactions, PCA acquired the containerboard and corrugated products
business of Pactiv Corporation (the “Group”), formerly known as Tenneco
Packaging Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Tenneco, Inc. The Group
operated prior to April 12, 1999 as a division of Pactiv, and not as a
separate, stand-alone entity. From its formation in January 1999 and
through the closing of the acquisition on April 12, 1999, PCA did not have
any significant operations.

The April 12, 1999
acquisition was accounted for using historical values for the contributed
assets. Purchase accounting was not applied because, under the applicable
accounting guidance, a change of control was deemed not to have occurred as a
result of the participating veto rights held by Pactiv after the closing of the
transactions under the terms of the stockholders agreement entered into in
connection with the transactions.

Results of Operations

The
historical results of operations of PCA are set forth below:


Year Ended December 31,
2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002

Net Sales

Net sales decreased by $0.3 million, or 0.0%, for
the year ended December 31, 2003 from the year ended December 31,
2002. Net sales increased due to improved sales volumes compared to 2002,
however, this increase was entirely offset by lower sales prices.

Total corrugated products
volume sold increased 2.1% to 28.1 billion square feet in 2003 compared to
27.5 billion square feet in 2002. On a comparable shipment-per-workday
basis, corrugated products sales volume increased 1.7% in 2003 from 2002.
Shipments-per-workday is calculated by dividing our total corrugated products
volume during the year by the number of workdays within the year. The lower
percentage increase was due to the fact that 2003 had one more workday (252
days), those days not falling on a weekend or holiday, than 2002 (251 days).
Containerboard sales volume to external domestic and export customers decreased
6.7% to 445,000 tons for the year ended December 31, 2003 from 477,000
tons in the comparable period of 2002.

Income Before Interest Expense and Income Taxes
(Operating Income)

Operating income decreased by $48.4 million, or
33.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to 2002. Included in
income before interest and taxes for the twelve months ended December 31,
2003 is a $3.3 million charge for fees and expenses related to the Company’s
debt refinancing which was completed in July 2003, and a fourth quarter
charge of $16.0 million to settle certain benefits related matters with Pactiv
Corporation dating back to April 12, 1999 when PCA became a stand-alone
company. The remaining $29.1 million decrease in income before interest
and taxes was primarily attributable to decreased sales prices ($13.4 million),
and increased costs of energy ($7.9 million) and wood costs ($4.8 million).

Gross profit decreased $26.8 million, or 8.2%,
for the year ended December 31, 2003 from the year ended December 31,
2002. Gross profit as a percentage of sales declined from 18.7% of sales in
2002 to 17.2% of sales in the current year primarily due to the sales price
decreases and energy and wood cost increases described above.

Corporate overhead for the year ended December 31,
2003, increased by $5.5 million, or 13.5%, from the year ended December 31,
2002. The increase was primarily attributable to the fees and expenses related
to the debt refinancing ($3.3 million), increased depreciation and amortization
expense ($ 0.8 million) and an increase in pension costs ($0.7 million).

Selling and administrative expenses decreased
$2.9 million, or 2.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2003 from the
comparable period in 2002. The decrease was primarily the result of decreased
travel and meeting costs ($1.3 million), lower recruiting and relocation
expenses ($0.7 million), reduced salary costs ($0.5 million) and a reduction in
training costs ($0.5 million).

Other expense, net,
increased $19.1 million, or 236.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2003
compared to the year ended December 31, 2002 including the $16.0 million
charge discussed above for the settlement of benefit cost related matters with
Pactiv Corporation. In addition, the Company’s legal reserve increased $1.6
million during 2003 and the Company received lower dividend payments from
Southern Timber Venture, LLC ($1.2 million).

Interest Expense and Income Taxes

Interest expense increased in 2003 by
$54.1 million, or 79.9%, from the comparable period in 2002. This increase
included $73.3 million of expenses related to the Company’s debt refinancing,
which was completed in July 2003. The $73.3 million of expenses consisted
of $55.9 million paid in premiums for the


tender of the 9


¤


%
senior subordinated notes, and a $17.4 million non-cash charge for the
write-off of deferred financing fees related to the 9


¤


% notes and
PCA’s original revolving credit facility dated as of April 12, 1999 and
amended and restated as of June 29, 2000. Excluding the $73.3 million
charge, interest expense was $19.2 million lower than in 2002 as a result of
lower interest rates attributable to the Company’s July 2003 refinancing
and lower debt levels.

PCA’s
effective tax rate was 42.3% for the year ended December 31, 2003 and
37.9% for the year ended December 31, 2002. The 2003 increase in the tax
rate is due to stable permanent items over lower book income (loss). The tax
rates are higher than the federal statutory rate of 35.0% due to state income
taxes.

Year Ended December 31,
2002 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2001

Net Sales

Net sales decreased by $54.1 million, or 3.0%,
for the year ended December 31, 2002 from the year ended December 31,
2001. The decrease was primarily the result of decreased sales prices of
corrugated products and containerboard, partially offset by increased
corrugated products volume and slightly higher volume of containerboard sold to
third parties.

Total corrugated products
volume sold increased 3.5% to 27.5 billion square feet in 2002 compared to
26.5 billion square feet in 2001. On a comparable shipment-per-workday
basis, corrugated products sales volume increased 3.9% in 2002 from 2001. The
larger percentage increase was due to the fact that 2001 had one more workday
(252 days), those days not falling on a weekend or holiday, than 2002 (251
days). Containerboard sales volume to external domestic and export customers
increased 11.4% to 477,000 tons for the year ended December 31, 2002 from
428,000 tons in the comparable period of 2001.

Income Before Interest Expense and Income Taxes
(Operating Income)

Operating income decreased by $104.2 million, or
41.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to 2001. The decrease
was primarily the result of decreased sales prices ($97.8 million), increased
costs for recycled fiber at our containerboard mills ($10.9 million), higher
medical ($7.5 million) and pension ($2.3 million) costs and increased
depreciation expense ($7.9 million) which were only partially offset by
increased volume ($23.8 million).

Gross profit decreased $91.2 million, or 21.9%,
for the year ended December 31, 2002 from the year ended December 31,
2001. Gross profit as a percentage of sales declined from 23.2% of sales in
2001 to 18.7% of sales in 2002 primarily due to the sales price decreases
described above.

Corporate overhead for the year ended December 31,
2002, increased by $0.4 million, or 1.1%, from the year ended December 31,
2001.

Selling and administrative expenses increased $8.8 million,
or 7.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2002 from the comparable period
in 2001. The increase was primarily the result of increased benefit costs of $2.9
million, increased expenditures of $2.6 million for other general selling
related expenses which were individually insignificant, and an increase in
salary expense of $2.3 million.

Other expense, net,
increased $3.8 million, or 87.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2002
compared to the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase was primarily
due to an increase in the loss on disposal of assets of $3.3 million.

Interest Expense and Income Taxes

Interest expense decreased by $7.4 million, or
9.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2002 from the comparable period in
2001, primarily due to prepayments PCA made in 2001 and 2002 on the term loans


under its senior credit
facility and the receivables credit facility and a $1 million write-off in
deferred financing fees in 2001 due to the debt prepayments.

PCA’s effective tax rate
was 37.9% for the year ended December 31, 2002 and 38.7% for the year
ended December 31, 2001. The tax rate is higher than the federal statutory
rate of 35.0% due to state income taxes.

Liquidity and
Capital Resources

Operating Activities

Cash flow provided by operating activities increased
$4.9 million, or 2.0%, to $244.9 million, for the year ended December 31,
2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase was the
result of lower working capital requirements of $30.1 million, partially offset
by lower net income as previously described and decreased deferred income taxes
as a result of recording a deferred tax asset related to the 2003 tax net
operating loss. The lower working capital requirements were primarily driven by
higher accounts payable balances, lower prepaid expenses and other current
assets balance due to a federal income tax refund received during 2003,
partially offset by higher balances of accounts receivable related to strong fourth
quarter 2003 sales volumes and higher inventory balances in 2003.

Cash flow provided by
operating activities decreased $74.3 million, or 23.6%, to $240.0 million,
for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to the year ended December 31,
2001. The decrease was primarily due to lower net income, decreased deferred
income taxes, and higher working capital requirements. The increased working
capital requirements were primarily driven by higher accounts receivable
balances resulting from stronger sales volumes previously described, partially
offset by lower inventory levels and a smaller reduction of the accounts
payable balance than in 2001.

Investing Activities

Cash used for investing activities increased by
$8.3 million, or 7.6%, to $117.9 million, for the year ended December 31,
2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in cash
used for investing activities was primarily the result of increased
expenditures for property, plant and equipment of $5.8 million the acquisition
of the assets of one corrugated products plant for $3.1 million and $0.7 million
in expenditures to establish two small sheet plants. See Note 12 to our audited
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for
additional information regarding this acquisition.

Cash used for investing activities decreased by $25.3 million,
or 18.7%, to $109.6 million, for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared
to the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in cash used for
investing activities was primarily the result of decreased expenditures for
property, plant and equipment of $23.8 million, partially offset by the
acquisition for $4.8 million of a corrugated products plant in the second
quarter of 2001. See Note 12 to our audited consolidated financial statements
included elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding this
acquisition.

As of December 31,
2003, PCA had commitments for capital expenditures of $37.5 million. PCA
believes operating cash flow from continuing operations will be sufficient to
fund these commitments.

Financing Activities

Cash used for financing activities increased by $4.7
million, or 5.7%, to $86.2 million, for the year ended December 31, 2003
compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase was primarily
attributable to $94.1 million in debt prepayments in 2003 compared to $53.1
million in debt prepayments made during the comparable period in 2002. This was
partially offset by lower stock repurchases of $15.5 million that PCA made in
2003 compared to 2002 and higher proceeds received from stock option


exercises of $7.2 million
in 2003 compared to the same period in 2002. In addition, PCA also netted $14.0
million in proceeds from the debt refinancing described below.

In connection with the debt refinancing in July, PCA
received proceeds, net of discount, of $595.8 million from its notes offering
and new senior credit facility and $27.0 million from settlement of the
Treasury locks in July, which it used to complete the tender offer of its 9


¤


%
senior subordinated notes in the amount of $602.3 million, including the
premium. PCA also incurred financing costs in the amount of $6.9 million in
connection with the debt refinancing.

Cash used for financing activities decreased by
$23.3 million, or 22.2%, to $81.6 million, for the year ended December 31,
2002 compared to the year ended December 31, 2001, primarily attributable
to decreased prepayments made by PCA on its various debt agreements of $21.2
million and a decrease in expenditures to repurchase PCA common stock of $5.3
million.

On January 28, 2000, PCA became a publicly traded
company with an initial public offering of its common stock. On March 3,
2000, PCA used the net proceeds from the offering to redeem all of its
outstanding shares of 12


¤


%
senior exchangeable preferred stock due 2010.

PCA holds a 33


¤


% equity
ownership interest in Southern Timber Venture, LLC. In 2003 and 2002, PCA
received dividends from Southern Timber Venture, LLC of $1.2 million ($0.7
million after-tax) and $2.3 million ($1.4 million after-tax), respectively.

On November 29, 2000, PCA established an
on-balance sheet securitization program for its trade accounts receivable. To
effectuate this program, PCA formed a wholly-owned limited purpose subsidiary,
Packaging Credit Company, LLC, or PCC, which in turn formed a wholly-owned,
bankruptcy-remote, special-purpose subsidiary, Packaging Receivables Company,
LLC, or PRC, for the purpose of acquiring receivables from PCC. Both of these
entities are included in the consolidated financial statements of PCA. Under
this program, PCC purchases on an ongoing basis substantially all of the
receivables of PCA and sells such receivables to PRC. PRC and lenders
established a $150.0 million receivables-backed revolving credit facility
through which PRC obtains funds to purchase receivables from PCC. The
receivables purchased by PRC are and will be solely the property of PRC. In the
event of a liquidation of PRC, the creditors of PRC would be entitled to
satisfy their claims from PRC’s assets prior to any distribution to PCC or PCA.
Credit available under the receivables credit facility is on a borrowing-base
formula. As a result, the full amount of the facility may not be available at
all times. On October 31, 2003, PCA renewed the receivables credit facility for
an additional three-year term. This facility will terminate on October 10, 2006.
As of December 31, 2003, $109.0 million was outstanding and
$41.0 million was available for additional borrowing under the receivables
credit facility. The highest outstanding principal balance under the
receivables credit facility during fiscal 2003 was $113.0 million.

On June 23, 2003, PCA launched a tender offer for
any and all of its outstanding $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9


¤


%
senior subordinated notes due 2009. In connection with the tender offer, PCA
also solicited consents to adopt amendments to the indenture under which the 9


¤


%
notes were issued to eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants
and several of the event of default provisions in the indenture. The consent
solicitation expired on July 7, 2003 and the tender offer expired on July
21, 2003. Holders of approximately $546.3 million, or 99.3%, in aggregate
principal amount of 9


¤


%
notes consented to the proposed amendments and tendered their notes in the
tender offer.

On July 7, 2003, PCA repaid all borrowings under
its then-existing senior credit facility. This facility was replaced with a new
senior unsecured credit facility that provides for a new $100.0 million
revolving credit facility, including a $35.0 million subfacility for letters of
credit, and a new $50.0 million term loan. The new senior credit facility
closed on July 21, 2003, and it expires in 2008. PCA’s total borrowings
under the senior credit facility as of December 31, 2003 consisted of $39.0
million of term loans.

million charge includes the tender offer premium of $55.9 million and a $17.4
million non-cash charge for the write-off of deferred financing fees due to the
early extinguishment of debt, which are included in interest expense, and fees
and expenses of $3.3 million, which are included in corporate overhead. As

at 104.8125%. On March 1, 2004, the Company delivered an irrevocable notice to
the trustee to redeem these notes on April 1, 2004.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company does not have
any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2003 that would
require disclosure under SEC FR-67, “Disclosure in Management’s Discussion and
Analysis About Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual
Obligations.”

Contractual Obligations

The
following table summarizes PCA’s contractual obligations at December 31,
2003:

The above table excludes an unamortized debt discount
of $3.9 million at December 31, 2003 and PCA’s pension contributions for plan
years 2003 and 2004 of $9.3 million to be made in 2004. PCA currently does not have
any projections for future pension contributions beyond 2004.

The lease commitments, purchase commitments and
letters of credit are not reflected on PCA’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31,
2003. See Notes 6 and 9 to the audited consolidated financial statements for
additional information.

PCA’s primary sources of liquidity are net cash
provided by operating activities, borrowings under PCA’s senior revolving
credit facility, and additional borrowings under PCA’s receivables credit
facility. As of December 31, 2003, PCA had $141.0 million in unused
borrowing capacity under its existing credit


agreements. PCA’s primary
uses of cash are for capital expenditures, debt service and common stock
dividends, which it expects to be able to fund from these sources.

The
following table provides the outstanding balances and the weighted average
interest rates as of December 31, 2003 for each of PCA’s outstanding term
loans, the revolving credit facility and the receivables credit facility:

The above table excludes unamortized debt discount of $3.9
million at December 31, 2003. It also excludes the impact from the annual
cash interest payments of the settlement of the Treasury locks related to the
five- and ten- year notes of $27.0 million received in July 2003.

The borrowings under the senior revolving credit
facility are available to fund PCA’s working capital requirements, capital
expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The term loan must be repaid
in quarterly installments from July 2006 through 2008. The senior
revolving credit facility will terminate in July 2008. The receivables
credit facility will terminate in October 2006.

The instruments
governing PCA’s indebtedness contain financial and other covenants that limit,
among other things, the ability of PCA and its subsidiaries to:

·

enter
into sale and leaseback transactions,

·

incur
liens,

·

enter
into certain transactions with affiliates, or

·

merge
or consolidate with any other person or sell or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all of the assets of PCA.

These limitations could limit corporate and operating
activities.

In addition, we must maintain minimum net worth,
maximum leverage and minimum EBITDA to interest ratios under the senior credit
facility. A failure to comply with the restrictions contained in the senior
credit facility could lead to an event of default, which could result in an
acceleration of such indebtedness. Such an acceleration would also constitute
an event of default under the notes indenture and the receivables credit
facility.

PCA currently expects to incur capital expenditures of
$110.0 millionto $115.0 millionin
2004. These capital expenditures will be used primarily for maintenance
capital, cost reduction, business growth, and environmental compliance.

PCA believes that net cash
generated from operating activities and available cash-on-hand will be adequate
to meet its anticipated debt service requirements, capital expenditures, common
stock dividend payments and working capital needs for the next 12 months,
and that net cash generated from operating


activities
and amounts available under the senior revolving credit facility and additional
borrowings under its receivables credit facility will be adequate to meet its
anticipated debt service requirements, capital expenditures, common stock
dividend payments and working capital needs for the foreseeable future. PCA’s
future operating performance and its ability to service or refinance the notes
and to service, extend or refinance the credit facilities will be subject to
future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many
of which are beyond PCA’s control.

Environmental
Matters

We are subject to,
and must comply with, a variety of federal, state and local environmental laws,
particularly those relating to air and water quality, waste disposal and the
cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater. The most significant of these
laws affecting us are:

·

Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)

·

Clean
Water Act (CWA)

·

Clean
Air Act (CAA)

·

The
Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know-Act (EPCRA)

·

Toxic
Substance Control Act (TSCA)

·

Safe
Drinking Water Act (SDWA)

We believe that we are currently in material
compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and
regulations. Because environmental regulations are constantly evolving, we have
incurred, and will continue to incur, costs to maintain compliance with these
and other environmental laws. For the year ended December 31, 2003 we
spent approximately $ 12.4 million to comply with the requirements of these and
other environmental laws. For the years ended December 31 2002 and 2001
the costs of environmental compliance were approximately $11.5 million and
$11.4 million, respectively.

In addition, the EPA finalized the Cluster Rules which
govern pulp and paper mill operations, including those at the Counce, Filer
City, Valdosta and Tomahawk mills. Over the next several years, the Cluster Rules will
affect our allowable discharges of air and water pollutants, and require us to
spend money to ensure compliance with those new rules.

As is the case with any industrial operation, we have,
in the past, incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or
groundwater contamination, as required by the federal Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as the
federal “Superfund” law, and analogous state laws. Cleanup requirements arise
with respect to properties we currently own or operate, former facilities and
off-site facilities where we have disposed of hazardous substances. Under the
terms of the contribution agreement, Pactiv has agreed to retain all liability
for all former facilities and all sites associated with pre-closing off-site
waste disposal. Pactiv has also retained environmentally impaired real property
in Filer City, Michigan unrelated to current mill operations.

Because liability for
remediation costs under environmental laws is strict, meaning that liability is
imposed without fault, joint and several, meaning that liability is imposed on
each party without regard to contribution, and retroactive, we could receive
notifications of cleanup liability in the future and this liability could be
material. From January 1994 through December 2003, remediation costs
at our mills and converting plants totaled about $3.1 million. As of December 31,
2003, we maintained an environmental reserve of $4.3 million, which
includes funds relating to onsite landfills and surface impoundments as well as
on-going and anticipated remedial projects. Total capital costs for environmental
matters, including Cluster Rule compliance, were $16.5 million for
2003 and we currently estimate 2004 environmental capital expenditures will be
$10.0 million, of which $0.9 million of the expenditures are to meet
Cluster


Rule requirements.
As of this filing, we believe that it is not reasonably possible that future
environmental expenditures above the $4.3 million accrued as of
December 31, 2003 will have a material impact on our financial condition
and results of operations.

Impact of Inflation

PCA does not believe that
inflation has had a material impact on its financial position or results of
operations during the past three years.

Critical Accounting
Policies

Management’s discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these
financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we
evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories,
intangible assets, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, income taxes,
and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We believe the following
critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and
estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. For
a further discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies,
see Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included
elsewhere in this report.

Accounts Receivable—Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We evaluate the collectibility of our accounts
receivable based upon a combination of factors. In circumstances where we are
aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to
us (e.g., bankruptcy filings, substantial downgrading of credit sources), we
record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net
recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected.
For all other customers, we recognize reserves for bad debts consisting of 0.3%
for amounts less than 90 days past due and 30% for amounts more than
90 days past due based on our historical collection experience. If our
collection experience deteriorates (i.e., higher than expected defaults or an
unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its
financial obligations to us), our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due
us could be reduced by a material amount.

As of December 31,
2003, the balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve was
$5.3 million, compared to $5.8 million at December 31, 2002. Bad
debt expense in 2003 was $1.8 million, compared to $3.0 million in 2002.
The $1.2 million decreasewas primarily
attributable to one customer that filed for bankruptcy during 2002, resulting
in bad debt expense of $1.3 million

.

For the year
ended December 31, 2002 bad debt expense was $3.0 million compared to
$0.7 million in 2001. During 2002, $1.7 million of bad debt expense
was recorded related to three customers that filed for bankruptcy during the
year.

Inventory

We record our inventory at
the lower of cost or market. The estimated market value is based on assumptions
for future demand and related pricing. If actual market conditions are less
favorable than those projected by management, reductions in the value of
inventory may be required. Raw materials,


work in
process and finished goods are valued using the lower of last-in, first-out (“LIFO”)
cost or market method. Supplies and materials inventories are valued using a
moving average cost.

Derivatives

We have historically held derivative financial
instruments to hedge our interest rate risk associated with our variable rate
long-term debt. These derivatives qualified for hedge accounting as discussed
in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements. We do not
speculate in derivatives trading. Hedge accounting results when we designate and
document the hedging relationships involving these derivative instruments.
While we intend to continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting, if
hedges do not qualify as highly effective or if we did not believe that
forecasted transactions would occur, the changes in the fair value of the
derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings.

To hedge interest rate risk, interest rate collars are
used to protect against rising interest rates and simultaneously guarantee
minimum interest rates related to our variable rate debt. These instruments are
valued using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future
cash receipts and cash payments. The cash receipts and cash payments are based
on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observed market
interest rate curves. We have not changed our methods of calculating these fair
values or developing the underlying assumptions. The values of these
derivatives will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as
market conditions change. Information about the fair values, notional amounts,
and contractual terms of these instruments can be found in Notes 6 and 7 to our
audited consolidated financial statements and the section titled “Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.” included elsewhere in this
report.

In addition to the above
derivative financial instruments, we have other contracts covering a portion of
our purchases of natural gas and electricity that have the characteristics of
derivatives but are not required to be accounted for as derivatives. These
contracts for the physical delivery of these items qualify for the normal
purchases exception under SFAS No. 133 as we take physical delivery of the
item and use it in the production process. This exception is an election and,
if not elected, these contracts would be carried on the balance sheet at fair
value with changes in fair value reflected in income. PCA has elected the
normal purchases exception under SFAS No. 133. Additional information
regarding these contracts can be found in Note 9 to our audited consolidated
financial statements included elsewhere in this report.

Environmental Liabilities

PCA accounts for its retirement obligations related to
its landfills under SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations,” which became effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15,
2002. The Statement requires legal obligations associated with the retirement
of long-lived assets to be recognized at their fair value at the time that the
obligations are incurred. Upon initial recognition of a liability, that cost
should be capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and allocated to
expense over the useful life of the asset. The adoption of SFAS No. 143 on
January 1, 2003 did not have a material impact on PCA’s financial
statements.

The potential costs for various environmental matters
are uncertain due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible cleanup
costs, the complexity and evolving nature of governmental laws and regulations
and their interpretations, and the timing, varying costs and effectiveness of
alternative cleanup technologies. Liabilities recorded for environmental
contingencies are estimates of the probable costs based upon available
information and assumptions. Because of these uncertainties, however, our
estimates may change. We believe that any additional costs identified as
further information becomes available would not have a material effect on our
financial statements.

In connection with the
sale to PCA of the containerboard and corrugated products business of Pactiv
Corporation in April 1999, Pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all
former facilities and all sites


associated
with offsite waste disposal prior to April 12, 1999. Pactiv also retained the
environmental liability for a closed landfill located near the Filer City mill.

Revenue Recognition

PCA recognizes revenue as
title to the products is transferred to customers. Shipping and handling costs
are included in cost of sales. Shipping and handling billings to a customer in
a sales transaction are included in revenue. In addition, PCA offers volume
rebates to some of its customers. The total cost of these programs is estimated
and accrued as a reduction to revenue at the time of the respective sale.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets to be
held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully
recoverable. In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of any long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of
recoverability would be performed. If an evaluation were required, the
estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be
compared to the asset’s carrying amount to determine if a write-down to fair
value were required.

New Accounting
Standards

For a description of
changes in accounting principles affecting PCA, see Note 2 to PCA’s
audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.

Item 7A.   QUANTITIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT
MARKET RISK

PCA is exposed to the
impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market value of its
financial instruments. PCA periodically enters into derivatives in order to
minimize these risks, but not for trading purposes. As of December 31, 2003, PCA
did not have any derivatives.

Item 9.

CHANGES IN AND
DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES

There were no changes in
or disagreements with PCA’s accountants during 2003 or 2002.

Item 9A.   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

PCA’s management, under the supervision and with the
participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of PCA’s disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). 
The evaluation of PCA’s disclosure controls and procedures included a
review of the controls’ objectives and design, PCA’s implementation of the
controls and the effect of the controls on the information generated for use in
this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

During the quarter ended December 31, 2003, there were
no changes in internal controls over financial reporting that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, PCA’s internal control
over financial reporting.

Based upon their evaluation as of December 31, 2003,
PCA’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that
PCA’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that material
information relating to PCA is made known to management, including the Chief
Executive


Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, particularly during the periods when PCA’s
periodic reports are being prepared.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Board of Directors and Shareholders of Packaging
Corporation of America:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Packaging Corporation of America (the “Company”) as of December 31,
2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in
shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2003. Our audits also included the financial statement
schedule listed in the index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and
schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing
standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Packaging Corporation of
America at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

BASIS
OF PRESENTATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS

Packaging Corporation of America (“PCA” or the “Company”)
was incorporated on January 25, 1999 pursuant to the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware. PCA was formed to acquire the containerboard and
corrugated packaging products business (the “Group”) of Pactiv Corporation,
formerly known as Tenneco Packaging Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of
Tenneco Inc. PCA had no operations from the date of incorporation on January 25,
1999 to April 11, 1999.

On April 12, 1999, Pactiv Corporation sold its
containerboard and corrugated products business to PCA, an entity formed by
Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC, a private equity investment firm, in January
1999. The business was sold for $2.2 billion, consisting of
$246.5 million in cash and the assumption of $1,760.0 million of debt incurred
by Pactiv immediately prior to the contribution. Pactiv retained a 45% common
equity interest, or 193,500 shares, in PCA valued at $193.5 million. PCA
Holdings, LLC, an entity organized and controlled by Madison Dearborn, acquired
the remaining 55% common equity interest, or 236,500 shares, in PCA for
$236.5 million in cash, which was used to finance in part the
transactions. Because significant veto rights were retained by Pactiv, the
carryover basis of accounting was used and no goodwill was recognized. Fees of
$23.8 million were incurred as part of the Transactions and were recorded
as a charge to shareholders’ equity.

The share amounts discussed above are prior to a
220-for-1 stock split which occurred in October 1999. Including the effect of
the 220-for-1 split, Pactiv received 42,570,000 shares and PCA Holdings, LLC
received 52,030,000 shares.

On August 25, 1999, PCA Holdings, LLC and Pactiv
agreed that the acquisition consideration should be reduced as a result of a
post-closing price adjustment by $20.0 million. On September 23,
1999, Pactiv paid PCA $20.7 million, representing the $20.0 million
adjustment and $0.7 million of interest through the date of payment by
Pactiv.

The Company is comprised of mills and corrugated
products operations. The mill operations (the “Mills”) consist of two kraft
linerboard mills located in Counce, Tennessee, and Valdosta, Georgia, and two
medium mills located in Filer City, Michigan, and Tomahawk, Wisconsin. The
Company leases the cutting rights to approximately 115,000 acres of timberland
as of December 31, 2003. The Mills transfer the majority of their output
to PCA’s corrugated products operations (“Corrugated”).

PCA’s corrugated manufacturing operations consist of
66 corrugated products plants, with 40 operating as combining operations, or
corrugated plants, and 26 as sheet plants; a technical and development center; five
graphic design centers; a rotogravure printing operation and a complement of
packaging supplies and distribution centers. All plants are located in North
America. Corrugated plants combine linerboard and medium (primarily from PCA’s
mills) into sheets that are converted into corrugated shipping containers,
point-of-sale graphics packaging, point-of-purchase displays and other
specialized packaging. Sheet plants purchase sheets primarily from PCA
corrugated products plants to use in the finished corrugated products
converting process. The corrugated products manufacturing plants sell to
diverse customers primarily in North America.

As of December 31, 2003, we had approximately
7,900 employees. Approximately 2,100 of these employees were salaried and
approximately 5,800 were hourly. Approximately 75% of our hourly

employees are represented
by unions. Our unionized employees are represented primarily by the Paper,
Allied Industrial, Chemical, Energy Workers International Union, the
International Association of Machinists, the Graphic Communications
International Union and the United Steel Workers of America (USWA).

The contract for our
unionized mill employees at our Valdosta, Georgia kraft linerboard mill expired
in September 2003 and we are currently operating under the expired
contract. Contracts for unionized mill employees at our three remaining
containerboard mills expire between October 2005 and June 2007.
Contracts for unionized converting plant employees expire between June 2004 and
August 2009. We are currently in negotiations to renew or extend any union
contracts that have recently expired or are expiring in the near future.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

Basis of Consolidation

The accompanying
consolidated financial statements of Packaging Corporation of America include
all majority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been
eliminated. The Company has one joint venture that is carried under the equity
method.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents
include all cash balances and highly liquid investments with a maturity of
three months or less. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates
market.

Accounts Receivable

The collectibility of PCA’s
accounts receivable is based upon a combination of factors. In circumstances
where a specific customer is unable to meet its financial obligations to us
(e.g., bankruptcy filings, substantial downgrading of credit sources), a
specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the
net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be
collected. For all other customers, reserves for bad debts are recognized
consisting of 0.3% for amounts less than 90 days past due and 30% for
amounts more than 90 days past due based on historical collection
experience. If collection experience deteriorates (i.e., higher than expected
defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s ability
to meet its financial obligations to us), the estimate of the recoverability of
amounts due could be reduced by a material amount.

SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Depreciation is computed
on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related
assets. The following lives are used for the various categories of assets:

Buildings and land
  improvements

5 to 40 years

Machinery and equipment

3 to 25 years

Trucks and automobiles

3 to 10 years

Furniture and fixtures

3 to 20 years

Computers and hardware

3 to 7 years

Leasehold improvements

Period of the lease

Assets under capital leases are depreciated on the
straight-line method over the term of the lease.

Expenditures for repairs
and maintenance are expensed as incurred.

Intangible Assets

The Company has
capitalized certain intangible assets, primarily customer lists, covenants not
to compete, and goodwill, based on their estimated fair value at the date of
acquisition. Amortization is provided for customer lists on a straight-line
basis over periods ranging from 10 to 15 years. Covenants not to compete are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective agreements.
Goodwill, which amounted to $2.3 million and $1.8 million as of December 31,
2003 and 2002, respectively, is not being amortized but is subject to annual
impairment tests in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(“SFAS”) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” beginning January 1,
2002. Goodwill amortization was not material during the year ended December 31,
2001.

Other Long-Term Assets

PCA has capitalized certain costs related to obtaining
its financing. These costs are amortized to interest expense using the
effective interest rate method over the terms of the senior credit facility and
senior notes, which range from five years to ten years. Unamortized deferred
financing costs were $4.6 million and $19.2 million as of December 31,
2003 and 2002, respectively.

PCA currently leases the cutting rights to
approximately 115,000 acres of timberland and capitalizes the annual lease
payments and reforestation costs associated with these leases. These costs are
recorded as depletion when timber is harvested and used in PCA’s business
operations or sold to customers. Capitalized long-term lease costs were
$18.9 million and $21.0 million as of December 31, 2003 and
2002, respectively.

PCA also capitalizes
certain costs related to the purchase and development of software which is used
in its business operations. The costs attributable to these software systems
are amortized over their estimated useful lives based on various factors such
as the effects of obsolescence, technology and other economic factors.
Capitalized software costs were $7.3 million and $11.8 million as of December 31,
2003 and 2002, respectively.

SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for
impairment in accordance with provisions of SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for
the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” In the event that facts and
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any long-lived assets may be
impaired, an evaluation of recoverability would be performed. If an evaluation
is required, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the
asset would be compared to the asset’s carrying amount to determine if a
write-down to fair value is required.

Income Taxes

PCA utilizes the liability
method of accounting for income taxes whereby it recognizes deferred tax assets
and liabilities for the future tax consequences of temporary differences
between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in
the financial statements. Deferred tax assets will be reduced by a valuation
allowance if, based upon management’s estimates, it is more likely than not
that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in a future
period. The estimates utilized in the recognition of deferred tax assets are
subject to revision in future periods based on new facts or circumstances.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes
revenue as title to the products is transferred to customers. Shipping and
handling costs are included in cost of sales. Shipping and handling billings to
a customer in a sales transaction are included in revenue. In addition, the
Company offers volume rebates to some of its customers. The total cost of these
programs is estimated and accrued as a reduction to revenue at the time of the
respective sale.

Research and Development

Research and development
costs are expensed as incurred. The amount charged to expense was
$6.1 million, $6.7 million, and $5.5 million for the years ended December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Freight Trades

PCA regularly trades
containerboard with other manufacturers primarily to reduce shipping costs. Containerboard
trade agreements are a long standing industry practice. These agreements are
entered into on an annual basis, in which both parties agree to ship an
identical number of tons to each other within the agreement period. These
agreements minimize transportation cost by allowing each party’s containerboard
mills to ship containerboard to the other party’s closest corrugated products
plant. We track each shipment to ensure that the other party’s shipments are
equal during the agreement period. Such transfers are possible because
containerboard is a commodity product with no distinguishing product
characteristics. They are accounted for at carrying value, and sales are not
recorded as the transactions are not the result of an earnings process. The
transactions are recorded into inventory accounts, and no income is recorded until
such inventory is converted to a finished product and sold to an end-use
customer.

SUMMARY OF

Segment Information

PCA is primarily engaged
in one line of business: the manufacture and sale of packaging materials, boxes
and containers for industrial and consumer markets. No single customer accounts
for more than 10% of total revenues. PCA’s manufacturing operations are located
within the United States.

Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive
income (loss) is as follows:

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and
Accounting Change

Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 133, “Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended by SFAS No. 137
and SFAS No. 138. The Statement requires the Company to recognize
derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet at
fair value. It further provides criteria for derivative instruments to be
designated as fair value, cash flow or foreign currency hedges and establishes
respective accounting standards for reporting changes in the fair value of the
derivative instruments. The gains or losses resulting from adjusting the
derivative instruments to fair value are recorded in net income or accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI), as appropriate.

The Company recorded a transition adjustment upon
adoption of SFAS No. 133 to recognize its derivative instruments at fair
value and to recognize the effective and ineffective portions of the cash flow
hedges. The effect of this transition adjustment was to decrease reported net
income in the first quarter of 2001 by approximately $0.5 million
($0.8 million pre-tax). The Company also recorded a minimal transition
adjustment in OCI and an increase in noncurrent liabilities of approximately
$0.8 million.

The Company has historically used derivative
instruments to manage interest costs and the risk associated with changing
interest rates. The Company’s objectives for holding derivatives are to
minimize the risks using the most effective methods to eliminate or reduce the
impacts of these exposures. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had no
derivatives.

Derivative losses included in OCI as of December 31,
2002, were reclassified into earnings over the lives of the collar agreements,
through June 30, 2003.

On June 12, 2003, PCA
entered into two interest rate protection agreements with a counterparty to
lock in then current interest rates on 5-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury
notes. PCA entered into these

F-

SUMMARY OF

agreements to protect it against increases in the five-year
U.S. Treasury note rate, which served as a reference in determining the
interest rate applicable to the five-year notes due 2008, and the ten-year
U.S. Treasury note rate, which served as a reference in determining the
interest rate applicable to the ten-year notes due 2013. As a result of
increases in the interest rates on the five-year U.S. Treasury notes and ten-year
U.S. Treasury notes, PCA received a payment of approximately $27.0 million from
the counterparty upon settlement of the agreements, which occurred on July 21,
2003. PCA recorded the settlement in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
(Loss) and will amortize this amount against interest expense over the
respective lives of the notes.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,”
which is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. The
Statement requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of
long-lived assets to be recognized at their fair value at the time that the
obligations are incurred. Upon initial recognition of a liability, that cost
should be capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and allocated to
expense over the useful life of the asset. Certain of the Company’s leased facilities
have indeterminate lives because they are expected to remain in operation for
the foreseeable future. The Company currently has no plans or estimates of when
it will move out of any of its leased facilities and historically has renewed
its leases. There are no components within the leased facilities that are
retired that have any associated retirement obligations. Consequently, the
asset retirement obligation related to these facilities cannot be reasonably
estimated. The adoption of SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003, did not
have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.

In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, “Accounting
for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities,” effective for exit or
disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. This Statement
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or
disposal activities. The adoption of SFAS No. 146 on January 1, 2003,
did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position
or results of operations.

In November 2002, the
FASB issued FASB Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 45, “Guarantors Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others.” This Interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to
be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its
obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that
a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a
liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the
guarantee. This Interpretation does not prescribe a specific approach for
subsequently measuring the guarantor’s recognized liability over the term of
the related guarantee. This Interpretation also incorporates, without change,
the guidance in FIN No. 34, “Disclosure of Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others,” which is being superseded. See Note 6 for
disclosures regarding letters of credit.

In January 2003,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation 46, “Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51” (FIN 46).

SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

December 2003, the FASB
modified FIN 46 to make certain technical corrections and address certain
implementation issues that had arisen. FIN 46 provides a new framework for
identifying variable interest entities (VIEs) and determining when a company
should include the assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interests and results of
activities of a VIE in its consolidated financial statements. FIN 46 was
effective immediately for VIEs created after January 31, 2003. The
provisions of FIN 46, as revised, were adopted as of December 31,
2003, for the Company’s  interests in all
VIEs. Adoption of FIN 46 did not have a significant impact on the Company’s
financial statements.

Stock-Based Compensation

PCA entered into management equity agreements in June 1999
with 125 of its management-level employees. These agreements provide for the
grant of options to purchase up to an aggregate of 6,576,460 shares of PCA’s
common stock at $4.55 per share, the same price per share at which PCA Holdings,
LLC purchased common stock in the Transactions. The agreement called for these
options to vest ratably over a five-year period, or, upon completion of an
initial public offering, vest fully with contractual restrictions on transfer
for a period of up to 18 months following completion of the offering. The
options vested with the initial public offering in January 2000, and the
restriction period ended August 2001.

In October 1999, the Company adopted a long-term
equity incentive plan, which provides for grants of stock options, stock
appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock and performance awards to
directors, officers and employees of PCA, as well as others who engage in
services for PCA. Option awards granted to officers and employees vest ratably
over a four-year period, whereas option awards granted to directors vest
immediately. Under the plan, which will terminate on June 1, 2009, up to
4,400,000 shares of common stock is available for issuance under the long-term
equity incentive plan.

During 2003, the Company granted 73,500 shares of non-vested
stock to certain of its employees, the fair value of which was approximately
$1.3 million at date of grant. These shares vest over a three to four year
period. The Company will recognize compensation expense associated with these
shares ratably over their vesting periods.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

As permitted by SFAS No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” and amended by SFAS No. 148, “Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure,” the Company has
elected to account for its stock option plan under Accounting Principles Board
(“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and
adopt the disclosure only provisions of SFAS No. 123 and SFAS No. 148.
Under APB No. 25, no compensation costs are recognized because the number
of options is fixed and the option exercise price is equal to the fair market
price of the common stock on the date of the grant. Under SFAS No. 123,
stock options are valued at the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation
model and compensation costs are recognized ratably over the vesting period.
Had stock options been accounted for using the fair value method as recommended
in SFAS No. 123, compensation expense would have had the following pro
forma effect on our net income and earnings per share for the years ended December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001.

Black-Scholes
option-pricing model assumptions and fair value for these options are shown in
the following table:

The Black-Scholes option
valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded
options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In
addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective
assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because the Company’s
employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those
of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can
materially affect the fair value estimate, in

management’s
opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.

Reclassifications

Prior year’s financial
statements have been reclassified where appropriate to conform with current
year presentation.

In accordance with SFAS
No. 145, the early extinguishment of debt previously classified as
extraordinary for the years 2000 ($18,358,000 pre-tax and $11,060,000
after-tax) and 2001 ($1,000,000 pre-tax and $609,000 after-tax) in PCA’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002, was
reclassified to interest expense and provision for income taxes.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS AND OTHER
POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

In connection with the Transactions, PCA and Pactiv
entered into a human resources agreement which, among other items, granted PCA
employees continued participation in the Pactiv pension plan for a period of up
to five years following the closing of the Transactions for an agreed upon fee.
For salaried employees, PCA paid Pactiv $4.0 million in the first and
second years, $6.0 million in the third year, $8.0 million in the
fourth year, and will pay $10.0 million in the fifth year following the
closing date of the Transactions. For hourly employees, PCA paid Pactiv
$1.2 million per year through December 31, 2000 and then
$4.5 million per year for two additional years, ending on December 31,
2002. The fees paid to Pactiv are expensed ratably throughout the year.

Effective January 1, 2003, PCA adopted a
mirror-image pension plan for eligible hourly employees to succeed the Pactiv
pension plan in which PCA had participated though December 31, 2002. The
new PCA pension plan for hourly employees recognizes service earned under both
the new PCA plan and the prior Pactiv plan. Benefits earned under the PCA plan
are reduced by retirement benefits earned under the Pactiv plan through December 31,
2002. All assets and liabilities associated with benefits earned through December 31,
2002 for hourly employees and retirees of PCA were retained by the Pactiv plan.
PCA intends to adopt its own retirement plan sometime in the future with
respect to its salaried employees currently participating in the Pactiv pension
plan with such participation scheduled to expire on April 11, 2004.

The Company adopted a supplemental executive
retirement plan in 2000 that provides supplemental pension benefits for certain
executive officers of the Company. Benefits are based upon years of service and
the highest three year average of compensation. The benefit obligation and
pension costs were not significant.

PCA also provides certain medical benefits for retired
salaried employees and certain medical and life insurance benefits for certain
hourly employees. For salaried employees, the plan covers employees retiring
from PCA on or after attaining age 58 who have had at least 10 years of
full-time service with PCA after attaining age 48. For hourly employees, the
postretirement medical coverage, where applicable, is available according to
the eligibility provisions in effect at the employee’s work location. Per the
human resources agreement referred to above, Pactiv retained the liability relating
to retiree medical and life

benefits for PCA employees
who had retired on or before the closing date of the Transactions on April 12,
1999 or who were eligible to retire within two years of that date. On
January 1, 2003, the Company adopted a new plan design for salaried
employees incorporating annual dollar caps in determining the maximum amount of
employer contributions made towards the total cost of postretirement medical
coverage.

The following table
summarizes activity of the Company’s pension plan in accordance with SFAS
No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pension Plans” and postretirement
benefit plans in accordance with SFAS No. 106, “Employers’ Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions.”

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT
PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS (Continued)

No pay-related benefits
are provided under the hourly pension plan. PCA uses a September 30
measurement date for all of its benefit plans.

PCA will contribute
$9.3 million to the pension plan in 2004 for plan years 2003 and 2004.

In determining net pension and other postretirement benefit
costs, we have elected to amortize net gains and losses and prior service cost
on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of employees
expected to receive benefits under the plans.

As of September 30, 2003, the Company assumed
health care cost trend rates for its postretirement benefit plans of 10.50% for
2004, 9.50% for 2005, 8.00% for 2006, 7.00% for 2007, 6.00% for 2008 and 5.00%
for 2009 thereafter. As of September 30, 2002, the Company assumed health
care cost trend rates of 11.00% for 2003, 10.50% for 2004, 9.50% for 2005,
8.00% for 2006, 7.00% for 2007, 6.00% for 2008, and 5.00% for 2009 and
thereafter. As of September 30, 2001, the Company assumed health care cost
trend rates of 9.50% for 2002 and 2003, 8.00% for 2004, 7.00% for 2005, 6.00%
for 2006, and 5.00% for 2007 and thereafter.

Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by
one percentage point would increase the 2003 postretirement benefit obligation
by approximately $0.9 million and would increase the net postretirement
benefit cost by approximately $0.2 million.

On February 1, 2000, the Company adopted two
defined contribution benefit plans that cover all full-time salaried employees
and certain hourly employees at several of the Company’s facilities. Employees
can make voluntary contributions in accordance with the provisions of their
respective plan. The Company expensed $7.0 million, $6.9 million and
$6.7 million for employer contributions during the years ended December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

A
summary of debt is set forth in the following table:

On June 23, 2003, PCA launched a tender offer for
any and all of its outstanding $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9


¤


%
senior subordinated notes due 2009. In connection with the tender offer, PCA
also solicited consents to adopt amendments to the indenture under which the 9

%
notes were issued to eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants
and several of the event of default provisions contained in the indenture. The
consent solicitation expired on July 7, 2003 and the tender offer expired
on July 21, 2003. Holders of approximately $546.3 million, or 99.3%, in
aggregate principal amount of the 9


¤


%
notes consented to the proposed amendments and tendered their notes in the
tender offer.

On July 7, 2003, PCA repaid all borrowings under
its then-existing senior secured credit facility. This facility was replaced
with a new senior unsecured credit facility that provides for a new $100.0
million revolving credit facility, including a $35.0 million subfacility for
letters of credit, and a new $50.0 million term loan. The new senior credit
facility closed on July 21, 2003, and it expires in 2008.

% senior
subordinated notes that were validly tendered and accepted for payment in the
tender offer that expired at midnight on July 21, 2003. As a result of
these transactions, PCA recorded a one-time charge of approximately $76.6
million ($46.7 million after-tax) in the third quarter. The $76.6 million
charge includes the tender offer premium of $55.9 million and a $17.4 million
non-cash charge for the write-off of deferred financing fees due to the early
extinguishment of debt, both included in interest expense, and fees and
expenses of $3.3 million, included in corporate overhead. The remaining senior
subordinated notes are callable beginning on April 1, 2004 at 104.8125%. On
March 1, 2004, PCA delivered an irrevocable notice to the trustee to
redeem these notes on April 1, 2004.

The new instruments governing PCA’s indebtedness
contain covenants that limit the ability of PCA and its subsidiaries to enter
into sale and leaseback transactions, incur liens, enter into certain
transactions with affiliates, or merge or consolidate with any other person or
sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company. They also require PCA to comply with certain financial covenants,
including the ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization (EBITDA) to interest expense, the ratio of debt to total capitalization,
and minimum net worth levels. A failure to comply with these restrictions could
lead to an event of default, which could result in an acceleration of such
indebtedness. At December 31, 2003 the Company was in compliance with
these covenants.

Additional
information regarding PCA’s variable rate debt is shown below:

Since April 12, 1999, PCA has made debt prepayments
totaling approximately $1,067.0 million using excess cash and proceeds from the
sale of certain timberlands to permanently reduce its borrowings under the term
loans. As a result of these prepayments, PCA recorded a charge of $1.0 million
($0.6 million after tax) as an early extinguishment of debt for the year ended
December 31, 2001. No quarterly installments will be required under any of the
term loans until July 21, 2005.

As of December 31, 2003, annual principal
payments for debt during the next five years are: $112.8 million (2004),
$0.1 million (2005), $9.0 million (2006), $10.0 million (2007),
$170.0 million (2008), and $400.0 million (2009 and thereafter).

Interest payments in connection with the Company’s
debt obligations for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001
amounted to $104.5 million, $66.0 million, and $73.6 million,

respectively. Included in
the $104.5 million in interest paid for 2003 is the tender offer premium
of $55.9 million paid in connection with the July 2003 tender offer.

On November 29, 2000, the Company established an
on-balance sheet securitization program for its trade accounts receivable. To
effectuate this program, the Company formed a wholly owned limited purpose
subsidiary, Packaging Credit Company, LLC (“PCC”), which in turn formed a
wholly owned, bankruptcy-remote, special-purpose subsidiary, Packaging
Receivables Company, LLC (“PRC”), for the purpose of acquiring receivables from
PCC. Both of these entities are included in the consolidated financial
statements of the Company. Under this program, PCC purchases on an ongoing
basis substantially all of the receivables of the Company and sells such
receivables to PRC. PRC and lenders established a $150.0 million
receivables-backed revolving credit facility (“Receivables Credit Facility”)
through which PRC obtains funds to purchase receivables from PCC. The
receivables purchased by PRC are and will be solely the property of PRC. In the
event of liquidation of PRC, the creditors of PRC would be entitled to satisfy
their claims from PRC’s assets prior to any distribution to PCC or the Company.
Credit available under the receivables credit facility is on a borrowing-base
formula. As a result, the full amount of the facility may not be available at
all times. At December 31, 2003, $109.0 million was outstanding and
$41.0 million was available for additional borrowing under the receivables
credit facility. The highest outstanding principal balance under the
receivables credit facility during fiscal 2003 was $113.0 million. On October 10,
2003, PCA renewed the receivables credit facility for an additional three-year
term. This facility will terminate on October 10, 2006.

landfills and solid waste programs, and workers’ compensation.

7.   FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS

The
carrying and estimated fair values of PCA’s financial instruments at December 31,
2003 and 2002 were as follows:

Short-Term Assets and Liabilities

The fair value of cash and
cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes receivable and accounts payable
approximate their carrying amounts due to the short-term nature of these
financial instruments.

Long-Term Debt

The fair value of the
senior credit facility and the receivables credit facility approximates their
carrying amount due to the variable interest-rate feature of the instruments.
The fair value of the senior subordinated notes and the senior notes are based
on quoted market prices. The fair values of the remaining debt were considered
to be the same as or were not determined to be materially different from the
carrying amounts.

Interest Rate Collars

The fair values of the
interest rate collars are the amounts at which they could be settled and are
estimated by obtaining quotes from banks.

8.   SHAREHOLDERS’
EQUITY

In June 1999, PCA entered into management equity
agreements with 125 of its management-level employees. Under these agreements,
PCA Holdings, LLC and Pactiv Corporation sold 3,132,800 shares of common stock
to 113 of these employees at $4.55 per share. The stock purchased under the

subject to vesting. As of August 2001, the stock was fully vested. The
management equity agreements also provide for the grant of options (see
Note 2).

On May 16, 2001, the Company announced a
$100.0 million common stock repurchase program. PCA may to continue to
repurchase shares from time to time. Through December 31, 2003, the Company
repurchased 5,195,600 shares of common stock for approximately
$88.8 million. All repurchased shares were retired prior to December 31,
2003.

The Company’s share
repurchases were as follows:

On October 13, 2003,
PCA announced its intentions to begin paying a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15
per share, or $0.60 per share annually, on its common stock. The first
quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share was paid on January 15, 2004 to
shareholders of record as of December 15, 2003.

Litigation

On May 14, 1999, PCA
was named as a defendant in two Consolidated Class Action Complaints which
alleged a civil violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. The suits, then
captioned

Winoff Industries, Inc. v. Stone Container
Corporation

, MDL No. 1261 (E.D. Pa.) and

General
Refractories Co. v. Gaylord Container Corporation

, MDL No. 1261
(E.D. Pa.), name PCA as a defendant based solely on the allegation that PCA is
successor to the interests of Tenneco Packaging Inc. and Tenneco Inc., both of
which were also named as defendants in the suits, along with nine other
linerboard and corrugated sheet manufacturers. The

F-


Packaging Corporation of America

COMMITMENTS AND
CONTINGENCIES (Continued)

complaints allege that the
defendants, during the period October 1, 1993 through November 30,
1995, conspired to limit the supply of linerboard, and that the purpose and
effect of the alleged conspiracy was to artificially increase prices of
corrugated containers and corrugated sheets, respectively. On November 3,
2003, Pactiv (formerly known as Tenneco Packaging), Tenneco and PCA entered
into an agreement to settle the class action lawsuits. The settlement agreement,
which is subject to court approval, provides for a full release of all claims
against PCA as a result of the class action lawsuits. A hearing is set for March 2004
regarding the settlement. Approximately 160 plaintiffs opted out of the class
and together filed about ten direct action complaints in various federal courts
across the country. All of the opt-out complaints make allegations against the
defendants, including PCA, substantially similar to those made in the class
actions. The settlement agreement does not cover these direct action cases.
These actions have almost all been consolidated as

In re
Linerboard

, MDL 1261 (E.D. Pa.) for pretrial purposes. Fact
discovery is proceeding and is currently set to close September 30, 2004. As
of the date of this filing, we believe it is not reasonably possible that the
outcome of this litigation will have a material adverse effect on its financial
position or results of operations.

PCA is also party to various
legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. These legal actions
cover a broad variety of claims spanning our entire business. As of the date of
this filing, we believe it is not reasonably possible that the resolution of
these legal actions will, individually or in the aggregate, have a material
adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

Environmental Liabilities

The Company accounts for its retirement obligations
related to its landfills under SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations,” which became effective for fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 2002. The Statement requires legal obligations associated
with the retirement of long-lived assets to be recognized at their fair value
at the time that the obligations are incurred. Upon initial recognition of a
liability, that cost should be capitalized as part of the related long-lived
asset and allocated to expense over the useful life of the asset. The adoption
of SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003 did not have a material impact on
the Company’s financial statements.

The potential costs for various environmental matters
are uncertain due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible cleanup
costs, the complexity and evolving nature of governmental laws and regulations
and their interpretations, and the timing, varying costs and effectiveness of
alternative cleanup technologies. From January 1994 through December 2003,
remediation costs at our mills and converting plants totaled about
$3.1 million. As of December 31, 2003, we maintained an environmental
reserve of $4.3 million, which includes funds relating to onsite landfills
and surface impoundments as well as on-going and anticipated remedial projects.
Total capital costs for environmental matters, including Cluster Rule compliance,
were $16.5 million for 2003. Liabilities recorded for environmental
contingencies are estimates of the probable costs based upon available
information and assumptions. Because of these uncertainties, however, PCA’s
estimates may change. As of this filing, we believe that it is not reasonably
possible that future environmental expenditures above the $4.3 million accrued
as of December 31, 2003 will have a material impact on our financial
condition and results of operations.
